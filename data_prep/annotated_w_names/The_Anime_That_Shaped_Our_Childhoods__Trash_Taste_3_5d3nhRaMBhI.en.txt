<connor> episode 3 I'm your host then we get into </connor>
<joey> the top yeah but you gotta have like a </joey>
<joey> can we we need to come up with like some </joey>
<joey> kind of like you know like how good </joey>
<joey> musical morning does it yeah like that </joey>
<joey> let's talk about that like we gotta have </joey>
<connor> something like that I was going to but </connor>
<joey> you interrupted me with the you know </joey>
<joey> what I was gonna say your names then the </joey>
<garnt> topic is gonna be smooth it was not </garnt>
<garnt> professional </garnt>
<connor> no no exactly right Wow okay ruining my </connor>
<garnt> turn what I would like to discuss today </garnt>
<joey> with you gentlemen is your anime origin </joey>
<joey> story if you will how did you get into </joey>
<garnt> anime and how you know you discovered </garnt>
<connor> that you were going to go down this </connor>
<joey> rabbit hole of never coming this </joey>
<connor> beautiful medium that we all we all love </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> yeah I mean you wanna go first Joey </connor>
<garnt> because I feel like you have the most </garnt>
<connor> yeah most likely yeah probably I </connor>
<garnt> probably have all yeah yeah okay I'm </garnt>
<connor> having to follow up his story is gonna </connor>
<joey> be fun but I mean yeah I guess like mine </joey>
<joey> is unique in the sense that like and </joey>
<joey> would you say I'm the only Ana tuber </joey>
<joey> that has like grown up with anime like </joey>
<joey> and when I say grown up I mean like from </joey>
<garnt> like Age of like conceptual thought age </garnt>
<garnt> of conceptual thoughts I think just </garnt>
<garnt> being raised in a household to the </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese perón yeah probably has an </garnt>
<connor> immediately different attitude towards </connor>
<joey> anime them that we would experience in </joey>
<joey> like Western right because like you know </joey>
<joey> when most people say like oh I grew up </joey>
<connor> with energy that was my childhood like </connor>
<joey> like you know that usually starts away </joey>
<garnt> age late you know well yeah </garnt>
<joey> the real question is did you know what </joey>
<joey> anime was growing up I mean that's all I </joey>
<connor> ever yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> okay so so when you were you growing up </connor>
<connor> in your head even at like age five or </connor>
<joey> six there's a clear distinction between </joey>
<joey> like Pokemon and like I don't know we </joey>
<joey> want the Cartoon Network shows that was </joey>
<joey> a difference and you knew that they one </joey>
<joey> of them as Japanese yeah yeah yes like I </joey>
<joey> because unlike a lot of kids in </joey>
<joey> Australia and like probably around my </joey>
<connor> age group I grew up watching Pokemon and </connor>
<joey> like Dragonball Japanese I thought </joey>
<connor> Pokemon was an American cartoon people </connor>
<joey> did my mind was blown at like age ten </joey>
<garnt> when I heard the Japanese version this </garnt>
<joey> is on YouTube clips right like oh wait </joey>
<joey> this is the original yeah how because to </joey>
<garnt> me Pokemon when I was growing up just </garnt>
<joey> seemed like this very weird </joey>
<connor> genre like I couldn't put my finger on </connor>
<joey> yeah but I felt like it was a genre like </joey>
<connor> it was pokemon digimon Cardcaptor Sakura </connor>
<garnt> which was cardcaptors it in the UK in </garnt>
<joey> America Sakura that's true Asian sound </joey>
<garnt> get rid of that Sakura Sakura </garnt>
<joey> oh and the other girl was like they </joey>
<connor> changed her name to Madison I think I </connor>
<connor> can trim all her original name was but </connor>
<connor> this is this is back in the age of like </connor>
<connor> four kids dubbing I don't think it was </connor>
<connor> even even for kids that dubbed </connor>
<connor> Cardcaptor Sakura but it was in the day </connor>
<joey> that's you know localization was a thing </joey>
<joey> we are eating jelly doughnuts cuz you </joey>
<joey> know like being as you said like growing </joey>
<garnt> up in an Asian household Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> household what media was just like the </garnt>
<garnt> most like normal concepts like your </garnt>
<joey> breath it's like you know like yeah as </joey>
<joey> you said it's like bread it's like </joey>
<joey> watching an American content like </joey>
<joey> Dexter's Laboratory yeah like a scene of </joey>
<joey> them making toast for example and it's </joey>
<joey> over dubbed into Japanese like you know </joey>
<joey> I'm making a rice ball I think it's just </joey>
<garnt> cause at that time I remember a lot of </garnt>
<connor> my friends just didn't really know the </connor>
<connor> concept of just eating rice yeah if you </connor>
<connor> want if you want Asian you're like why </connor>
<garnt> would you eat rice with every meal that </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't make sense </garnt>
<connor> great right </connor>
<connor> I think I can remember what my family </connor>
<connor> thinking like rice was like exotic isn't </connor>
<connor> really well I mean it was something you </connor>
<connor> had with like foreign food yeah so you </connor>
<joey> don't eat rice but like that's on the </joey>
<joey> contrary though right like do you eat </joey>
<connor> bread with everything because at least </connor>
<joey> in Japan the concept of white bread with </joey>
<connor> everything is like why I feel like at </connor>
<connor> least in British culture you could put </connor>
<joey> bread with anything like you just wear </joey>
<joey> that I guess I guess like the food I'll </joey>
<connor> drop that country revolve anyway we're </connor>
<connor> getting off topic </connor>
<connor> yeah but so like basically like I grew </connor>
<connor> up like watching Pokemon and like what </connor>
<connor> else can remember watching I guess like </connor>
<connor> before that though like before Pokemon </connor>
<connor> or anything like that or you know before </connor>
<connor> I started watching like one piece like </connor>
<connor> Dragonball like you was shown in jump </connor>
<joey> stuff like Japanese kids grow up with </joey>
<joey> this like very certain array of like </joey>
<connor> kids anime yeah which is just absolutely </connor>
<joey> not known overseas so Ryan was probably </joey>
<connor> like the most well known but like you </connor>
<connor> don't like see a Nana to bow a five </connor>
<garnt> thousand review Doraemon let's go series </garnt>
<connor> that I grew up watching like alongside </connor>
<joey> thorium or was this show called </joey>
<joey> salvation yeah which is like the </joey>
<joey> longest-running just running and yeah </joey>
<garnt> and nobody outside of Japan has heard of </garnt>
<garnt> you I didn't know about it until you I </garnt>
<joey> was having perspective in my mom cause </joey>
<garnt> right so it's it's been going on since </garnt>
<connor> like the sixties and I think there's </connor>
<connor> like five thousand how I don't know </connor>
<connor> please because like it's really weird </connor>
<joey> because the concept of that show is like </joey>
<joey> it's just a revolving around this family </joey>
<joey> living in Japan and it's just like the </joey>
<joey> most like normal ask slice of life show </joey>
<joey> that I've ever seen but I also think to </joey>
<joey> myself like how can you come up with </joey>
<joey> like 40 years worth of topics and not be </joey>
<joey> like oh maybe we did cover this topic </joey>
<joey> like 25 years ago and one of those </joey>
<connor> episodes there must be absolute that </connor>
<connor> overlap like I feel you can't make that </connor>
<joey> many episodes or not overlap I know I </joey>
<joey> probably could overlap but nobody </joey>
<connor> watching that show right it's one of </connor>
<joey> those things if it's on TV you watch it </joey>
<joey> right it's like they covered this topic </joey>
<joey> in episode 1700 there's you know there's </joey>
<connor> one super fan </connor>
<joey> apologist in every episode and just </joey>
<joey> knows everything about every episode but </joey>
<connor> that seems to be and Doraemon seem to be </connor>
<joey> the one thing where if you ask anyone </joey>
<joey> Japan </joey>
<garnt> do you watch anime they'll be like oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah I thought I'm honest yeah and I'm </joey>
<connor> like oh I'm in like you know the other </connor>
<connor> anime thing she's no boobs in that </connor>
<garnt> please don't but like but like watching </garnt>
<connor> Doraemon and like saws Ison and like I </connor>
<connor> couldn't list off a number but late </connor>
<connor> there's just like a certain number of </connor>
<connor> shows that I think like it's just become </connor>
<connor> tradition now no matter what generation </connor>
<joey> or like if you're born born and raised </joey>
<joey> in the city or the you know the middle </joey>
<joey> of nowhere every kid grows up watching </joey>
<connor> these like really specific set of shows </connor>
<joey> you know and that's just like it normal </joey>
<connor> to them you know that's like watching </connor>
<connor> you know a Peppa Pig yeah it's like it's </connor>
<garnt> just like you don't even think about </garnt>
<garnt> like oh yes it's a cartoon yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> just something to show to you yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> and then yeah like I guess like the </garnt>
<garnt> concept of like anime anime didn't hit </garnt>
<joey> me until maybe like oh I thought when I </joey>
<joey> started watching like one piece I'm like </joey>
<joey> Dragon Ball and like probably around </joey>
<joey> like the Pokemon time so I reckon when I </joey>
<garnt> was like five or six years and white </garnt>
<garnt> girl so so when you started realizing </garnt>
<garnt> what anime is it probably gets in into </garnt>
<garnt> it that's when probably we started to </garnt>
<garnt> watch our first anime which was Pokemon </garnt>
<joey> right but like in my head I'm like yeah </joey>
<connor> Pokemon is an anime and like Samurai </connor>
<joey> Jack is a cartoon yeah because at that </joey>
<connor> time like around like five or six years </connor>
<joey> old that's when I started like watching </joey>
<joey> like Cartoon Network and I'd like to </joey>
<joey> think that we grow up in like the Golden </joey>
<connor> Age of causing Network I mean I'd say so </connor>
<connor> we had Samurai Jack that's right jack </connor>
<joey> like Dexter's Lab cow and chicken yeah </joey>
<connor> anyway so many amazing shows and to me </connor>
<joey> that's like okay things on Cartoon </joey>
<joey> Network are cartoons yeah but things </joey>
<joey> that are on like the VHS tapes that my </joey>
<connor> grandma would seem to me </connor>
<connor> oh those animes anime yeah so for me </connor>
<garnt> there's like a really clear distinction </garnt>
<garnt> so like I didn't have like one day this </garnt>
<garnt> sudden realization there like oh [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> Doraemon is an anime yeah yeah because </joey>
<garnt> it was just so natural to me see I don't </garnt>
<garnt> even remember when I got </garnt>
<garnt> realization because I think I must have </garnt>
<garnt> got it when I properly started getting </garnt>
<garnt> into anime with Naruto was my first like </garnt>
<joey> anime anime and that was purely because </joey>
<joey> I just kept seeing avatars and you know </joey>
<joey> gifts on the internet and I was like </joey>
<joey> yeah this kind of looks like Dragon Ball </joey>
<garnt> Z which I grew up I can't see now I was </garnt>
<garnt> ready in - do they have ridiculously </garnt>
<garnt> spiky hair exactly right yeah I think I </garnt>
<garnt> was on the internet way before I started </garnt>
<joey> watching anime and I think obviously </joey>
<joey> being on the Internet you see a lot of </joey>
<joey> anime I just think in all I knew is that </joey>
<connor> their opinion didn't matter because they </connor>
<garnt> had profile anime profile pictures it's </garnt>
<connor> generational now it's generational </connor>
<connor> I mean pokeman was the first one for me </connor>
<connor> I must have been like God I mean Pope </connor>
<joey> was always one of my favorite shows and </joey>
<joey> I think we've mentioned this in like </joey>
<connor> episode zero or something that it had </connor>
<joey> like an overarching story yeah but you </joey>
<joey> only really got you don't really get it </joey>
<garnt> actually in anything for like avatar </garnt>
<garnt> that came way later yeah like an old </garnt>
<garnt> like 90s do you just call avatar anime </garnt>
<connor> oke like cartoon you know you don't want </connor>
<connor> Courage the Cowardly Dog for the </connor>
<connor> overarching story right like you watch </connor>
<joey> chicks it's like every episode it's </joey>
<joey> great and you have a good time but then </joey>
<joey> I remember poke one was like oh whoa </joey>
<connor> they're like actually like working </connor>
<joey> towards something yes I think as well </joey>
<connor> like that era of anime as well like I </connor>
<connor> don't like a lot of cartoons it was like </connor>
<joey> yes there was like a Masonic moments but </joey>
<connor> as you said there was like an over they </connor>
<connor> used you even if it was a filler you </connor>
<joey> knew they were like they had a goal yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and that seemed to be the case </joey>
<joey> where that kind of structure really like </joey>
<joey> spoke to me as a first for whatever </joey>
<connor> reason I really enjoyed that as a kid </connor>
<joey> and then yeah you had the same thing and </joey>
<connor> then I thought how all these things with </connor>
<connor> all the spiky had people there really </connor>
<connor> like wild drawn things are like I like </connor>
<joey> these kind of it's so easy for me at </joey>
<connor> least with you you know is that I didn't </connor>
<joey> know you yo wasn't anime because I grew </joey>
<joey> up with the card game first time I got </joey>
<garnt> the card game and then watch them yeah </garnt>
<joey> right because one of your schools </joey>
<garnt> playing Yuki yeah I didn't get that face </garnt>
<garnt> I did </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't get that yugioh phase we had </garnt>
<joey> ivory because when I was in school </joey>
<joey> everyone was like trading pokemon cards </joey>
<joey> and nobody knew how to play the actual </joey>
<joey> game we are like a black market like </joey>
<garnt> trade deal with photon cards I have like </garnt>
<joey> I had like a really dog like you your </joey>
<joey> face just like I was like I was legit </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] it's like dad because my </joey>
<joey> dad like used to work for like a </joey>
<connor> printing company yeah what he would do </connor>
<connor> is he would find like high-res like </connor>
<joey> print them out and I would come to </joey>
<joey> school now if you like my piece of </joey>
<joey> exodia and I mean like 10 year old </joey>
<joey> doesn't know but it was funny as well </joey>
<garnt> because like much like your Pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> cause you no one knew how to play you </garnt>
<garnt> you it was just like oh cool you have </garnt>
<joey> Exodia because I feel like like the rows </joey>
<connor> of you go were easier to understand oh </connor>
<joey> come on yeah </joey>
<connor> oh comes hard yeah cuz I did like I </connor>
<connor> don't think anyone in my school played </connor>
<connor> the Pokemon card games you collect them </connor>
<connor> yeah you just you just collected them </connor>
<garnt> right yeah like it was easy understand </garnt>
<connor> you had a shiny um well that's the thing </connor>
<joey> though right it's like in order to play </joey>
<joey> the Pokemon card games you need it to </joey>
<joey> like not throw away the energy cards </joey>
<garnt> which like my my school like in my </garnt>
<connor> school everyone was just like yep go up </connor>
<connor> go up go I haven't got lunchtime every </connor>
<connor> day am I sure yeah but yeah I guess I've </connor>
<joey> started to realize that I really liked </joey>
<joey> anime when everyone got into Pokemon </joey>
<joey> when we had the pokemon card card game </joey>
<joey> phase as well so yeah just like a global </joey>
<connor> craze </connor>
<connor> oh yeah how long did that last that </connor>
<joey> lasted like a year or something right </joey>
<connor> well I think or like a few months the </connor>
<connor> year I was born 1986 I think poke Holmes </connor>
<joey> the most googled thing </joey>
<joey> yeah of that year a game it just it just </joey>
<joey> came out and obviously since that point </joey>
<joey> onwards it's pretty it through the mid </joey>
<joey> 2000s yeah pretty insane I hope one was </joey>
<connor> like and arguably still today is one of </connor>
<garnt> the biggest like yeah cuz I just kept </garnt>
<connor> watching Pokemon even after everyone had </connor>
<connor> like even when the cursor and ever my </connor>
<connor> mom was my mom without wondering like </connor>
<garnt> why is this kid still into Pokemon </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] he's going on oh I had the same </connor>
<connor> thing my parents were like they were </connor>
<connor> like worried for me they were like </connor>
<connor> should we like doing he's like do </connor>
<connor> something about this like he's still </connor>
<connor> like watching cartoons my older brother </connor>
<joey> had like foregone cartoons yeah there's </joey>
<joey> a sign of pride that he's not watching </joey>
<connor> games like I only watch reality TV show </connor>
<joey> now with my parents </joey>
<joey> I don't watch this kids i watch a game </joey>
<joey> TV yeah right right yeah yeah and I </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] loved like you know Samurai Jack </joey>
<connor> like I would always try and watch </connor>
<connor> Samurai Jack like scars Cowardly Dog </connor>
<connor> anime as well my parents genuinely like </connor>
<joey> what concern for me I don't know if they </joey>
<joey> still are concerns the exact point </joey>
<garnt> because all the way up to university and </garnt>
<joey> when I rediscovered what anime was my </joey>
<garnt> parents were like he's doing it again </garnt>
<joey> pass this [ __ ] phase when they found </joey>
<connor> out I was watching like more anime than </connor>
<joey> ever </joey>
<connor> they were like more concerned they were </connor>
<joey> like whoa he's gone even harder and yeah </joey>
<joey> I thought it would stop I remember my </joey>
<connor> dad like the funniest thing my dad ever </connor>
<connor> said I think I was in like late maybe </connor>
<connor> the last year of high school yeah and </connor>
<connor> that was like when I was like hot this </connor>
<joey> right before I made my youtube job and I </joey>
<connor> was like watching every anime ever my </connor>
<joey> dad would be like what are you doing in </joey>
<joey> your room because he thought I was doing </joey>
<joey> something else yeah I know when I told </joey>
<joey> him that I was watching anime I remember </joey>
<joey> my dad saying like okay at this point I </joey>
<joey> think I'd rather you just do drugs I </joey>
<joey> would have been less disappointed if I </joey>
<connor> found that you were doing drugs which </connor>
<joey> ones more life crushing yeah but like I </joey>
<connor> don't know like I guess like I don't </connor>
<connor> really have like a phase of like when I </connor>
<connor> dispute anime or anything because as </connor>
<joey> long as I've known why do yeah that's </joey>
<joey> like even mangas well like I started </joey>
<joey> reading manga like around the same time </joey>
<joey> that I discovered or I'm oh we just </joey>
<joey> probably around when I was like four or </joey>
<connor> five years old howtechs you've been </connor>
<connor> reading manga since four or five </connor>
<joey> probably maybe earlier than that but I'd </joey>
<joey> specifically remember the first ever </joey>
<connor> volume of manga ever God was volume 2 of </connor>
<connor> Doraemon I don't know why my mom didn't </connor>
<connor> get me volume 1 cool like I didn't know </connor>
<connor> that it was like the overarching story </connor>
<connor> so I was like oh just start reading this </connor>
<joey> I had no idea what the [ __ ] was going on </joey>
<joey> that's all I don't fully 100 now it </joey>
<connor> makes it's like a wow </connor>
<connor> mani I feel like my anime thing was like </connor>
<connor> there's three points in my life where </connor>
<joey> like I was I conveyed like very vividly </joey>
<joey> remember watching anime first was like </joey>
<joey> Pokemon yeah they are occasionally </joey>
<joey> seeing a yugioh episode of the cards </joey>
<joey> yeah I think maybe when I got access to </joey>
<garnt> like the Internet </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's when another one came </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember watching like yugioh </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was GX right parts three </garnt>
<garnt> parts three parts on YouTube you know it </garnt>
<garnt> sounds like an OG anime fan because </garnt>
<garnt> they're like oh yeah don't you hate it </garnt>
<garnt> when you find an espagnol sub of your </garnt>
<garnt> your one okay so envision it right it's </garnt>
<connor> two thousand right you watch episode 1 </connor>
<connor> part 1 of Yuki oh yeah okay cool I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna watch episode 1 part 2 you click </connor>
<connor> it it's the next recommended video it's </connor>
<connor> in espanol thank you do you just do you </connor>
<connor> like keep looking or you just give up </connor>
<connor> and go to the next part </connor>
<joey> yeah I remember so many times I had to </joey>
<joey> do that what was then that is when you </joey>
<joey> like could someone uploads like a full </joey>
<garnt> anime movie yeah always always like </garnt>
<garnt> either like pot 6 or part [ __ ] one </garnt>
<garnt> part that was missing yeah who didn't </garnt>
<joey> find us you just had to give up and just </joey>
<garnt> be like alright I'll just skip 15 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes I just hopefully try and catch </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I think there's 15 minutes of the </garnt>
<joey> first Naruto movie that I've just never </joey>
<connor> seen it's just I don't know what's </connor>
<connor> happened it might be the best 15 minutes </connor>
<connor> of Naruto the max upload time is 10 </connor>
<garnt> minutes on YouTube right yeah yeah so </garnt>
<connor> that's why I was plugged into three yeah </connor>
<connor> and yeah I remember that was like the </connor>
<garnt> one of the biggest and the third part </garnt>
<garnt> would always just be like five minutes </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah there's the outro off of it </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah no that was like definitely a </connor>
<connor> big phase for me and I could have been </connor>
<connor> around 13 14 at that point question to </connor>
<garnt> you then did you grow up during the </garnt>
<garnt> Toonami phase because I feel like </garnt>
<joey> tsunami is has played such a big factor </joey>
<garnt> into making the anime fans of today no I </garnt>
<connor> hate for some reason I we did we have </connor>
<garnt> Toonami in the UK we did we did but you </garnt>
<garnt> need it you need it Sky TV so I think </garnt>
<connor> you needed Cartoon Network to be so sky </connor>
<connor> is like basically cable in the UK </connor>
<joey> wait you guys didn't get consonant with </joey>
<connor> just like free - no no they've got to </connor>
<joey> network yes I'm here in Australia it was </joey>
<joey> free oh wow yes because I know my </joey>
<joey> parents paid because my dad wanted to </joey>
<joey> pay for the football matches in the UK </joey>
<joey> right and you basically got the whole </joey>
<joey> bundle so I would watch the cartoons </joey>
<joey> stuff and I remember there's like there </joey>
<joey> was loads of cartoons I never saw anime </joey>
<connor> I think it was raring really late </connor>
<connor> and by there my parents are like why </connor>
<joey> don't you in bed son because when you </joey>
<joey> Joe was on the tsunami army it was like </joey>
<garnt> Dragon Ball Z Gundam Wing </garnt>
<connor> Iram the same Dragon Ball never watched </connor>
<connor> it though cuz I just it was always a </connor>
<connor> mess because it would they add it out of </connor>
<connor> order so I was going on I thought it was </connor>
<connor> cool but I couldn't get into it yeah I </connor>
<connor> think Dragon Ball Z and Gundam Wing were </connor>
<garnt> the only two I was able to watch </garnt>
<garnt> whenever because our family didn't have </garnt>
<garnt> Sky TV so I can only watch it when I go </garnt>
<garnt> to my cousin's house and I'll be </garnt>
<connor> watching episodes out of order Gundam </connor>
<connor> Wing made no [ __ ] sense still makes </connor>
<joey> like I'll be watching a scene and for </joey>
<joey> some reason the guy wants to kill this </joey>
<joey> girl but the girl still wants to get </joey>
<joey> what the guy makes no [ __ ] sense to </joey>
<connor> me as a kid you know gunner he's already </connor>
<connor> confusing enough as it is </connor>
<connor> Dragon Ball Z was okay because I could </connor>
<joey> just watch I could skip five episodes </joey>
<connor> and they'd be the same cuz I remember </connor>
<garnt> like I would help you watching these </garnt>
<connor> scenes in Dragon Ball Z yeah and Goku </connor>
<connor> was like powering up the Spirit Bomb </connor>
<connor> yeah and then I'd go I I'd not be able </connor>
<connor> to go to my cousin's till like two weeks </connor>
<connor> later the Goku was still powering I was </connor>
<connor> like oh this is just the next episode no </connor>
<connor> it was like I missed like three four </connor>
<connor> episodes and it was it was just four </connor>
<connor> still the same [ __ ] to this day he's </connor>
<joey> still powering it up hasn't finished man </joey>
<garnt> if he hasn't died for the seventh time </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because my my exposure to anime has </garnt>
<garnt> got like now that I think back to it </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's the main phases of like </garnt>
<connor> the Pokemon phase and then there's the </connor>
<connor> Toonami phase yeah well I'd see it on </connor>
<connor> Toonami and TV and then there was this </connor>
<connor> huge gap I have exact same yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> then I did like I realized now that in </connor>
<connor> the in this huge gap I still had like </connor>
<connor> small exposures to anime like whenever I </connor>
<connor> go to Thailand we'd always have these </connor>
<connor> shitty shitty Thai dubs these are like </connor>
<connor> that like Ultraman was </connor>
<joey> was like a massive in Thailand even </joey>
<connor> though that's even though that's not an </connor>
<joey> anime but like Dragon Ball Z dubs and </joey>
<joey> man having listening to Thai doves </joey>
<garnt> they've only got five voice actors and </garnt>
<joey> actresses and they voice every character </joey>
<joey> in every anime who's growing up in </joey>
<garnt> Southeast Asia </garnt>
<garnt> knows what I'm talking about when you </garnt>
<joey> have five voice actors who plays every </joey>
<joey> character in every show and then my </joey>
<joey> cousin showed me I think was Princess </joey>
<joey> Mononoke just our hostess it came out I </joey>
<joey> didn't know it was animated just like </joey>
<garnt> was this animated film I thought it was </garnt>
<joey> Disney how old are you and you watch it </joey>
<joey> ah and he came out in 97 yes I must have </joey>
<garnt> been like like it was the year after </garnt>
<connor> came out cuz there's a gruesome movie to </connor>
<connor> watch I thought I thought that movie was </connor>
<connor> just Disney and then just just before I </connor>
<connor> discovered like Naruto air that I went </connor>
<connor> through the LimeWire phase just for </connor>
<connor> music though I didn't know no just just </connor>
<joey> for music same here right so I would be </joey>
<joey> browsing browsing LimeWire for music I </joey>
<joey> probably you'd like downloading Linkin </joey>
<joey> Park or Papa Roach or something like </joey>
<connor> that and then something else likes you </connor>
<connor> know sometimes you download a file yeah </connor>
<joey> and it's not the file you aim for like </joey>
<connor> it's why you meet everything the Bill </connor>
<garnt> Clinton fine </garnt>
<connor> so in LimeWire someone was just </connor>
<connor> circulating bible black clips yeah I </connor>
<joey> never knew that Bible Black was a </joey>
<joey> Japanese anime because I'm just like </joey>
<joey> what is this shitty porn that I'm </joey>
<joey> watching how's the kid as a kid I'm like </joey>
<connor> oh it's kind of hot though this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing that's exactly how I </connor>
<connor> discovered it yeah she said in multiple </connor>
<connor> videos that like going through lime </connor>
<connor> while obviously looking for the new </connor>
<connor> Lincoln Pavel just trust people </connor>
<connor> it was the tentacle scene of Bible black </connor>
<garnt> and she's like this is like she had like </garnt>
<garnt> an epiphany she was like this is the </garnt>
<joey> most amazing thing </joey>
<garnt> I can imagine though like because that I </garnt>
<joey> don't even remember I don't want to get </joey>
<connor> on to the toffee boy I don't remember </connor>
<connor> how I discovered people I killed the top </connor>
<connor> because because I didn't I obviously </connor>
<connor> didn't know it was hentai I didn't even </connor>
<connor> know it was anime holy [ __ ] I'm having a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] epiphany now bible black wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> the only hence i downloaded on there oh </garnt>
<garnt> my god like i like cuz i remember i </garnt>
<garnt> remember downloading full length and no </garnt>
<connor> hentai that came out in the 90s i can't </connor>
<connor> remember the name but I got why why are </connor>
<connor> you downloading full length and tag </connor>
<connor> because I like like I say you just </connor>
<connor> downloading random files okay and I got </connor>
<joey> one of these files that are downloaded </joey>
<joey> was this hence I that icon him the title </joey>
<joey> had angel in the name this there's a lot </joey>
<joey> of million yeah yeah yeah angel the name </joey>
<joey> I'm like what if I just what if I just </joey>
<connor> put this title into LimeWire and see </connor>
<connor> what comes up and there were like six </connor>
<garnt> titles that came up so I'm like Colin </garnt>
<garnt> I'm downloading all of this how to </garnt>
<connor> destroy your laptop speedrun did you </connor>
<garnt> ruin any laptops or pcs oh [ __ ] oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> I yeah I blamed it on my brother and he </joey>
<joey> totally got blamed for it but it was </joey>
<joey> totally me yes III think that I would </joey>
<connor> have been I think the reason why and I'm </connor>
<connor> I just realize this now I was wondering </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] was I doing between like </connor>
<connor> 13 and 18 yeah I can picked about it </connor>
<connor> like it and I just realized I was like </connor>
<joey> cripplingly like addicted to Xbox like I </joey>
<joey> it was like every second I got free I </joey>
<connor> was playing call of duty like that was </connor>
<joey> like ah friends is well right Nash </joey>
<connor> that's like the like the Golden Age of </connor>
<joey> like playing games yeah play with your </joey>
<joey> friends at school it was like </joey>
<connor> immediately when I was done I'd go home </connor>
<connor> play games until I had to go to bed and </connor>
<joey> I was like the Golden Age of a call it </joey>
<connor> as well oh my god that was perfect yeah </connor>
<connor> 1 phi2 came out when I was like like </connor>
<connor> 1516 and which is like by the perfect </connor>
<joey> time to play it I I think I had an age </joey>
<connor> like a gap as well that I didn't watch </connor>
<connor> any my nose around the same time yeah I </connor>
<connor> know exactly why I wasn't but I'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna say because it's probably yeah but </connor>
<connor> weirdly enough even though like during </connor>
<connor> that gap until I probably the last year </connor>
<connor> of like yeah </connor>
<joey> school hmm I was still reading manga </joey>
<connor> like religiously yeah so I don't know </connor>
<joey> what it is it's like I had this burnout </joey>
<connor> with anime or maybe just like a loss of </connor>
<connor> interest with anime of some reason manga </connor>
<joey> was like always this one thing that I </joey>
<joey> would just come home and just read the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] out of wait just a little more </connor>
<connor> engaging almost like actively make an </connor>
<joey> effort oh yeah and also because I just </joey>
<garnt> like reading in general I think so so I </garnt>
<garnt> mean a lot of question to you guys what </garnt>
<connor> drew you to anime over like cartoons or </connor>
<joey> other things like what drew you to this </joey>
<garnt> medium specifically as a child that's a </garnt>
<joey> kid and growing up as well for me it was </joey>
<connor> just the fact that my mom would just </connor>
<connor> push it a lot because it was the she </connor>
<joey> knew that it was the easiest way for me </joey>
<connor> to appreciate the Japanese culture yeah </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> every time I realized Joey's born on </connor>
<joey> Japanese I'll speak Japanese god I like </joey>
<joey> like my mom knew that like if I just </joey>
<joey> kept talking to her in Japanese yeah it </joey>
<joey> would most likely stick but she wanted </joey>
<connor> me to like not just be like competent in </connor>
<connor> Japanese really the whole cold chilly </connor>
<joey> like yeah not just appreciate the </joey>
<joey> culture but also like excel in Japanese </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah and like thank God </joey>
<joey> because now I think I have yeah and like </joey>
<garnt> you know I have learned to like </garnt>
<garnt> appreciate the culture and just anime in </garnt>
<garnt> general in the language and like I did </garnt>
<garnt> like you know learn a [ __ ] ton of </garnt>
<joey> Japanese even though I said well in a </joey>
<joey> lot of videos </joey>
<joey> don't use animate alone in Japanese yeah </joey>
<joey> I kind of helped open admit I learned a </joey>
<joey> lot of Japanese from watching out I mean </joey>
<connor> any amount of language that you take in </connor>
<joey> to learn like if you're watching </joey>
<connor> anything in a language it's good you </connor>
<garnt> know he'll help I feel like as a kid you </garnt>
<joey> just absorb it through osmosis I'm like </joey>
<joey> oh yeah like I remember learning Thai </joey>
<connor> just because I was what like whenever </connor>
<connor> I'd go to Thailand I would just I would </connor>
<garnt> just absorb it whenever talking to my </garnt>
<joey> family or just watching TV shows did you </joey>
<joey> learn any Thai from the Thai Dobbs </joey>
<garnt> um letter account I can be hard and tie </garnt>
<joey> the same it's just very bad quality it's </joey>
<connor> it's kind of its kind of like I don't </connor>
<garnt> know there wasn't a lot of money put </garnt>
<connor> into the dubbing industry I reckon so </connor>
<connor> store more that much - yeah so and we </connor>
<connor> all we all know a second language then </connor>
<connor> purely cuz we were just raised yeah </connor>
<connor> everywhere is spoken yeah yeah but the </connor>
<connor> thing is well was when you were a kid </connor>
<connor> you know you have way more time to just </connor>
<connor> sit there and absorb it when you're in </connor>
<connor> handle it's uh I get ten minutes a day </connor>
<connor> on dueling or maybe right where's a kid </connor>
<connor> it's like eight hours of just you're </connor>
<connor> hearing this stuff so obviously you're </connor>
<joey> gonna pick it up but I was just like </joey>
<joey> like from as far as I can remember with </joey>
<joey> my childhood like the only memories I </joey>
<joey> have is just like either watching anime </joey>
<joey> reading manga or like watching come </joey>
<joey> right right right yeah so already just </joey>
<joey> from that like two-thirds of my </joey>
<connor> childhood essentially is MIA just </connor>
<joey> absorbing the Japanese language in like </joey>
<connor> anyway pause right so I think that just </connor>
<connor> helped me a [ __ ] like if I never got </connor>
<joey> into anime or manga I would like to </joey>
<joey> think that I would be nowhere near as </joey>
<connor> good write the language as I am now I </connor>
<connor> think definitely for me when I was </connor>
<connor> watching anime the thing that appealed </connor>
<connor> to me especially my younger age is that </connor>
<connor> like I said oh yeah like there's more of </connor>
<joey> a structure right and there's always an </joey>
<connor> overarching like point there's no me a </connor>
<joey> journey to go on and also I felt like </joey>
<joey> you know I mean this wasn't a problem </joey>
<joey> back then went with our cartoons you </joey>
<joey> know the ones a we grew up with yeah I </joey>
<garnt> felt like anime didn't treat the </garnt>
<garnt> audience stupid you know like if you're </garnt>
<garnt> if you're like 16 18 yeah you know maybe </garnt>
<connor> you don't want to Pokemon you can still </connor>
<joey> appreciate it and enjoy it and I felt </joey>
<connor> that like some cartoons I mean I mean </connor>
<joey> you can watch Samurai Jack any age why </joey>
<joey> this time yeah there was a lot when I </joey>
<garnt> was growing up there very treated you as </garnt>
<garnt> a kid right whereas Pokemon was like </garnt>
<garnt> your teenager you're going on a journey </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I'm gonna catch pokemon </garnt>
<connor> I was so cool like imagine yourself as </connor>
<garnt> that like it sounds dumb how old was Ash </garnt>
<garnt> again - 10 10 10 but I mean but I mean </garnt>
<garnt> here - [ __ ] together </garnt>
<connor> like you imagine a mom just letting a </connor>
<joey> ten-year-old go I to the [ __ ] world </joey>
<connor> by himself with a [ __ ] rats to keep </connor>
<joey> him company </joey>
<joey> I mean wasn't the whole joke there like </joey>
<joey> the mom sent her off so they just </joey>
<connor> brought commits crimes are like yeah I </connor>
<connor> guess that was really irresponsible of </connor>
<joey> us so I go with a 35 year old man and </joey>
<joey> Misty okay with like ash hanging out </joey>
<joey> with like this 10 year old kid life </joey>
<joey> throws your bike into a river it's like </joey>
<joey> I'll pay you back </joey>
<connor> how also as like a ten year old as do </connor>
<joey> you have any concept of Brock constantly </joey>
<connor> hitting on people what do you how do you </connor>
<connor> like perceive that like like what is </connor>
<garnt> that to you is it imagine being broke </garnt>
<connor> and just leaving your family and your </connor>
<garnt> job to like follow this massive family </garnt>
<connor> as well what are you doing nice to say </connor>
<connor> that kind of reckless behavior really </connor>
<connor> appeals to me as a kid just I'm leaving </connor>
<joey> my family that I was supporting we're </joey>
<joey> leaving my family for what to follow </joey>
<joey> this tenure also I can go slay some post </joey>
<connor> it's like it's like strangely </connor>
<connor> reminiscent of like Hisoka from Hunter </connor>
<connor> hunter it's like grown man just wants to </connor>
<connor> follow a kid around see him grow it's </connor>
<garnt> the biggest thing for me though with </garnt>
<garnt> late Pokemon that just made no sense to </garnt>
<garnt> know is how Gary oak yeah is like </garnt>
<garnt> essentially the same ages ash and yet he </garnt>
<connor> can get like all this puss this is it </connor>
<connor> bad that like I actually like liked </connor>
<connor> carrying more than a hat and I loved it </connor>
<connor> when he was a dick to ash I'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> you should be catching pokémon ash </connor>
<garnt> because he was actually achieving the </garnt>
<garnt> goal to become a pokémon master </garnt>
<connor> yeah like I feel like as a kid maybe you </connor>
<connor> appreciate ash more but hasn't had like </connor>
<joey> you know Gary's kind of got [ __ ] - yeah </joey>
<connor> Gary's achieving his dream yeah yeah it </connor>
<joey> was cool that you saved that bottle free </joey>
<joey> and reunited a mash but like like but </joey>
<connor> Gary did but a free start a patron pay </connor>
<connor> your bills no didn't don't you get a job </connor>
<connor> ash Gary's Omegas gold split speed one </connor>
<garnt> of the supplies [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> any % it like getting all the [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> that man did it all like and yet we </connor>
<connor> still were supposed to hate him like </connor>
<connor> like I think when they were like when </connor>
<joey> Ash was about to like go to like Koga I </joey>
<joey> think I know Gary just rocks up in a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like Lamborghini like you're </joey>
<joey> still here who's driving the car yeah </joey>
<connor> not only is he an expert Pokemon master </connor>
<joey> he's a logistic expert yeah you're </joey>
<joey> getting all these women around ya always </joey>
<connor> an Islam beginning he doesn't worry </connor>
<connor> about parking tickets I was just walking </connor>
<connor> is an a duel I think ash is kind of </connor>
<connor> shitty oh yeah </connor>
<connor> I mean yeah definitely as a kid that </connor>
<joey> whole kind of structure and the kind of </joey>
<joey> you know going on a journey I was very I </joey>
<joey> will you guys like did you guys feel </joey>
<joey> really like disappointed when ash got </joey>
<joey> beaten in the Pokemon oh yeah I was like </joey>
<connor> this is our destiny like he formed these </connor>
<connor> artificial bombs with these Pokemon and </connor>
<connor> he [ __ ] Charles I had the balls to </connor>
<connor> sleep at the final fight are you serious </connor>
<garnt> jhaza </garnt>
<garnt> it was like as a kid it was like top 10 </garnt>
<joey> anime twisted you bro </joey>
<joey> is actually uh there's actually this </joey>
<joey> really funny thing I have found the </joey>
<joey> other day when I was learning to like </joey>
<joey> Pokemon speedruns yeah yeah you know the </joey>
<joey> other thing called ash percent to play </joey>
<garnt> the game exactly like every Pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> exactly the same oh my gosh you have to </garnt>
<garnt> release your Butterfree you have to </garnt>
<joey> release your Charizard and then you have </joey>
<garnt> to purposely lose at the would drive me </garnt>
<joey> mentally 9 oh my god shirtless mario </joey>
<garnt> speedrun yeah you do basically just your </garnt>
<joey> speed run mario ought to see where you </joey>
<joey> try and get mario sure let's cruise </joey>
<connor> possible yeah I love the troll speed </connor>
<joey> runs </joey>
<joey> anyway we got off-topic okay and I don't </joey>
<connor> know well it was it the same thing as </connor>
<garnt> well for you as a kid yeah I like I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know I couldn't quite put my </garnt>
<garnt> finger on it but it was this huge </garnt>
<garnt> overarching plot like they had a goal </garnt>
<garnt> and they were working towards a goal </garnt>
<connor> like Pokemon turned out to me my like </connor>
<connor> as as I watch more anime I started </connor>
<connor> liking Pokemon less and less like when I </connor>
<connor> things like Digimon came and they had an </connor>
<connor> actual like story arc my Charizard at </connor>
<connor> the most crucial moment did you want for </connor>
<garnt> me was probably the moment when I </garnt>
<garnt> actually fell in love with anime yeah do </garnt>
<joey> you want to know something I never </joey>
<connor> watched the Digimon anime did you know I </connor>
<garnt> watched it the only things I anything </garnt>
<joey> Digimon that I ever like consumed are </joey>
<connor> the two movies I played the games as </connor>
<connor> well as a kid and the other thing I </connor>
<joey> remember is them being hot as [ __ ] are </joey>
<joey> they are well there are games of that </joey>
<joey> there's games and like I think at least </joey>
<joey> the Digimon World Games I don't know how </joey>
<joey> old they are I remember like thee </joey>
<joey> they're like some of the hardest games </joey>
<joey> to get like full completion any games </joey>
<joey> ever like they're like insane and I </joey>
<joey> remember as a kid thing like the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> why can't I get past the first level I </connor>
<joey> beat all of Pokemon in French I what the </joey>
<joey> hell like yeah no I never I don't know </joey>
<joey> what it is maybe because I was just so </joey>
<connor> obsessed with Pokemon yeah but like I </connor>
<joey> always knew Digimon was a thing yeah but </joey>
<connor> I never watched any of it was always the </connor>
<garnt> joke is a kid right you would like the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] comedian if you yeah I guess </garnt>
<garnt> you're the did you know no one wants to </garnt>
<connor> be the Digimon [ __ ] I have a question </connor>
<garnt> for you specifically okay this isn't </garnt>
<connor> apply to you but did you like as a kid </connor>
<connor> have a sense of like oh I kind of like </connor>
<connor> this whole like Japanese culture thing </connor>
<connor> whenever it propped up you know in like </connor>
<connor> TV or anything I mean to me was less of </connor>
<joey> a less exotic cuz to me it was like </joey>
<connor> Asian culture I guess yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> because it was it was I had seen more of </joey>
<joey> it because I you know I didn't exactly </joey>
<joey> grow up in Thailand but I would visit </joey>
<joey> there at least once a year so I'd spend </joey>
<joey> like my summer holidays in Thailand </joey>
<connor> every year so seeing some of more </connor>
<joey> Japanese culture the more Asian oriented </joey>
<connor> culture it's not that different from </connor>
<joey> what you get from fly-ins Asia like </joey>
<joey> Japanese specific like say onigiri I </joey>
<joey> didn't have no idea what the five before </joey>
<joey> but I could see that all it was just a </joey>
<garnt> ball of rice I know Ric is I can see </garnt>
<connor> what this is I guess it's a difference </connor>
<connor> of me coming from you know the whitest </connor>
<connor> place on earth and not not being exposed </connor>
<connor> to any other especially Asian cultures </connor>
<connor> you know yeah yeah the only Asian </connor>
<garnt> exposure I had you know apart from media </garnt>
<garnt> was just like the shitty Chinese shot </garnt>
<garnt> that you know down </garnt>
<connor> a dress like we've had awful Chinese and </connor>
<connor> so I think whenever I saw Japanese stuff </connor>
<connor> in media I thought it's so cool like I </connor>
<joey> it's gonna sound so [ __ ] dumb that </joey>
<joey> were the same go on you know you're more </joey>
<joey> like jackass the movie or whatever </joey>
<joey> whether they wear like one of them goes </joey>
<connor> to Japan oh yeah sounds like just </connor>
<connor> stripping in a store and dancing yeah </connor>
<connor> the whole time I just didn't know what </connor>
<joey> that like dude look at those [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> appliances they have I thought it was so </joey>
<joey> cool they had all these appliances in </joey>
<connor> the store like I've never seen them like </connor>
<joey> because in the West we never got those </joey>
<joey> like TV and radio built in yes and like </joey>
<joey> they had like the numbers on the side I </joey>
<joey> thought those were cool as [ __ ] as a kid </joey>
<joey> and then obviously watching like samurai </joey>
<connor> stuff and then Samurai Jack was a huge </connor>
<connor> thing that made me think like I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> love samurais oh yeah they were like the </connor>
<joey> coolest things to me I think I think it </joey>
<connor> was either like we're depending on if </connor>
<connor> you were into anime oh yeah like the two </connor>
<joey> things that got people into samurai were </joey>
<joey> either Samurai Jack all the locks I can </joey>
<connor> still watch Samurai Jack today and like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] love my Jack ride like a baby </joey>
<garnt> Samurai Jack is just a [ __ ] great </garnt>
<joey> show Jack was like the one constant </joey>
<joey> Network show other than ed and Eddy that </joey>
<joey> my dad would be just as excited to watch </joey>
<connor> it was like dude like I remember like </connor>
<connor> the episode we'd like the assassin do </connor>
<connor> you remember this one would they like </connor>
<connor> that the robot dog and I love that </connor>
<connor> episode all my favorites but uh I think </connor>
<connor> in my head looking back now I feel like </connor>
<joey> it was inevitable that I was gonna get </joey>
<connor> into anime cuz I had like a fondness for </connor>
<connor> Japanese culture well it wasn't like </connor>
<connor> intense a we be a thing I like the </connor>
<connor> movies I like the like all the culture </connor>
<connor> that I saw I loved video games and being </connor>
<connor> a video game fan you're gonna run into </connor>
<joey> like stuff so you're like huh why is it </joey>
<joey> like this and you're like oh it's </joey>
<joey> Japanese yeah and then also watching </joey>
<joey> anime from a young age and like yeah </joey>
<connor> so I felt like it was inevitable at some </connor>
<connor> point in my life I was gonna find anime </connor>
<connor> and be like I [ __ ] love this [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<garnt> my I feel I completely forgot about </garnt>
<connor> video games and just like JRPGs oh it's </connor>
<connor> it's a big push you don't realize not </connor>
<connor> really exactly I mean yeah and I realize </connor>
<connor> a lot of the same story tropes that drew </connor>
<connor> me to anime like I liked in JRPGs and to </connor>
<connor> JRPGs as well I guess remember the time </connor>
<joey> when Japan just felt like this foreign </joey>
<joey> oh yeah concept oh yeah yeah like this </joey>
<connor> was where this is way past even when me </connor>
<joey> discovering anime but I mean I remember </joey>
<connor> like after discovering an amazed </connor>
<connor> discovering Naruto and everything you </connor>
<connor> know it was so weird to find anyone who </connor>
<connor> went to Japan or see any kind of like </connor>
<connor> Japanese media even outside of the Japan </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's only recently become a </connor>
<garnt> tourist destination yeah you know like </garnt>
<joey> like if my my parents who like never </joey>
<joey> want to leave Europe right like they're </joey>
<joey> like if it's not Europe it's not a </joey>
<joey> vacation if they're considering like Oh </joey>
<joey> career and Japan sounds cool like if </joey>
<joey> they don't like that I'm like okay well </joey>
<joey> now I guess everyone's up to it now are </joey>
<joey> they thinking that yeah they were </joey>
<joey> planning they're not just because I </joey>
<joey> lived here but they were gonna they one </joey>
<joey> of the car anyway </joey>
<joey> and yeah I feel like there's that kind </joey>
<joey> of mainstream nurse of it anyway as </joey>
<connor> really like had a big impact recently </connor>
<connor> cuz I remember when I first started </connor>
<garnt> watching stuff on YouTube there was no </garnt>
<garnt> like vloggers like I've been watching </garnt>
<connor> like a Chris broad video from like years </connor>
<joey> ago yeah and he was like the only guy </joey>
<joey> right he was one of the oh geez right </joey>
<joey> like the thing yeah and I remember back </joey>
<joey> then like if you wanted to find certain </joey>
<joey> Japanese they were had to be like a BBC </joey>
<connor> documentary yeah yeah someone going </connor>
<connor> there right yeah like it was not a </connor>
<joey> youtube the weird wacky world of Japan </joey>
<garnt> ya know like you can find out anything </garnt>
<garnt> you want about exactly like it's not </garnt>
<connor> hard but I remember yeah like same thing </connor>
<garnt> you'd see you see these weird </garnt>
<garnt> commercials you'd see like these clips </garnt>
<joey> from these talk shows or the variety </joey>
<garnt> show </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and you're like what the [ __ ] is </garnt>
<joey> going on in this country takeshi's </joey>
<connor> Castle at 7:00 a.m. every day the </connor>
<connor> challenge I used to wake up early before </connor>
<joey> school and I would like watch every </joey>
<joey> episode over like I literally watched </joey>
<garnt> takeshi's castle all throughout high </garnt>
<connor> school no no same in those reruns oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah I loved it every time yes the same </garnt>
<connor> episodes over and over it's like it's </connor>
<connor> like watching Top Gear and down you know </connor>
<connor> it's like it's it's something you could </connor>
<garnt> always watch over and over and it was </garnt>
<joey> just so [ __ ] weird usually that I </joey>
<connor> found out though that like takeshi's </connor>
<connor> Castle you guys had the console yeah and </connor>
<joey> they're really interesting because </joey>
<joey> that's a shirt from the 80s yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it's strange cuz I think America has </joey>
<joey> their own version as well by the way </joey>
<joey> takeshi's Castle is this kind of </joey>
<connor> physical the most extreme Game Show was </connor>
<garnt> it called like did your warriors </garnt>
<garnt> something like that like what's like the </garnt>
<connor> moment you </connor>
<connor> but imagine if it was like all the </connor>
<connor> contestants were just everyday people </connor>
<connor> and it was horribly unfair yeah it was </connor>
<connor> so unfair and it was so fun and it was </connor>
<connor> just brutal these these courses they </connor>
<joey> would just send people and they were </joey>
<joey> ninja warrior' across the jackass yeah </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] dangerous I mean there's a </joey>
<joey> reason why they don't do that show any </joey>
<joey> no no no legit oh yeah yeah that show </joey>
<connor> had a huge following in the UK because </connor>
<connor> of rally and and I think America did as </connor>
<joey> well but each each localization had a </joey>
<joey> different style to it sir the Japanese </joey>
<garnt> mom she just showed the show yeah a </garnt>
<garnt> British one had like this Craig Charles </garnt>
<garnt> a Charles who's have quite a famous </garnt>
<garnt> person back in the 90s right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because he did Robot Wars right right </garnt>
<connor> yeah it was really big in America they </connor>
<connor> had like a kind of imagine like a pseudo </connor>
<connor> kind of football commentators been like </connor>
<connor> what do you think of that Jeff yeah he's </connor>
<connor> supposed to be like kind of like jokey </connor>
<connor> thinks I should watch clips of it it's </connor>
<connor> not as good but each country a Terran </connor>
<joey> localization yeah okay was huge because </joey>
<joey> I remember those petitions even when I </joey>
<joey> was like 16 17 people wanting to bring </joey>
<connor> it back but I mean how can you bring it </connor>
<connor> back by just dumping over the old but a </connor>
<connor> Thailand actually had I think a version </connor>
<garnt> like a few years ago as well okay they </garnt>
<garnt> made their own version I know because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember watching and thinking like not </garnt>
<garnt> the same thing quite scratch but that </garnt>
<garnt> was a huge factor in why also I love </garnt>
<joey> Japanese culture because you watch that </joey>
<connor> show in light it's it's crazy it's </connor>
<connor> amazing and it's also a blatantly </connor>
<connor> extremely Japanese yeah you're seeing </connor>
<connor> like katakana kanji everywhere like it's </connor>
<garnt> obviously just like it's it's purely </garnt>
<garnt> jazz like ADHD like editing you know I </garnt>
<connor> know it's pure like yeah that's my first </connor>
<garnt> introduction to like using Japanese your </garnt>
<garnt> chaos I don't know but what it is about </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese variety shows it's just about </garnt>
<garnt> having as much information on screen to </garnt>
<connor> like distract your eyes as possible I </connor>
<connor> start making YouTube videos I have come </connor>
<connor> to like feel sorry for every Japanese </connor>
<joey> editor oh the sheer amount of texts they </joey>
<connor> have to put on the screen changing </connor>
<joey> colors and [ __ ] popping up everywhere </joey>
<joey> because everybody's dialogue has </joey>
<garnt> sometimes it's like we can hear them </garnt>
<garnt> fine do you know what I hate when I </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I see like an anime trailer and </garnt>
<joey> it's from like Japanese TV so they </joey>
<joey> always go like this guy reacting to a or </joey>
<joey> something oh in the corner </joey>
<joey> and they're not even reacting that was </joey>
<connor> they just lame yeah yeah yeah game shows </connor>
<connor> they'll have like yeah and really like </connor>
<connor> like normal thing others have a guy in </connor>
<garnt> the corner like yeah it's like a really </garnt>
<garnt> interesting behind-the-scenes clip of </garnt>
<connor> this anime or show well like one of like </connor>
<connor> I remember seeing like the giorno Kent </connor>
<garnt> clip of the guy doing muda yeah right </garnt>
<connor> and there's just a gargantia in the </connor>
<connor> corner I was like I don't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> about my guys taking up valuable screen </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I have to say that like with </garnt>
<connor> takeshi's castle yeah I [ __ ] loved </connor>
<connor> growing up </connor>
<connor> oh my job I sure what was your guys like </connor>
<connor> favorite like segment of that show </connor>
<connor> because for me like to this day if I </connor>
<joey> have a bad day I'll always watch clips </joey>
<connor> of the ocean staircase see I think they </connor>
<joey> have different names for them yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> challenges title screens yeah I could </connor>
<connor> tell that they called try to mimic I </connor>
<joey> mean did you guys watch like the lotion </joey>
<connor> stay case is like they it's like a giant </connor>
<garnt> staycation it's just covered in lotion </garnt>
<garnt> and oh yeah yeah yeah I remember that </garnt>
<connor> one I like I like the the one where they </connor>
<joey> would the the honeycomb maze like the </joey>
<joey> hexagon maze although I was really this </joey>
<joey> maze and like and you got a up top down </joey>
<joey> view which is so good and you would see </joey>
<joey> them go through this maze and they're </joey>
<joey> basically these [ __ ] dudes which grab </joey>
<connor> them in the face there's also like the </connor>
<garnt> rolling things that they know the one </garnt>
<connor> the one of things that's my mind is the </connor>
<connor> one where they're like rock skipping </connor>
<connor> like just like you you [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] go full pelt over these like </connor>
<connor> rocks over a river and some of the rocks </connor>
<connor> would just would just sink yeah I'll </connor>
<connor> just imagine if like you're running full </connor>
<connor> pelt and then one of the rocks sinks and </connor>
<garnt> you just faceplant into a real rock oh </garnt>
<joey> my god I'll live to painful if you </joey>
<connor> haven't watched it you're in for a treat </connor>
<joey> it's just it's so good it's such good </joey>
<connor> fun I don't think a show like that good </connor>
<joey> command of issues causal they're like </joey>
<connor> there's so many shows that either </connor>
<connor> America or the UK or like some Western </connor>
<garnt> countries like off like silent library </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah wipeout alais they're all and </connor>
<connor> even like ninja warrior they're all like </connor>
<connor> a regionally Japanese owari are watching </connor>
<garnt> the Japanese version they could never go </garnt>
<connor> as crazy as a [ __ ] No </connor>
<connor> mean ya know it's crazy I mean I think </connor>
<joey> that was definitely game shows like </joey>
<joey> everything kind of got me into anime </joey>
<joey> Ryan like it was just that kind of </joey>
<joey> buildup of I kind of think this culture </joey>
<joey> is kind of sick right and I like what </joey>
<joey> they do I like all the media that they </joey>
<joey> put out like you know just jives with me </joey>
<garnt> right now I just seem to enjoy it and </garnt>
<garnt> then I remember the first like anime </garnt>
<garnt> anime right this is where we're talking </garnt>
<joey> about like finally getting into like </joey>
<joey> there should yeah oh [ __ ] yeah I </joey>
<garnt> remember I really force up for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason I wanted to be like a TV and film </garnt>
<garnt> snob I don't know why I wanted to be </garnt>
<garnt> like I've seen everything I think I feel </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone's gone at this point yeah </garnt>
<garnt> everybody I feel like it was in it I </garnt>
<connor> just finished watching like 24 in Prison </connor>
<connor> Break and I was feeling like man I'm </connor>
<connor> such TV connoisseur I've watched Prison </connor>
<garnt> Break in 24 so I went to went through </garnt>
<garnt> the list and and Death Note was like </garnt>
<garnt> eight for something at the time Wow nice </garnt>
<garnt> and I this must've been like mm yeah </garnt>
<garnt> 1213 yeah and I skipped it or initially </garnt>
<connor> because I'm like watching [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> cartoons yeah I'm a grown-ass man I grew </connor>
<connor> up because it was real again cuz like </connor>
<connor> you know my parents and they're all my </connor>
<connor> family and cousins and whatever like </connor>
<connor> they were telling you like dude stop </connor>
<connor> watching cartoons right your honor </connor>
<garnt> alright so I initially skipped it but </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason I did a double take like </garnt>
<garnt> two or three weeks later read the </garnt>
<garnt> synopsis and I thought okay this sounds </garnt>
<garnt> pretty [ __ ] sick yeah yeah and if </garnt>
<garnt> it's in the top ten it's got to be </garnt>
<garnt> pretty good right yeah watched one </garnt>
<garnt> episode I I had to school the next day </garnt>
<garnt> but I stayed up the whole night up until </garnt>
<garnt> school I had to leave with two episodes </garnt>
<garnt> left yeah a wash I binge did the whole </garnt>
<garnt> season of Death Note yeah one night and </garnt>
<connor> oh my god I just immediately feel I </connor>
<connor> became obsessed like it was like </connor>
<connor> overnight I had just come like all my </connor>
<connor> other plans to watch all these famous </connor>
<connor> movies and TV show yeah get that out of </connor>
<connor> someone on YouTube said watch Code Geass </connor>
<connor> so I'm gonna do that yeah and it's just </connor>
<connor> like obviously that phase where you </connor>
<connor> discover all like the golden anime it's </connor>
<connor> just like Bangor after Bangor and it's </connor>
<connor> like three months straight where you're </connor>
<connor> just like all you think about is </connor>
<garnt> watching the next Anam good like </garnt>
<garnt> remember that thing I've missed that </garnt>
<connor> fall so much everything she watched was </connor>
<connor> amazing you know like I look back at </connor>
<connor> some of the [ __ ] now like going through </connor>
<joey> this phase where I was </joey>
<joey> I was obsessed with Love Hina right okay </joey>
<connor> if we all had that face back of the day </connor>
<connor> can I ask what was the show that ruined </connor>
<connor> that for you I do remember because I </connor>
<connor> know exactly how it was for me not </connor>
<garnt> because like I feel like once you </garnt>
<connor> watched enough anime or you start like </connor>
<connor> do you remember the feeling of the void </connor>
<connor> right avoid where you watch this really </connor>
<connor> really good show you're like no one's </connor>
<connor> gonna top this not nothing's gonna top </connor>
<connor> this and you just feel empty </connor>
<connor> hit your boo oh and then and then the </connor>
<joey> more shows you watched more the more </joey>
<joey> that void shrinks right they were like </joey>
<joey> you find the next amazing show right you </joey>
<joey> were like and then you watch enough and </joey>
<connor> then you find like your top ten favorite </connor>
<connor> shows yeah yeah and then that's that's </connor>
<connor> kind of when it starts cementing for me </connor>
<connor> to like to the next phase where you </connor>
<connor> start watching stuff and it's not as </connor>
<connor> good a feeling as when you first started </connor>
<connor> so what was it for you then school days </connor>
<connor> cuz I I decided I distinctly remember </connor>
<connor> this okay and I remember being really </connor>
<connor> annoyed about it and I'm not saying that </connor>
<garnt> for the meme is totally accurate cuz I </garnt>
<garnt> can I never escaped school okay so you </garnt>
<connor> want to know you all know what's even </connor>
<connor> worse right is that so I was watching </connor>
<connor> anime on YouTube still at this point </connor>
<connor> right so I remember because I would get </connor>
<connor> I'd get a my anime list because that's </connor>
<connor> what I have one did right like you would </connor>
<connor> look at which ones are high rated and </connor>
<connor> which ones yeah for some reason school </connor>
<connor> daze was like one of the highest rated </connor>
<connor> but but it was like it was like it was </connor>
<joey> like split right between light it was </joey>
<joey> either a 10 or a 2 yeah and I thought </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna be in the 10 calories yeah </connor>
<connor> everything I've watched so far [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> long yeah so first off I already had a </connor>
<connor> bad start watching school days because I </connor>
<connor> remember watching school days HQ or </connor>
<connor> something and it was like like a </connor>
<joey> spin-off it was like 40 minutes of </joey>
<joey> course cool days HQ to explain is the </joey>
<joey> original visual novel of school days but </joey>
<garnt> the original visual novel of school days </garnt>
<garnt> was basically just a full-on anime yeah </garnt>
<connor> right it was all animated I didn't know </connor>
<connor> that this is the first time I just found </connor>
<garnt> that out yeah so you can watch you can </garnt>
<connor> watch all the school days HQ on </connor>
<connor> something like pornhub or less videos </connor>
<connor> which if you're really just like no </connor>
<garnt> if you're really just looking to watch </garnt>
<garnt> the you know clips that you're looking </garnt>
<connor> for you can just find it oh and they </connor>
<connor> would have showed the clips and that I </connor>
<connor> didn't get that far I got about soos a </connor>
<connor> 40 minute episode one right and I </connor>
<connor> watched 40 minutes and I was like this </connor>
<connor> isn't this isn't seem right am i </connor>
<connor> watching the right thing like everyone's </connor>
<joey> saying it's good right it's so funny </joey>
<connor> that you saying like the school days </connor>
<connor> like mal is either like a tan or yeah I </connor>
<connor> know you didn't say [ __ ] going on here I </connor>
<connor> know what mindset you're in where you </connor>
<garnt> were like every time I'm in the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> hood that sheep right who everyone else </connor>
<connor> is set at 10 and he doesn't want to be </connor>
<connor> that one guy who's like I don't think I </connor>
<connor> have good taste no way I have good taste </connor>
<joey> I can appreciate it Scott because for me </joey>
<joey> right like school days was like it was </joey>
<joey> crap until the last episode because the </joey>
<connor> last episode I was like first of all I </connor>
<connor> remember just like sitting there I'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna say it but I'm sure there's lots </connor>
<connor> of maleic school days for me that ending </connor>
<connor> just like the most satisfying thing I'd </connor>
<connor> ever seen it okay okay I will give you </connor>
<connor> that it was satisfying but then I </connor>
<connor> remembered like I just sat through 11 of </connor>
<connor> the most boring [ __ ] in my life yeah and </connor>
<connor> I don't think this is big enough to </connor>
<garnt> redeem it like the first the first 11 </garnt>
<connor> episodes was just like I think I need </connor>
<connor> anger management right yeah yeah oh my </connor>
<connor> god I hate the main character so my </connor>
<connor> whole and then I've gone and then he's </connor>
<garnt> like the [ __ ] orgasm you got an </garnt>
<joey> episode 12 where what happened happens </joey>
<joey> and you're like oh yeah that ending for </joey>
<joey> me made it it in no I specifically </joey>
<connor> remember I'm like I'm glad I went </connor>
<joey> through those 11 episodes going no </joey>
<connor> that's satisfying that's [ __ ] that </connor>
<connor> is bullet that's recency bias right cuz </connor>
<connor> you're you're basing your review of how </connor>
<connor> it ended not the [ __ ] the absolute </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] truck they do it to like a shovel </connor>
<joey> okay no but let but he's the thing right </joey>
<joey> like i I've said this so many times in </joey>
<joey> videos but like the ending for me is so </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] important because like I had got </connor>
<connor> that goldfish brain but iTunes </connor>
<connor> everything outside </connor>
<connor> the opposite experience with Deadman </connor>
<connor> Wonderland no I selected my guys cuz </connor>
<connor> they may wanna let for me was amazing </connor>
<connor> first 10 episodes and the ending was </connor>
<joey> just the most garbage [ __ ] II like </joey>
<joey> okay we ran out of budget ending that </joey>
<garnt> I've ever seen that it just completely </garnt>
<garnt> ruling class doesn't mean it's a one I </garnt>
<joey> mean I get devil in Wonderland the anime </joey>
<connor> yeah like a 5 what no no it's better </connor>
<joey> than a 5 because then I read the manga </joey>
<connor> and the monk is infinitely better you </connor>
<joey> think so yeah I thought whether because </joey>
<connor> the manga actually ends it's better than </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] anime I guess I am a reading </connor>
<connor> Deadman Wonderland and I kind of liked </connor>
<connor> what it did a little bit but the ending </connor>
<connor> I wasn't too big with fan over them all </connor>
<joey> right but even if it was like a mediocre </joey>
<joey> ending right ending at least I got an ok </joey>
<joey> ending whereas the anime just left me </joey>
<joey> wanting more and I'm like don't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> tease me like that after 10 amazing </joey>
<connor> episodes would you rather a show that </connor>
<connor> has like 10 amazing episodes with with </connor>
<connor> no ending or 24 episodes with 10 amazing </connor>
<joey> episodes and it starts to go kind of man </joey>
<garnt> the endings a little questionable the </garnt>
<connor> first writers what we got with dead man </connor>
<garnt> there yeah angers and that's why I but </garnt>
<garnt> like oh I'm trying I'm just trying to </garnt>
<joey> like wrap my head around how you could </joey>
<connor> justify like I've just been sitting here </connor>
<garnt> for like the past few minutes having a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] mental let me let me rephrase </joey>
<joey> let me rephrase okay I had so many </joey>
<connor> opinion changes on the ending to school </connor>
<connor> days like sorry okay so what would you </connor>
<connor> give school days now then now I would </connor>
<joey> give it a 6 </joey>
<connor> no no I had a phase where I'm like is </connor>
<joey> this ending genius or is it the worst </joey>
<connor> garbage if I if I like you know if I </connor>
<connor> make a character that is so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> abhorrent and then I kill him off oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah you should he's not even a good </garnt>
<connor> character like there's not a good </connor>
<joey> character it was exactly the reason why </joey>
<joey> the ending all it's satisfying but it's </joey>
<garnt> just so [ __ ] surface-level you know I </garnt>
<connor> mean I wouldn't watch it again he he </connor>
<connor> liked this protagonist it's the one that </connor>
<connor> we follow he made this character dog </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] on purpose but then there's also a </connor>
<connor> little bits where he tries to make you </connor>
<connor> like the guy and that's the words right </connor>
<connor> and that's what I [ __ ] hey is like no </connor>
<connor> don't try </connor>
<connor> we sympathize with this con you had like </connor>
<connor> a threesome in like class three be like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] you just had like a dad </connor>
<joey> that's the one character development </joey>
<joey> that uh what the folks Makoto had that's </joey>
<garnt> noses named makoto valued I complete </garnt>
<garnt> because he's so [ __ ] plans I couldn't </garnt>
<garnt> even remember his [ __ ] I can't </garnt>
<garnt> remember any of the character I love the </garnt>
<joey> one derivative all the Makoto hat is </joey>
<joey> that he started out as is like absolute </joey>
<joey> synthase kya needs of these most like </joey>
<garnt> the Giga chat and I'm the episode for me </garnt>
<joey> that made me like had to like pause and </joey>
<joey> go like was like the wind when they want </joey>
<joey> one of the have like a threesome </joey>
<joey> I like Poston I was like should chop </joey>
<garnt> them up there chop the [ __ ] mutt </garnt>
<connor> there so like like it was literally a </connor>
<garnt> porn plot how it happened it was </garnt>
<connor> schooldays hate you there's a pond </connor>
<connor> that's the worst thing about it right is </connor>
<connor> it they try and sell you that it's not a </connor>
<connor> poor plot and then they hit you with the </connor>
<connor> in front of my salad plot and you're </connor>
<connor> like no this isn't what I want like and </connor>
<connor> the fact that people on mal had the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] balls to be like this is an </connor>
<connor> artistic masterpiece of our generation </connor>
<connor> the timing is impeccable it's like no </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like yeah okay if my dog </connor>
<connor> got rabies and I watched it die that for </connor>
<connor> three hours yeah I'd probably see it put </connor>
<connor> down B would be satisfying right because </connor>
<connor> it's just suffering that's what that </connor>
<connor> anime was he was just suffering I </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hated it and the fact that I had </connor>
<connor> to then watch 40 minutes of a let's play </connor>
<connor> or whatever the [ __ ] it was the first </connor>
<connor> thing I did watch that and the worst </connor>
<connor> part was is that imagine okay before you </connor>
<connor> could even start the dog [ __ ] power that </connor>
<connor> is the [ __ ] school days you had to </connor>
<connor> watch 40 minutes of the same thing </connor>
<connor> before you started the same thing again </connor>
<connor> so I remember watching the first episode </connor>
<connor> already bored out of my mind because I'd </connor>
<connor> seen this [ __ ] before in it in a </connor>
<connor> slightly different way and I was like </connor>
<garnt> okay I hate school this school day sucks </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] I'm just having a [ __ ] mental </connor>
<connor> breakdown right now because I thought I </connor>
<connor> had left school days in the past I never </connor>
<connor> thought I'd hear though </connor>
<connor> two words again I'd be sitting next to </connor>
<connor> the guy who Lucas cuz I remember that </connor>
<connor> mal phase and I thought they must </connor>
<connor> everyone must be trolling yeah this is </connor>
<joey> like the interspecies reviewers kind of </joey>
<joey> thing everyone's giving this a ten </joey>
<joey> everyone's being [ __ ] ironic there's </joey>
<joey> no way that there can be a guy I'm sure </joey>
<joey> there were I'm sure there were but like </joey>
<garnt> I can't imagine I couldn't imagine you </garnt>
<joey> all ironically gave it a turn I just </joey>
<joey> can't I just I just remember like I had </joey>
<joey> a video like this is look were you </joey>
<joey> corrected your opinion no not enough I </joey>
<joey> mean two videos I had I had a video the </joey>
<joey> first video I ever made on school days </joey>
<joey> was right after I finished watching it </joey>
<joey> and I think like a six year old video </joey>
<joey> it's cold like is the school days ending </joey>
<joey> a masterpiece or something like that oh </joey>
<garnt> my god it's just like me going like yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah okay it's like it's like imagine if </connor>
<connor> Code Geass is ending right you had that </connor>
<connor> but then 25 episodes was just as fun </connor>
<connor> following like like Nunnally like just </connor>
<connor> yeah her daily life you know I mean like </connor>
<garnt> that shit's boring I don't [ __ ] see </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it wasn't like okay the ending </garnt>
<garnt> was satisfying but it was just it was </garnt>
<garnt> just a boring show it was a boring show </garnt>
<garnt> for half of it and then the second half </garnt>
<joey> was just like anger management I think I </joey>
<joey> gave us such a high score because I just </joey>
<joey> appreciated the meta behind how the </joey>
<joey> director and producer chose the little </joey>
<joey> worst ending of any visual novel in </joey>
<joey> existence it was like grade-a trolling </joey>
<joey> in my opinion and I think that's why I </joey>
<joey> said it was kind of Jean I mean it's </joey>
<connor> definitely different like that anything </connor>
<joey> was not like an ending like that we you </joey>
<joey> don't I said why we're still talking </joey>
<joey> about school days after [ __ ] how many </joey>
<connor> years of it's me now yeah but okay </connor>
<connor> here's the thing right is that sometimes </connor>
<connor> what what is a good ending right is it </connor>
<connor> is do it do you think it as a good </connor>
<connor> ending because if the story made sense </connor>
<joey> it really like in the whole thing it was </joey>
<joey> like wow that's a great ending it really </joey>
<joey> made sense all the characters </joey>
<joey> built up to this no it's a good ending </joey>
<joey> because the main character was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> awful and everyone in that show was </joey>
<joey> god-awful yeah we just wanted to see </joey>
<joey> them get like revenge but I'm like but I </joey>
<joey> would argue that like an ending that is </joey>
<joey> good right doesn't necessarily have to </joey>
<connor> be memorable right there's a difference </connor>
<joey> between a memorable ending </joey>
<joey> and a good it's a memorable I mean it's </joey>
<garnt> just like pure shock factor right it's </garnt>
<joey> just like pure shock factor and it's got </joey>
<connor> not much substance behind that shock </connor>
<joey> right right right </joey>
<connor> and that was my big problem with school </connor>
<connor> days because at least with the visual </connor>
<connor> novel you could see [ __ ] sex scenes </connor>
<connor> for one get some tips he's getting 316 </connor>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] exactly cuz ELISA in that what </garnt>
<connor> he actually makes made sense why he was </connor>
<connor> getting all this [ __ ] [ __ ] did it </connor>
<connor> did it made sense because he was the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] hint I'm the visual what in the </joey>
<connor> anime because they didn't explain the </connor>
<joey> hentai sub porn yeah or the subtext I </joey>
<connor> guess that it is like a hint I I think </connor>
<garnt> that was the first time as a teenager </garnt>
<connor> there that I was like Oh sex again like </connor>
<garnt> really we're gonna go with sex again all </garnt>
<connor> right geez that's like the age where </connor>
<joey> like you start to be like beyond those </joey>
<joey> kinds of like six and poop jokes where </joey>
<joey> it's all about like like challenging my </joey>
<joey> sixteen-year-old atheist brain then it's </joey>
<connor> not good material you know I mean I'm </connor>
<connor> pretty sure I watched that like peepee </connor>
<connor> poo-poo thing that made me laugh on </connor>
<joey> YouTube like two weeks ago so I don't </joey>
<connor> know why I'm fully gone but right but </connor>
<joey> like it always goes back right light </joey>
<joey> you'll often poop jokes at age 10 not at </joey>
<joey> age 15 and then you'll offer poop jokes </joey>
<connor> again at age 20 I being a teenager is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] weird that's actually it is </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] whiff because teenagers we horny </garnt>
<connor> as [ __ ] right yeah I guess when you're a </connor>
<connor> teenager you wanna this is weird thing </connor>
<joey> that you don't do as an adult right when </joey>
<joey> you're an adult you fully accept what </joey>
<joey> you're into as a teenager you're like </joey>
<garnt> trying to mold your interest into what </garnt>
<garnt> you think yeah yeah yeah I felt like the </garnt>
<garnt> shows that you watched which is probably </garnt>
<garnt> why this guy gave mallet </garnt>
<connor> I have [ __ ] schooldays of Tani's like </connor>
<connor> I want to be this smart you can see </connor>
<joey> through all the [ __ ] to see that </joey>
<joey> masterpiece I fully admit that's exactly </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna sit here and say like I </connor>
<joey> did that too right yeah I'm out there's </joey>
<joey> a part of me that would argue that </joey>
<joey> Prison Break was a masterpiece of art </joey>
<joey> I'm right when I look back now maybe the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] was like thinking I was 15 </joey>
<connor> yeah you know like it's when you're a </connor>
<connor> teenager you have dumb opinions </connor>
<joey> you should never start an energy channel </joey>
<garnt> in your no no you're very highly </garnt>
<garnt> regretted later on my first video was on </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] bleach how old do you started </connor>
<connor> YouTube then 17 oh [ __ ] okay I would see </connor>
<joey> I would do still do dumb [ __ ] up until </joey>
<connor> 20 yeah I started my youtube in 19 right </connor>
<joey> holy crap some of the stuff that I said </joey>
<joey> I I look back now and you know you look </joey>
<connor> back and you know the motives as well to </connor>
<joey> why you said the dumb [ __ ] yeah yeah oh </joey>
<connor> never have now right of course </connor>
<joey> like you you're like I want to be seen </joey>
<garnt> in this way so I'm gonna say opinion </garnt>
<connor> that isn't really mine but I don't know </connor>
<garnt> who will view me if I like I look like </garnt>
<garnt> my son my first videos and I [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> cringe man I could not finish them oh my </connor>
<connor> god I'm so [ __ ] glad that the way the </connor>
<connor> internet was it was like the perfect </connor>
<connor> time I think for when I was growing up </connor>
<connor> because like yeah there is still the </connor>
<connor> kind of thing of you could say whatever </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] you wanted I got away with it </connor>
<connor> right like I'm sure I said some [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> horrible stuff on runescape and Xbox </connor>
<connor> Live people right off like you know now </connor>
<connor> I mean kind of stuff gets hold against </connor>
<connor> you yeah yeah I'm glad that I had that </connor>
<connor> room to grow room to know that school </connor>
<joey> days was garbage you know without having </joey>
<joey> to make a video about it I mean my </joey>
<connor> school days is a masterpiece guys </connor>
<garnt> actually make a video what you did you </garnt>
<connor> did </connor>
<joey> oh your channel we're watching five </joey>
<connor> minutes I kind of watch it cuz so cringy </connor>
<joey> but it's like me and like a [ __ ] late </joey>
<joey> during the era where like known as the </joey>
<joey> guy as to where the wheel hats yeah I </joey>
<joey> had like I had a like a chop I had those </joey>
<joey> like the hugely chop behind and I was </joey>
<joey> also wearing this like rainbow beanie </joey>
<joey> with like a scarf attached to any [ __ ] I </joey>
<joey> love to cross to save the leaves I don't </joey>
<joey> know why anyone was like oh yeah this </joey>
<joey> guy's looks good but like yeah like on </joey>
<joey> ironically I was like you know what now </joey>
<joey> that I'd like mulling it over I think </joey>
<joey> school days is ending is really freaking </joey>
<joey> good </joey>
<joey> and it's a channel right now like I'll </joey>
<joey> keep that [ __ ] up because it is getting </joey>
<connor> a drive he's gonna I can't I like to </connor>
<joey> keep it up until I kind of remind my </joey>
<connor> audience that like you know I used to be </connor>
<joey> like this but now obviously I've changed </joey>
<connor> my view on school days and a lot of </connor>
<connor> shows because I've as you said </connor>
<connor> had the room to grow now and the room to </connor>
<joey> watch yeah I think it's funny to look </joey>
<garnt> back here old videos where your cringes </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah I used to be like this is what </joey>
<connor> I'm like now you know yeah I mean you </connor>
<garnt> can see clear improvement I like I like </garnt>
<connor> seeing the growth you know yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that feels good it feels it hurts to </connor>
<connor> watch some of your older videos I </connor>
<garnt> actually watched it and I'm like I sound </garnt>
<garnt> so much more British yeah so [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> mind </garnt>
<connor> I didn't realize such a northern accent </connor>
<joey> yeah start of YouTube well when I made </joey>
<joey> you you have like the thickest Walsh </joey>
<connor> accent yeah it's kind of been like </connor>
<joey> destroyed yeah which is nice you know I </joey>
<joey> mean I use to be clearly here but I </joey>
<joey> think that's to coincide with all like </joey>
<joey> YouTube growth I think you have that as </joey>
<joey> well especially in your tastes and anime </joey>
<garnt> when you're a teenager and what you like </garnt>
<garnt> and you know you can allow yourself a </garnt>
<garnt> trash taste for a reason </garnt>
<garnt> Joey's Joey's really pulling his weight </garnt>
<garnt> on that this episode has been on [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> point and to bring the trashy and </joey>
<garnt> alright if Seoul is gonna do is gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> me like why is it every podcast someone </garnt>
<joey> I can never escape for that's why I </joey>
<joey> think it's that it's that moment as an </joey>
<connor> anime fan when you watch school days and </connor>
<joey> it's like two paths which one are you </joey>
<connor> gonna go are you gonna go down like just </connor>
<connor> admitting your tastes </connor>
<joey> this is like the modern-day like Pokemon </joey>
<connor> versus Digimon yeah school days good old </connor>
<garnt> school days back it's like the anime </garnt>
<garnt> litmus test thank you well school days </garnt>
<garnt> just way more culturally important for </garnt>
<connor> the anime fandom than I've realized that </connor>
<connor> least for you know in the mid you know </connor>
<connor> 2010 that right yeah I think that was a </connor>
<joey> big like taste indicator oh and also </joey>
<joey> anyone who said they liked it was a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] liar at the time you know no </joey>
<connor> because at that time I remember this I </connor>
<connor> felt like I was too [ __ ] the idiot </connor>
<connor> cuz I'm like the only guy that thinks </connor>
<joey> the show is garbage like okay school </joey>
<joey> days come out it was like 2007 it was it </joey>
<garnt> was during the Golden Age okay so 2007 </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah cuz I think it was 2006 saying </joey>
<connor> that right I watched that at like 2013 </connor>
<garnt> yeah and that was just that argument was </garnt>
<connor> still going on yeah until 2013 and a </connor>
<connor> Sonic's aspect that's still going on </connor>
<joey> today </joey>
<joey> obviously a lot lesser but I mean you </joey>
<joey> can argue that we brought it back yeah </joey>
<joey> how many anime do you know that have had </joey>
<connor> like discussions like that where it's </connor>
<connor> like brought up time and it's so </connor>
<garnt> decisive well right I think this is the </garnt>
<joey> only anime that's like properly trashy </joey>
<connor> you know enemies no it's no trap that it </connor>
<joey> just keeps being brought up because I </joey>
<connor> can you know point shows like say </connor>
<connor> Evangelion or something that's you know </connor>
<joey> we can discuss till the end of times and </joey>
<connor> fans probably will discuss that too at </connor>
<joey> the end of time but in terms of like </joey>
<joey> shows that I count as [ __ ] awful yeah </joey>
<joey> um school days is just a show that just </joey>
<joey> doesn't a few slice the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> cockroach every time I step on it every </connor>
<connor> time I think it'll never escape from it </connor>
<connor> dude that's that's the beauty of school </connor>
<joey> 20 oh my god I love how this was just </joey>
<connor> like search for your origin story in </connor>
<joey> Texas the downfall of anime the absolute </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] roasting of my 10 out of 10 </joey>
<connor> opinions just like a Brazos of anime you </connor>
<joey> know it's just like that's basically </joey>
<joey> what it is it's like an action if like </joey>
<connor> if a browsers had a good ending we </connor>
<connor> probably all be arguing about it right </connor>
<connor> that's the equivalent it's like it's not </connor>
<connor> it's [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah so heated about </connor>
<connor> it I just it gives like a visceral </connor>
<connor> reaction to everyone who dislikes this </connor>
<joey> guys are living adapt I'm just looking </joey>
<connor> forward to the giant discussion this is </connor>
<joey> gonna cause and like the Sabra it's </joey>
<connor> gonna be a whole threat again this time </connor>
<connor> I am interested to see what you the </connor>
<garnt> viewers you have seen school they think </garnt>
<connor> of it and yeah if you're wrong on I mean </connor>
<garnt> I I said anything else we can talk about </garnt>
<garnt> over then I think that's a good place to </garnt>
<joey> end if yeah I feel like that's that's </joey>
<garnt> just took the wind out of my sails I </garnt>
<joey> don't know how I can possibly be calm </joey>
<joey> about anything else today but you do </joey>
<connor> have something important about our we've </connor>
<connor> actually started the trash taste patreon </connor>
<connor> as you can see the production value is </connor>
<garnt> quite high for this podcast and we have </garnt>
<garnt> editors helping us and stuff and it's a </garnt>
<connor> whole system that we have and sadly it </connor>
<garnt> doesn't fund itself it's a lot of money </garnt>
<garnt> to run basically I just want to talk </garnt>
<garnt> about because you know I feel like when </garnt>
<garnt> we were making this podcast we didn't </garnt>
<garnt> want to settle for like cheap production </garnt>
<connor> values we wanted this </connor>
<connor> to be you know comparable to any other </connor>
<connor> high budget pot yeah yeah like to us </connor>
<joey> this was a passion project yeah </joey>
<connor> we've put quite a lot of our own savings </connor>
<joey> into that's an understatement </joey>
<connor> expensive like you know several thousand </connor>
<connor> dollars into making this and plus you </connor>
<joey> know we are renting out a studio you </joey>
<joey> know in Japan a lot of time a lot of </joey>
<joey> money yeah new Tokyo so right now like </joey>
<connor> not to say that we you know all three of </connor>
<connor> us are pretty well off we'd be fine if </connor>
<connor> we just don't want our passion project </connor>
<joey> to be bleeding money which right now it </joey>
<connor> is ya know so any any help that you can </connor>
<connor> give to help us just to you know go even </connor>
<connor> cuz that's that's my goal if yep I can </connor>
<connor> do this and not have to worry about </connor>
<connor> losing my thing like just constantly </connor>
<connor> losing money and you know then I would </connor>
<garnt> be more comfortable and I will just be </garnt>
<joey> happy yeah and hopefully with your guys </joey>
