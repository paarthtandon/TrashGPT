<garnt> this is just a acceptable gift that you </garnt>
<connor> can give anyone yeah </connor>
<connor> um so let's let's let's do the unboxing </connor>
<connor> shall we </connor>
<joey> yes asmr asmr unboxing time </joey>
<joey> yeah and you see we've already got wine </joey>
<garnt> glasses because we had no idea what this </garnt>
<garnt> could possibly be </garnt>
<connor> it is fancy so basically at our </connor>
<connor> supermarket i'll </connor>
<garnt> tell the story while you're opening that </garnt>
<garnt> so basically at the supermarket that we </garnt>
<garnt> all </garnt>
<garnt> live near which i'm not gonna say yeah </garnt>
<garnt> uh there's like a </garnt>
<garnt> like a boost section like a liquor store </garnt>
<garnt> section and i didn't know for the </garnt>
<connor> longest time that not only is there a </connor>
<connor> liquor sauce section but there's like </connor>
<connor> a dedicated section to wine okay like a </connor>
<connor> wine </connor>
<joey> like room i guess so i got a uh </joey>
<garnt> an italian one i think overall </garnt>
<joey> i i misread this at first i was like </joey>
<garnt> buruto </garnt>
<garnt> like i was like this is this anime one </garnt>
<connor> naruto </connor>
<connor> borrows so wide yeah it just sounds like </connor>
<connor> a generic dragon ball villain </connor>
<garnt> thank you very much no worries i don't </garnt>
<joey> know too much about wines apart from if </joey>
<joey> they're in </joey>
<joey> um red or white what colors </joey>
<joey> if they're red or white or if they're </joey>
<garnt> one of the ten from drops of god </garnt>
<joey> i don't think it's that but barolo is </joey>
<joey> like uh i think it's like pretty well </joey>
<garnt> known in </garnt>
<garnt> italy i think right the guy was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah if you want like a well-known </garnt>
<garnt> italian wine like get barolo so uh </garnt>
<garnt> hey if anyone's watching this episode or </garnt>
<garnt> listening to this episode </garnt>
<garnt> probably you're italian let us know if </garnt>
<joey> you know </joey>
<connor> barolo i just thought they were like the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] is a barolo </joey>
<connor> rolo that's what they call boruto </connor>
<garnt> actually it's funny because how i got </garnt>
<garnt> into wine </garnt>
<garnt> because how i got into wine initially </garnt>
<garnt> was literally um </garnt>
<garnt> drops of god because before that i was </garnt>
<garnt> like why does anyone would drink wine i </garnt>
<garnt> just want a cold beer </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to like but after reading </garnt>
<garnt> you read drops of god once and you're </garnt>
<connor> like i love wine </connor>
<connor> wine's great i i read drops of god on a </connor>
<connor> flight </connor>
<connor> i think it was what was the flight i </connor>
<garnt> don't know it's from like america or </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere </garnt>
<garnt> and uh i remembered reading drops of god </garnt>
<connor> and you know when like the little cart </connor>
<connor> comes by yeah what do you want to drink </connor>
<connor> and i was like </connor>
<connor> of course i want what i'm a connoisseur </connor>
<connor> of fine taste </connor>
<connor> of course why even ask me the question </connor>
<joey> yeah i was about to ask i hope you were </joey>
<joey> drinking </joey>
<connor> wine on the flight away so so she you </connor>
<connor> know she gets out there the little </connor>
<connor> bottle of wine they crack open and pours </connor>
<connor> it into this plastic cup for me </connor>
<connor> and it was like the most pathetic drink </connor>
<connor> i'd ever had i was sitting there like </connor>
<connor> swirling this plastic cup that like a </connor>
<connor> you know ten-year-old would drink a </connor>
<connor> drink out yeah yeah just mean that </connor>
<joey> yeah that's good yeah because table wine </joey>
<joey> we all know table wine on flights is </joey>
<joey> basically just like </joey>
<joey> grape juice with hand sanitizer in it </joey>
<connor> like it's it's disgusting i mean because </connor>
<connor> you you can't even taste </connor>
<garnt> uh like things that aren't like super </garnt>
<connor> salty right on flights anyway yeah </connor>
<garnt> i feel like wine is the worst thing i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like it's that point when you're </garnt>
<garnt> watching something that's </garnt>
<garnt> super good like for example when you're </garnt>
<garnt> watching shokugeki </garnt>
<garnt> this food looks amazing and you're </garnt>
<garnt> sitting there with your [ __ ] takeaway </garnt>
<garnt> combining meal </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like this is this is kind of </garnt>
<connor> like a5b </connor>
<connor> now just imagine hard enough </connor>
<joey> nothing more orgasmic than craft mac and </joey>
<garnt> cheese </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<garnt> which was another meme that uh </garnt>
<garnt> originated from drops of god </garnt>
<garnt> if if oh come on i'm sorry </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<joey> the podcast is starting now happy </joey>
<joey> birthday cheers </joey>
<connor> so boys what are we what are we </connor>
<garnt> discussing today what's the topic i mean </garnt>
<garnt> on the topic of you know we we talked </garnt>
<garnt> about </garnt>
<garnt> uh we because we live quite close </garnt>
<joey> together right we live within </joey>
<garnt> you know walking distance yeah so i </garnt>
<joey> guess </joey>
<joey> i think a good topic would be how we you </joey>
<garnt> know what our experiences are like </garnt>
<garnt> living here in japan </garnt>
<garnt> now that we've all finally moved here </garnt>
<garnt> because we just moved here um how many </garnt>
<garnt> months have we been living here now it's </garnt>
<garnt> actually like eight </garnt>
<connor> eight months she's crazy really yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah october so </joey>
<joey> it's just hit june so it was like and </joey>
<joey> this was like middle too it was like </joey>
<garnt> seven and a half months i guess yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah right </joey>
<garnt> yeah and that's it does not feel like no </garnt>
<connor> no well to be fair the last two months i </connor>
<garnt> might as well have been living in </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] australia </garnt>
<joey> i like quarantine does things to you and </joey>
<garnt> i hadn't heard anyone speak japanese </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> about two months except for like that </garnt>
<garnt> brief moment where you'd go out to buy </garnt>
<garnt> groceries and you i just forget that i </garnt>
<joey> was living in japan </joey>
<joey> yeah legit like i remember like catching </joey>
<joey> the train for the first time in like </joey>
<connor> two months and i was just like the world </connor>
<connor> is full of water </connor>
<connor> i was like i felt like i was uh like </connor>
<joey> cast away like </joey>
<joey> when he like tom hanks after castaway </joey>
<connor> when he came back to humanity </connor>
<joey> you know because i don't i don't know if </joey>
<joey> you guys have but yet but i still </joey>
<joey> haven't gone into tokyo yet </joey>
<garnt> uh uh i went there like central tokyo </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah i think the first time i went </joey>
<joey> there was like </joey>
<joey> yesterday and that was literally just </joey>
<joey> because it was like quarantine was over </joey>
<garnt> just on like the day of my birthday yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh this is this is fate i'm i'm gonna go </garnt>
<garnt> out and uh have some nice food but </garnt>
<garnt> even now there's like a lot of places </garnt>
<garnt> are still closed yeah so it's it's still </garnt>
<garnt> not like everything's open yet </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah it's it's been a really </garnt>
<garnt> fast eight months it hasn't felt like </garnt>
<garnt> eight years at all </garnt>
<garnt> like i guess my first question to you </garnt>
<garnt> guys my first question to you guys is </garnt>
<joey> like what </joey>
<joey> made you decide to move to japan in the </joey>
<joey> first place because you've been here for </joey>
<joey> how many years now </joey>
<joey> i've been here four years now yeah i </joey>
<garnt> guess for you it's more obvious though </garnt>
<joey> i mean yeah because i've spent what like </joey>
<garnt> half my life here and i have family </garnt>
<garnt> up north and in tokyo um at least with </garnt>
<garnt> me </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm pretty sure i've said this in </garnt>
<garnt> videos before but like </garnt>
<garnt> i was gonna move to japan after i </garnt>
<garnt> graduated from uni anyway </garnt>
<garnt> because i i think this was like back </garnt>
<garnt> when i had </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like 20k 30k subs so i wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> doing it full time at all </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i was in like my second year of </garnt>
<garnt> university and i was </garnt>
<garnt> interning at like a japanese like it </garnt>
<garnt> company which i believe </garnt>
<garnt> is now like defunct like it doesn't </garnt>
<connor> exist anymore i don't think </connor>
<garnt> so glad that internship never went </garnt>
<connor> through yeah but </connor>
<garnt> yeah so i i was gonna move to japan </garnt>
<garnt> anyway because like it just makes sense </garnt>
<garnt> for me because i'm fluent in both </garnt>
<garnt> english and japanese which is </garnt>
<garnt> such a huge plus here like if you know </garnt>
<garnt> both languages like </garnt>
<garnt> you can pretty much get a job anywhere </garnt>
<garnt> we'll we'll get to that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> we'll get to that and like no one in </garnt>
<garnt> australia gives a [ __ ] if you can speak </garnt>
<garnt> japanese </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly like my dad's works at like </garnt>
<garnt> a japanese it company for </garnt>
<garnt> 30 years he can't speak a word in </garnt>
<garnt> japanese yeah it's because no one in the </garnt>
<garnt> office can speak japanese right but </garnt>
<garnt> here it's like if you can speak english </garnt>
<garnt> you can do business with </garnt>
<garnt> anybody yeah in or out of japan so it </garnt>
<garnt> just was like a natural process for me </garnt>
<joey> to like okay </joey>
<joey> i get my paper i work at like some </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] it company in japan and then </joey>
<garnt> we're all good so yeah it's funny </garnt>
<garnt> because i i reckon one of the </garnt>
<garnt> few industries where japanese is it can </garnt>
<joey> be super super important </joey>
<joey> is anime and manga exactly exactly yeah </joey>
<garnt> you might start your luck there yeah </garnt>
<joey> exactly so like either way </joey>
<garnt> like it was just a natural like path for </garnt>
<garnt> me to like move here </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but you know instead of you know </garnt>
<garnt> doing that desk job that i </garnt>
<garnt> had set my plans on uh you know youtube </garnt>
<garnt> for me blew up like in my third year of </garnt>
<garnt> uni when i graduated and so </garnt>
<garnt> i was like all right i'll guess i'll do </garnt>
<joey> this guess i'll do youtube for as long </joey>
<garnt> as i can and then </garnt>
<garnt> you're still doing it i'm still doing it </garnt>
<joey> somehow i'm still doing it </joey>
<joey> i know it's crazy the story of or i </joey>
<garnt> guess like the the original plan </garnt>
<joey> that was brought up to you guys about </joey>
<garnt> bbq yes like a year ago </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i wanted to move here for a </garnt>
<garnt> while i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like since we first met each other and </garnt>
<garnt> since my first trip to japan i was like </garnt>
<garnt> i could really see myself living here </garnt>
<joey> this is and this is not </joey>
<joey> like the typical weeb kind of fantasy </joey>
<joey> i actually never had that you know i was </joey>
<connor> what like i remember </connor>
<connor> back in back in the day when it was like </connor>
<connor> mid-2000s yeah </connor>
<connor> like the weeaboo dream was to live in </connor>
<joey> japan and you know </joey>
<joey> work in the anime work in the anime </joey>
<joey> industry it was just like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dream that nobody had ever proven or you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> so it was just that weeb dream but i </joey>
<joey> never really wanted that i was like you </joey>
<joey> know i'm i'm happy with a normal career </joey>
<joey> yeah um i'd never really fantasized </joey>
<joey> about going to japan but </joey>
<joey> i remember the first time i came here it </joey>
<garnt> was so eye-opening for me because it was </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> you know when you know that feeling when </garnt>
<garnt> you're like man this country just works </garnt>
<garnt> in a lot of ways and it's to do with my </garnt>
<garnt> job </garnt>
<garnt> so i'm like this this could be a really </garnt>
<garnt> good opportunity for me yeah </garnt>
<connor> i definitely felt the same thing with </connor>
<garnt> how i thought about japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i couldn't have cared less about </garnt>
<garnt> living here and i thought people were </garnt>
<garnt> learning the language </garnt>
<garnt> at the time you know i was like 15 14 i </garnt>
<garnt> was like that's kind of cringe bro </garnt>
<garnt> but like now now that you know i've </garnt>
<garnt> actually started to learn it i regret it </garnt>
<garnt> so much i regret that like </garnt>
<connor> i didn't learn any because i could have </connor>
<connor> been like a few months ahead at least </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> i wish i was more weeaboo yeah like now </connor>
<connor> that the </connor>
<connor> now that the cringy weeaboo phase is </connor>
<connor> over i wish i was that cringey weeaboo </connor>
<garnt> because that would give me so much more </garnt>
<garnt> of an advantage </garnt>
<connor> now that i'm hearing yeah yeah exactly </connor>
<garnt> you know and </garnt>
<connor> a part of me with i remember when i i </connor>
<connor> used to think that way like anyone who's </connor>
<connor> learning it it's just like wow it's so </connor>
<connor> sad you're never like actually gonna </connor>
<connor> learn it but like to be fair if you're </connor>
<connor> learning anything </connor>
<connor> you know any other kind of language </connor>
<connor> especially if you only speak one i think </connor>
<connor> that's like </connor>
<connor> good good on you like better yourself </connor>
<connor> you know gives a [ __ ] and i really </connor>
<connor> regret that i thought that </connor>
<garnt> everyone everyone who's learning </garnt>
<garnt> japanese because of anime is pathetic </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah but then again i was like an </garnt>
<garnt> edgy teenager right and we all think </garnt>
<garnt> that and </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like like like you said i had no i </garnt>
<garnt> no intention or want to live here </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i was pretty content in the uk and </garnt>
<garnt> even when i visited here i thought </garnt>
<garnt> wow this is an amazing place to come </garnt>
<garnt> visit right but </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think i was still sold yet on </garnt>
<garnt> moving here because i </garnt>
<garnt> i think i don't know about you guys but </garnt>
<garnt> i really like need friends </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<connor> and i was like i need that social </connor>
<connor> interaction </connor>
<connor> for every weeb but i i do need like to </connor>
<connor> have friends </connor>
<connor> that i like see often otherwise like i </connor>
<connor> really get like upset like you're like </connor>
<joey> the antithesis of </joey>
<connor> every weirdo yeah like i i need to </connor>
<connor> socialize or i </connor>
<garnt> really like it really starts to take a </garnt>
<connor> toll on me yeah i was just like </connor>
<garnt> i really like worried that i wouldn't be </garnt>
<garnt> able to you know have a good social </garnt>
<connor> circle or meet people </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean luckily that hasn't been the </garnt>
<garnt> case but because i guess the big </garnt>
<garnt> difference between you and me is that </garnt>
<joey> i've already like before japan i'd </joey>
<garnt> already lived in thailand </garnt>
<joey> for right right three years um so i had </joey>
<garnt> experience </garnt>
<garnt> moving to a different country and </garnt>
<joey> finding new friends </joey>
<joey> and to me it was like okay that's i'm </joey>
<joey> just starting the process </joey>
<joey> all over again and it's just a new </joey>
<garnt> adventure i guess yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so it was a lot easier for me to decide </garnt>
<garnt> hey i'm gonna i'm gonna move to japan i </garnt>
<garnt> guess the biggest thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's you know made me think is that do </garnt>
<garnt> i really want to go </garnt>
<garnt> through this process again how long do i </garnt>
<garnt> see myself actually living here </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um and to me it was like this is </garnt>
<garnt> the last big move </garnt>
<joey> i'm gonna do before i kind of start to </joey>
<joey> think about yeah that's crazy </joey>
<joey> staying in one place just flying to </joey>
<joey> different countries every few months </joey>
<garnt> which is what i was doing </garnt>
<garnt> before yeah yeah i i don't know how you </garnt>
<garnt> were doing that for like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like it was because you were you </garnt>
<joey> were going from like thailand to uk </joey>
<garnt> to america america and then yeah it was </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> it was like i had three offices i had </garnt>
<garnt> one in thailand one in the uk </garnt>
<garnt> and one in america that's a major </garnt>
<garnt> entrepreneur </garnt>
<connor> it's like the traveling just gets to you </connor>
<connor> man because i oh yeah </connor>
<joey> like you know when you're like at </joey>
<joey> university you're like i just want to </joey>
<joey> travel i want to </joey>
<joey> get out i want to experience new things </joey>
<joey> but you do it every year for about a </joey>
<garnt> good </garnt>
<garnt> four years and it [ __ ] it [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> gets you in yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i think i'm definitely starting to </joey>
<garnt> phase out of that like i love </garnt>
<joey> just any excuse to travel is great </joey>
<garnt> because now i'm really starting to like </garnt>
<connor> to test </connor>
<garnt> some some travel remember like when </garnt>
<garnt> traveling to anime cons was exciting </garnt>
<garnt> and now the thought of having to go on a </garnt>
<garnt> plane to get somewhere </garnt>
<garnt> that was to me to me it's it's a lot </garnt>
<connor> harder than it used to be </connor>
<connor> i guess because it's just because how </connor>
<joey> it's become </joey>
<joey> it's always a 10 plus hour flight and </joey>
<joey> that's like the thing </joey>
<connor> that is really draining we must sound so </connor>
<garnt> god i'm so annoyed we have to travel so </garnt>
<connor> it's i hate to win these concerts pay </connor>
<joey> for our travel </joey>
<joey> right but yeah i mean you know it's i </joey>
<joey> guess it happens right when you travel a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] ton i'm sure any anyone who has </connor>
<connor> like parents or family </connor>
<connor> friends who work their whole business is </connor>
<garnt> to travel it does become drainage </garnt>
<connor> i mean because it's it is a job i think </connor>
<connor> yeah because i like you know </connor>
<connor> it's people want to travel but if you've </connor>
<garnt> ever had like a </garnt>
<garnt> office job which i did for the bbc and </garnt>
<garnt> you had to travel </garnt>
<garnt> to europe you have to travel to these </garnt>
<garnt> places and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> hours and hours of traveling for the job </garnt>
<garnt> it drains you </garnt>
<garnt> no matter where you're traveling to if </garnt>
<garnt> you travel there enough it'll </garnt>
<joey> it'll eventually drain you and it will </joey>
<joey> there's a massive difference between </joey>
<garnt> traveling for </garnt>
<garnt> pleasure oh yeah for business and i mean </garnt>
<garnt> like it doesn't seem </garnt>
<garnt> it might not seem there's like a huge </garnt>
<garnt> difference especially to someone who </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't travel </garnt>
<joey> a lot but after a while you're just like </joey>
<joey> oh man i have to go on this flight </joey>
<joey> versus </joey>
<joey> yay i get to go on this flight i think </joey>
<connor> the only time i'm like excited for a </connor>
<garnt> flight is when like </garnt>
<joey> netflix drops like a whole show yeah </joey>
<garnt> that i'm like super hyped for </garnt>
<garnt> it's like yeah sweet like at 10 hours no </garnt>
<connor> one bothered me yeah i haven't watched </connor>
<connor> this hell yeah that's like the only time </connor>
<connor> but the worst is when you get to the app </connor>
<garnt> you're like [ __ ] i didn't download </garnt>
<garnt> anything yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh god oh no we have to pay for shitty </garnt>
<connor> wi-fi to scroll on twitter for 12 hours </connor>
<joey> cool i have to play this solitaire game </joey>
<joey> for 10 hours that doesn't require any </joey>
<garnt> internet yeah it's like when you sit </garnt>
<joey> down for a [ __ ] and you realize your </joey>
<joey> phone's on one percent </joey>
<garnt> you're like what do i do when this </garnt>
<garnt> battery runs out </garnt>
<garnt> like another thing is like time </garnt>
<connor> differences and yeah adjusting sleep </connor>
<connor> schedule </connor>
<connor> i got a question for you because we went </connor>
<connor> through the same kind of flight how did </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> find the traveling to the crunchyroll </connor>
<connor> anime awards because to put things in </connor>
<garnt> perspective we </garnt>
<garnt> we had we were there for like one day </garnt>
<garnt> one two two days </garnt>
<garnt> right um and we had to travel how long </garnt>
<connor> did you have to travel </connor>
<connor> 16 ish hours i think it was for the </connor>
<connor> crunchyroll anime awards yeah for me it </connor>
<garnt> was 21 hours of traveling </garnt>
<joey> yeah because you're in the uk at the </joey>
<garnt> time i was in thailand </garnt>
<garnt> which is even worse yeah that was the </garnt>
<garnt> straw that broke the camel's back </garnt>
<garnt> after that i was like right you know if </garnt>
<garnt> if i'm traveling too far </garnt>
<garnt> there's got to be something man i think </garnt>
<connor> i remember hanging out with you after </connor>
<connor> you came back from that and you were </connor>
<connor> still pissed off about like </connor>
<connor> that you had to endure that and i'm like </connor>
<connor> all right well you know </connor>
<garnt> i just want to say cheers you're all for </garnt>
<connor> not inviting me to that </connor>
<connor> you saved me a lot of trouble no i mean </connor>
<connor> it's a great experience </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm trying to i'm trying to be </joey>
<joey> brand uh friendly here </joey>
<garnt> my brand like i'm not saying the </garnt>
<garnt> experience is bad </garnt>
<garnt> what i'm the the thing that was bad was </garnt>
<garnt> me having to adjust </garnt>
<garnt> immediately to uh to like a 16 hour time </garnt>
<garnt> difference </garnt>
<joey> and then two days later have to adjust </joey>
<garnt> back yeah and try to be </garnt>
<joey> in like try to be in a working state not </joey>
<joey> to mention in between that you have to </joey>
<joey> go on stage in front of </joey>
<joey> thousands of people yeah and be like </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah just just just nail this don't </joey>
<joey> act like you're sleepy </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah no pressure it was fun overall </connor>
<garnt> i like uh networking with people and </garnt>
<garnt> like meeting other youtubers you don't </garnt>
<garnt> get to see often is </garnt>
<garnt> pretty fun but anyway cycling back to </garnt>
<garnt> the japan stuff </garnt>
<garnt> when in your timeline did you </garnt>
<connor> get like i guess presented with the idea </connor>
<connor> or the offer of moving </connor>
<connor> like when was that or do you remember </connor>
<garnt> the date ish i can't </garnt>
<connor> remember the dates the exact time and </connor>
<garnt> location </garnt>
<garnt> roughly um when was it for you because i </garnt>
<connor> i know that you knew you were like the </connor>
<connor> offer had been presented itself to you </connor>
<connor> before me </connor>
<connor> um and i think it must have been like </connor>
<connor> in either like february march-ish this </connor>
<connor> is like </connor>
<connor> it was like three or four months before </connor>
<joey> ax i know that yeah when i </joey>
<joey> i remember it was like at least a year </joey>
<connor> ago when i heard about it yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so it was i think i guess from the </connor>
<connor> timeline where it came up to me knowing </connor>
<connor> it was possibility </connor>
<connor> to me actually like finishing the move </connor>
<garnt> it was probably like like seven eight </garnt>
<garnt> months oh yeah it's it's been </garnt>
<garnt> it's been well over a year for me </garnt>
<connor> because i </connor>
<connor> knew that you knew before me so yeah how </connor>
<garnt> it happened for me was i was i remember </garnt>
<garnt> i was just sitting in a book walker </garnt>
<garnt> meeting </garnt>
<garnt> and we were just talking about i can't </garnt>
<garnt> remember some some random stuff about </garnt>
<garnt> what book walker you know wants to do in </garnt>
<garnt> the future and then </garnt>
<garnt> um the person who i was talking to which </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> can i can i mention your name alan </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not going to throw i'm not going to </garnt>
<garnt> throw you on there </garnt>
<connor> so so melin who is basically our manager </connor>
<connor> we're all our managers now um she </connor>
<connor> basically just asked me </connor>
<connor> have you ever thought about moving to </connor>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<garnt> and that was just kind of a this it just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of came out of nowhere for me yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was like i didn't know how to react to </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> i was like that's a loaded question yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but </garnt>
<connor> i mean i'm not gonna say no but you know </connor>
<connor> you know when you like </connor>
<connor> ask the question and it's obviously for </connor>
<connor> a purpose like it's not just it's not a </connor>
<connor> hypothetical yeah yeah yeah and you're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> oh this this this could actually be a </connor>
<garnt> thing yeah and so </garnt>
<garnt> um i went away i thought about it and i </garnt>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah if i'm not gonna do it now then </garnt>
<garnt> when in my life am i gonna do it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah and then i guess the idea </garnt>
<garnt> just grew from there from </garnt>
<garnt> what if like from it being a </garnt>
<connor> hypothetical question to </connor>
<connor> what needs to happen to be able to bring </connor>
<garnt> an annie tuber </garnt>
<garnt> to japan as a job yeah right right right </garnt>
<connor> and so that started </connor>
<garnt> my whole process when did you when did </garnt>
<connor> you hear about it uh yeah i think it was </connor>
<connor> it must have been around march february </connor>
<connor> i'm not 100 sure i </connor>
<connor> i think i was i think i was on call with </connor>
<joey> maylene i think maylene brought it up to </joey>
<joey> me </joey>
<joey> and and was basically the same thing </joey>
<garnt> where it's like the </garnt>
<joey> hypothetical do you like japan or </joey>
<joey> something like that right and i think i </joey>
<joey> was just like </joey>
<garnt> oh wait or maybe i was in japan at the </garnt>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> it was something right a thing where it </garnt>
<garnt> was like not concrete and it was like </garnt>
<garnt> hey think about it you know like if you </garnt>
<connor> want to do it </connor>
<connor> and then i think uh two or three months </connor>
<connor> later it became a bit more serious of </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> okay do you want to do it i think was </garnt>
<garnt> that similar thing to you yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly </garnt>
<connor> you know i think we had time to think </connor>
<garnt> about it and then seriously they asked </garnt>
<garnt> us </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and it went from the it went from a </garnt>
<garnt> hypothetical to oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh this is actually happening i'm </garnt>
<garnt> i'm moving to japan </garnt>
<connor> and this because yeah i don't think i've </connor>
<connor> spoke to you about </connor>
<connor> your thoughts on it i maybe i might have </connor>
<garnt> at the time but i can't remember but </garnt>
<garnt> were you like </garnt>
<garnt> from the first time you got heard or you </garnt>
<connor> were given the offer </connor>
<connor> were you gonna take it or yeah i think i </connor>
<garnt> was i think i was always </garnt>
<garnt> going to take it i think because i had </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to move to japan for a while even </garnt>
<garnt> if it was </garnt>
<garnt> for a little bit yeah i hadn't really </garnt>
<garnt> put much thought into how long i wanted </garnt>
<joey> to stay here but i was thinking </joey>
<joey> hey you're going to get this chance yes </joey>
<joey> once in your life i want to i want to </joey>
<joey> like if i hated it then i would great at </joey>
<garnt> least at least i've done it right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um but i was i was pretty concrete </garnt>
<garnt> when i got the offer yeah that you're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna take it i was gonna take it i was </garnt>
<garnt> what i was more worried about was how it </garnt>
<garnt> was actually </garnt>
<garnt> going to happen or how what the process </garnt>
<connor> yeah i think there's a lot of stuff like </connor>
<connor> that where </connor>
<garnt> i guess because we'd only interacted </garnt>
<garnt> with book walker through maylene yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> was </garnt>
<garnt> i think maybe we were a bit like </garnt>
<joey> skeptical about what goes on in the back </joey>
<joey> end right </joey>
<joey> like i don't know what's happening right </joey>
<garnt> yeah um but they're great by the way </garnt>
<garnt> uh the two characters very nice and </garnt>
<connor> melee will kill me if i say i don't know </connor>
<garnt> but it's against their contract um </garnt>
<connor> but i think the huge like advantage for </connor>
<connor> at least youtube was the fact that and i </connor>
<connor> know a lot of people who don't do this </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> definitely should is that you guys </connor>
<connor> visited japan </connor>
<connor> enough times yeah to like yeah </connor>
<connor> well i mean i i was there for a while i </connor>
<connor> mean yeah but </connor>
<connor> like i know a lot of stories of like </connor>
<garnt> people who move here </garnt>
<garnt> just like thinking like oh japan is this </garnt>
<garnt> like a wonderful place yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> like nothing could go wrong and </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's so friendly and then they </garnt>
<joey> move here </joey>
<joey> and their expectations are just </joey>
<joey> completely </joey>
<connor> rejected yeah there's a lot of stuff </connor>
<connor> that's different between </connor>
<connor> moving here and living visiting and </connor>
<connor> moving here which we can get into later </connor>
<garnt> yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> for me i think it goes back to the </garnt>
<garnt> mentality of i never felt like moving </garnt>
<garnt> here or i never thought i would you know </garnt>
<garnt> want to move here </garnt>
<garnt> um because of the fact that i liked </garnt>
<garnt> anime you know i think i think that's </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest thing </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to move to japan just purely </garnt>
<garnt> for anime you're gonna have a basketball </garnt>
<garnt> play the weeaboo dream yeah it's like </garnt>
<joey> it's it's not it's not real </joey>
<connor> like honestly there's probably worse </connor>
<connor> reasons but it's pretty what </connor>
<garnt> like for me in terms of my exposure to </garnt>
<garnt> anime it hasn't actually increased too </garnt>
<garnt> much </garnt>
<garnt> compared to when i was living in </garnt>
<connor> thailand because there is like a massive </connor>
<connor> anime fandom in thailand and just like </connor>
<connor> asia in general </connor>
<connor> yeah so unlike like there was there's a </connor>
<garnt> big difference between like </garnt>
<garnt> like say england to japan but from </garnt>
<garnt> thailand to japan i still have to watch </garnt>
<garnt> anime online sub because i can't watch </garnt>
<garnt> you can't watch it on tv because i don't </garnt>
<connor> understand </connor>
<connor> it yet even if you did the schedule of </connor>
<connor> airing is so </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm not going to stay up till 3am </joey>
<joey> like it's just not worth it exactly it </joey>
<joey> kind of reminds me like old cartoon </joey>
<garnt> broadcast schedule right like yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> just all over the place </connor>
<garnt> constantly like it's weird yeah anyway i </garnt>
<garnt> think when i was presented with the </garnt>
<garnt> offer i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't initially i wasn't that keen on </garnt>
<connor> it mainly because i </connor>
<connor> i didn't really know anything and i i </connor>
<connor> you know when someone's like hey you </connor>
<connor> want to come here </connor>
<connor> to this country it's like okay i mean </connor>
<joey> japan's cool but i literally </joey>
<joey> don't yeah i literally don't know </joey>
<garnt> anything yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> i think over time i just especially when </garnt>
<garnt> i found out that you were gonna go 100 </garnt>
<garnt> i think that was like all right well at </garnt>
<garnt> least i have you know my boys here </garnt>
<garnt> so if i do get lonely i'll be good yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> but i mean you know meeting friends </garnt>
<joey> wasn't a problem anyway but </joey>
<joey> i think it is scary though it is part of </joey>
<joey> it yeah i think that </joey>
<connor> i'll go into later with like what i </connor>
<connor> think is important yeah you move here </connor>
<connor> and then just got to the point where i </connor>
<connor> had nothing better going on and people </connor>
<garnt> gave me so much [ __ ] for saying that in </garnt>
<garnt> my video by the way i got oh really yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i literally said in my video i said uh i </garnt>
<garnt> said nothing better going on that's why </garnt>
<garnt> i moved here and people think that like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm being like nonchalant or joking like </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't like when you're a youtuber you </garnt>
<garnt> don't have anything to do </garnt>
<garnt> other than youtube and hang out with </garnt>
<connor> your friends and do whatever you need to </connor>
<connor> do to be happy but yeah </connor>
<connor> i literally had nothing better going on </connor>
<connor> so i'm like in my head </connor>
<connor> there's no reason why i wouldn't take </connor>
<connor> this because it gives me a purpose to </connor>
<connor> you know just better myself as a person </connor>
<connor> i get to learn new things get to meet </connor>
<joey> new people i mean that's a huge reason </joey>
<joey> why i moved as well is because like in </joey>
<connor> australia </connor>
<connor> like you know what are you doing right </connor>
<garnt> it's like like you know </garnt>
<garnt> i had like great friends you know from </garnt>
<garnt> uni </garnt>
<garnt> and high school who i would hang out </garnt>
<connor> with every now and then right yeah and </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> you know i had places to go to yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> exciting anymore for me like it was just </garnt>
<garnt> routine yeah and like totally i hate </garnt>
<garnt> getting into a routine with </garnt>
<garnt> anything right so i was like yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> you know i haven't like yes i've spent </garnt>
<garnt> half my life here </garnt>
<garnt> technically but i haven't really like </garnt>
<garnt> gone out to like fully support the </garnt>
<garnt> country and even </garnt>
<connor> four years later i'm nowhere near close </connor>
<connor> to exploring this place yeah like there </connor>
<garnt> are so many more places i want to go to </garnt>
<connor> i still haven't left tokyo it's been </connor>
<connor> like eight months like i haven't left </connor>
<garnt> tokyo </garnt>
<joey> that road trip that we planned all right </joey>
<joey> once once the roanoke is gone it's </joey>
<joey> happening okay </joey>
<garnt> i've i've left tokyo once yeah </garnt>
<joey> the the decision to move to japan </joey>
<garnt> funnily enough was probably the easiest </garnt>
<garnt> part of the process </garnt>
<garnt> really oh yeah okay well first of all i </garnt>
<connor> mean you're very lucky </connor>
<garnt> yeah you know if if you're half japanese </garnt>
<garnt> and have a japanese passport </garnt>
<joey> it's gonna be easy to move here </joey>
<joey> for anyone else who's thinking about </joey>
<joey> moving to japan </joey>
<garnt> uh whatever visa you're thinking about </garnt>
<garnt> coming on </garnt>
<garnt> it is going to be a tower yeah it's it's </garnt>
<connor> and this year </connor>
<connor> or this year from oh sorry from april uh </connor>
<connor> this year i believe they changed the </connor>
<connor> rules to make </connor>
<connor> visas more uh easy or easier to get </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> they need more immigrants to work here </connor>
<connor> because the population's getting older </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and they allocated 40 000 worker permits </connor>
<connor> and in the article </connor>
<joey> they only managed to allocate 4 000 this </joey>
<joey> year of the 40 000. what </joey>
<joey> of the yeah wait it's 40 000 like per </joey>
<joey> year uh </joey>
<joey> for some specific kind of uh like visa </joey>
<joey> for this year </joey>
<joey> right right they only managed to do one </joey>
<garnt> tenth of that </garnt>
<garnt> which is like not a problem because i </garnt>
<connor> don't think there's like and </connor>
<connor> like there's not demand to move here </connor>
<connor> yeah probably one of the countries that </connor>
<garnt> i think people have most interested in </garnt>
<garnt> moving to out of a lot of places right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just i think that that if </garnt>
<garnt> anything says a lot about how </garnt>
<garnt> difficult it is to move here yeah </garnt>
<connor> exactly i mean i can't speak on any </connor>
<garnt> other visa processes but </garnt>
<garnt> you know everyone i've talked to has had </garnt>
<garnt> like a difficult process unless you're </garnt>
<connor> just coming here for a tourist visa </connor>
<garnt> super easy it's super easy </garnt>
<garnt> or if you're one of those countries that </garnt>
<joey> has working holiday visas yeah which </joey>
<garnt> unfortunately uh america does not </garnt>
<garnt> so sorry like like if you want advice on </garnt>
<garnt> how to move here easily get a working </garnt>
<joey> holiday visa yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> probably gonna be i think those last uh </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like a year and a half </garnt>
<garnt> yeah year and a half i think it depends </garnt>
<garnt> on the country at least australians have </garnt>
<garnt> a year and a half wow right i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> about you </garnt>
<joey> maybe uk has like six months to a year </joey>
<connor> maybe </connor>
<connor> depends but yeah a lot of paperwork it </connor>
<garnt> fell out yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think the hardest part of the process </garnt>
<garnt> was finding an apartment oh my god oh my </garnt>
<joey> god </joey>
<joey> i mean i'm a japanese citizen and it was </joey>
<connor> still a pain in the ass </connor>
<connor> you hear about on youtube and twitter </connor>
<connor> and everything like it's hard it's hard </connor>
<connor> and then you see some people saying like </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> people are exaggerating it is it is 100 </garnt>
<garnt> percent </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] difficult especially if you're a </garnt>
<garnt> foreigner as well uh </garnt>
<garnt> you basically play under different rules </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's sad to say like i </garnt>
<connor> i you know in the uk i think if you have </connor>
<connor> money you get an apartment i think more </connor>
<joey> importantly especially if you're a </joey>
<connor> youtuber </connor>
<connor> oh my god oh what because the the the </connor>
<connor> hardest thing </connor>
<connor> at least in japan from my experience </connor>
<garnt> about why it's so hard to get </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] apartment here is because </connor>
<connor> freelancing is not a job here yeah </connor>
<connor> freelancing you might as well be </connor>
<joey> unemployed according to this </joey>
<garnt> government's like </garnt>
<garnt> the government's like that typical asian </garnt>
<garnt> parent yeah it's like what you're not a </garnt>
<garnt> doctor or an engineer or a lawyer </garnt>
<joey> it's like you're out of here you're </joey>
<joey> unemployed right yeah you're working </joey>
<connor> part-time </connor>
<connor> and that's due to because they're </connor>
<connor> worried about if you can pay all the </connor>
<joey> rent and what </joey>
<joey> yeah right but the thing is is that they </joey>
<joey> don't even like </joey>
<joey> you know at least in like i don't know </joey>
<joey> about the uk or thailand but at least in </joey>
<joey> australia </joey>
<joey> you when you sign up for like an </joey>
<joey> apartment right usually the landlord </joey>
<joey> will be like okay can i see your bank </joey>
<joey> account </joey>
<joey> yeah like just to see how much money you </joey>
<joey> have saved up you know regardless of </joey>
<joey> what job you do </joey>
<joey> we just want to see that you have you </joey>
<joey> know money in the bank and if you do </joey>
<joey> then you're like okay </joey>
<joey> but here in japan they don't check your </joey>
<joey> bank they check </joey>
<joey> your work status to make sure that </joey>
<joey> there's like a constant flow of money </joey>
<garnt> coming yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's not just that as well because </garnt>
<garnt> if you're not japanese </garnt>
<connor> and especially if you can't speak </connor>
<connor> japanese most places aren't even going </connor>
<connor> to talk to you or consider you because </connor>
<connor> that was a big problem we had </connor>
<connor> because we went through like an agency </connor>
<connor> and we just </connor>
<connor> made a list of about 10 to 20 apartments </connor>
<connor> that we were interested in um and we </connor>
<garnt> sent it off and applied </garnt>
<connor> for reject rejected from all of them </connor>
<connor> jesus christ and we had a company as a </connor>
<connor> guarantor </connor>
<connor> yeah like having the like payments </connor>
<connor> secured wasn't the issue it was like </connor>
<garnt> a lot of the time it was really dumb </garnt>
<garnt> stuff like yeah can you sort the bins </garnt>
<connor> properly and like stuff like that </connor>
<garnt> yes we're not 12 year old it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> like the main concern you'll hear all </connor>
<connor> the time is can you sort your trash </connor>
<connor> properly and it's like okay it might be </connor>
<connor> different from where i'm from but like </connor>
<connor> i can learn yeah it's like like the the </connor>
<connor> government councils in the area give you </connor>
<joey> an english manual that tells you how to </joey>
<joey> do it like it is tedious and it is a lot </joey>
<joey> more complex in most places but </joey>
<joey> it's not like it's not rocket science </joey>
<joey> yeah it's not like you're having to do </joey>
<connor> like the weirdest stuff imaginable to </connor>
<connor> this stuff like it's basically just </connor>
<connor> rinse your stuff separate all of it </connor>
<connor> that's pretty much it </connor>
<connor> and i know there's some places uh in in </connor>
<joey> europe that do way more thorough that </joey>
<joey> probably don't have this concern when </joey>
<connor> they're </connor>
<connor> letting people yeah right houses it's </connor>
<connor> just like because it's the least of your </connor>
<joey> concerns it's </joey>
<joey> you know yeah it's ridiculous yeah and </joey>
<garnt> the thing is </garnt>
<garnt> that if you'd go through an agency for </garnt>
<joey> example that specializes in foreigners </joey>
<joey> and people who can't speak japanese </joey>
<joey> you're going to be paying so much for </joey>
<joey> that ability to pay like a premium </joey>
<joey> for that bill and that rent so it's </joey>
<joey> you you either have a [ __ ] difficult </joey>
<garnt> time finding a place </garnt>
<garnt> and getting past all the barriers or </garnt>
<garnt> you're just gonna pay a [ __ ] ton of </garnt>
<garnt> money </garnt>
<garnt> and those aren't two very good options </garnt>
<connor> the the only concern that they often </connor>
<connor> cite like building managers etc </connor>
<connor> that i find is like somewhat all right </connor>
<connor> that's fair enough is that they're </connor>
<connor> worried that you'll run away </connor>
<connor> yeah but run away and not pay the rent </connor>
<connor> but if you have a guarantor </connor>
<connor> that's the whole [ __ ] point of that </connor>
<connor> problem which you can't run away you </connor>
<connor> if we run away you're still getting your </connor>
<connor> money like yeah and the house is vacant </connor>
<connor> great no damage to it like this is a </connor>
<connor> win-win for the company i don't </connor>
<connor> understand like we do </connor>
<connor> you play by their rules it's because </connor>
<joey> it's just like typical </joey>
<connor> like this is like one aspect of like </connor>
<connor> japanese </connor>
<connor> it's definitely one of the worst culture </connor>
<connor> that i learned very quickly it's that </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter what the business is </connor>
<connor> if they're not </connor>
<connor> 100 million sure that this is going to </connor>
<connor> go through </connor>
<connor> yeah it might as well no risk they don't </connor>
<connor> do risk </connor>
<connor> in any business venture whether that be </connor>
<garnt> paying for rent or like </garnt>
<garnt> anything it's like if they're not 100 </garnt>
<garnt> million </garnt>
<connor> sure in every possible avenue ever yeah </connor>
<joey> it's just not happening and </joey>
<connor> you know you know that's ridiculous i </connor>
<connor> think that'd be interesting to talk </connor>
<garnt> about later on when we get to more of </garnt>
<garnt> like the stuff that we've </garnt>
<garnt> experienced here yeah um but like was </garnt>
<garnt> there any part of the visa process </garnt>
<garnt> applying for i'm sure people are </garnt>
<garnt> wondering i got a lot of emails i'm sure </garnt>
<garnt> you did as well </garnt>
<garnt> people asking hey how did you get a visa </garnt>
<garnt> like was it hard </garnt>
<garnt> etc etc yeah if there's any advice you </garnt>
<garnt> can give someone who's watching who </garnt>
<connor> wants to come japan what would you say </connor>
<connor> is like the main piece of advice </connor>
<garnt> if they want to get a working visa um i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i didn't apply for a working visa </garnt>
<connor> yeah but uh so i don't have too much </connor>
<connor> experience we didn't apply for it we had </connor>
<connor> immigration lawyers help us yeah we had </connor>
<garnt> immigration lawyers help us but </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i've applied for visas before and </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the worst the most painful part is </garnt>
<joey> just waiting </joey>
<joey> it's it's you're gonna be waiting a lot </joey>
<connor> you're gonna be waiting a long time and </connor>
<connor> you're just gonna be in this limbo </connor>
<connor> limbo kind of because we had what it was </connor>
<connor> like the initial thing where they filed </connor>
<connor> for something called a certificate of </connor>
<connor> eligibility </connor>
<connor> which is basically if the government </connor>
<connor> decides if you can have a visa </connor>
<connor> which isn't the visa itself which </connor>
<joey> already sounds to me like that sounds </joey>
<joey> like we're adding steps </joey>
<joey> where steps don't need to be but as you </joey>
<joey> move to japan you'll learn that's what </joey>
<joey> they love to do </joey>
<joey> so yeah we had to wait what was it six </joey>
<joey> weeks for that six to eight weeks yeah </joey>
<joey> it could have been six to eight weeks </joey>
<joey> for this piece of paper to arrive which </joey>
<joey> then they send by post which </joey>
<joey> makes you feel so uneasy because you're </joey>
<joey> like they're sending me a piece of paper </joey>
<joey> through the mail </joey>
<joey> that i've waited two months for and </joey>
<garnt> you're just like something's gonna go </garnt>
<garnt> wrong </garnt>
<garnt> someone's gonna take it so you get you </garnt>
<garnt> get this piece of paper right um </garnt>
<garnt> to get this this thing you need to prove </garnt>
<garnt> that you have a good reason to work in </garnt>
<garnt> japan that you're the job or </garnt>
<garnt> you know because you have to say what </garnt>
<garnt> your work is yeah they need to check </garnt>
<connor> that you </connor>
<garnt> are actually like in that field et </garnt>
<connor> cetera et cetera we had to </connor>
<garnt> send so much evidence yeah that </garnt>
<connor> we were we were doing valuable work that </connor>
<connor> could </connor>
<connor> which i'm sure some people would argue </connor>
<connor> youtube isn't but you know </connor>
<connor> yeah at the end of the day if we bring </connor>
<connor> in money to the government and pay taxes </connor>
<garnt> it's valuable work right yeah but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> basically just </garnt>
<garnt> how many companies we've worked with </garnt>
<garnt> what's work </garnt>
<connor> that's notable that you know that that </connor>
<connor> and then why we need to be in japan </connor>
<garnt> what it felt like was i was applying for </garnt>
<connor> a job yeah yeah you know </connor>
<garnt> it was like here's here's all my </garnt>
<garnt> achievements here's what i can bring for </garnt>
<garnt> your country </garnt>
<connor> please please let me play on your team </connor>
<garnt> coach </garnt>
<connor> and then yeah so we get that certificate </connor>
<connor> of eligibility yeah which </connor>
<connor> is we get that and then you have to go </connor>
<garnt> to the </garnt>
<garnt> embassy so you turn that into a visa and </garnt>
<connor> then they'll put uh </connor>
<connor> yeah again there's more steps because </connor>
<connor> first of all if you live in the uk </connor>
<connor> uh the only embassy is in london now i </connor>
<connor> felt i would feel bad for someone who </connor>
<connor> lives in like in the north of scotland </connor>
<connor> i don't think they have an embassy in </connor>
<connor> scotland no no and in wales i had to go </connor>
<garnt> all the way from wales that i mean </garnt>
<garnt> luckily this </garnt>
<garnt> fast train doesn't matter yeah point is </garnt>
<garnt> one embassy so you're going to be taking </garnt>
<garnt> a day trip to get this thing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah worst part is is that then if you </garnt>
<garnt> go to the embassy which you might have </garnt>
<garnt> have to have traveled cross-country for </garnt>
<joey> you have to wait five days </joey>
<joey> to then actually get the visa which is a </joey>
<joey> little thing that is print out and </joey>
<joey> staple in your passport so you have to </joey>
<joey> go back </joey>
<joey> the embassy you have to go back right so </joey>
<garnt> i i just went home because i'm like i'm </garnt>
<connor> not staying in london for five days yeah </connor>
<garnt> like if you're if you're poor you know </garnt>
<joey> you haven't got much money and you can't </joey>
<joey> you know the train tickets in the uk are </joey>
<joey> expensive right like </joey>
<connor> there's a lot of things where it's just </connor>
<joey> like my god why are we doing this but </joey>
<joey> then again like realistically how many </joey>
<joey> people in like the [ __ ] middle of </joey>
<connor> scotland is going i'm sure there's </connor>
<connor> i'm sure i bet there's one person from </connor>
<connor> like like the north island and like </connor>
<connor> scotland is like dude i had to fly </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] that [ __ ] if you want that one </joey>
<joey> person watching subscribe </joey>
<connor> and and to make matters even more um </connor>
<joey> stressful you lost your past ideas </joey>
<joey> this motherf we were meeting up at the </joey>
<garnt> embassy to collect our visas yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and this [ __ ] lost my </garnt>
<joey> perspective i just heard that story </joey>
<connor> i couldn't [ __ ] believe oh my god </connor>
<connor> that was like one of the worst days like </connor>
<joey> you can't </joey>
<connor> write that [ __ ] it was like it was </connor>
<joey> horrible all because you didn't have a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] backpack </connor>
<connor> i i carry my passport in my jeans pocket </connor>
<connor> which i'm hearing people </connor>
<connor> like oh my god </connor>
<connor> i'm like cringing hearing that man i'm </connor>
<connor> like so okay i've traveled like </connor>
<connor> all over the world just having my my </connor>
<connor> passport in my okay i have lost it </connor>
<connor> before and you guys know i have </connor>
<garnt> i lost it in america as well i found it </garnt>
<garnt> though luckily but anyway so i was going </garnt>
<garnt> to the train station to pick up </garnt>
<garnt> you know go to the train go to london </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and as my train arrived </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like i always tap my pockets right </garnt>
<garnt> to make sure it's there i tap my pockets </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's not in there it's not in there </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like [ __ ] and what's running through </garnt>
<garnt> my head is like </garnt>
<garnt> all of this like months of work i feel </garnt>
<garnt> bad for the company they paid for </garnt>
<connor> lawyers like </connor>
<garnt> all these people who have like banked on </garnt>
<garnt> me coming and i've put </garnt>
<garnt> so much work into this myself and other </garnt>
<connor> people yeah also having a mental </connor>
<connor> breakdown i don't think i've ever like </connor>
<connor> had that much of a like </connor>
<connor> quick mental breakdown in my life yeah </connor>
<joey> and </joey>
<connor> it's to be expected and it was like </connor>
<garnt> gradually getting worse and like the </garnt>
<garnt> hour i couldn't find it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i scoured this train station a tiny </garnt>
<connor> train station in wales it's called like </connor>
<connor> flint it's you can look it up on </connor>
<connor> it's literally just like a platform </connor>
<connor> right there's nowhere this should have </connor>
<connor> gone where i couldn't have found it </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> could not find it check my car quickly </connor>
<connor> drove home to find it didn't find it </connor>
<joey> came back to check again </joey>
<joey> couldn't find it going to the police </joey>
<joey> station literally everything i could not </joey>
<joey> find you have no idea </joey>
<joey> what happened i have no idea what have </joey>
<joey> my passport and then eventually it was </joey>
<joey> getting like </joey>
<joey> 3 4 p.m and i was like okay i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> just call up the </joey>
<joey> the british government and tell them hey </joey>
<joey> can you cancel my passport i want to </joey>
<joey> apply for another one </joey>
<joey> and that whole thing was an ordeal and </joey>
<joey> then my main concern was like all right </joey>
<joey> well i lost my passport </joey>
<joey> do i have to restart the whole visa </joey>
<joey> process again yeah luckily the embassy </joey>
<joey> were like no as long as you have like </joey>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> certificate which i didn't lose great i </connor>
<connor> could </connor>
<connor> redo it so i had to scramble to get a </connor>
<connor> new passport and that was the whole </connor>
<connor> thing and i got one within like five </connor>
<connor> days luckily and </connor>
<connor> luckily it all went well but like it was </connor>
<connor> just so stressful </connor>
<connor> on top of like already the stress that i </connor>
<connor> was already at my limit with stress </connor>
<connor> that whole period because of this whole </connor>
<connor> thing yeah and that was just like the </connor>
<connor> full like i had a full breakdown that </connor>
<garnt> day that was horrible and i think i like </garnt>
<garnt> joked about it on twitter but like i was </garnt>
<garnt> like not okay that day </garnt>
<garnt> oh no no no and the worst part is right </garnt>
<garnt> it's when you [ __ ] up this badly </garnt>
<garnt> you can accept that you [ __ ] up but </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's messaging your friends being </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> hey i'm not gonna be in london in like </garnt>
<connor> in like two hours they're like oh </connor>
<connor> why what's up i'm like i lost my </connor>
<garnt> passport </garnt>
<connor> no because i remember reading that text </connor>
<connor> because i was waiting for you outside </connor>
<connor> the embassy </connor>
<connor> when uh when when you're like uh i get a </connor>
<connor> message from connor being like i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> be a bit like 30 minutes late little did </connor>
<connor> i know i was like oh all right all right </connor>
<connor> i'll get a coffee and i i i see the </connor>
<garnt> event unfold as he's just texting me </garnt>
<garnt> so he goes yeah i i can't find my </garnt>
<garnt> passport i'm just gonna </garnt>
<garnt> go uh look for it quickly and then it </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just you like just breaking </garnt>
<garnt> down </garnt>
<garnt> every message and it just ends with </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't i don't think i can come </garnt>
<connor> and i'm still annoyed to this day </connor>
<connor> because i went around this is a very </connor>
<connor> small town where i lost it i went around </connor>
<connor> like every shop in that area </connor>
<connor> i had literally everyone in that area </connor>
<connor> hey if you find this passport </connor>
<connor> can you call me right away because if </connor>
<connor> not i'm gonna just cancel it today </connor>
<connor> i still never heard anything yeah i like </connor>
<connor> i was crazy and i </connor>
<garnt> don't know how i lost it so like from </garnt>
<garnt> your experience yeah to </garnt>
<garnt> for anyone who's listening if there's </garnt>
<garnt> anything that you need to know to make </garnt>
<garnt> the process </garnt>
<connor> easier what would you guys say get a </connor>
<connor> degree yeah degree helps a lot </connor>
<joey> especially if it's you know like not an </joey>
<joey> associates like like like a bachelor's </joey>
<connor> degree </connor>
<connor> yeah i think a lot of their forms didn't </connor>
<connor> recognize associates i think it actually </connor>
<joey> said like specified like but </joey>
<joey> i think associates is a thing in japan </joey>
<connor> it's not a thing in the uk i don't think </connor>
<connor> yeah it's not the same </connor>
<garnt> in japan right i mean it is a thing but </garnt>
<garnt> like it's not like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah as heavily emphasized on as a </garnt>
<connor> bachelor's degree </connor>
<connor> yeah i and i i saw a lot of people </connor>
<connor> asking like oh how did we get it etc </connor>
<connor> like you you need to like have </connor>
<garnt> especially with a country this strict </garnt>
<garnt> you need to have like concrete proof </garnt>
<garnt> that like you can do something here like </garnt>
<garnt> you can't just come here on a whim </garnt>
<garnt> that you're worth unless unless you're </garnt>
<garnt> like extremely extremely rich and they </garnt>
<joey> want your tax money like i think that </joey>
<joey> the only other reason like you need </joey>
<joey> something like </joey>
<joey> even then you need a degree yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> they'll find a way to because </joey>
<joey> they'll be like where are you getting </joey>
<joey> this money from yeah and i imagine just </joey>
<joey> having like </joey>
<joey> a a fair amount of experience in what </joey>
<garnt> you're doing and the reason you're </garnt>
<garnt> coming here will help you </garnt>
<connor> uh i mean i can't talk about most just </connor>
<garnt> what we went through or basically just </garnt>
<garnt> come here to teach english </garnt>
<connor> that is like the instant like get in </connor>
<joey> button yeah pretty much </joey>
<joey> i can speak english and i can teach it </joey>
<connor> to someone they feel like </connor>
<connor> it's probably like not a bad way to if </connor>
<connor> you if your goal ultimately is </connor>
<connor> living in japan forever it's probably </connor>
<connor> not a bad way to like transition into </connor>
<joey> living here </joey>
<connor> because i know i know a lot of friends </connor>
<garnt> personally who did start </garnt>
<joey> with teaching english and then gradually </joey>
<joey> moved on to something else cause like </joey>
<garnt> you can gain </garnt>
<garnt> by teaching english english you can gain </garnt>
<garnt> connections in the country yeah and then </garnt>
<joey> maybe </joey>
<joey> that transitions to an like a normal </joey>
<joey> office job or something like that </joey>
<connor> working with the company you know but if </connor>
<connor> you just want to get your foot through </connor>
<connor> the door i'm teaching english would be </connor>
<garnt> the easiest way </garnt>
<garnt> for anyone to be able to do it but you </garnt>
<connor> still need a degree </connor>
<connor> yeah either way you need a degree but </connor>
<connor> they pretty much accept everyone on that </connor>
<connor> as far as i'm aware </connor>
<connor> again if you have a degree yeah it </connor>
<joey> doesn't matter how good your high school </joey>
<joey> essays were if you don't have a degree </joey>
<connor> in in that like yeah which is why i'm so </connor>
<connor> glad to drop out of university </connor>
<garnt> listen to your asian parents go to uni </garnt>
<joey> if you want to go to youtube </joey>
<connor> degrees right yeah yeah okay engineering </connor>
<connor> baby let's go oh really yeah engineering </connor>
<joey> i never actually have known what you're </joey>
<joey> you have an engineering degree i haven't </joey>
<connor> yeah he has electrical engineering i </connor>
<connor> have mechanical engineering </connor>
<joey> oh wow but he's a masters i have a </joey>
<garnt> bachelor's i've got a [ __ ] masters </garnt>
<joey> model </joey>
<joey> look at this boy spending more than four </joey>
<garnt> years at uni </garnt>
<connor> i i got to the third year i was like i </connor>
<connor> can't do it anymore i can't i can't do </connor>
<joey> this yeah i was like </joey>
<joey> have i got the required minimum yeah get </joey>
<joey> me out of here </joey>
<garnt> i don't want to be here for another year </garnt>
<garnt> dude so like now that you guys moved to </garnt>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<garnt> what would you say are the pros and cons </garnt>
<garnt> of actually living here </garnt>
<joey> i mean i want i want to know from you </joey>
<connor> guys right because i mean i've </connor>
<connor> experienced </connor>
<connor> japan pretty much for half my life so </connor>
<connor> i'm not like </connor>
<connor> to me the pros and cons are just very </connor>
<connor> natural to me and i feel like you </connor>
<connor> the most of the cons that we might me </connor>
<garnt> and god might have </garnt>
<garnt> you won't ever experience because one </garnt>
<garnt> you can speak the language and read it </garnt>
<connor> fluently </connor>
<garnt> yeah and i don't know man there's some </garnt>
<garnt> though that's the face of a foreign </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm just gonna say it there's a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of discrimination here </garnt>
<garnt> but i mean what country does i would say </garnt>
<garnt> i like understand it more because </garnt>
<garnt> growing up </garnt>
<garnt> in and like in an asian country there's </garnt>
<garnt> definitely discrimination in asia </garnt>
<garnt> it's just very different from what you </garnt>
<joey> see in the west i think </joey>
<garnt> that's the thing it's not racism it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's more xenophobia yeah yeah right and </garnt>
<garnt> if you guys don't know the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between that </garnt>
<garnt> like racism is where it's like oh you're </garnt>
<garnt> a different race to me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so therefore you are worse than me </garnt>
<garnt> and xenophobia is like oh you're not </garnt>
<joey> from </joey>
<garnt> here yeah therefore you're i think he </garnt>
<garnt> comes because </garnt>
<connor> i think it comes more from a place of </connor>
<connor> ignorance </connor>
<garnt> because it's just you know because you </garnt>
<garnt> guys didn't open the country </garnt>
<joey> i mean japan has been a closed island </joey>
<joey> for like the past two thousand exactly </joey>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> what do you expect exactly um so it it </garnt>
<garnt> like it makes sense to me um but like </garnt>
<garnt> for example finding finding an apartment </garnt>
<garnt> that was my first experience </garnt>
<garnt> with that where if you didn't if you </garnt>
<garnt> want if you're not japanese and </garnt>
<garnt> if you didn't speak japanese then they </garnt>
<garnt> were very </garnt>
<garnt> like scared to even touch you you know </garnt>
<garnt> consider you or even like or in that </garnt>
<connor> case </connor>
<connor> especially when you have a company </connor>
<garnt> backing you in my mind i was like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't see what the problem is here like </garnt>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> i'm like the model tenant here i'm </connor>
<joey> single i don't know </joey>
<joey> we can't write your name in kanji yeah </joey>
<connor> right that's the problem </connor>
<connor> katakana name ew gross but i mean i have </connor>
<garnt> that problem too because like </garnt>
<garnt> even though i am japanese and you have a </garnt>
<garnt> japanese name </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the fact that i don't look it is </garnt>
<garnt> already a huge like wall that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah regular japanese people find a </garnt>
<garnt> difficulty in getting over because like </garnt>
<garnt> it's really funny as well because like </garnt>
<garnt> during my intern days as well like i had </garnt>
<garnt> to be like the guy to like if there was </garnt>
<garnt> like a business partner coming to the </garnt>
<garnt> office </garnt>
<garnt> i had to be the one to like get on the </garnt>
<garnt> phone with them and being like okay </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna you guys are coming at this </garnt>
<garnt> time in this day okay i'll come down </garnt>
<garnt> to like meet you guys and greet you up </garnt>
<garnt> to the office yeah but when i speak </garnt>
<garnt> japanese i don't have an accent </garnt>
<garnt> and my name is japanese so there were so </garnt>
<garnt> many times where i would go down to </garnt>
<connor> greet them </connor>
<connor> and they'd be like who the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> are you the you're not the person on the </garnt>
<connor> phone ryan i was like yeah </connor>
<garnt> i am it's like oh oh we thought you were </garnt>
<connor> japanese and i'm like </connor>
<garnt> i am japanese and they're like and </garnt>
<garnt> it's just so so many of like the older </garnt>
<garnt> generation especially they just </garnt>
<joey> can't fathom that there are these things </joey>
<joey> called </joey>
<joey> hafuz yeah it's just not a thing it's </joey>
<joey> like you're either japanese or you're </joey>
<garnt> not japanese </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah because the way i treat is </garnt>
<garnt> treat it is that </garnt>
<garnt> i i treat it like exactly the same how i </garnt>
<garnt> would treat </garnt>
<garnt> my grandmother or like my grand my </garnt>
<garnt> grandad who </garnt>
<garnt> lived in thailand in this in the small </garnt>
<garnt> village their entire [ __ ] life knew </garnt>
<garnt> nothing about the </garnt>
<garnt> outside world so they just they just </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> you know yeah it's the same way with a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of japanese people where </garnt>
<garnt> some of them especially like older </garnt>
<garnt> people have never interacted with a </garnt>
<garnt> foreigner or </garnt>
<garnt> or even like got to know them or even </garnt>
<garnt> knows what's what the outside world is </garnt>
<garnt> like beyond what they see on the news </garnt>
<garnt> and what they see on tv you know what i </garnt>
<joey> mean </joey>
<joey> and you don't want to like import </joey>
<garnt> anything from japanese tv </garnt>
<garnt> no no like you don't oh my god some of </garnt>
<connor> the stuff they are it's like we're </connor>
<connor> called trash taste podcasts like if </connor>
<connor> there's anything trashier than trash </connor>
<connor> taste podcast </connor>
<joey> it is [ __ ] japanese tv it is full of </joey>
<connor> absolute </connor>
<connor> garbage yeah it's it's something i wish </connor>
<garnt> that like a lot of youtubers </garnt>
<garnt> whose channel is focused all about japan </garnt>
<garnt> would like </garnt>
<garnt> look speak about a little more because </garnt>
<garnt> it's not like something you can ignore </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> if you're if you're foreign and or even </garnt>
<garnt> look foreign and live here </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna experience it like totally </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> i i didn't know anything about this </garnt>
<joey> because no youtubers talk about it or </joey>
<garnt> anything yeah i feel like it's such an </garnt>
<joey> important </joey>
<joey> like topic especially when you talk </joey>
<joey> about living in japan </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be a factor like you're gonna </joey>
<connor> be stared at and it's not </connor>
<connor> like like you've said like it's it's not </connor>
<connor> a place of like hatred or anything it's </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> they don't see those kind of people a </connor>
<connor> lot of problem with a lot of like j </connor>
<connor> vloggers that do cover topics like that </connor>
<connor> because i </connor>
<garnt> like when you live here you pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> get to know every j vlogger </garnt>
<garnt> yeah natural it's such a small community </garnt>
<garnt> so i know pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> every like notable job you hear and </garnt>
<connor> there's been a number of them that i </connor>
<garnt> know that have made topics on like </garnt>
<garnt> the blatant xenophobia here in japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah but the problem is </garnt>
<garnt> i think a lot of those videos aren't </garnt>
<garnt> taken seriously by the internet because </garnt>
<garnt> it's seen as like a privileged problem </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's like you get to live in </garnt>
<garnt> japan you know so therefore </garnt>
<garnt> you should just be able to put up with </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] right because you get to </garnt>
<garnt> experience all this other cool stuff </garnt>
<connor> when </connor>
<garnt> you know that's not the point of the </garnt>
<connor> video right like it's still a problem </connor>
<joey> regardless of how privileged you may </joey>
<joey> seem </joey>
<garnt> living here like i think the worst thing </garnt>
<garnt> that happened to me was um </garnt>
<connor> the time one time we got the police </connor>
<garnt> called on us </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah and uh explain why we got the </connor>
<connor> police call </connor>
<connor> we didn't do anything illegal we just </connor>
<joey> played mario party really loud yeah </joey>
<connor> at like two in the morning very drunk </connor>
<connor> that's that that was all bad you know we </connor>
<connor> caught we can't really complain about </connor>
<connor> that okay </connor>
<connor> so basically we got a noise complaint um </connor>
<garnt> so the policeman came </garnt>
<garnt> and he basically asked joey you know um </garnt>
<garnt> who </garnt>
<garnt> who is he with yeah and i remember you </garnt>
<garnt> you saying like oh there's </garnt>
<garnt> you know one american one you know </garnt>
<garnt> british person and then there's </garnt>
<garnt> me who who i'm thai so he mentioned that </garnt>
<joey> i'm i'm with a thai friend </joey>
<joey> and as soon as he mentioned that he was </joey>
<joey> with a thai friend the police was the </joey>
<joey> policeman was like oh </joey>
<joey> can we see your thai friend can we see </joey>
<joey> your thai friend </joey>
<joey> i go up there and i start getting </joey>
<joey> grilled </joey>
<joey> about why i'm here they want to see my </joey>
<joey> passport and everything and they're </joey>
<joey> asking me about my my visa </joey>
<joey> but you show them your british party no </joey>
<joey> no as soon as i </joey>
<joey> as soon i was like oh i have a british </joey>
<joey> passport though they were like </joey>
<joey> okay you're free to go </joey>
<garnt> it was so messed up and i was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] just happened what was </garnt>
<joey> that it was so messed up like </joey>
<joey> and and the fact that they like only </joey>
<joey> called you yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> up there even though there was like a it </joey>
<joey> was like the most </joey>
<joey> multi-like cultural room in probably the </joey>
<garnt> entire apartment building i'm gonna say </garnt>
<garnt> it now i wasn't making the noise </garnt>
<garnt> you weren't like the quietest one there </garnt>
<garnt> if anything and it's just i </garnt>
<garnt> like that was the first time i like ever </garnt>
<joey> experienced that too and i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> jesus christ like they can't even be </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> subtle about no no no yeah and i'm like </garnt>
<joey> you do know </joey>
<joey> like this is like not cool right like </joey>
<joey> but to them it's just yeah you know i </joey>
<connor> think you just </connor>
<connor> i don't know i know i get stared out a </connor>
<connor> lot which is weird for me because </connor>
<garnt> obviously coming from like the widest </garnt>
<garnt> place on earth i was just like another </garnt>
<garnt> you know just another like person and </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i would've never experienced this </garnt>
<garnt> in my life </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um which i guess is also strange </garnt>
<garnt> and also </garnt>
<garnt> like um this goes </garnt>
<garnt> but okay in japan not exactly known for </garnt>
<connor> the best like legal system if you will </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> normally if you're like arrested or </connor>
<connor> whatever or convicted </connor>
<connor> uh charged with a crime you normally get </connor>
<joey> like it's like a 98 99 conviction </joey>
<joey> i don't know where this is going right </joey>
<connor> but also like this is the first time </connor>
<connor> i've ever been like around police where </connor>
<connor> i'm like [ __ ] please don't stop </connor>
<connor> me please don't stop like i </connor>
<connor> i guess this is like conor checking his </connor>
<connor> white privilege for the first time ever </connor>
<connor> but like </connor>
<connor> because i if the police stop me right i </connor>
<connor> can't explain to them </connor>
<connor> why i might like i don't know what i </connor>
<connor> might do that's wrong you know what i </connor>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> i don't want to get [ __ ] arrested </connor>
<connor> because like i get myself out of that </connor>
<connor> hole </connor>
<connor> right and yeah it's just a weird </connor>
<connor> experience for me that i've never felt </connor>
<connor> before and i'm sure people are like wow </connor>
<connor> connor </connor>
<connor> really seeing his white privilege for </connor>
<connor> the first time ever in his life </connor>
<connor> but it's weird it's weird though right </connor>
<connor> because that's like stuff that i never </connor>
<connor> considered i have to like </connor>
<joey> worry about ever right you have to like </joey>
<garnt> kind of experience it </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately like first hand to like </garnt>
<garnt> really understand it right and that's </garnt>
<garnt> the problem is that there are so many </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i guess you know controversial topics </garnt>
<garnt> like that concerning being a foreigner </garnt>
<garnt> living in japan that </garnt>
<garnt> i'm sure a lot of jvloggers want to talk </garnt>
<garnt> about but because </garnt>
<joey> from the position that they're talking </joey>
<joey> about it from it's very difficult to </joey>
<joey> make it </joey>
<connor> bring it up like oh they hate chinese </connor>
<joey> people right because because it's like </joey>
<garnt> it's also like for someone who's the for </garnt>
<garnt> a foreigner who's never lived in japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's very hard to like </garnt>
<garnt> swallow and understand being like no </garnt>
<garnt> that doesn't happen right </garnt>
<garnt> that must be just you whereas it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> very much a </garnt>
<garnt> common occurrence for any like foreigner </garnt>
<garnt> who lives here unfortunately </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's unfortunate but it's it's just </garnt>
<connor> a thing where you move here and you </connor>
<garnt> realize there's pretty quickly yeah </garnt>
<garnt> pretty quickly yeah it's you know it </garnt>
<garnt> works differently and people view you </garnt>
<garnt> differently </garnt>
<garnt> as well um but i think to me that is you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> the worst experience i've had yeah about </garnt>
<garnt> moving to japan apart from </garnt>
<garnt> okay can we talk about how slow japanese </garnt>
<garnt> businesses work </garnt>
<garnt> yeah my </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] god everyone has this image that </garnt>
<garnt> japan's this </garnt>
<connor> like super optimized place like the most </connor>
<joey> optimized system on earth they figured </joey>
<garnt> it out speed running business </garnt>
<joey> like things just work you go to a </joey>
<joey> restaurant you press a button on a </joey>
<joey> tablet </joey>
<joey> and the food just appears in front of </joey>
<joey> you you know you're like this is the </joey>
<joey> future </joey>
<joey> and then you and then you go to a </joey>
<garnt> japanese business and you're like oh </garnt>
<garnt> is that is that a fax machine are you </garnt>
<garnt> using a fax machine right now </garnt>
<connor> or just like stuff you never even </connor>
<connor> considered like a problem or like yeah </connor>
<connor> asking for permission for like the the </connor>
<connor> slightest thing on earth like it's just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you show a logo or something in a video </connor>
<connor> we gotta find permission to do that it's </connor>
<connor> like yeah </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] upload it it's a problem </connor>
<joey> they'll tell us you know see but like </joey>
<joey> that's the thing right is that </joey>
<connor> japan doesn't understand what well </connor>
<connor> no risk as well but at least with like </connor>
<connor> what we do </connor>
<connor> business-wise japan doesn't have fair </connor>
<connor> use </connor>
<connor> no yeah so it's so difficult to get </connor>
<connor> permission for any like if you ask like </connor>
<connor> like as you said it's like can </connor>
<connor> can i just show this logo of your </connor>
<garnt> company that is like </garnt>
<garnt> publicly available to anybody yeah just </garnt>
<garnt> like slap it on for like </garnt>
<garnt> two seconds i'm not even gonna like </garnt>
<garnt> mention your name just slap it on it has </garnt>
<garnt> to go through like a hundred layers of </garnt>
<garnt> the company </garnt>
<garnt> just to get a simple yes and that could </garnt>
<garnt> take like a couple of days if you're </garnt>
<joey> lucky </joey>
<joey> yeah usually a week to maybe a month </joey>
<connor> yeah and it's like </connor>
<connor> it's a business model where there's like </connor>
<joey> imagine if every employer was a boss and </joey>
<joey> everyone had to ask for permission </joey>
<joey> constantly it's like you employees can't </joey>
<joey> make their own decisions they have to </joey>
<joey> ask </joey>
<joey> their boss who then asks their boss and </joey>
<connor> that takes a week </connor>
<connor> and that's just to see if you can </connor>
<connor> sharpen your pencil right like we </connor>
<connor> haven't even got to business yet like </connor>
<connor> we're just trying to figure out what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] happening it's not even just </connor>
<connor> business it's just </connor>
<connor> stunning everything it's everything </connor>
<connor> everything moves so slowly </connor>
<connor> like i remember when you sign up for a </connor>
<connor> gym membership oh my god </connor>
<joey> it took us how an hour hour and a half </joey>
<joey> an hour and a half to sign up for a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] to get a gym car </joey>
<joey> right because you know you know in um </joey>
<joey> you know in america or </joey>
<joey> like basically everywhere where you get </joey>
<joey> you get the terms and conditions right </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] scroll through you click accept </joey>
<garnt> no in japan you're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> sit there and you're gonna read every </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] term and you can agree to every </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] term individually </garnt>
<garnt> and they're gonna they're gonna sit </garnt>
<garnt> there with you to make sure you read it </garnt>
<joey> yeah you not only are subject to going </joey>
<joey> through the fine </joey>
<joey> print which is no longer fine it's just </joey>
<garnt> print </garnt>
<garnt> like but they're like let me read it out </garnt>
<garnt> for you </garnt>
<garnt> in case you're a [ __ ] illiterate </garnt>
<garnt> piece of [ __ ] it's like see that's why </garnt>
<garnt> like when i signed up for the gym </garnt>
<garnt> membership because it's all written in </garnt>
<garnt> japanese right </garnt>
<garnt> i straight up just said like i can read </garnt>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> i saved myself like an hour of pain i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> listening to this like [ __ ] hour-long </connor>
<joey> monologue from this like </joey>
<connor> yeah i think that's because we were </connor>
<connor> foreign he was like he he really </connor>
<connor> really wanted to make sure he understood </connor>
<connor> and bear in mind these weren't terms </connor>
<garnt> like conditions that were like any like </garnt>
<garnt> social things it was like literally </garnt>
<garnt> the the bare bones of what a gym needs </garnt>
<garnt> to make sure you know like right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like you know don't run on the treadmill </garnt>
<garnt> if you know your legs don't work right </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> just stuff like don't basically don't </garnt>
<garnt> sue us stuff right stuff you wouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> take for granted i remember he was like </garnt>
<garnt> asking us </garnt>
<garnt> our translator like if we understood </garnt>
<garnt> every single point every one of them is </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> do you understand that on the treadmill </connor>
<connor> you have to have your hands on the </connor>
<connor> treadmill at all times </connor>
<connor> and i looked at like like our friend </connor>
<connor> abby i was like is he serious </connor>
<connor> like it's not a joke right he wants me </connor>
<connor> to like like he legally has to </connor>
<joey> i have to agree that i'm gonna put my </joey>
<connor> hands on have you ever seen </connor>
<connor> like anyone butter like a crippled old </connor>
<joey> man right on the treadmill </joey>
<joey> oh yes because that's how i run like </joey>
<connor> three hands </connor>
<connor> no one does that and you literally like </connor>
<connor> you're signing this agreement and you </connor>
<connor> turn your head to see </connor>
<connor> ten people on the treadmill none of them </connor>
<connor> holding their hands and you're like </connor>
<connor> yes i agree and it's just </connor>
<connor> it's all [ __ ] that's all you do and </connor>
<garnt> and this is the stuff that you never </garnt>
<garnt> experience as a tourist because yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like perfectly separated the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that you experience as a tourist </garnt>
<garnt> yeah to like the stuff you experience </garnt>
<garnt> living here and the moment you do </garnt>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<garnt> that is remotely permanent or </garnt>
<connor> reoccurring in a contract you you better </connor>
<connor> be ready to </connor>
<connor> bring every document that you've ever </connor>
<connor> had in your life </connor>
<connor> and the hanko which you'll lose a lot </connor>
<joey> i'm surprised they didn't ask for like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] birth certificate when signing </joey>
<garnt> up for the gym because </garnt>
<joey> it's so formal with everything it's like </joey>
<garnt> who </garnt>
<garnt> you don't need to know my life story </garnt>
<garnt> that's the perfect word everything in </garnt>
<garnt> japan is so </garnt>
<garnt> formal and you don't see it as a tourist </garnt>
<garnt> because everything when you're in japan </garnt>
<garnt> on tourism </garnt>
<connor> and you're just sightseeing everything </connor>
<connor> just works right you go to a restaurant </connor>
<connor> it just works </connor>
<connor> living here all the little intricacies </connor>
<connor> and all the little </connor>
<connor> things you take for granted that should </connor>
<connor> be quick yeah just takes a million </connor>
<garnt> processors when </garnt>
<joey> it's just the most unoptimized thing in </joey>
<joey> the world yeah </joey>
<joey> um and there's just like a lot of things </joey>
<joey> that don't make sense like </joey>
<connor> in contracts like i've going back to </connor>
<connor> paying rent </connor>
<connor> there's this thing called a key fee what </connor>
<connor> was it like </connor>
<connor> what's this it's like it's key money </connor>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<joey> money more money and and i mean you can </joey>
<garnt> explain it if you want go ahead </garnt>
<garnt> okay what can i explain it's two months </garnt>
<connor> of rent some </connor>
<garnt> sometimes it's so the amount is about </garnt>
<garnt> two months of rent </garnt>
<garnt> that you pay to the rent owner to say </garnt>
<garnt> thank you for renting me your place for </garnt>
<connor> free like </connor>
<connor> you don't get any you don't get it back </connor>
<connor> you you this money is literally not a </connor>
<garnt> deposit </garnt>
<connor> you just pay two months of rent just </connor>
<connor> which you also have to pay a deposit </connor>
<connor> yeah and then on top of the deposit that </connor>
<garnt> you have to pay </garnt>
<joey> just it's basically a dick sucking thing </joey>
<garnt> like that's what it is it's like thank </garnt>
<joey> you so much for letting me stay in your </joey>
<connor> apartment that's what it is </connor>
<connor> and then it doesn't end there because </connor>
<connor> you then have to pay the rental </connor>
<connor> the the agency that got you the house </connor>
<connor> you have to pay a month's rent to them </connor>
<connor> as a fee </connor>
<connor> which is just stupid because i think in </connor>
<connor> every other country they take their </connor>
<connor> split </connor>
<connor> from the person renting the house right </connor>
<joey> like not from you because </joey>
<joey> renting a house shouldn't be you </joey>
<joey> shouldn't have to pay like six to eight </joey>
<joey> months </joey>
<joey> up front that's ridiculous yeah and it's </joey>
<joey> i think it's the reason why </joey>
<joey> uh a lot of homeless people here also </joey>
<joey> struggle to get houses because how the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] are you gonna get six months worth </joey>
<connor> of rent right good money are you </connor>
<joey> kidding me like that's like you expect </joey>
<joey> when you when you look at the rent you </joey>
<connor> expect like okay this is how much i'm </connor>
<garnt> going to pay for the first time </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you're paying like me two months </garnt>
<garnt> yeah maybe like a month or two </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah but like no it's like double </garnt>
<joey> or triple that and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> jesus christ like it's ridiculous yeah </joey>
<joey> stupid </joey>
<garnt> it's it's like yes six months worth of </garnt>
<connor> rent yeah in one sitting and you're not </connor>
<connor> gonna get like </connor>
<connor> two months of that back at all because </connor>
<garnt> they want you to stay in that apartment </garnt>
<garnt> they don't want you to leave </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i i like i like going around i </garnt>
<garnt> like moving getting a new place seeing </garnt>
<garnt> how things are </garnt>
<garnt> knowing what i like you don't like but </garnt>
<garnt> now it's pretty much just solidified </garnt>
<connor> that i'm not leaving this because i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna charge out the ass if i want to </connor>
<joey> move </joey>
<joey> because it's like a minimum of like two </joey>
<joey> years to like stay in one place two </joey>
<connor> years yeah and even then if you're </connor>
<connor> moving like the amount like </connor>
<joey> that you paid in that first month that </joey>
<joey> that if you split that across two years </joey>
<joey> of rent yeah you'd be </joey>
<joey> way overpriced oh yeah i think that's </joey>
<joey> why </joey>
<joey> like i that's that's one thing right </joey>
<joey> about like uh </joey>
<joey> living in japan that i've i've </joey>
<connor> personally never understood for the </connor>
<connor> longest time but i think finally now i </connor>
<connor> i do understand is when people say like </connor>
<garnt> man japan is such an expensive place </garnt>
<connor> but like when you think about it it's </connor>
<garnt> like no it's </garnt>
<connor> like because you know when when i think </connor>
<connor> oh japan is such an expensive place i </connor>
<connor> think like getting out eating out </connor>
<garnt> like drinking and i'm like no it's </garnt>
<connor> relatively cheap but then you think </connor>
<garnt> about </garnt>
<connor> all the bills six months worth of rent </connor>
<garnt> in the first month kind of [ __ ] i'm </garnt>
<connor> like okay </connor>
<joey> maybe yeah it is a little bit ridiculous </joey>
<garnt> and expensive </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean you can live frugally here </garnt>
<garnt> it's uh it's not too hard to live </garnt>
<connor> through </connor>
<connor> yeah you can live cheap it's it's like </connor>
<garnt> not a problem i mean convinies you can </garnt>
<garnt> live offline yeah oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> we can do a whole episode that's </garnt>
<garnt> basically the best thing about japan </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> no matter where you are you are in with </garnt>
<connor> like a hundred meter radius of </connor>
<connor> everything you need </connor>
<joey> like no questions japan is the only </joey>
<garnt> country where </garnt>
<garnt> the word convenience store actually </garnt>
<garnt> lives up to its name </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah because it is actually one of </garnt>
<joey> the most convenient places that you </joey>
<garnt> could </garnt>
<garnt> god i love kombini so [ __ ] much man </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> not even the food the food's amazing </connor>
<connor> like you expect this like if you go to a </connor>
<connor> gas station in any country in the world </connor>
<connor> yeah and you try and convince me to buy </connor>
<joey> something that's been cooked </joey>
<joey> in that building yeah i would rather </joey>
<joey> like just get salmonella like i'm not </joey>
<joey> gonna risk you </joey>
<connor> just seeing what they give me you know </connor>
<connor> what i mean like yeah those nasty hot </connor>
<connor> dogs that have been on rotation for like </connor>
<connor> 20 hours </connor>
<connor> at least but the one thing that like i </connor>
<garnt> thought was just like the most </garnt>
<garnt> genius thing that japan does which i do </garnt>
<garnt> not understand why every other country </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't do this </garnt>
<joey> is the fact they just have like a </joey>
<joey> printing machine in there </joey>
<joey> so no one needs to buy a printer or </joey>
<joey> buying you can just go to this place </joey>
<connor> that's probably within like </connor>
<connor> you know 100 meters of you 200 meters at </connor>
<connor> most max yeah </connor>
<connor> you pay like 10 cents or whatever and </connor>
<garnt> you can get a printed a4 copy of </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you want </garnt>
<garnt> because no one needs to print that much </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] right no i've never needed to print </garnt>
<garnt> more than like </garnt>
<garnt> one document expensive right and it </garnt>
<garnt> dries </garnt>
<garnt> as well so you might print one thing </garnt>
<garnt> it's gone dry yeah and i feel so bad for </garnt>
<garnt> admitting that i've done this but in the </garnt>
<garnt> uk uh and university </garnt>
<garnt> when we had to have a printer i was </garnt>
<garnt> printing a lot of documents i used to </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> the ink was more expensive to buy on its </garnt>
<garnt> own than just buying a new printer </garnt>
<garnt> yeah every time i ran out of ink i </garnt>
<garnt> bought a new </garnt>
<garnt> serious printer that's like 200 iq move </garnt>
<connor> though </connor>
<connor> because bear in mind right this is the </connor>
<connor> time when you're university right where </connor>
<connor> you're losing 20 pounds which is like </connor>
<connor> like 30 bucks at the time it was like a </connor>
<connor> big deal right like i don't </connor>
<connor> you don't get any money i can't afford </connor>
<joey> to lose 30 bucks that's like 10 instant </joey>
<connor> ramens dude </connor>
<connor> that's like like like two nights out </connor>
<connor> yeah if i'm good </connor>
<connor> so i would go to like the charity shop </connor>
<connor> uh and just like give it to them and </connor>
<connor> every single like month on cue i'd come </connor>
<connor> in with a printer and just the exact </connor>
<connor> same </connor>
<connor> amazon basics printer and give it and i </connor>
<connor> just thought like i can appreciate this </connor>
<connor> so much now that </connor>
<connor> in japan if you want to print anything </connor>
<connor> you don't have to buy a printer you </connor>
<connor> don't have to [ __ ] around worrying about </connor>
<connor> which ink cartridge mats with your </connor>
<connor> printer yeah you go to the convenience </connor>
<connor> store and you print it off and it's just </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> it makes sense and the best thing is is </joey>
<garnt> that like you know if you do need to </garnt>
<garnt> like print out like a document or </garnt>
<garnt> anything you can just be like oh i can </garnt>
<garnt> do that but you know i can also buy like </garnt>
<connor> a drink </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i can stock up my fridge yeah </connor>
<connor> it's all there </connor>
<joey> i can pay my bills you can pay your </joey>
<garnt> bills </garnt>
<garnt> you can pay your bills at the </garnt>
<connor> convenience store yeah that's wild to me </connor>
<connor> i don't anymore because that just takes </connor>
<connor> time but i did it you just did directly </connor>
<garnt> it was a novelty </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i think the best and worst </garnt>
<connor> part of japan to me </connor>
<connor> is that it's like a dichotomy it either </connor>
<garnt> works exceedingly well </garnt>
<connor> too well exceedingly optimized always </connor>
<garnt> just a hundred processors to do the </garnt>
<garnt> simplest [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> there's no middle ground nothing here </joey>
<garnt> works okay yeah it either works </garnt>
<garnt> exceedingly well or it just doesn't work </garnt>
<connor> at </connor>
<connor> all i think it's normally like </connor>
<connor> a public demand right convenience stores </connor>
<connor> trains everyone is using them </connor>
<connor> 24 7. we want this easy as possible </connor>
<connor> all that it all works flawlessly yeah i </connor>
<connor> think where it comes into play </connor>
<connor> mostly is with like government agencies </connor>
<connor> like big companies that have </connor>
<connor> higher ups that don't want to change </connor>
<connor> things very fastly yeah and if you </connor>
<connor> thought like companies in the west don't </connor>
<connor> want to change things </connor>
<joey> my god you are in for like a surprise </joey>
<joey> most japanese companies haven't changed </joey>
<connor> since like the 70s because because not </connor>
<connor> only do they not want to change things </connor>
<connor> even if the person before them dies </connor>
<connor> they're like well they didn't want to </connor>
<garnt> change it and i </garnt>
<connor> really don't want to like you know step </connor>
<garnt> on their toes even though they don't </garnt>
<garnt> exist anymore you know it's like </garnt>
<connor> we've got to keep everything the same </connor>
<joey> way it was that's been working the </joey>
<joey> problem though is that japan has such a </joey>
<connor> double-edged sword </connor>
<garnt> in terms of like maintaining culture </garnt>
<joey> yeah it works </joey>
<garnt> because it's maintaining tradition it's </garnt>
<garnt> very traditional in a lot of ways like </garnt>
<garnt> man look look i'm looking at japanese </garnt>
<garnt> web design </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god oh my god man i </garnt>
<garnt> i take it for granted how good we had it </garnt>
<connor> like i didn't realize that i cared about </connor>
<joey> users i </joey>
<garnt> i i when i was interning i was in the </garnt>
<garnt> web division department because that's </garnt>
<connor> what i measured in at uni right so i had </connor>
<garnt> to like </garnt>
<garnt> go around fixing basically like clients </garnt>
<garnt> like old websites </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like anybody who like ever did </garnt>
<garnt> anything like html or css related can </garnt>
<joey> relate to this but like </joey>
<joey> i almost had a stroke when i looked at </joey>
<joey> the source code and i saw a table </joey>
<joey> and i'm like that's something we haven't </joey>
<garnt> used since like the early 90s like not </garnt>
<garnt> this is like early 90s type of web </garnt>
<connor> design and they're </connor>
<connor> still using it today yeah yeah i don't </connor>
<connor> think i've seen </connor>
<garnt> a single animation on a web page in </garnt>
<garnt> japan no </garnt>
<garnt> no like there's no graphics at all it's </garnt>
<joey> it literally looks like </joey>
<connor> the first like windows iteration like </connor>
<joey> it's just it just looks so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] cluttered weirdly enough the </joey>
<joey> best web design i have seen </joey>
<garnt> is like landing pages for new anime yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah yeah yeah that's it that's the </garnt>
<garnt> thing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah good websites that i've seen i'm </garnt>
<joey> like damn </joey>
<garnt> these javascript for this [ __ ] jesus </garnt>
<garnt> before we move on to the logistics </garnt>
<garnt> i want to talk about staying to the car </garnt>
<connor> to thank the pros </connor>
<connor> how good the [ __ ] food is oh my god </connor>
<connor> moving </connor>
<connor> moving here from england oh my god where </connor>
<connor> good food is you either it's you you </connor>
<connor> either have to pay a lot </connor>
<connor> or you have to cook it yourself it's </connor>
<garnt> every everything here </garnt>
<garnt> tastes good it's it's it's just true </garnt>
<garnt> right everything </garnt>
<garnt> you never have a bad experience in japan </garnt>
<connor> with food i swear to god that's like the </connor>
<connor> difference that i tell my parents the </connor>
<connor> most i'm like </connor>
<connor> in in the uk i don't know about </connor>
<connor> australia but when you go to the </connor>
<garnt> restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> it's not a gamble it's but it kind of is </garnt>
<garnt> it's like you don't know if it's going </garnt>
<garnt> to be </garnt>
<garnt> okay or amazing and it's always a coin </garnt>
<garnt> flip you just don't know and you have to </garnt>
<garnt> go to find out </garnt>
<joey> oh no that's 100 how it works in </joey>
<joey> australia right because there might be a </joey>
<joey> restaurant owned by a guy who has no </joey>
<joey> idea </joey>
<connor> what he's doing doesn't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> about the food but in japan it is like </connor>
<connor> guaranteed no matter where you go you </connor>
<connor> will get good food yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah you are like never like you never </connor>
<connor> overcharged </connor>
<garnt> either like you always pay a fair amount </garnt>
<garnt> and when you are overcharged </garnt>
<garnt> it is like the the taste and experience </garnt>
<connor> is worth </connor>
<connor> exactly exactly i remember saying very </connor>
<connor> harsh words to my mom when she used to </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> you know i'm like how dare you give me </connor>
<garnt> these this bland food all my life </garnt>
<garnt> when this stuff existed how many times </garnt>
<garnt> must i have beans and toast mother how </garnt>
<garnt> many times </garnt>
<connor> can a man eat beans and toast i actually </connor>
<garnt> still like it like when like when the </garnt>
<garnt> combini food here is better than </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the restaurant food you can </garnt>
<garnt> find in british restaurants i </garnt>
<garnt> go to yeah i'm like man there's </garnt>
<garnt> something wrong with me there's </garnt>
<joey> something wrong here man so that's the </joey>
<joey> insane thing is that i </joey>
<joey> i don't know if it's i don't know if </joey>
<garnt> japan's the only country that's like </garnt>
<garnt> this but </garnt>
<garnt> it's cheaper to eat out than it is to </garnt>
<garnt> cook your own food it's the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> in thailand i think </garnt>
<garnt> because at least in australia like jesus </garnt>
<garnt> christ </garnt>
<garnt> no one goes to restaurants because it's </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't want to gamble </garnt>
<garnt> if this 25 pasta is going to be good or </garnt>
<connor> not like i'm sorry i'm like i'm not that </connor>
<joey> rich </joey>
<garnt> i'd rather just go to a supermarket and </garnt>
<garnt> just cook a five dollar pasta i'm here </garnt>
<garnt> in japan and to get like a single lime </garnt>
<garnt> a single lime i paid two dollars </garnt>
<garnt> yeah two dollars for a single [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> life </connor>
<connor> what the something i wish no i don't </connor>
<garnt> think anyone's mentioned that on youtube </garnt>
<garnt> people don't tell you </garnt>
<connor> how expensive it is to cook here yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't know if this is just like </garnt>
<garnt> maybe in america it's different no we're </garnt>
<connor> not from america and i know the prices </connor>
<garnt> for fresh food in america is like </garnt>
<connor> ridiculous yeah but in the uk i don't </connor>
<garnt> know about australia </garnt>
<joey> in the uk like buying ingredients is </joey>
<joey> so incredibly cheap nobody </joey>
<garnt> eating out is not so much you do it for </garnt>
<garnt> the food it's more of like an experience </garnt>
<joey> with your friends </joey>
<joey> no no it's for an event right it's a </joey>
<garnt> luxury yeah don't do it because like </garnt>
<joey> you know you you have the money it's </joey>
<garnt> like you do it for a reason and </garnt>
<connor> you like if you speak to someone in the </connor>
<connor> uk and i know that if you say like you </connor>
<connor> eat out every day in the uk everyone's </connor>
<connor> like what </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] wrong yeah because like in </garnt>
<garnt> the uk you don't eat out alone yeah </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> it's very rare to do something like </connor>
<connor> eating out alone in here </connor>
<connor> more people eat out alone than cook yeah </connor>
<connor> then cook </connor>
<connor> you know because it's just more </connor>
<connor> convenient and it's cheaper as well </connor>
<garnt> because my god vegetables here meats are </garnt>
<garnt> okay but vegetables are so expensive and </garnt>
<connor> i don't know why </connor>
<connor> like and the biggest offender in my mind </connor>
<garnt> lime's terrible peppers you know like </garnt>
<garnt> normal bell peppers </garnt>
<garnt> yeah in the uk i distinctly remember in </garnt>
<garnt> like aldi or even like tesco </garnt>
<garnt> it's like one pound 29 right for a pack </garnt>
<garnt> of three bell peppers right </garnt>
<garnt> that's like what 1.60 yeah in japan for </garnt>
<garnt> like a single bell pepper which comes </garnt>
<joey> with its own packaging </joey>
<connor> it's like 180 yen so if you want to have </connor>
<connor> three bell peppers so that's that's two </connor>
<connor> bucks </connor>
<connor> six dollars for three bell pepper are </connor>
<joey> you [ __ ] good can we talk about the </joey>
<joey> biggest defender though which is fruits </joey>
<garnt> oh my gosh roots </garnt>
<connor> i like okay they're good they're good </connor>
<connor> they're good they're amazing </connor>
<garnt> but jesus talk about overpriced yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like i know like </garnt>
<garnt> you know there are like japan has this </garnt>
<garnt> like weird obsession when it comes to </garnt>
<garnt> fruits where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's from this you've got a massage </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's from the specific prefecture </garnt>
<garnt> that specializes in that fruit therefore </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to buy an apple from like </garnt>
<garnt> aomori prefecture which is like known </garnt>
<garnt> for the apples it's like you know a </garnt>
<garnt> regular apple like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know about the uk but at least </garnt>
<connor> in australia it's like if you want like </connor>
<connor> a freshly ground </connor>
<connor> we don't [ __ ] know where apples come </connor>
<connor> from like good quality like you know </connor>
<connor> home-grown apple </connor>
<joey> right there like the most you'd pay is </joey>
<connor> maybe like a buck </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i've never paid more than 50 </connor>
<connor> cents for an apple no i don't know i </connor>
<connor> think i'd be shocked if i paid more than </connor>
<joey> whereas here if you want like a </joey>
<joey> specialized </joey>
<joey> branded apple which is like the only </joey>
<joey> kind of apples they have here for some </joey>
<garnt> reason yes like </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah 600 yen please there's no cheap </connor>
<joey> brands here it's right it's every </joey>
<connor> every brand has a certain story and it's </connor>
<connor> like that uh </connor>
<joey> it's like you know when you have asian </joey>
<joey> grandparents or something everything </joey>
<joey> they feed you has </joey>
<joey> health benefits or something yeah you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> they they they feed you like this </joey>
<connor> vegetable or this fruit and they're like </connor>
<connor> oh this is really good for eggs this is </connor>
<garnt> it's not proven but uh it's it's like a </garnt>
<connor> wives tale right </connor>
<connor> the amount of like fat products they </connor>
<connor> sell here is like incredible </connor>
<garnt> right like you know you'd think that </garnt>
<garnt> we're in the age of science right like </garnt>
<garnt> i thought that people like knew that </garnt>
<garnt> half the [ __ ] they see on packaging is </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like the amount of like uh just weight </garnt>
<garnt> loss </garnt>
<garnt> things that i've seen here is incredible </garnt>
<connor> like put this pad on your belly and it </connor>
<connor> will just magically go because of the </connor>
<connor> gels and it's like </connor>
<connor> that's just not how the body works like </connor>
<joey> you know what's kind of incredible as </joey>
<garnt> well like when it comes to like weight </garnt>
<garnt> loss like culture here in japan </garnt>
<garnt> apparently i saw somewhere and i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know don't quote me on this </garnt>
<garnt> but i saw a while ago that like japan is </garnt>
<connor> really interesting when it comes to </connor>
<connor> weight loss because </connor>
<connor> we're one of the most healthiest </connor>
<connor> healthiest </connor>
<connor> countries in the world and yet i think </connor>
<joey> it's something ridiculous like one in </joey>
<connor> three people </connor>
<connor> diet it's crazy and i'm like you don't </connor>
<joey> need to diet because i and and that </joey>
<connor> whole </connor>
<connor> you know that whole thing comes from the </connor>
<garnt> whole ridiculous standard of </garnt>
<connor> everyone's here everybody needs to be </connor>
<garnt> bulimic otherwise you're not considered </garnt>
<garnt> beautiful yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but like going back to the fruit thing i </garnt>
<garnt> i remember uh me and aki </garnt>
<garnt> went to like this new supermarket that </garnt>
<garnt> opened up near our place </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um and i wanted to check out the </garnt>
<garnt> fruit section because i'm always curious </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> how can we get ripped off anymore um and </garnt>
<garnt> there was like this packet of uh </garnt>
<garnt> there were these cherries right i love </garnt>
<garnt> eating cherries there were these packet </garnt>
<garnt> of like cherries from america </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which were like there was like 30 </garnt>
<garnt> of them in there and it was like 400 yen </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like okay a tad expensive but not </garnt>
<garnt> too </garnt>
<garnt> bad right next to there there was a pack </garnt>
<garnt> of another 30 </garnt>
<garnt> cherries but they were from like ibaraki </garnt>
<garnt> or like somewhere local </garnt>
<joey> and it was obviously some kind of brand </joey>
<connor> right guess how much these cherries were </connor>
<connor> just going off japan experience like 30 </connor>
<joey> bucks </joey>
<joey> okay so like three thousand yen how much </joey>
<garnt> do you think it was i think like 25 </garnt>
<garnt> uh hundred yen it's like two thousand </garnt>
<garnt> yeah two thousand five hundred yen right </garnt>
<garnt> twenty five bucks yeah </garnt>
<garnt> think of uh six thousand five hundred </garnt>
<garnt> jesus </garnt>
<garnt> for thirty cherries homegrown </garnt>
<garnt> okay like what like </garnt>
<garnt> i saw like i was really tempted to buy </garnt>
<garnt> just being like i swear to god if one </garnt>
<garnt> cherry doesn't give me an orgasm like </garnt>
<joey> it's it's not worth it yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah i know right it's not worth it it's </garnt>
<garnt> good it's good fruit don't get me wrong </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but is it worth the [ __ ] premium </garnt>
<joey> that i'm paying right </joey>
<joey> i don't think so i don't think so like </joey>
<garnt> like it's already </garnt>
<garnt> a luxury just to buy regular food yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah regular non-branded food exactly </garnt>
<garnt> it's like who is buying this that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's my biggest concern it's like </garnt>
<joey> what kind of fruit elitist is like </joey>
<joey> buying these like </joey>
<joey> 60 dollar cherries from like down the </joey>
<garnt> road you know five-star michelin </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] cherries like what who is buying </joey>
<garnt> these </garnt>
<garnt> and being like yes i can definitely </garnt>
<joey> taste like the homegrown quality in this </joey>
<garnt> it's the it's the [ __ ] elderly it's </garnt>
<joey> the grandmaster this is hidden health </joey>
<garnt> benefits </garnt>
<connor> this is low gmo this cherry will fix </connor>
<joey> your erectile dysfunction </joey>
<joey> this isn't from america it's homegrown </joey>
<connor> going back to you know uh people who </connor>
<connor> stay thin in japan i think one </connor>
<connor> preconception i had is that i would just </connor>
<connor> move to japan and because oh god because </connor>
<garnt> japanese food is so healthy </garnt>
<garnt> you just like lose weight automatically </garnt>
<garnt> i'd like </garnt>
<garnt> zero efforts lose weight automatically </garnt>
<connor> most restaurants </connor>
<connor> have a menu surprise surprise and uh if </connor>
<garnt> you just pick the unhealthy option you </garnt>
<connor> read the unhealthy </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah you gain just as much weight i </joey>
<connor> think the whole preconception is that </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> i think especially when it comes from </garnt>
<garnt> like americans yeah yeah it's just it's </garnt>
<garnt> not so much about like </garnt>
<garnt> the actual fact that like the food is </garnt>
<connor> healthier and i'm sure like if you </connor>
<connor> like constantly go eat out of like </connor>
<garnt> traditional japanese restaurants that's </garnt>
<connor> sort of traditional japanese </connor>
<garnt> food yes you're probably getting </garnt>
<garnt> healthier stuff yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> i think it just seems healthier </garnt>
<joey> especially when compared to like </joey>
<joey> americans because </joey>
<joey> the portion sizes are just smaller that </joey>
<connor> yeah and like the whole conbini all that </connor>
<connor> stuff is definitely not healthy oh no no </connor>
<joey> that's not enough </joey>
<garnt> it's delicious but it's not it's ordered </garnt>
<garnt> that's the problem </garnt>
<garnt> everything's delicious so you just want </garnt>
<connor> to keep eating more and more right right </connor>
<connor> i think we like we mistake it as like a </connor>
<connor> food culture thing as to why everyone's </connor>
<garnt> so thin here but it's definitely like </garnt>
<garnt> when you live here you realize really </garnt>
<garnt> quickly it's a lifestyle thing yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> definitely </connor>
<connor> because they walk so much most people do </connor>
<connor> exercise unless they're super busy with </connor>
<connor> work and </connor>
<connor> i mean that's already draining enough </connor>
<garnt> but i've noticed that people don't </garnt>
<garnt> really like eat </garnt>
<connor> lunch or breakfast much here it's like a </connor>
<connor> light bite most of the time unless it's </connor>
<connor> a business meal </connor>
<connor> yeah that's when they'll eat lunch but </connor>
<joey> most people i think just have like an </joey>
<joey> onigiri or like a small snack </joey>
<joey> like a calorie mate right and even then </joey>
<joey> i think most people are just too </joey>
<garnt> exhausted by the time they finish work </garnt>
<garnt> they just have something just because </garnt>
<garnt> they need to </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then they go to bed where i </garnt>
<garnt> mean when you're a youtuber like </garnt>
<connor> i'm i i eat because i'm bored and trust </connor>
<connor> me there is more than enough stuff to </connor>
<connor> eat here that is like </connor>
<connor> terrible i'm sure the amount of food </connor>
<joey> they just like are used to eating as </joey>
<connor> well is greatly different to like any </connor>
<joey> like standard of like a westerner right </joey>
<garnt> oh no like for me when i whenever i have </garnt>
<garnt> like a sweet like uh like an ice cream </garnt>
<connor> everything is sweet here yeah everything </connor>
<connor> everything and it's so good like </connor>
<connor> normally i hate sweets but now but now </connor>
<connor> when i go to a company i have to get at </connor>
<garnt> least one </garnt>
<joey> snack or one suite but like the one </joey>
<joey> thing i can't forgive </joey>
<joey> especially this is not just japan this </joey>
<connor> is all asian countries yes </connor>
<connor> sweet bread oh i i just think they </connor>
<joey> i i i i can't speak of other </joey>
<connor> asian countries but this bread this this </connor>
<connor> country's bread is a joke </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah this is not like it's not </connor>
<connor> bread like </connor>
<connor> no half the bread that you can choose </connor>
<garnt> like i have not seen </garnt>
<garnt> a single bread that is like multi-grain </garnt>
<garnt> bread like just brown bread right </garnt>
<connor> minding anything but white bread and </connor>
<connor> then sometimes like bread with custard </connor>
<joey> in it </joey>
<joey> who the [ __ ] wants bread with coffee </joey>
<joey> okay i i [ __ ] with bread </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] with it because i grew up eating </joey>
<connor> that [ __ ] but and then there's other </connor>
<connor> stuff and it's like </connor>
<connor> in the uk the one thing that i realized </connor>
<connor> now i took most for granted </connor>
<connor> was just a loaf of bread yeah right like </connor>
<connor> i feel like the one thing that everyone </connor>
<connor> feels entitled to in the uk is a loaf of </connor>
<connor> bread </connor>
<connor> like it is like the staple of the house </connor>
<garnt> right it's just everyone has a loaf of </garnt>
<garnt> bread you just go to </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] tesco's waitress at most </garnt>
<garnt> you can even get the cheaper option </garnt>
<garnt> still a whole loaf of bread for like 80 </garnt>
<connor> cents </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah 80 cents adm whatever how many </joey>
<joey> loaves of bread </joey>
<joey> how many slices of bread do you get in </joey>
<connor> the you get like 12 like 12 times you </connor>
<connor> get a full load like this yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> okay japan you get half the [ __ ] loaf </connor>
<joey> and they've cut it </joey>
<joey> you get six slices you get six slices </joey>
<joey> but it's not only six slices it's like </joey>
<garnt> a brick of [ __ ] like it's not even a </garnt>
<garnt> slice like it's too thick to make a </garnt>
<joey> sandwich out of </joey>
<joey> it's so thick that the toaster struggles </joey>
<garnt> to toast it all the way through </garnt>
<garnt> you have to like put that [ __ ] in for </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 minutes and it's like lightly </garnt>
<joey> brown and i'm just like </joey>
<connor> i just want toast yeah i think bread has </connor>
<connor> been the thing that i've </connor>
<connor> missed the most if not that cheese like </connor>
<connor> oh don't get me started you can get good </connor>
<connor> cheese here but </connor>
<connor> for the same block of cheese in the uk </connor>
<connor> like a kilogram of cheese i would pay </connor>
<connor> like two three pounds right so that's </connor>
<connor> like what four five bucks </connor>
<connor> here if i want like 200 grams or 500 </connor>
<connor> grams of good </connor>
<connor> like actual cheese not that god-awful </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] they have here </connor>
<connor> it's like 15 bucks like and i'm not </connor>
<connor> paying that much for cheese because i </connor>
<connor> just can't like in my head </connor>
<joey> i mean it's a bigger struggle for me </joey>
<joey> like considering that australia is like </joey>
<joey> known for its cheese like all </joey>
<joey> supermarkets in australia have an </joey>
<garnt> aisle specifically right here you have </garnt>
<garnt> to go to a specific </garnt>
<garnt> specialized supermarket for foreign </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and it's like the most </garnt>
<connor> processed [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> americans they'll have they'll have like </connor>
<connor> 100 meters of tofu </connor>
<connor> don't you worry about it they'll have </connor>
<connor> every every single tofu imaginable </connor>
<joey> they'll have like it's the same tofu but </joey>
<joey> with like it's like instead of zero zero </joey>
<joey> zero zero f on the color grade it's zero </joey>
<joey> zero zero point one x </joey>
<joey> one shade whiter literally like the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> they'll sell </connor>
<connor> but like cheese no way get that [ __ ] out </connor>
<connor> of here we don't need cheese you know </connor>
<joey> what's [ __ ] when we have more </joey>
<joey> variations of natto than we do </joey>
<garnt> i mean not that i'm complaining but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know how you handle natto man </garnt>
<joey> i just grew up with a man like this yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm open to things </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm i i think i have a really good </joey>
<joey> like palette i can eat anything </joey>
<connor> but natto i don't know what the [ __ ] i </connor>
<joey> don't want to be that guy but it's an </joey>
<garnt> acquired taste </garnt>
<garnt> you know you can say that again you know </garnt>
<garnt> i i feel that i'm pretty international </garnt>
<garnt> and and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm open to trying new things there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's a few things in the world that i </garnt>
<garnt> just don't get </garnt>
<garnt> natto is one of them yeah i'm sorry to </garnt>
<garnt> betray my own country </garnt>
<garnt> durian is another one i'm sorry guys </garnt>
<joey> i've never tried right now </joey>
<connor> but i've always wanted to what what are </connor>
<joey> some like </joey>
<connor> i guess what we're talking about what </connor>
<connor> are some misconceptions about japan that </connor>
<connor> you think you experienced </connor>
<connor> because for me i know i thought for some </connor>
<garnt> reason i thought i was going to eat way </garnt>
<garnt> more fish </garnt>
<garnt> by just being i mean in comparison i </garnt>
<garnt> guess i do eat slightly more fish </garnt>
<garnt> all right uh but i thought fish was </garnt>
<garnt> going to be way more of a factor in my </garnt>
<garnt> life than it actually is </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know and i i feel like if you </garnt>
<garnt> want to avoid fish in japan it is so </garnt>
<joey> easy </joey>
<joey> oh yeah like it is i mean i think that </joey>
<garnt> also </garnt>
<garnt> comes from the whole fact that like </garnt>
<connor> because there are more foreigners living </connor>
<garnt> here like they were just like </garnt>
<garnt> especially like even in between the four </garnt>
<garnt> years that i've been living here there </garnt>
<garnt> are </garnt>
<garnt> so many more vegetarian and vegan places </garnt>
<connor> open now like </connor>
<connor> it's incredible especially in tokyo but </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> yeah no i agree like i love me my fish </connor>
<connor> don't get me wrong i'm saying </connor>
<connor> but i'm definitely not going to eat </connor>
<joey> sushi every week like most of my fans </joey>
<connor> think i yeah </connor>
<connor> i can't eat sushi every day it's like a </connor>
<garnt> it's like a like nice little treat </garnt>
<garnt> right right i know what you guys doing </garnt>
<joey> about if i could eat sushi every week i </joey>
<joey> would and i do most </joey>
<garnt> mostly before pre-quarantine like </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> going to like this dollar sushi chain </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i [ __ ] love it because you get </garnt>
<garnt> you get better sushi than you do for </garnt>
<connor> paying </connor>
<connor> 30 quid oh yeah i think i think sushi </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] dollar and it's [ __ ] amazing </joey>
<connor> and i i do eat quite a lot of fish </connor>
<connor> mostly because i </connor>
<connor> eat sushi a lot and when you cook at </connor>
<connor> home um </connor>
<connor> you know because i love [ __ ] salmon </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah and and because there's so </connor>
<garnt> much fish like in the uk sometimes you </garnt>
<garnt> could get like </garnt>
<connor> meat that's been like like seasoned </connor>
<garnt> already yeah and you can get like fish </garnt>
<garnt> and supermarkets here that's already </garnt>
<garnt> been like </garnt>
<garnt> pre-seasoned everything so literally all </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta do is open that bad boy up </garnt>
<garnt> throw in a pan </garnt>
<connor> and you've got an amazing taste yeah </connor>
<connor> it's so good i think it's just habit </connor>
<garnt> basically yeah because if you don't have </garnt>
<garnt> the habit of eating fish you could </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's so many other [ __ ] that </garnt>
<garnt> you could eat because there's it's so </garnt>
<garnt> readily available pizza potato that's </garnt>
<connor> the best </connor>
<connor> don't know what pizza potato is come to </connor>
<joey> japan it's amazing it's </joey>
<garnt> i [ __ ] but that's the thing right </garnt>
<joey> it's like sorry </joey>
<garnt> i think most people think that like oh </garnt>
<garnt> we just you know all the receipts it's </garnt>
<connor> just like sushi is </connor>
<connor> because like you know as as obvious as </connor>
<joey> this is going to sound japanese </joey>
<joey> food culture is just so much more than </joey>
<connor> that like it's so much more than fish </connor>
<connor> i have consistently had the best italian </connor>
<garnt> food </garnt>
<garnt> here as opposed to there would be some </garnt>
<garnt> there would be </garnt>
<garnt> someone italian out there just like </garnt>
<connor> cringing yeah </connor>
<garnt> you know going to italy it's no contest </garnt>
<garnt> right but compared to the uk where </garnt>
<garnt> it was literally like again it was a </garnt>
<garnt> coin toss right you'd go to a place </garnt>
<garnt> and the pastor was like god awful like </garnt>
<garnt> it's the saddest carbonara which you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> how can you [ __ ] that up that's like </garnt>
<garnt> pasta 101 right </garnt>
<connor> you come here and i feel like you just </connor>
<connor> always consistently have like a good </connor>
<connor> experience with every kind of food right </connor>
<connor> like i mean i mean you you know this </connor>
<garnt> chinese food in the uk is a joke </garnt>
<garnt> we're not gonna </garnt>
<garnt> any kind of cuisine you can imagine </garnt>
<joey> except maybe like </joey>
<connor> american food like really like dinosaurs </connor>
<connor> yeah like meat like really like ribs and </connor>
<connor> stuff </connor>
<connor> yeah it's hard to get that but you know </connor>
<garnt> i'm fine with going to america or going </garnt>
<garnt> back to the uk and having that myself </garnt>
<garnt> every now and then yeah </garnt>
<connor> for the for the overall trade-off of all </connor>
<connor> right consistently i get better meals </connor>
<garnt> right yeah right right </garnt>
<garnt> is there anything else that like haven't </garnt>
<garnt> met your expectations or </garnt>
<garnt> haven't met your preconceptions yeah i </garnt>
<joey> would i want to know as like a non-like </joey>
<connor> president right or like you know </connor>
<connor> non-japanese this is gonna sound dumb as </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] right and i know it's gonna sound </connor>
<connor> dumb but </connor>
<garnt> i like i knew things were going to be </garnt>
<connor> difficult that i couldn't speak japanese </connor>
<connor> or read japanese more so read than </connor>
<connor> anything i feel like you can </connor>
<connor> for some reason you can be fine not </connor>
<connor> speaking japanese here but if you can't </connor>
<connor> read </connor>
<connor> like you're in for like a storm of </connor>
<garnt> trouble because </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many things and and i think </garnt>
<garnt> you you all can agree on this if amazon </garnt>
<garnt> didn't exist here and happen </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god if amazon didn't have english </garnt>
<connor> settings here i genuinely don't know </connor>
<connor> what i would do because </connor>
<connor> the websites here in japanese like i </connor>
<connor> don't know if they've done this on </connor>
<connor> purpose </connor>
<connor> or due to the old interface they do not </connor>
<joey> work well with google translate it's all </joey>
<joey> going back to that like 90s web browser </joey>
<garnt> they don't know how to design their </garnt>
<garnt> websites it's not user friendly so if </garnt>
<garnt> you can't speak japanese or read </garnt>
<garnt> japanese you're kind of [ __ ] yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> the google translate does not help no it </connor>
<garnt> doesn't help it can help you like </garnt>
<garnt> feel like you kind of feel your way </garnt>
<garnt> through but you cannot tell what the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] you're doing </garnt>
<garnt> the only reason we've been able to get </garnt>
<garnt> through it is because we've had </garnt>
<connor> uh friends we've got a company helping </connor>
<garnt> us yeah that makes it so much </garnt>
<connor> easier for you oh yeah joey shout out to </connor>
<connor> your friends yeah </connor>
<connor> joey helped me a lot when i when we </connor>
<joey> moved here like help me out doing all </joey>
<joey> the </joey>
<joey> i had to go to the town hall with you </joey>
<connor> like fill out your papers </connor>
<connor> that's the thing right is that you think </connor>
<connor> like in the </connor>
<connor> big population areas they'd have like a </connor>
<connor> lot of english support but i think they </connor>
<connor> said like if you come </connor>
<connor> on these certain days like setting up </connor>
<connor> internet do you remember how much of a </connor>
<connor> hassle that was good </connor>
<connor> like i remember that uh uh au right they </connor>
<connor> say they have an english location in </connor>
<connor> shinjuku oh yeah </connor>
<connor> that's a [ __ ] lie no no their english </connor>
<garnt> location </garnt>
<garnt> is that they have a tablet which can </garnt>
<garnt> call a call center </garnt>
<garnt> that can translate the person for you </garnt>
<garnt> kind of but not really but that's the </garnt>
<connor> closest thing did you </connor>
<connor> get that fox i didn't even get to the </connor>
<garnt> guy on the tablet i just turned up </garnt>
<garnt> saying </garnt>
<connor> on the website this says this is the </connor>
<connor> last location and they were like </connor>
<connor> no and i'm like what do i do how the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] do i get internet yeah yeah help me </garnt>
<garnt> like i luckily i had a cousin who worked </garnt>
<garnt> in japan so she could speak japanese she </garnt>
<garnt> helped me through </garnt>
<garnt> so much and i don't know what i would do </garnt>
<connor> without her yeah </connor>
<connor> and you know same with you yeah you </connor>
<connor> needed like you need a lot of you feel </connor>
<joey> like a baby </joey>
<joey> i i genuinely don't know like how </joey>
<connor> there are some foreigners here who can't </connor>
<connor> even speak english </connor>
<connor> yeah somehow at least on their own and </connor>
<joey> i'm like </joey>
<joey> how the [ __ ] did you do that because at </joey>
<joey> least they have a lot of english words </joey>
<joey> right and a lot </joey>
<joey> a lot of english options sometimes yeah </joey>
<joey> if you speak </joey>
<joey> you can't speak english [ __ ] i don't </joey>
<garnt> know what i don't know how i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> like english is hard enough as it is </garnt>
<connor> yeah you know if you can't speak </connor>
<garnt> japanese </garnt>
<garnt> then i i think you're pretty much [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> um if you can't </garnt>
<joey> real positive message coming out of this </joey>
<garnt> episode no no no no </garnt>
<garnt> because that's the thing a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> don't talk about which is </garnt>
<garnt> how hard it is to live here actually </garnt>
<garnt> live here </garnt>
<connor> without speaking japanese because coming </connor>
<connor> in </connor>
<connor> like we said it's so different living </connor>
<connor> here as </connor>
<connor> you know working here and just live </connor>
<connor> visiting here as a tourist yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> there's there's a world of difference </connor>
<connor> and there's so many little things </connor>
<connor> like for example registering with a town </connor>
<garnt> hall yeah how the [ __ ] am i supposed to </garnt>
<garnt> do that if i don't speak japanese </garnt>
<garnt> because they don't they don't speak </garnt>
<garnt> english and all the forms were in </garnt>
<connor> japanese yeah the forms they tell you </connor>
<garnt> that you need to do that within two </garnt>
<garnt> weeks of moving here yeah or also </garnt>
<joey> in it's just in japanese just learn </joey>
<joey> japanese in the two weeks that you hear </joey>
<joey> the only reason we knew is because the </joey>
<joey> lawyers told us hey you've got to do </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> but like if we didn't know that i don't </joey>
<connor> know what i was getting i would have </connor>
<garnt> just carried on </garnt>
<garnt> you need a dedicated agency just to help </garnt>
<garnt> you with all the admin stuff because i </garnt>
<joey> mean i can understand the language and i </joey>
<connor> still have to like learn from like my </connor>
<connor> cousins who leave here that's like </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] i have to go to the town hall </connor>
<garnt> and register for like my </garnt>
<garnt> address and like my health certificate </garnt>
<garnt> and all of that [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i never had to experience that </garnt>
<garnt> living in australia yeah i never had to </garnt>
<garnt> experience that while visiting here </garnt>
<garnt> right so it's just it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> overwhelming and like </garnt>
<garnt> i it's like massive kudos to people who </garnt>
<connor> don't know japanese or even don't know </connor>
<connor> english </connor>
<connor> yeah again i don't know how the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> they do without the help of an agency </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> so to clarify you can live here if you </connor>
<connor> don't speak any japanese or if you're </connor>
<connor> learning but </connor>
<connor> i i think if you're somehow coming here </connor>
<connor> alone without anyone </connor>
<connor> helping you it's going to be hell yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah cause it was hell enough </connor>
<connor> with multiple ways of us having help </connor>
<connor> right it was just </connor>
<connor> and i felt so bad for joey the amount of </connor>
<connor> times i have to ask him for help i was </connor>
<connor> like he [ __ ] hates me at this point </connor>
<connor> every day every day i'm coming over with </connor>
<connor> a form </connor>
<connor> what does this say and then also like </connor>
<connor> until you figure this out right if you </connor>
<connor> miss a package in the post </connor>
<connor> you get a little form through your </connor>
<garnt> mailbox that's all in japanese </garnt>
<garnt> and and you need to figure out how the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] you're going to reschedule this </garnt>
<garnt> thing </garnt>
<garnt> luckily you know there's a like i found </garnt>
<garnt> a way eventually which was like scan the </garnt>
<garnt> barcode with like whatever thing you </garnt>
<garnt> have </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it'll take you to a website use </garnt>
<garnt> google translate to translate it </garnt>
<joey> and then hope that the translations are </joey>
<joey> rough enough where you can like figure </joey>
<joey> out what's being said and that's what i </joey>
<joey> do every time now but </joey>
<connor> for the first week where i didn't know </connor>
<connor> that every time i missed a package i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> hey joey can you uh call them up and </connor>
<connor> tell them tell them i'm gonna be </connor>
<joey> homeless it was like a month where like </joey>
<joey> i was calling up these guys more often </joey>
<connor> for his packages than i was for my own </connor>
<joey> packages </joey>
<connor> i felt so bad but i was like i need the </connor>
<connor> package </connor>
<connor> and again like if okay let's trace it </connor>
<connor> back again </connor>
<connor> and i hate being like nice to a trillion </connor>
<connor> dollar company like amazon but </connor>
<connor> without them and like the english </connor>
<connor> because you can just change it to </connor>
<connor> english right yeah they also they have </connor>
<connor> support in english i'd know because i've </connor>
<connor> had to like return items and stuff </connor>
<garnt> like it's literally no different from </garnt>
<garnt> using like </garnt>
<garnt> amazon in in the uk except maybe </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes the translations don't work </garnt>
<garnt> one for one but </garnt>
<connor> you can pretty much find what you want </connor>
<connor> like you can type it in english i mean </connor>
<garnt> we basically furnished our entire yeah </garnt>
<connor> my whole house </connor>
<garnt> using amazon yeah because like they they </garnt>
<garnt> have like a japanese like here which is </garnt>
<garnt> called nitori </garnt>
<garnt> um but you know you have to go to the </garnt>
<garnt> store you have to register you have to </garnt>
<connor> put in your address </connor>
<connor> and all that stuff takes like 20 days to </connor>
<connor> deliver anything yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah how crazy is that like if you want </connor>
<connor> to like their version of like </connor>
<connor> this ikea here as well but it's very </connor>
<connor> expensive uh </connor>
<connor> if you buy stuff from nitori which is </connor>
<connor> like their version of ikea like you said </connor>
<connor> it's it's like there's a lot there's a </connor>
<connor> lot of waiting time like 20 days i think </connor>
<connor> for some products </connor>
<connor> yeah and i was like i can't wait 20 days </connor>
<connor> for a bed like i want to sleep </connor>
<connor> like what do you what do you mean let me </connor>
<joey> just live on the hard floor </joey>
<connor> what am i going to do and yeah just uh </connor>
<joey> also any advice to someone moving to </joey>
<connor> japan </connor>
<connor> please make sure your house has ac </connor>
<connor> before you move in because i didn't </connor>
<connor> and i had to pay i think it's like two </connor>
<joey> thousand yeah your previous tenant like </joey>
<connor> jacked the [ __ ] he [ __ ] gutted the </connor>
<connor> whole place </connor>
<connor> he took everything he took the light </connor>
<connor> bulbs who leaves who takes light bulbs </connor>
<joey> oh yeah that's a frequent occurrence </joey>
<joey> you'll see like going into a new </joey>
<joey> apartment </joey>
<joey> there won't be any lights right right </joey>
<connor> you have to apply your own lights like </connor>
<connor> when i move out of a place i'll leave </connor>
<connor> stuff that i think is like </connor>
<connor> super generic that like you don't need </connor>
<connor> to think about like i'll just </connor>
<connor> you know i'll i'll leave the bulbs in if </connor>
<connor> i have like a door mat i'll just leave </connor>
<connor> the door mat like </connor>
<connor> whatever they can throw it away if they </connor>
<connor> don't want it yeah like they they took </connor>
<connor> everything </connor>
<connor> everything so i removed everything i </connor>
<connor> moved in with no ac </connor>
<connor> and it was getting really cold and i </connor>
<connor> think there's one cosplay video </connor>
<connor> where i was like [ __ ] freezing during </connor>
<connor> this video </connor>
<connor> and i was getting like naked for it and </connor>
<joey> i was like </joey>
<connor> not only that but you were in like the </connor>
<garnt> coldest routine yeah yeah yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<garnt> tommy yeah the time which retains no </garnt>
<connor> just like before you move just like </connor>
<connor> please before you move into an apartment </connor>
<garnt> please make this sure there's ac there </garnt>
<garnt> otherwise that's going to be a huge cost </garnt>
<garnt> when you move so i had to pay </garnt>
<garnt> 2 000 plus dollars for two ac units </garnt>
<garnt> jesus and </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know what i'm gonna do with that </garnt>
<garnt> if i haven't moved back to the uk like i </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> i just can't i guess i'll bring it right </garnt>
<garnt> uk could use ac </garnt>
<garnt> but like okay let's see you pay for an </garnt>
<garnt> apartment right you you paid for the ac </garnt>
<garnt> in that apartment right like that's part </garnt>
<garnt> of your bill whereas i had to pay </garnt>
<garnt> 2 000 independently so that you could </garnt>
<connor> argue that my rent has gone up yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's just like dumb [ __ ] like that i </connor>
<garnt> didn't consider no so </garnt>
<garnt> okay one thing that was different for me </garnt>
<connor> is how much </connor>
<connor> i thought i would go to akihabara versus </connor>
<connor> how much i </connor>
<connor> actually go to akihabara yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because every time we haven't gone since </connor>
<joey> you guys moved </joey>
<joey> i know i mean i'm so sad like because i </joey>
<joey> remember </joey>
<connor> like when every time we visited here on </connor>
<connor> holiday we'd spend </connor>
<garnt> half our time there or something like </garnt>
<garnt> that of course going to akihabara it's </garnt>
<connor> the proper way to be experienced i'm not </connor>
<connor> proud to admit that </connor>
<connor> i it was like it was like the like </connor>
<connor> imagine every single anime convention </connor>
<joey> shoved into one it is like a mecca of </joey>
<joey> weed it is just </joey>
<garnt> the holy land for yeah but then you move </garnt>
<garnt> here and you're like </garnt>
<garnt> man akihabara is not only a long way </garnt>
<garnt> away but you can get a lot of [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> better online </joey>
<joey> for cheaper if you can figure out </joey>
<garnt> japanese not only that but there are </garnt>
<joey> just like cities that </joey>
<joey> just are better for like all-round like </joey>
<joey> experiences like that's why i love like </joey>
<garnt> ikebukuro yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> because with akihabara you only go there </joey>
<joey> for anime yeah if you don't if you want </joey>
<joey> to do something else then it's </joey>
<joey> not the best place to go but if you go </joey>
<joey> somewhere like ikebukuro you can still </joey>
<joey> shop for anime figurines you can still </joey>
<joey> go you know go </joey>
<joey> go down autumn road exactly exactly go </joey>
<connor> go to the animate there which is also in </connor>
<connor> akihabara yeah but then you could also </connor>
<connor> go to an izakiya afterwards or go </connor>
<connor> karaoke or you know </connor>
<connor> a lot of other things it's a lot more </connor>
<garnt> varied there's a lot more variation </garnt>
<garnt> outside of akihabara than um </garnt>
<joey> if you want just not to downplay </joey>
<joey> akihabara though no it's amazing don't </joey>
<garnt> like it </garnt>
<garnt> no like you every weeb should go to </garnt>
<garnt> akihabara yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's an experience you'll have a </joey>
<connor> spiritual awakening when you go dark but </connor>
<connor> it is crazy like the first time you go </connor>
<joey> there yeah holy [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> why this is what i dreamed about three </connor>
<connor> sega arcades </connor>
<garnt> right next to each other why it's just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like information overload right </garnt>
<joey> you get blasted with so many lights with </joey>
<garnt> so so much [ __ ] just around you you </garnt>
<connor> don't know where to go </connor>
<connor> you can spend an entire [ __ ] day in </connor>
<garnt> one store </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah yeah easily because if you want </connor>
<connor> to look for deals right and figures </connor>
<connor> you've got to pull out the whole </connor>
<connor> shelf because they they hide [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> way in the back and sometimes you might </connor>
<connor> find that one deal that is like all you </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] talk about yeah </connor>
<connor> when i found that one thing for like 20 </connor>
<joey> bucks yeah if you want to get a figurine </joey>
<joey> for like the best price </joey>
<garnt> you got to like create like a google </garnt>
<garnt> spreadsheet all right this store has it </garnt>
<garnt> for this price but the store down there </garnt>
<joey> so you gotta like keep track of </joey>
<connor> everything yeah and then you ultimately </connor>
<connor> realize that it's not it's cheaper than </connor>
<garnt> on uh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a price like it's way better </garnt>
<garnt> to buy online yeah even amazon here like </garnt>
<connor> the figures are way cheaper sometimes in </connor>
<joey> the stores which is like weird see </joey>
<joey> because for me like amazon </joey>
<joey> itself was just like a huge revelation </joey>
<garnt> because we don't have amazon in </garnt>
<garnt> australia yeah wow you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what to think that we have how does a </garnt>
<garnt> country function </garnt>
<garnt> amazon we have ebay and we have like our </garnt>
<garnt> own version of amazon one called </garnt>
<garnt> gumtree which is just like oh we have </garnt>
<connor> gum trees yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> i used to like sell sketchy stuff to </garnt>
<garnt> like that's like the craigslist of </garnt>
<joey> amazon though yeah </joey>
<joey> pretty much but like gumtree i'm pretty </joey>
<garnt> sure it's an australian company </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like so we have gumtree and </garnt>
<garnt> ebay and that's it we don't have amazon </garnt>
<garnt> so like when </garnt>
<garnt> you know back when i was living in </garnt>
<garnt> australia and talking to like american </garnt>
<garnt> like youtuber friends who were like oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i just got that off amazon i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah about that they're selling it for </garnt>
<garnt> three times the price on ebay does that </garnt>
<garnt> count </garnt>
<garnt> i hated it so when i moved here amazon </garnt>
<garnt> was just like </garnt>
<garnt> whoa holy [ __ ] it's gonna arrive </garnt>
<joey> deliberately yeah [ __ ] hell yeah so </joey>
<joey> that was amazing </joey>
<joey> because the thing about akihabara i feel </joey>
<connor> it's more of an experience </connor>
<connor> than the actual you don't go there to </connor>
<connor> actually shop you go there for like the </connor>
<connor> akihabara experience because yeah like i </connor>
<connor> remember one of the biggest things that </connor>
<connor> i noticed going to akihabara is that you </connor>
<garnt> can walk into one shop </garnt>
<garnt> and you think it's like this single </garnt>
<garnt> store shop and you're just gonna come in </garnt>
<garnt> and come out </garnt>
<connor> and then it turns out to be seven </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] stories </garnt>
<connor> of shops and then you waste </connor>
<garnt> five hours there because there's so much </garnt>
<joey> stuff in this one shop </joey>
<joey> it's so tightly packed yeah oh by used </joey>
<connor> figures as well like </connor>
<connor> their version of used here is is a joke </connor>
<garnt> no everything is immaculate it's </garnt>
<garnt> immaculate like i feel bad now because </garnt>
<garnt> when i use something it's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] messy as [ __ ] i have books that </garnt>
<garnt> have like one single folded page or </garnt>
<garnt> something that i like </garnt>
<garnt> placed it down wrong and that that's </garnt>
<garnt> just unusable here yeah they'll be like </garnt>
<connor> damaged goods </connor>
<connor> looks very used and i'm like what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] used in the uk is like </connor>
<connor> if it's just barely functioning yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's fairly functioning </garnt>
<garnt> you know it probably has like an std i </garnt>
<joey> don't [ __ ] know what it's been </joey>
<joey> through </joey>
<joey> whereas here it's like have you opened </joey>
<garnt> the box yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah which is which is [ __ ] amazing </joey>
<joey> how connor you found probably the only </joey>
<joey> used product in japan </joey>
<joey> which was your fridge oh yeah can we </joey>
<joey> talk about that </joey>
<connor> yeah i'll let you tell the story but it </connor>
<connor> definitely was not in </connor>
<connor> immaculate shape you know we had spent a </connor>
<garnt> lot of money on moving right </garnt>
<garnt> as anyone knows moving is very expensive </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<garnt> and i've heard of these like sayonara </garnt>
<garnt> sales as they're called people who move </garnt>
<garnt> from japan </garnt>
<garnt> they basically sell all their stuff yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know and so they sell their stuff on </garnt>
<garnt> craigslist and meline kept telling me </garnt>
<joey> that a bookwalker kept telling me like </joey>
<joey> dude just buy a buy all your stuff on </joey>
<joey> craigslist it's like dirt cheap </joey>
<joey> and i thought well you know it's a great </joey>
<joey> idea maybe well call her out call her </joey>
<connor> out </connor>
<joey> yeah and uh you know i thought all right </joey>
<garnt> well you know japanese people are really </garnt>
<garnt> great with like </garnt>
<garnt> keeping their stuff immaculate so yeah </garnt>
<garnt> uh i order i speak to someone on </garnt>
<connor> craigslist the sauna fridge </connor>
<joey> and a laundry machine is that what you </joey>
<joey> call it </joey>
<garnt> i bought it for like it was like 50 </garnt>
<garnt> bucks right for a fridge and a long like </garnt>
<garnt> that's already a red ride right right </garnt>
<connor> but there was some people who were </connor>
<connor> giving their stuff away for free </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah because they were like we're </connor>
<garnt> gonna get charged by the the </garnt>
<garnt> local council oh yeah yeah to get rid of </garnt>
<garnt> the stuff so i didn't pay for anything </garnt>
<garnt> else not the moving fear or anything </garnt>
<garnt> so you were there with my house when it </garnt>
<garnt> turned up yeah like a guy from like new </garnt>

<garnt> five cockroaches </garnt>
<garnt> in my fridge it was like i was like holy </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] right no wonder they didn't want to </connor>
<connor> foreign </connor>
<connor> imagine being the only foreigner in your </connor>
<connor> building and that guy has cockroaches </connor>
<garnt> it's like the cleanest country in the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] world </connor>
<connor> i swear to god the [ __ ] who brought </connor>
<connor> cockroaches </connor>
<connor> so i bought a cockroach but i i [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> tore this fridge apart right yeah </connor>
<connor> i literally told you know like the felt </connor>
<connor> that you have on fridges though yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i tore all that [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> i took everything out i bleached the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] out of this thing like </connor>
<connor> this my house must have smelt like a </connor>
<connor> murder scene </connor>
<connor> right i bleached the hell out of this </connor>
<connor> thing and it was the most vile thing </connor>
<connor> like you know the the felt thing right i </connor>
<connor> was shaking it out and like maybe like </connor>
<connor> 100 cockroaches must have fell out </connor>
<connor> i don't even want to know the living </connor>
<connor> conditions of the person who sold me </connor>
<connor> this fridge but [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> if you ever watch this you are horrible </connor>
<connor> do not sell people your fridges if they </connor>
<connor> are </connor>
<connor> like how can you get cockroaches in the </connor>
<garnt> most cleanest country </garnt>
<garnt> that i've ever been to you're on the </garnt>
<connor> streets here and you don't see </connor>
<joey> any [ __ ] rubbish there are less </joey>
<joey> cockroaches in like the back of like a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] denny's yeah </connor>
<connor> then they were in your friends yeah like </connor>
<connor> i i so that was my first experience </connor>
<connor> buying used in japan </connor>
<connor> yeah and it was awful because i i just </connor>
<garnt> thought like god damn it like i just got </garnt>
<garnt> this house and i have cockroaches now </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and so i had to like scour my </garnt>
<garnt> whole apartment just making sure these </garnt>
<garnt> cockroaches didn't go anywhere </garnt>
<connor> and i and like months after i kept </connor>
<connor> finding one or two and i'm like </connor>
<connor> how i bleached everything like there is </connor>
<connor> no reason these things should be </connor>
<connor> existing as cockroaches one-on-one make </connor>
<joey> sure </joey>
<joey> you thought you got rid of them all this </joey>
<joey> still around so now i got rid of the </joey>
<joey> fridge because i just thought enough is </joey>
<joey> enough this thing looks </joey>
<joey> disgusting i threw it out yeah it wasn't </joey>
<joey> a nice looking freezer it was great it </joey>
<connor> looked like </connor>
<connor> it looked like something got like a </connor>
<garnt> homeless man with stapler your apartment </garnt>
<garnt> probably has a cockroach infection that </garnt>
<connor> you just put into </connor>
<connor> no no no no no it's it's i got it it's </connor>
<garnt> it's somewhere in the building i got </garnt>
<connor> them one </connor>
<connor> i got all those [ __ ] i'm just saying </connor>
<garnt> i spent i spent a lot of time that's </garnt>
<joey> what you think </joey>
<connor> so before we we end this episode i'd </connor>
<garnt> like to know </garnt>
<garnt> like especially from you because i know </garnt>
<garnt> i experienced this like yeah when you </garnt>
<garnt> announced that you moved to japan </garnt>
<garnt> because i kept mine secret for like a </garnt>
<garnt> month yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't tell anyone about the process </garnt>
<garnt> and he already told close friends but </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> just kind of dropped it down like i just </garnt>
<connor> kind of like made a tweet being like </connor>
<connor> live in japan now </connor>
<connor> what's up everyone's like what like what </connor>
<connor> reaction did you experience when you </connor>
<garnt> tweeted that i mean everyone just </garnt>
<garnt> assumed </garnt>
<garnt> that i was you know i was following that </garnt>
<joey> weeb dream that's </joey>
<joey> that we we talked about earlier where </joey>
<joey> just like oh you're </joey>
<joey> you're funny you're finally being the </joey>
<joey> final form of </joey>
<garnt> every weeb you're finally in japan </garnt>
<garnt> you're going to watch so much anime </garnt>
<joey> you're basically japanese </joey>
<connor> you know everyone assumes i could </connor>
<connor> already speak japanese because i was </connor>
<connor> moving to japan </connor>
<connor> really yeah yeah yeah people people </connor>
<connor> no no no no no no no i think i think a </connor>
<connor> lot of people </connor>
<connor> just rightfully just okay they're not </connor>
<garnt> rightfully i don't know i i would never </garnt>
<garnt> assume if someone moves to a country </garnt>
<garnt> they can automatically speak the </garnt>
<garnt> language but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i got so many comments people mean like </garnt>
<garnt> but you can't speak japanese </garnt>
<connor> so like why why would you move there and </connor>
<joey> i'm like i'm like i don't really it's </joey>
<connor> not really that much of an issue like </connor>
<garnt> i'm gonna learn it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah but it it it did become </garnt>
<garnt> an issue and it we it is an issue if we </garnt>
<connor> didn't have someone to help you </connor>
<connor> it is an issue but like if you have you </connor>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> agency or friends it's not a requirement </garnt>
<connor> yeah if you have amazon </connor>
<connor> jeff bezos shout out </connor>
<connor> is that all you got like everyone just </connor>
<connor> assumed you're like the weeb dream etc </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean i didn't get too much of </garnt>
<garnt> like a reaction apart from just </garnt>
<garnt> everyone was happy for me um everyone </garnt>
<connor> like wanted to know how i moved here or </connor>
<connor> like what i went through </connor>
<connor> yeah exactly now you know much of much </connor>
<garnt> of the advice i can offer </garnt>
<garnt> isn't too helpful because we were kind </garnt>
<garnt> of the first of our kind we were like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the first </garnt>
<garnt> some of the first youtubers to be able </garnt>
<garnt> to move here for being an annie tuber </garnt>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> basically we got so good at being a weeb </garnt>
<garnt> the japanese government allowed us to </garnt>
<garnt> continue being weaves and we're being </garnt>
<connor> paid </connor>
<connor> they gave us a visa for being a super </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] weeb </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah that's pretty much that's like </connor>
<garnt> a you know we're the anomaly we're we're </garnt>
<garnt> the exception </garnt>
<garnt> yeah in terms of i mean aki technically </garnt>
<joey> was you know no she was she was the </joey>
<garnt> first </garnt>
<garnt> i'm saying like we're one of them yeah </garnt>
<garnt> of course </garnt>
<garnt> of course yeah no it's it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> incredible how i mean i felt the same </garnt>
<garnt> way with argue but with you guys as well </garnt>
<garnt> that like wow </garnt>
<garnt> like attitude has gotten to that point </garnt>
<garnt> now yeah yeah yeah cause like </garnt>
<garnt> like you know even like three years ago </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it was [ __ ] unheard of </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right it's like oh yeah you talk </garnt>
<garnt> about anime on the internet for a living </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah good luck staying in your </garnt>
<garnt> country for the rest of your life right </garnt>
<garnt> but like now it's just like an actual </garnt>
<joey> viable like career option if you can </joey>
<joey> give back more than you take out yeah </joey>
<joey> there's no reason why </joey>
<connor> i guess a government agency would not </connor>
<connor> want to have that job there right yeah </connor>
<connor> if you're giving more money and you're </connor>
<connor> not doing any harm and you're respectful </connor>
<connor> like why wouldn't they want you yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's been really humbling to like </garnt>
<joey> actually </joey>
<joey> be working here officially yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> doing anime youtube and it's it's been </joey>
<connor> really weird </connor>
<connor> um especially talking to people who work </connor>
<connor> in the companies </connor>
<joey> you know what i mean yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> directly yeah how do you feel like your </joey>
<garnt> careers have been affected after moving </garnt>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> i mean i'm i think mine's like increased </joey>
<garnt> dramatically because now i do have </garnt>
<garnt> access directly </garnt>
<garnt> to a lot of these like yeah productions </garnt>
<garnt> like i i </garnt>
<garnt> like you know i knew like a lot of </garnt>
<connor> people in the industry quote unquote </connor>
<connor> while i was living in australia industry </connor>
<garnt> industry but like it is </garnt>
<garnt> a completely different story when you </garnt>
<garnt> move here oh no exactly because like </garnt>
<garnt> most of these japanese companies don't </garnt>
<garnt> know what the [ __ ] email is </garnt>
<garnt> no no and they they need they require </garnt>
<garnt> you to meet interviews oh no no like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah if you're going to do business in </garnt>
<garnt> japan you need to have a face-to-face </garnt>
<garnt> meeting </garnt>
<garnt> no email no [ __ ] zoom call no no </garnt>
<garnt> not even a phone call it's like you need </garnt>
<joey> to come to our office and we need to </joey>
<joey> make sure that you're a real person yeah </joey>
<garnt> exactly </garnt>
<garnt> exactly so it's it's it's it's all very </garnt>
<garnt> traditional here so to do business with </garnt>
<garnt> any anime company which is why </garnt>
<garnt> you know things move so slowly is that </garnt>
<garnt> you have to follow the tradition you </garnt>
<garnt> have to do that face-to-face meeting </garnt>
<garnt> they </garnt>
<garnt> they call a meeting for any [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> reason yeah exactly </garnt>
<connor> somebody sneezed in the office when you </connor>
<garnt> discuss whether this is a potential </garnt>
<joey> anthrax injection get hr on the phone </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean career-wise i guess for me the </joey>
<garnt> biggest thing is that like </garnt>
<garnt> i just want to experience something else </garnt>
<garnt> and also you know maybe learn another </garnt>
<connor> language </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah although it's it's painfully </garnt>
<connor> difficult to learn japanese </connor>
<garnt> um i just think getting more life skills </garnt>
<connor> can can only be a plus right like </connor>
<connor> if i continue doing what i was doing in </connor>
<garnt> the uk i was doing a lot of voice over </garnt>
<garnt> which sure i could probably go and maybe </garnt>
<garnt> go into that when i'm </garnt>
<garnt> yeah for some reason i stopped doing </garnt>
<garnt> youtube but i think i just want to learn </garnt>
<garnt> more skills in my life well i'm still </garnt>
<garnt> young as well right and while i'm still </garnt>
<garnt> open to doing things and putting myself </garnt>
<garnt> out there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and i think if anything from </garnt>
<connor> my career definitely like </connor>
<connor> that benefit of hopefully learning more </connor>
<connor> and making new connections with </connor>
<connor> you know maybe not the industry i don't </connor>
<joey> know what i'll go into but </joey>
<connor> i mean we've definitely made connections </connor>
<joey> as well just from being in a company </joey>
<joey> under </joey>
<joey> not even in the anime industry just like </joey>
<garnt> lots of industries you made people with </garnt>
<connor> that you never knew that you were a lot </connor>
<connor> of creatives right yeah a lot of cool </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> like i think the biggest barrier is like </connor>
<connor> the language barrier yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> japanese really needs to fix their </connor>
<connor> difficulty curve because you go from </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] playing animal </connor>
<connor> crossing when you're about to do the </connor>
<connor> eternal on nightmare </connor>
<connor> it's like like katakana and hiragana is </connor>
<garnt> like you're </garnt>
<joey> just playing animal crossing and then </joey>
<joey> suddenly you're doing like a no hit um </joey>
<joey> no hit run in dark souls or something </joey>
<joey> when kanji gets in and you're like </joey>
<garnt> pretty much what the [ __ ] is going on </garnt>
<garnt> this is not the difficulty curve i </garnt>
<connor> wanted and the problem is with like </connor>
<garnt> kanji at least not problem i mean it's </garnt>
<joey> it's really beautiful like the system of </joey>
<garnt> writing i've come to appreciate it more </garnt>
<joey> and more but it's like </joey>
<garnt> if you don't understand a baseline </garnt>
<connor> amount you just can't read anything </connor>
<garnt> yeah because the moment you do you're </garnt>
<joey> like what's wrong welcome to the past 25 </joey>
<joey> years of my life right </joey>
<joey> right and it's like it's not like you </joey>
<garnt> know if i was learning french where i </garnt>
<garnt> can sound it out and maybe like </garnt>
<garnt> i just can't like i'm like what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> is that thing and then you're like oh i </garnt>
<garnt> know what this kanji is </garnt>
<connor> turns out the kanji has five different </connor>
<connor> pronunciations and meanings </connor>
<connor> and you don't know which one's which </connor>
<connor> because you you just have to know that </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> it's just [ __ ] that's that's i think </connor>
<garnt> that's what's the most difficult right </garnt>
<garnt> is that like japan is like an </garnt>
<connor> anti-phonetic country right yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah you just have to know it </connor>
<connor> and that's why it's so difficult for a </connor>
<connor> lot of people i mean like i mean </connor>
<joey> i think i we know a lot of people who </joey>
<joey> can speak japanese but have not even </joey>
<joey> attempted to learn to reject no no no it </joey>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<joey> a completely different ballgame you know </joey>
<garnt> like even like </garnt>
<garnt> me having learnt it but pretty much my </garnt>
<garnt> first language </garnt>
<garnt> i still struggle with it every now and </garnt>
<garnt> then it is like a constant learning </garnt>
<garnt> process for me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like thank god that my mom did </garnt>
<garnt> whip my ass to like loner when i was </garnt>
<joey> little because jesus christ my life has </joey>
<joey> been </joey>
<joey> a million times easier that i can read </joey>
<garnt> it and understand it but </garnt>
<garnt> it's the one time when she said you </garnt>
<joey> appreciate it when you're older yeah you </joey>
<garnt> did actually appreciate it when you're </garnt>
<joey> older thanks mom </joey>
<joey> you helped build my career essentially </joey>
<connor> yeah everyone said that with welsh </connor>
<joey> didn't quite pan out i mean i appreciate </joey>
<connor> the culture but that's uh about as far </connor>
<joey> as a usefulness </joey>
<joey> but here's the question i want to ask </joey>
<garnt> you guys how well now that you've </garnt>
<garnt> experienced living here for what like </garnt>
<connor> eight </connor>
<joey> months essentially seven eight months </joey>
<connor> now how long do you intend to stay here </connor>
<connor> um that's a good question i i think i've </connor>
<garnt> lived here long enough to know that </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to live here forever right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i think there's just </garnt>
<garnt> at least right now and how japan is a </garnt>
<connor> lot of stuff that i just like don't </connor>
<garnt> gel with yeah yeah um i think i can </garnt>
<connor> definitely see myself </connor>
<connor> because i put a lot of time though yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah because i i've lived here for eight </garnt>
<garnt> months it feels it's felt like i've </garnt>
<garnt> lived here for a month </garnt>
<garnt> right i haven't even reached a service </garnt>
<joey> close to my final form </joey>
<garnt> like i want an anime reference i know </garnt>
<garnt> we've hardly talked about anime on this </garnt>
<garnt> podcast </garnt>
<garnt> but uh yeah i mean i still like i feel </garnt>
<joey> like i've </joey>
<joey> i want to explore japan more i want to </joey>
<joey> learn the language way more proficiently </joey>
<joey> than </joey>
<joey> than i have now um i want to take </joey>
<joey> advantage of it way more and i want to </joey>
<joey> experience japanese cultures more </joey>
<joey> because the one thing i the one thing </joey>
<joey> the one way </joey>
<joey> the one target i've set myself i should </joey>
<connor> say is being able to </connor>
<connor> like have a conversation with some of </connor>
<connor> the businesses and you know going to </connor>
<connor> some of the office parties </connor>
<connor> actually being able to participate in </connor>
<garnt> the conversations and everything like </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> um that's like my goal when it comes to </garnt>
<garnt> learning you know yes same i just want </garnt>
<connor> to be able to communicate yeah um </connor>
<garnt> and learn a bit of kanji right learn the </garnt>
<garnt> basics just so i can like figure out </garnt>
<garnt> you know what the mcdonald's menu says </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's uh i can definitely see it </connor>
<connor> being like a second home to me </connor>
<connor> right like a place where maybe i can </connor>
<connor> easily go back to it months periods but </connor>
<connor> i think like when i'm like 50 or </connor>
<garnt> whatever i think i'm gonna miss the </garnt>
<connor> how because i think i've been you know </connor>
<garnt> i've been really ingrained in british </garnt>
<garnt> culture of like how friendly and open it </garnt>
<connor> is </connor>
<garnt> yeah i really like that like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> especially in wales you just rock up to </garnt>
<garnt> a pub and you can speak to anyone there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah in the small pubs in wales like i </garnt>
<garnt> love that and i kind of missed that a </garnt>
<garnt> bit </garnt>
<garnt> um and i think yeah i think i i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know i mean i'm eight months in maybe in </garnt>
<garnt> a podcast in a year </garnt>
<garnt> we'll talk about it and our minds will </garnt>
<garnt> have changed yeah i want to live here </garnt>
<garnt> forever right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i think i think because right </garnt>
<garnt> now i feel like a foreigner still </garnt>
<connor> right and i think that's probably never </connor>
<connor> going to change but maybe at some point </connor>
<connor> i'll </connor>
<connor> i'll finally feel like i can call this </connor>
<joey> place home yeah yeah it might smoothen </joey>
<connor> out a little yeah </connor>
<connor> probably i imagine it will unless i get </connor>
<connor> arrested and convicted of a crime that i </connor>
<connor> wasn't accused of then i'm imprisoned </connor>
<connor> for 100 years </connor>
<garnt> but you know what's the odds of that </garnt>
<garnt> before we end the podcast yeah there was </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> one story i wanted to end on which is um </garnt>
<garnt> like it it completely shattered what my </garnt>
<garnt> preconceptions of moving to japan would </garnt>
<garnt> be </garnt>
<garnt> um and that was at one of the company </garnt>
<garnt> parties that we attended </garnt>
<garnt> with uh book walker in geeks plus and </garnt>
<garnt> you know kadakara in general </garnt>
<garnt> and it was to do with my fiance sydney </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so what happened was you know we </garnt>
<garnt> went to a company party everyone got </garnt>
<connor> pretty merry </connor>
<connor> and then we went to uh a bar </connor>
<connor> afterwards right i think </connor>
<garnt> a lot of people from from the company </garnt>
<garnt> some some pretty high up from the </garnt>
<connor> company </connor>
<connor> and then we started singing karaoke </connor>
<connor> together and so </connor>
<connor> sydney being the drunken little weeaboo </connor>
<connor> that she is such </connor>
<connor> she's such a weirdo unlike us unlike us </connor>
<connor> she went through her weeb phase right </connor>
<connor> she went proper cringy weeb face </connor>
<connor> unlike us i i just i love sydney i love </connor>
<connor> you should watch this yeah </connor>
<garnt> isn't she like kind of the face of like </garnt>
<connor> the cringy weeb </connor>
<joey> according to the instagram </joey>
<connor> so we start singing karaoke and she </connor>
<connor> starts singing the anna </connor>
<connor> and hannah and me and god were like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] are you doing like you're </connor>
<connor> in front of a lot of important </connor>
<connor> people in the company and she starts she </connor>
<connor> starts </connor>
<connor> bailing the [ __ ] uh and honey and </connor>
<connor> hannah ending </connor>
<connor> and then the [ __ ] businessman start </connor>
<connor> clapping </connor>
<connor> and cheering i start singing along </connor>
<connor> and i i know i'm just sitting there like </connor>
<connor> we were both shocked i couldn't believe </connor>
<connor> what i was seeing i looked at connor </connor>
<connor> and i'm like is this our slash it </connor>
<garnt> already happens right now </garnt>
<joey> are we living our 2007 tumblr posts yeah </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah yeah so like i i moved to </joey>
<joey> japan </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah i was i was in an important </joey>
<joey> business meeting a business party </joey>
<connor> and then we started singing the </connor>
<connor> yanahanna opening uh ending even </connor>
<connor> and then everyone started clapping and </connor>
<garnt> cheering and it was amazing </garnt>
<connor> i'm like this this is so surreal right </connor>
<connor> now it's literally </connor>
<connor> that happened post right it's like this </connor>
<connor> definitely happened </connor>
<connor> but it's great because i feel like when </connor>
<connor> you do sing stuff like that it's never </connor>
<connor> they're never like oh my god they're </connor>
<connor> trying to be like us they're like oh my </connor>
<connor> god they care about our culture that's </connor>
<garnt> so cool they really do yeah and i guess </garnt>
<garnt> i guess </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i want to end on which is </garnt>
<garnt> like i think </garnt>
<garnt> it's you know we started on the good </garnt>
<garnt> sides and the bad sides of japan but i </garnt>
<connor> think they really do </connor>
<garnt> care about our culture they're really </garnt>
<connor> they really care about learning more </connor>
<connor> and they are open to foreigners there's </connor>
<connor> just sometimes </connor>
<garnt> a lot of barriers that come between that </garnt>
<garnt> and i guess one of the biggest things </garnt>
<garnt> you can do is learn japanese because </garnt>
<garnt> that's such a </garnt>
<connor> they love it they love it if you speak </connor>
<garnt> japanese they love it to them it's like </garnt>
<connor> you've made an effort to learn that </connor>
<joey> yeah i mean and you know likewise right </joey>
<garnt> like if somebody comes over </garnt>
<garnt> to like your country and they can </garnt>
<garnt> understand your language like that's </garnt>
<garnt> immediately like </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah oh yeah if you could speak welsh </connor>
<connor> in wales like you're immediately like </connor>
<garnt> like love because like what people in </garnt>
<garnt> wells welsh can't even speak whales </garnt>
<garnt> welsh people can't even speak well right </garnt>
<garnt> like it's i can imagine it's like one of </garnt>
<garnt> those right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i think like you said right all </garnt>
<garnt> differences aside and all complaints </garnt>
<garnt> that we have like at the end of the day </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think i've ever spoken to a </garnt>
<garnt> person here who's been rude to me </garnt>
<joey> no and everyone has been super nice and </joey>
<joey> you know you might get stared at or </joey>
<joey> anything but that's not a place of like </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> aggression or anything they just they </joey>
<joey> just don't see it often and yeah at the </joey>
<joey> end of the day they're </joey>
<joey> really really nice the positives </joey>
<joey> definitely outweigh this oh 100 yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean i i'm just british right so to me </joey>
<joey> it's like one percent </joey>
<joey> one percent negative 99 positive i only </joey>
<connor> see this right that's what your raise is </connor>
<connor> british </connor>
<connor> exactly but overall it's it's an amazing </connor>
<connor> country and i'm glad that we have </connor>
<joey> i'm having a great [ __ ] time oh yeah </joey>
