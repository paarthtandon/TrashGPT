<garnt> - Like my family to this day still call me Gig. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm completely comfortable </garnt>
<joey> with just people calling me Gigguk or Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - If my parents call me Anime Man. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> I would think I was like disowned or something. </joey>
<joey> (both laughs) </joey>
<joey> - If they call me the Anime Zone on the other hand, </joey>
<garnt> then now we got a problem. </garnt>
<joey> (upbeat soft music) </joey>
<joey> - What's up you eccentric ecchi enthusiasts? </joey>
<garnt> Welcome back to another episode </garnt>
<garnt> of the Trash Taste podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Absolutely terrible. - Pretty awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm so sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look, it's gonna be a thing from now on. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, you guys have to just brace yourself </garnt>
<joey> every three episodes. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm always gonna open with something like that. </joey>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> Meilyne, our producer, stop making noise. </joey>
<connor> (both laughs) </connor>
<joey> Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - This is a professional production. </connor>
<joey> - You've ruined my intro. </joey>
<garnt> Goddamn it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Excuse me Meilyne, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought we- </garnt>
<joey> we have professionalism on this. </joey>
<joey> - Trash production on this Trash Taste Podcast. </joey>
<garnt> - I know right? - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, welcome to another episode </garnt>
<garnt> of Trash Taste where we talk about Trash Tastes </garnt>
<connor> in Anime and everything else in the world. </connor>
<connor> I'm your host, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, is that an intro now? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - My God, that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> that went from 'What the fuck are you saying?' </garnt>
<garnt> to 'Man this is a smooth ass intro'. </garnt>
<garnt> We didn't agree on any of this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a professional after all. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> and as always, joining me </garnt>
<connor> are the boys, Garnt and Connor. </connor>
<garnt> - Hey guys. </garnt>
<connor> - No nickname, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> Okay, okay </joey>
<joey> I'm the Hentai Kid and this is GiggUK Arizona. </joey>
<joey> And the 93% </joey>
<joey> - All right - All right </joey>
<joey> - You guys are on the subreddit have just been going crazy </joey>
<garnt> with those memes, right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, we don't pick them nicknames. </garnt>
<garnt> They pick the nicknames at the end of the day. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? - Exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> So, yeah guys, </garnt>
<garnt> what are we going to talk about today? </garnt>
<connor> Oh, wait. </connor>
<connor> You were thinking about something, all right? </connor>
<connor> - I watched- </connor>
<connor> - That you wanted to talk about </connor>
<joey> You were thinking something spicy to talk about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you talk about YouTube </joey>
<connor> but I think before we do that, </connor>
<connor> I watched "Perfect Blue" recently. </connor>
<connor> - Oh! </connor>
<joey> (group clapping) </joey>
<connor> - You broke your Satoshi Kon virginity. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm proud of you, I'm proud of you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unlike Garnt, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where if we bring up a show, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like "Yeah, you should watch it." </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt's gonna be like, "Whoof." </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually started watching "Dorohedoro", </garnt>
<garnt> - You actually did? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Everyone is breaking their cherries. </connor>
<connor> - I just thought because of the Full Metal Alchemist curse. </connor>
<connor> - They're no gonna to know that </connor>
<connor> because that was on the episode </connor>
<connor> where we recorded an episode </connor>
<garnt> and then the audio just wasn't recording apparently. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's the lost episode you'll not get to see </connor>
<joey> - I did like a 10 minute speech on </joey>
<garnt> why Dorohedoro was good and you should watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But no, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Perfect Blue, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> How did you find it? </connor>
<connor> - It was amazing. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I knew it was going to be good, right? </connor>
<connor> Everything I've seen of it </connor>
<connor> and the amount of works that its inspired. </connor>
<joey> It's obvious it was going to be good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, </joey>
<joey> I was kinda not ready for what I was going to watch </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - No one is when they're going to watch it. </joey>
<garnt> - Like it was a lot, </garnt>
<connor> some of the scenes are pretty whoof. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like how would you feel watching it today? </garnt>
<joey> Because this came out in, </joey>
<joey> I think 1995 or something like that. </joey>
<joey> Which 1995? 1997? </joey>
<joey> It came out in the nineties </joey>
<joey> - It's at least 20 years old. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How'd you feel it is now watching it </joey>
<garnt> for the first time in today's climate? </garnt>
<connor> - It's really creepy being like an online personality </connor>
<joey> watching a story about- - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Another online personality </joey>
<connor> - And that's, what's scary about it, right. </connor>
<joey> Is that the themes in that are just as prevalent today, </joey>
<garnt> as it was back then. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. - If not worse I feel </garnt>
<garnt> - No no, I feel like it's more relevant today. </garnt>
<joey> Over 20 years later than it was when it came out. </joey>
<joey> Do you wanna explain quickly what the story is? </joey>
<garnt> Cause it's been a while since I've watched it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I mean that's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> (both laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> It's a mindfuck, it's horror </garnt>
<connor> but it's essentially there's this girl who is an idol. </connor>
<connor> She then quits becoming an idol to pursue a career </connor>
<connor> in film acting. </connor>
<connor> But then, that's all sort of like a side plot, I guess. </connor>
<connor> But there's a guy who was obsessed with her. </connor>
<connor> And the whole point of the story is </connor>
<joey> that he is obsessed with the image of the celebrity </joey>
<joey> not the actual personality of the celebrity. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then it's kind of a story about how much </joey>
<joey> as an online personality or a celebrity, </joey>
<garnt> how much of your public persona do you own </garnt>
<connor> and how much of that do you have control over. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it actually you, who is the real you? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it who you perceive yourself as online? </garnt>
<connor> Or is it who you are as a person? </connor>
<connor> And the fact that this came out </connor>
<connor> in the nineties, where- </connor>
<connor> - It's way away ahead of its time. </connor>
<connor> - Like what the fuck right? </connor>
<connor> It predicted so much about how </connor>
<garnt> social media would work and our perceptions </garnt>
<garnt> of like online celebrities, </garnt>
<garnt> and how people are viewed online. </garnt>
<joey> And- </joey>
<joey> - It's just like Satoshi Kon's cinematography </joey>
<joey> is just so out of this world. </joey>
<joey> I love that scene, </joey>
<joey> the one scene I vividly remember </joey>
<garnt> is like when the stalker guy is </garnt>
<garnt> at the main character's concert. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he just hold his hand up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that was such a good shot. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is just so, so good </garnt>
<connor> because it's just such good imagery. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - Right. </connor>
<connor> - He was ugly as fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah </joey>
<joey> - He looked like a human beetle. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, so he's the bad guy." </connor>
<joey> - This boy was the OG ugly bastard. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Every ugly bastard was based off that guy. </joey>
<joey> - No kidding. </joey>
<joey> It's amazing. </joey>
<connor> Like it was, I feel like it's, again, like you said </connor>
<connor> it's so relevant at this time. </connor>
<connor> And I think anyone can- </connor>
<garnt> I think it's more relevant now </garnt>
<connor> than it wasn't when it come out. </connor>
<garnt> - And the way he pulled it off as well </garnt>
<connor> because it wasn't just a simple story. </connor>
<joey> It was weaved in with just pure top-class filmmaking. </joey>
<joey> Like, there was a point </joey>
<joey> when you don't notice the transition </joey>
<joey> but it transitions into, "Okay, what's real? </joey>
<joey> What's like her imagination? </joey>
<garnt> What's part of the film?" </garnt>
<garnt> Because one of the genius parts of this story </garnt>
<garnt> is that because she's like an actress as well- </garnt>
<garnt> - They use of the world of the acting. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - They use the world </garnt>
<garnt> of the acting and like the filmmaking </garnt>
<garnt> to blend into her real life. </garnt>
<garnt> So you don't know which scenes </garnt>
<garnt> are like really happening </garnt>
<joey> and which scenes are just being acted. </joey>
<connor> And its, it fucks with your mind. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause like there's three worlds, right? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause there's the real world, </garnt>
<garnt> the acting world </garnt>
<connor> and then the stuff </connor>
<connor> that she's seeing in her head. - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's so hard trying to like unwind all that. </connor>
<connor> And trying to figure out what's what. </connor>
<connor> But then I guess, </connor>
<joey> almost a certain extent, </joey>
<joey> you're not supposed to. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You're supposed to be confused. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's the fact that it's so blurry, </connor>
<joey> is what's showing you </joey>
<garnt> why this whole thing is so scary. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you don't even know watching what is real </garnt>
<connor> and what is not real. </connor>
<connor> And I feel a lot of that, </connor>
<connor> kind of like, theming in Satoshi Kon's movies </connor>
<garnt> really transitioned over to his latest stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> Did you ever watch "Paprika"? </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't - Yeah, I did, I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because Paprika, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, for those of you who don't know </garnt>
<garnt> it's literally- </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] My favorite spice. - [Joey] Anime inception. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's totally different </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like inception </garnt>
<garnt> is like a heist movie in a dream. </garnt>
<garnt> Satoshi. </garnt>
<garnt> Paprika is on a base level. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, they're both about dreams, </garnt>
<garnt> but Paprika is like 10 times more imaginative </garnt>
<garnt> in how he approaches its visuals, </garnt>
<garnt> when, in like, they're in the dream world, right. </garnt>
<joey> - And how he shows the dream world </joey>
<garnt> versus the real world is very much like in Perfect Blue. </garnt>
<garnt> Where you don't realize, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, we're in a dream world now." </garnt>
<garnt> Or, "Oh, we're back to reality." </garnt>
<joey> And he does that </joey>
<joey> so seamlessly through the scenes. </joey>
<garnt> It's really incredible. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think Perfect Blue is my favorite Satoshi Kon movie. </garnt>
<garnt> A close second is Millennium Actress. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Millennium Actress, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I saw a lot of people </garnt>
<connor> said that he was his best work. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I think he took a lot of elements </garnt>
<garnt> from Perfect Blue in terms of, </garnt>
<garnt> so Millennium Actress, isn't a mind fuck. </garnt>
<joey> But it basically tells the story of this girl </joey>
<joey> through film basically. </joey>
<joey> So they, I think, she was- </joey>
<joey> The name's Millennium Actress. </joey>
<joey> She's an actress. </joey>
<connor> - She's an Actress. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, was she an actress? </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, wait a minute, of course she was. </garnt>
<garnt> Damn. </garnt>
<joey> - Millennium farmer. </joey>
<garnt> (both laughs) </garnt>
<joey> She was a farmer. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But they show this woman's whole life story, </garnt>
<garnt> just through various films that she shot </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe she didn't shoot them. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's just such, again, </garnt>
<garnt> it's such a seamless transition between </garnt>
<garnt> real life or the 'Canon' real life of the movie </garnt>
<garnt> and a movie in a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> If that makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's good. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I mean, I also feel like </garnt>
<connor> because of the position we're in, </connor>
<connor> it was like a weird, uncomfortable. </connor>
<garnt> - It was Uncanny Valley, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Some parts were a little bit too close. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah </connor>
<connor> - Just like, cause obviously there's the personality </connor>
<connor> that we show in our videos, right? </connor>
<connor> And then it's our own personality. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't have to deal with it too much, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like I'm pretty close </connor>
<joey> to what I am in real life. </joey>
<joey> - I think all three of us are. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I definitely have some friends </joey>
<joey> who are YouTubers </joey>
<garnt> who are very, very different to how they're perceived </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure Emily won't mind me saying. </garnt>
<garnt> Emirichu, she's like a </garnt>
<connor> story time animator, right? </connor>
<connor> Very like this image of like pure, right, liken. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> Everyone thinks that she's like a Disney character. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - But like you hang out with her, </connor>
<connor> she's a normal person, right. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if you follow her on Twitter, </joey>
<joey> you will see it. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Right </joey>
<joey> And this is the thing right is that </joey>
<joey> I know she gets stressed out with it more than most. </joey>
<garnt> And she's told me a few times that she's like </garnt>
<garnt> "I wish you would just stop treating me </garnt>
<garnt> like a Disney character." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Like people won't let us say things. </connor>
<connor> Cause when she says things like, oh you know, </connor>
<connor> that are a little crude maybe. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - She gets a lot of comments being like </connor>
<connor> this is not how you're supposed to act. </connor>
<connor> - That's not you. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, people literally tell her, </garnt>
<garnt> "You shouldn't act this way. </garnt>
<garnt> This is not how you're supposed to act." </garnt>
<garnt> And it's weird 'cause it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have to deal with that. </garnt>
<garnt> If I do whatever the fuck I want </garnt>
<connor> and people like ha ha funny, you know, teehee. </connor>
<connor> But like it's really creepy seeing people- </connor>
<joey> - It was weird for me- </joey>
<connor> - Force these things onto her </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was really weird for me </connor>
<joey> because I met Emily IRL </joey>
<joey> before I saw any of her YouTube stuff. </joey>
<garnt> So, it was- </garnt>
<joey> Me watching her videos, it was kind of </joey>
<garnt> a reverse shock for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, wow, you're so pure </joey>
<connor> - Not to say that Emily is like crazy or anything. </connor>
<garnt> She's just a normal person. </garnt>
<garnt> - No no - No </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't met her personally but </garnt>
<garnt> - People are more dimensional than a Disney persona. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - She doesn't even try </garnt>
<garnt> and put that on herself, right. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just because you know </garnt>
<connor> - That's just get how the audience perceive it. </connor>
<connor> It's funny because Sydney or sydsnap, </connor>
<connor> She has like the opposite problem where </connor>
<connor> people come to me and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Why Sydney acting so hyperactive </connor>
<garnt> and so loud in her videos?" </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, the big difference between Sydney in a videos </garnt>
<garnt> and Sydney in real life </garnt>
<garnt> is that Sydney in her videos has a volume button. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - It's true. </connor>
<connor> - I can physically turn her down when she's in a video. </connor>
<garnt> I can't physically turn it down in real life. </garnt>
<connor> - You can put like a normalization. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<joey> Can't do that in real life. </joey>
<connor> That shit peaks. </connor>
<connor> - You can't put a limit on her voice, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and it's just, it was really uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> Like I said, it's uncomfortable at times. </connor>
<connor> It's really like unnerving. </connor>
<connor> And again, if take away anything from this </connor>
<connor> you should watch Perfect Blue. - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - If you consume any form of online content. </connor>
<joey> - Did you watch Requiem For A Dream? </joey>
<connor> - No, no I haven't </connor>
<joey> - Or Black Swan? - Black Swan? </joey>
<connor> - I saw a bit of Black Swan. </connor>
<connor> I got really bored and I turned off. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, a lot of, </joey>
<joey> I mean, both of those movies are </joey>
<garnt> heavily, heavily influenced. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I show that Black Swan was heavily inspired. </connor>
<garnt> - It's funny that you fell asleep during that one. </garnt>
<garnt> Because Black Swan is basically the same storyline </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] I think I was in a plane and you know, </connor>
<garnt> sometimes you're in a mood, </garnt>
<connor> where you're like, </connor>
<joey> "I don't wanna watch a movie, but what else can I do?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - I'm thinking I put Black Swan on. </joey>
<joey> I was like, it was not the right environment </joey>
<joey> to watch Black Swan. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Very dark room. </joey>
<garnt> - 10 inch LCD, eating those shitty pack nuts. </garnt>
<connor> - I have this genre I like to call </connor>
<connor> 'Plane Movies', </connor>
<connor> where it's like movies </connor>
<connor> you would never ever watch, </connor>
<connor> but when you're in a plane, </connor>
<connor> you're like "Eh". </connor>
<connor> - Every Jason Statham movie. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I know - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> Every Mission Impossible. </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure </connor>
<connor> his career and the Rock's career </connor>
<connor> are solely being funded by planes. </connor>
<joey> Like no one. </joey>
<joey> Why else would you watch that fucking shark movie </joey>
<joey> that Jason Statham was in? </joey>
<joey> - Which shark movie? </joey>
<joey> - The whole movie was him fighting a shark. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - What's the movie called? </connor>
<garnt> - Are you serious? </garnt>
<connor> Is this a movie? </connor>
<garnt> - It's on the screen right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sharknado 4. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just a movie </garnt>
<garnt> and I can't describe any of it to you. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just, the whole thing was just this really- </garnt>
<connor> - Jason Statham versus the shark. </connor>
<joey> - It's like imagine Jaws on steroids </joey>
<joey> and that was like the whole movie. </joey>
<joey> It was so bad. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, was it called like Megalodon? </joey>
<joey> - That was like mega-something? </joey>
<connor> Megachad? </connor>
<connor> (group laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Megachad - Megachad </joey>
<joey> - Jason Statham is Megachad. </joey>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> There's just too much fucking, oh my god. </connor>
<joey> So many movies, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> Jason Statham movie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, I agree with the airplane movies thing. </joey>
<joey> I've, I've seen more movies on planes </joey>
<joey> than I think I have in, like, cinemas and my own room. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel bad for anything </connor>
<connor> I watch on a plane. </connor>
<joey> Cause I feel like it automatically </joey>
<joey> loses two points out of 10. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Just because I watched it on the plane. </garnt>
<garnt> - No no, I know what you mean. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I never have a positive memory </connor>
<connor> of binge-watching a series. </connor>
<garnt> - But, sometimes I just wanna fucking watch </garnt>
<joey> some shitty thing. </joey>
<joey> Like, have you ever had like before a plane, </joey>
<garnt> like you download something you actually wanna watch, </garnt>
<garnt> like an anime or a series of manga. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Ah, I don't really feel like watching. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me watch this shitty five out of 10 show that's, </garnt>
<garnt> or movie that I would never watch </garnt>
<garnt> under any other circumstances. </garnt>
<joey> - Mine is worse because I go on a plane being like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, I can work on a script because I have my laptop." </connor>
<connor> - Do you work on a plane? </connor>
<connor> - No - Okay </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - I plan to every single time. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Okay, I'm gonna like work on a script </connor>
<connor> or I'm going to play this game. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to finish it while I'm </connor>
<joey> on this 10 hour flight to the US. </joey>
<joey> But instead, now I'm going to watch this really crap </joey>
<joey> documentary about this topic that I just do not care about." </joey>
<joey> But because you're forced to watch it </joey>
<joey> by the end of it I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "That was very informative." </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> I learnt a lot, </connor>
<joey> I'm glad I watched that. </joey>
<connor> - People who can like work on planes, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how they do it. </connor>
<joey> - I can do it on domestic flights. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I can't, it's a, </connor>
<garnt> you're a fucking madman </garnt>
<garnt> if you can work on planes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think you have to be a sociopath. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry. </garnt>
<joey> I guess I'm a sociopath. </joey>
<connor> (both laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I think so, I think so. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, right? </connor>
<connor> Because, with airplane movies, as you said- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - It's always like two points lower than </connor>
<connor> if you would watch it in a cinema. </connor>
<connor> - Cause it's not a comfortable viewing experience- </connor>
<connor> - No, it's not. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is all the more reason why I wanna re-watch Maquia. </garnt>
<joey> Because I watched Maquia on a flight. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck is Maquia? </joey>
<garnt> - You never heard of Maquia? </garnt>
<garnt> - I would never watch an anime film </garnt>
<garnt> that I want to watch on a flight. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember hearing people </garnt>
<garnt> watching Your Name </garnt>
<garnt> when it was like out in theaters </garnt>
<garnt> and the only chance they had to watch it, </garnt>
<garnt> was on the flight. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I feel so sorry for you. </garnt>
<joey> Why?"- - I know </joey>
<joey> And that's exactly same experience I had </joey>
<garnt> with Maquia because I missed it in the cinemas </garnt>
<connor> before I went to US but it was on my flights </connor>
<garnt> to US so I was like, "Perfect, </garnt>
<garnt> I can finally watch it." - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - But in my head I was like, Oh no, </garnt>
<garnt> I have to watch it on this tiny screen </garnt>
<garnt> with these crappy ass headphones that I had </garnt>
<garnt> because I didn't bring my proper headphones. </garnt>
<garnt> But I watched it on the flight. </garnt>
<garnt> And I cried like a fucking bitch. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> Which makes me more, </garnt>
<garnt> it makes me more inclined to go watch it </garnt>
<garnt> on like a big screen. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I know if I watched it on the big screen, </garnt>
<joey> I would be crying even more like a bitch. </joey>
<connor> - You just get a text </connor>
<connor> from like row three, seat C, </connor>
<connor> that's like "Why you crying so damn loud?" </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> Like that meme template. (both laugh) </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, if you don't know </joey>
<connor> do you know Maquia? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know - I know, I do </garnt>
<garnt> - So Maquia is this movie that was, </garnt>
<joey> it wasn't advertised anywhere. </joey>
<garnt> Was it? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> It was very under the radar. </joey>
<garnt> I think it was by PA. </garnt>
<garnt> Was it by PA Works? </garnt>
<garnt> No. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not PA Works, </joey>
<garnt> it was written and directed by Okada Mari. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - What was it about? </garnt>
<connor> - She did Onahana- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - She's basically known as the anime writer </connor>
<connor> who is known for like all those series that make you cry. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. She's like the master of making you cry. </joey>
<joey> And Maquia was the movie that </joey>
<connor> it was a first directing debut. </connor>
<connor> But the thing is it wasn't advertised anywhere. </connor>
<connor> Even in Japan, it wasn't advertised anywhere. </connor>
<garnt> And I only found out about it because my friend, Nabi. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - Let me know about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But, he let me know like two days </garnt>
<garnt> before it was gone from the cinema. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, cool. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess I can't watch that. </garnt>
<garnt> But then it was on the flight and yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But that's the thing, right, </garnt>
<garnt> when you watch something that's really funny </garnt>
<garnt> or very emotional on a plane- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't just burst out </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah you can, just fucking cry. </connor>
<joey> - I can't do that - I'm in the middle seat. </joey>
<joey> Dude, I've cried on a plane. </joey>
<joey> - I was literally doing like a, this </joey>
<garnt> Like trying to hold it in (others laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - They're like, "What you want? Chicken or beef?" </joey>
<garnt> (imitating sobs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Beef - Beef </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And I didn't want this white guy sitting </joey>
<joey> next to me to think, </joey>
<joey> "What the f-, this guy's crying to a cartoon?" </joey>
<joey> (group laughs) </joey>
<joey> "What the hell's wrong with you?" </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> - What's like the riskiest thing </garnt>
<garnt> you've ever watched in the flight? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean risky? </joey>
<connor> - I saw a guy on a plane watching porn one time. </connor>
<garnt> (others laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I thought that was impressive. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember the first time I watched Prison School </garnt>
<garnt> on a flight. </garnt>
<garnt> That was, like, </garnt>
<garnt> - How the fuck did you do that? </garnt>
<connor> - I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, I really want to watch Prison School." </connor>
<connor> I downloaded it- </connor>
<connor> - You should put explain how bad Prison School is </connor>
<connor> so that people can appreciate this. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, Prison School is like, </connor>
<connor> before there was inter-species reviewers basically, </connor>
<connor> there was like Prison Schools. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's one step away from Hentai. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, for like how far you could push ecchi. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, there's a scene where </garnt>
<garnt> I think the guy pisses on the girl accidentally, </garnt>
<joey> - As you do, as you do. </joey>
<joey> - As you do, as you do. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking- </joey>
<connor> - I hate it when that happens. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's hilarious though, it's hilarious. </connor>
<connor> It's one of the funniest </connor>
<garnt> ecchi anime that I have seen. </garnt>
<garnt> It was out like a few years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> Wasn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> How old was it when it came out? </garnt>
<joey> - Twenty </joey>
<joey> seventeen, twenty eighteen. - Yeah, cause I was a big fan </joey>
<garnt> of the manga. </garnt>
<garnt> It was one of the few manga </garnt>
<garnt> that literally had me crying-laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - When I was reading it. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, I got to watch this when it was out but- </garnt>
<joey> - Except it has a very unfortunate ending. </joey>
<garnt> Doesn't it? - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't read to the ending yet. </garnt>
<joey> - Don't spoil for me. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a bit unfortunate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I was the same. </garnt>
<garnt> I read the manga and I thought this is </garnt>
<garnt> one of the funniest things I've ever read. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah </garnt>
<connor> - And then just, Oh man, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to say too much about the ending, </connor>
<joey> but it's, eh, not that great. </joey>
<garnt> - So I was watching- </garnt>
<garnt> - How the hell though did you watch that on the plane? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so- </garnt>
<joey> - Cause I felt ashamed watching it by myself </joey>
<joey> - Wait, wait, wait, hold up. </joey>
<connor> Where were you sitting? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I was sitting on the end, right. </connor>
<connor> And I had an iPad. </connor>
<connor> - Oh that's, wait so, </connor>
<connor> the whole, everybody walks gets to see it. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't care about them, right. </garnt>
<connor> I care about the people sitting next to me. </connor>
<connor> - Why? Why do you not care about them? </connor>
<connor> - And the person sitting next to me </connor>
<garnt> was like a little kid. </garnt>
<garnt> (group laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - You're like, "You're gonna love this </connor>
<connor> when you're older." </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - So, at the beginning, right. </connor>
<joey> I was like, okay, </joey>
<garnt> I was trying to be discreet about it, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> I was on the iPad. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was trying to watch it as close </garnt>
<garnt> to my face as possible, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know, like trying to be discrete. </garnt>
<garnt> So- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just putting blinders on this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> And then it was like a 10 hour flight, </joey>
<joey> so my arms are going to get tired. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah </joey>
<joey> - And then about like an hour in, </joey>
<joey> I was like, I don't fucking give a shit anymore. </joey>
<garnt> And, you know, if the kid wants to look over, </garnt>
<garnt> there's some culture in his life. </garnt>
<joey> - You wanna be a Chad kid, watch this. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, it wasn't the only thing I watched, as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause the new season of Game of Thrones was on as well. </garnt>
<connor> So I thought, you know what, </connor>
<connor> I've already watched Prison School- </connor>
<connor> - Finish it off with a Brazzers video, why not? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Why not, why not. </connor>
<connor> - I mean they can't blame me that time </connor>
<connor> because it was on their selection, right? </connor>
<connor> So, you know, </connor>
<joey> I'm sorry kid </joey>
<joey> or you're welcome kid. </joey>
<garnt> - He's probably a massive fan of the show now, </garnt>
<connor> he's like, (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> thank you for opening me up to the world. </joey>
<joey> - Do you get to the point on a long ass flight, </joey>
<connor> it's like a flight that's over like eight hours, right? </connor>
<connor> Where you have one hour left </connor>
<connor> and you need to pick something to watch. </connor>
<connor> And that one hour of content is like the worst watching. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even bother with that kind of stuff. </joey>
<connor> If there's less than two hours remaining on a flight, </connor>
<connor> I just don't even bother starting it. </connor>
<connor> - What do you do? </connor>
<connor> - I either read a book or sleep. </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like that Twilight zone- </garnt>
<joey> - It's awful, I hate that- </joey>
<joey> - I hate it because it's the same </joey>
<joey> when I know I have to do something in an hour </joey>
<joey> and I'm like I could squeeze in an anime episode </joey>
<connor> in this time. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like yeah. - But I never do. </garnt>
<garnt> - I watch a random Family Guy episode, I guess, </garnt>
<connor> cause I hate myself. </connor>
<connor> Big Bang Theory episode right after, why not? </connor>
<joey> - No, Big Bang Theory is never worth it. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] No, no, no. - It's not, you know that. </joey>
<joey> - When I see people watching that on the plane </joey>
<joey> for like six hours straight, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "What's wrong with you?" </joey>
<joey> (both laughs) </joey>
<joey> What went wrong? </joey>
<connor> Where this is the pick. </connor>
<joey> - I couldn't escape from The Big Bang Theory thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Because of my surname. </joey>
<connor> - Bazinga! - Yeah, so many people </connor>
<joey> are like, "Oh look, The Big Bang Theory." </joey>
<garnt> (both laughs) Or like, shut the fuck up. </garnt>
<garnt> No. </garnt>
<joey> - Already hate the show. </joey>
<joey> - First of all, it's pronounced BAZINGA. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah - All right </joey>
<joey> - Goddamn it, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's gonna be on the Reddit now, </joey>
<garnt> that's gonna- </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember seeing you tweet the other day </garnt>
<joey> that you don't realize how much porn is on Twitter </joey>
<joey> until you see it in public. - There's a lot of porn. </joey>
<joey> There's like, apart from what you like as well, </joey>
<garnt> we've already touched that topic. </garnt>
<garnt> But you know, when you're sitting at home on a couch </garnt>
<garnt> you're just scrolling past, </garnt>
<joey> you're just immune to this shit. </joey>
<garnt> When you're sitting in like a crowded train, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a grandma to your left, </garnt>
<garnt> like another little kid to your right. </garnt>
<joey> And you're like, "Man, there's just a girl </joey>
<joey> sucking dick right on my timeline." </joey>
<joey> (both laughs) </joey>
<joey> And it's just out there. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, like IRL? </joey>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<garnt> - Like real life stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, hentai, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was gonna say it like "What accounts are you following?" </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Jesus, I though I was bad, goddamn. </joey>
<connor> - The reason I tweeted that </connor>
<connor> was the other day I was on the train. </connor>
<garnt> And like that was, you know, it's the worst right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where the image is cropped- - No, I was about to say that </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> - And you're like, what's this? </garnt>
<garnt> And you open it, </garnt>
<joey> and it's just like. </joey>
<joey> Cause what it was was two people, right? </joey>
<joey> Two people dressed as cowboys- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah </connor>
<connor> - On the top, right? </connor>
<connor> So I opened it, </connor>
<connor> and then they were naked from the bottom down. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Riding each other, like anime characters. </connor>
<connor> And because I was asleep, </connor>
<connor> it took me like four seconds to realize </connor>
<connor> what I was looking at. </connor>
<connor> But, like, I was holding my phone like here. </connor>
<connor> So the two women who were sitting next to me definitely saw. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh yeah, </connor>
<connor> I should not show this." </connor>
<connor> But okay, when I moved to Japan the first week or so, </connor>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh God I shouldn't share </garnt>
<garnt> what I'm looking at on my phone." </garnt>
<joey> But now I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Hentai, hentai." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah - I don't give a shit. </connor>
<garnt> How do you think I find the time to like all the hentai? </garnt>
<garnt> I do it on my commute. - [Connor] You have to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause there's always that picture </garnt>
<garnt> where you're like, this is a 50/50. </garnt>
<joey> Am I going to see titty? </joey>
<joey> Or is this just an ecchi picture? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Am I gonna see- </joey>
<garnt> - Where it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it gets cut at like top of the cleavage, right. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah yeah, like that right? </joey>
<garnt> - I have nothing or </garnt>
<garnt> - And the facial expression, it isn't like ahegao. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like neutral right? </joey>
<joey> - It's just like a slightly blushing picture. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> (voices overlapping) </garnt>
<garnt> - I know exactly what you're talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just like a slightly blushing picture </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, this could be </garnt>
<garnt> just a really nice piece of artwork </garnt>
<garnt> or it could be just be somebody getting dicked from behind. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I have to click to find out, right. </garnt>
<joey> (group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's like Reddit 50/50. </joey>
<connor> - Do you remember that time? </connor>
<connor> Can we tell that story? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can tell him. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Garnt had like this photo of like </joey>
<joey> a woman who was in a Naruto costume. </joey>
<joey> And it was heavily cropped. </joey>
<garnt> So all you could see was like </garnt>
<connor> her shoulder upwards. </connor>
<connor> - It was Tsunade. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause how I found it was </connor>
<garnt> Revel House, </garnt>
<garnt> Dee, </garnt>
<garnt> Deesidia, </garnt>
<garnt> had liked it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought, I saw the top half. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought that's a good cosplay. </garnt>
<connor> - It looked like a wholesome cosplay. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, I'll like that one. </garnt>
<connor> - We were all sitting in the living room, right. </connor>
<connor> Then Sydney barges and is like, </connor>
<connor> "Garnt, what the fuck have you liked?" </connor>
<garnt> (group laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And we were all like, why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Whoa, what's going on? - What's going on? </garnt>
<garnt> So, we go and we expanded this image </garnt>
<connor> and like 70% of it is like her with her ass, </connor>
<connor> like full bare ass out. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> So, the exact pose she was doing, </connor>
<garnt> it was like top half was like this </garnt>
<garnt> but then the bottom half was just- </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> The bottom half was just like this. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing continues) </connor>
<connor> - He was like, wait what? </connor>
<connor> So he goes, opens it. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Oh shit." </connor>
<connor> And we all, we all went to it to Twitter to look. </connor>
<connor> Because it's like six of us in a living room. </connor>
<connor> And we all went to see it. </connor>
<connor> We all start fucking pissing ourselves. </connor>
<connor> (laughing). </connor>
<connor> Cause Garnt had basically retweeted this. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - It was so funny. </connor>
<joey> I nearly fucking lost it. </joey>
<joey> I was laughing about that for like a week. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna find the photo. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Speaking of weird stuff on Twitter, </joey>
<joey> you've been watching some weird stuff on Youtube. </joey>
<garnt> - Speaking on weird stuff on twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> stuff has been happening on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah. </connor>
<connor> YouTube, every single YouTube community seems to be on fire. </connor>
<connor> We're doing pretty well there, Anime YouTube right? </connor>
<joey> - Surprisingly - So far. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's kind of wild right now. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I don't really want to get into the specifics </connor>
<connor> of all of that. </connor>
<connor> It's all speculation. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure, if you guys have a Twitter account, </joey>
<joey> you know what's been- </joey>
<garnt> - Basically the whole of YouTube is on fire </garnt>
<joey> and, every day you log in on Twitter, it's just- </joey>
<joey> - Twitter's just adding the fuel to the fire. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, it's just, at this point it's just exhausting, </garnt>
<connor> right? </connor>
<connor> - It's so hard to keep up with. </connor>
<connor> And like, I obviously don't wanna sit here and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck the victims" or whatever. </connor>
<garnt> I'm not trying to say that. </garnt>
<connor> What I'm trying to say is it's so exhausting. </connor>
<garnt> - As like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> shall I say consumer or just person on the internet, </garnt>
<garnt> there's just too much information for me to be able </garnt>
<garnt> to keep up with everything that's going on now. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's only so many tweet logs I can read it in a day </garnt>
<garnt> before I just start to the big sigh starts to kick in. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - I wanna care, right. </joey>
<connor> I want to support all these people who are coming out </connor>
<joey> with all these statements, </joey>
<garnt> but I also don't wanna help a situation </garnt>
<garnt> that I don't understand anything about. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And then also there's just, there's just too many. </connor>
<connor> It feels like our brains are being like D-DOSed right now, </connor>
<connor> by information. - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - Cause like not only is the world ending with Coronavirus </connor>
<connor> which we've just forgot about </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - You know, we gonna deal with all this shit </connor>
<connor> and figure that out and it's just, oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> It's impossible. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't even know how the drama channels </garnt>
<garnt> are keeping up with all the stuff that's coming out. </garnt>
<joey> - They're just frothing at the mouth, aren't they? </joey>
<garnt> With all this content. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, I made a joke on Twitter saying, </joey>
<joey> "The only people benefiting from 2020 </joey>
<garnt> are the drama and news channels." </garnt>
<garnt> But, it really does seem that's the case, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - Because everybody else is just </garnt>
<garnt> so sick of what's happening. </garnt>
<joey> And I feel bad saying that, all right. </joey>
<garnt> Because as you said- </garnt>
<connor> - I just wish it didn't happen. </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? - Right, right </garnt>
<garnt> - It's tragic that the bar </garnt>
<connor> for being a somewhat decent content creator </connor>
<joey> is just not touching kids now. </joey>
<joey> - It's just keeping your genitals in your pants. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah </joey>
<connor> - You know, it's sad that it's come to that. </connor>
<connor> (Connor chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - All right. - It's just, all right. </connor>
<connor> I guess just making content is not even thing anymore. </connor>
<joey> - Because, remember like five years ago </joey>
<joey> when it was controversial to have a sponsor in your video. </joey>
<garnt> And now it's kind of "controversial", </garnt>
<garnt> if you do something really weird with kids. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like, what's - I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, YouTube changed and evolved so much. </garnt>
<joey> Thinking about, just like, </joey>
<joey> I'm going on like a content perspective. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know I mean? </joey>
<joey> There's always this kind of like YouTube-meta </joey>
<joey> about the content you should make. </joey>
<joey> Cause I remember like commentary channels </joey>
<joey> or drama channels didn't really exist like five years ago. </joey>
<garnt> Because, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I remember thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> 'Why would anyone be interested in YouTubers </garnt>
<garnt> talking about other YouTubers?' </garnt>
<connor> - I guess it's like the way that, you know, </connor>
<garnt> the reason why TMZ exists, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - It gets to a point, right. </garnt>
<garnt> where YouTube got so big </garnt>
<garnt> and you can only like there people- </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I basically only watch YouTube at this point. </garnt>
<garnt> I watch anime, I watch Netflix but. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like 80% YouTube, right, what I watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It would make sense that then a market would appear </garnt>
<garnt> for being able to just talk about YouTuber drama </garnt>
<connor> and dumb shit that YouTubers do. </connor>
<connor> Cause, my God, do they do some dumb shit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and a lot of them, unfortunately, </joey>
<joey> get away with a lot of it as well. </joey>
<garnt> - And I think it's just because there was not as many eyes </garnt>
<joey> on just what YouTubers were doing back then. </joey>
<joey> Cause it was just like, </joey>
<joey> why are you talking about a YouTuber? </joey>
<garnt> They're no celebrity. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't have any power. </garnt>
<joey> - As much as all these YouTubers </joey>
<joey> like to wish they were a celebrity. </joey>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We're main stream. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I don't know, like Twitter is just been. </connor>
<connor> I've always enjoyed Twitter </connor>
<connor> because I've always said to people, </connor>
<joey> it's kind of a nice in-between of social and business. </joey>
<joey> At least in terms of like as a YouTuber using Twitter. </joey>
<connor> - I don't understand what, like, </connor>
<joey> a regular person would need Twitter for. </joey>
<joey> - Right? - I think it's a cesspit. </joey>
<joey> - I never used Twitter before I started YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, nor did I. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never cared about Twitter or anything like that. </garnt>
<connor> But, I think as a YouTuber, it's kinda of- </connor>
<connor> - You have no choice. </connor>
<connor> - It's almost required at this point. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Next to a YouTube channel. </joey>
<joey> - I doubt we would be friends, right, </joey>
<garnt> if we didn't all meet on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, nah. </garnt>
<connor> - Socialize with each other. </connor>
<joey> - To me, Twitter is just basically Facebook for </joey>
<joey> influencers online, I guess. </joey>
<connor> I get to follow what everyone else is doing. </connor>
<connor> Not just in my own circles, </connor>
<connor> but in like other circles as well. </connor>
<connor> Because that's basically the only reason </connor>
<garnt> I go on Twitter apart from </garnt>
<garnt> ludes and memes, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Porn and you know </garnt>
<connor> - The rest of Twitter just makes me </connor>
<connor> (sighs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Sometimes, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - I totally get it. </connor>
<garnt> - You can't have a debate anything, </garnt>
<joey> really, on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - No, no </joey>
<joey> - And people aren't interested in </joey>
<connor> having their opinions changed. </connor>
<joey> - The moment you join in on an argument you've already lost. </joey>
<connor> - That's why I like, obviously, </connor>
<connor> we're all human, we all have opinions on things. </connor>
<connor> But I think the reason </connor>
<connor> why most of us just don't comment on anything. </connor>
<joey> Cause it's like if you comment, you lose. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you get involved, you lose. </joey>
<connor> - We can't be fucked </connor>
<connor> joining on this losing battle, right. </connor>
<joey> It's just a waste of energy. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, if I want it to get involved, </joey>
<joey> I don't think Twitter is the right platform- </joey>
<joey> - No, no - To get involved. </joey>
<joey> Like a lot of things, like some things yeah definitely. </joey>
<joey> But I feel like there are other platforms </joey>
<garnt> or other means that can, </garnt>
<connor> that you can use - Yeah, definitely </connor>
<connor> - To get involved. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's just like, </garnt>
<connor> it's crazy how even the most agreeable statements </connor>
<connor> can become controversial on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> Like I saw, someone who was just like, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, don't fuck kids." </joey>
<joey> And there was somehow people in the comments. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - How dare you? </joey>
<joey> - Somehow, there was someone commenting like, </joey>
<connor> as a playing devil's advocate, </connor>
<connor> it's like what? </connor>
<joey> This is just like drink water. </joey>
<connor> I thought this was a thing </connor>
<connor> that everyone was just understood was the thing to do. </connor>
<connor> But, somehow - Unfortunately common sense, </connor>
<joey> nowadays, it's not as common as we'd like to think it is, </joey>
<connor> all right. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why I just, again, even if I think </connor>
<connor> me commenting on something or like, </connor>
<garnt> getting involved with a drama, it's like a slam dunk. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, it's not worth it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's like four people who are like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know though. </connor>
<garnt> - You could say you got to drink water to survive </garnt>
<garnt> and people would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "But I like drinking Coke." </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> "Can I not do, are you telling me that I can't drink Coke?" </garnt>
<connor> - You fucking right wing. </connor>
<garnt> You like water- </garnt>
<garnt> - Coke once water, </garnt>
<connor> right? </connor>
<connor> - It's just, I hate it so much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's unfortunate - It's kinda why, </connor>
<connor> I just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> switch off and post my occasional memes </connor>
<connor> to Twitter and get on with my YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - I feel for me, </joey>
<joey> it's been like that for the past couple of years. </joey>
<connor> And it's just kind of gradually </connor>
<joey> gotten worse and worse until today. </joey>
<joey> I mean, before I wouldn't hesitate </joey>
<connor> to post an opinion about something, </connor>
<connor> regardless of how controversial was. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I notice, </connor>
<connor> you don't really post your opinions much anymore. </connor>
<connor> - No, because every time I do- - You got a lot of shit. </connor>
<connor> - There's always some group of people </connor>
<garnt> who's just so quick to coming on to me like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, no, you're a terrible person </garnt>
<garnt> for saying this very personal opinion." </garnt>
<joey> - You are, Joey. </joey>
<joey> (both laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, apparently, according to the Internet I am. </joey>
<joey> And now I just, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> There's so much, as you said, </joey>
<joey> there's so much I want to say </joey>
<garnt> but I guess that's the double-edged sword </garnt>
<garnt> of having a big following. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah </connor>
<connor> - And a quote-unquote influence on the internet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I think I've become content with </connor>
<connor> not having to say my opinion. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you look at like JK Rowling and you're like </connor>
<connor> please, stop. - Yeah </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Please stop saying your opinion, right. </connor>
<connor> But like, that's the thing, right. </connor>
<connor> You get famous or whatever </connor>
<connor> and you think my opinion deserves to be heard. </connor>
<connor> It's a right for it to be heard. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, shut the fu- </connor>
<connor> No one gives a fuck about what you think. </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes no one gives a shit. </joey>
<connor> - I think like that's the biggest reality check </connor>
<connor> as a YouTuber is like just learning </connor>
<garnt> that no one gives a fuck of what you think. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause just make videos for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty much. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Cause I mean like, for me, </connor>
<joey> I see myself the same way as I did like 10 years ago, </joey>
<joey> we're all just fucking normal guys </joey>
<joey> who had like the same fucking life </joey>
<joey> as most other people watching this. </joey>
<garnt> And I went through fucking university. </garnt>
<garnt> No one gave a shit about my opinion back then. </garnt>
<garnt> Why would people give a shit about my opinion now? </garnt>
<connor> Because I have shitty opinions on Anime. </connor>
<connor> That just doesn't make sense to me, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - I just don't think my opinion is better than anyone's. </garnt>
<garnt> I think my opinion is just as shitty as some people. </garnt>
<joey> - And isn't that hilarious how so many people </joey>
<joey> who are against like channels like us </joey>
<joey> who are so quick to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, he thinks that his opinion is so much more grander </joey>
<joey> than everybody else's because he has a large following. </joey>
<joey> He has influence on the internet." </joey>
<joey> And yet we never say or mean that ever. </joey>
<joey> Like they're putting words in our mouth. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it happens. </connor>
<joey> I just kind of accepted that stuff happens like that </joey>
<garnt> but I don't get too beat up about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's part of like you said </garnt>
<garnt> the double-edged sword of </garnt>
<garnt> having a very large audience. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we could not talk to this large an audience </garnt>
<garnt> if they were like in real person, there in real life. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're going to get like, </garnt>
<garnt> something you're gonna say is gonna </garnt>
<garnt> inevitably get misconstrued </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And some people are just not gonna like you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - We talked about it last time. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a hard thing to learn </connor>
<connor> that you're just gonna have to accept that </connor>
<connor> you're not gonna be universally liked. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's weird. </connor>
<connor> But, you know, what's a one good example </connor>
<garnt> is that I remember. </garnt>
<garnt> you know when you first start uploading videos </garnt>
<garnt> when you got that first dislike and you were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Huh? </garnt>
<connor> Huh! </connor>
<connor> Whomst disliked this? </connor>
<connor> Tell me thy name." </connor>
<connor> You know, you're like, you want to find out </connor>
<joey> why they disliked it. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then like, </joey>
<joey> if you're looking at like down here right now, </joey>
<joey> you can see like 120 or like 300 or a thousand, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how many views we have, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You just accept really quickly </joey>
<joey> that you're gonna have </joey>
<connor> like 200 dislikes straight away. </connor>
<connor> and you don't know why. - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why 30 people disliked my video </connor>
<connor> when it goes live, but it happens to everyone. </connor>
<connor> And I want to know why. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> But it's something that as a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> you just come to accept. </connor>
<connor> But I guarantee if any of you start a YouTube channel, </connor>
<connor> you'll know when you get that first disliked. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's gotten sting and you're going to be like, </connor>
<joey> "Argh!" </joey>
<joey> - But, I've always said to people who, </joey>
<joey> because so many people </joey>
<joey> when I go to panels or conventions or whatnot. </joey>
<joey> The question that I'm sure all three of us get asked </joey>
<joey> is 'How do you start a YouTube channel?' </joey>
<joey> Like 'What tips do you have </joey>
<joey> for a beginning YouTube channel?' </joey>
<joey> And I've always said to people </joey>
<connor> that the moment you start getting dislikes in your video </connor>
<connor> is when you know you've made it. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> It's, because it's true. </garnt>
<joey> Because now- - It's actually true </joey>
<joey> - Because- </joey>
<connor> - Or you're fucked up </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, or you fucked up really bad. </joey>
<joey> But, if your video start to get </joey>
<garnt> maybe like one or two dislikes, it's like, you know- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe 10 times the amount of likes. right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then that means you know you've made it, </garnt>
<garnt> because now you're reaching a wide enough audience </garnt>
<joey> that you won't be able to please everybody. </joey>
<joey> And that's the end goal really for content creators, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh definitely. </joey>
<joey> - Because I think it's kind of futile </joey>
<joey> that there are some content creators out there </joey>
<joey> who are just really desperate to try and please everybody. </joey>
<joey> And I always just want to tell those people, </joey>
<joey> "Dude, it's not gonna work." </joey>
<joey> Like, you just have to accept </joey>
<joey> that if you're on the internet, </joey>
<joey> people are going to hate you for no reason. </joey>
<joey> And you just have to accept that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like it's, I mean, you read the comments, right. </connor>
<joey> And you see that some people make really odd conclusions </joey>
<joey> from your behavior. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - That are really odd and general </joey>
<joey> and someone, no matter what you do, </joey>
<connor> and what kind of personality you show, </connor>
<connor> one person is going to perceive it in a bad way. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. - Like it's gonna happen- </connor>
<garnt> - Like, if we were just to take </garnt>
<garnt> all the videos where we've collaborated, </garnt>
<garnt> apparently Connor's like manically depressed. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt And Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Because I just have a face </garnt>
<connor> where like naturally, I always get this in person. </connor>
<joey> People think I'm mad at them, </joey>
<connor> but I just have a face naturally that's just like. </connor>
<joey> - You just have a - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You just have a resting bitch face. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I've always had that since I was like a kid- </joey>
<joey> - But, there's always that one comment when it's just like, </joey>
<joey> "Why is Connor so depressed?" </joey>
<joey> - It's got like a thousand upvotes, right? </joey>
<connor> - "Is he just not happy to be there? </connor>
<connor> - It was on like your Engrish video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah </connor>
<connor> - Where it's like, okay, </connor>
<connor> people like "Yo Connor, not, like, super energetic." </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's not my video. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to be that asshole </connor>
<connor> who's like "It's about me." </connor>
<connor> You know, it's like, if I'm on like Joey's channel, right. </connor>
<connor> Joey's doing his intro, </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to try and interject. </connor>
<connor> It's his fucking intro. </connor>
<connor> - You gonna be like "Hello guys" </connor>
<connor> - I'm not so self-centered </connor>
<connor> where I think that I'm on someone else's video </connor>
<connor> that I have to be the center of attention. </connor>
<connor> I'm there to be on Joey's channel. </connor>
<connor> Right, - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I don't see it as like, I need to entertain. </connor>
<joey> - We're not all like Guy Fieri every episode. </joey>
<connor> - I'll contribute when I can join in. </connor>
<garnt> But I'm not gonna cut you off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - Yeah, right </garnt>
<garnt> - It's your channel, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it would piss me off </garnt>
<connor> if someone was like trying to really </connor>
<connor> show me up on my own channel. </connor>
<connor> Like bro, come on, we're collabing, </connor>
<connor> just be normal. </connor>
<connor> - This is my channel, alright. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Know your place. </joey>
<connor> - Because wouldn't be weird, right, </connor>
<connor> if you're doing a video with someone, </connor>
<connor> let's say you're a new YouTuber </connor>
<connor> and your friend comes over, </connor>
<connor> and, you're like, let's make a video. </connor>
<connor> And your friend is like his normal self. </connor>
<connor> The moment that camera turns on, </connor>
<connor> he's like, "Yo, what's up?" </connor>
<connor> You're like, "Wow, what the fuck man." </connor>
<connor> (Joey And Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> "What happened?" </connor>
<connor> That would be weird, right. </connor>
<connor> Cause obviously I'm not like that all the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah </connor>
<connor> - It's just something that's like, I don't know, man. </connor>
<connor> Okay, question for you, </connor>
<connor> I get this every single time I do </connor>
<connor> like a panel at convention. </connor>
<connor> I get the question that goes, </connor>
<connor> "How do you deal with hate?" </connor>
<garnt> Because I'm of the philosophy, </garnt>
<garnt> you never deal with it, </garnt>
<garnt> you just come to accept it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - Yeah </garnt>
<connor> - Right, you just learn to just get over it. </connor>
<connor> Do you remember how you- </connor>
<garnt> - No, like that's like a very, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like I feel very passionate about this </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like there's no right answer for this. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like the right answer is that </garnt>
<garnt> we just basically got to check ourselves online </garnt>
<garnt> and just don't be a fucking dick. </garnt>
<garnt> All right, because it's unfortunate, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I get this </garnt>
<garnt> I get asked the question a lot as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And every creator I've talked to, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no solution, right. </garnt>
<garnt> You just get used to it, right. </garnt>
<garnt> You just, you just got to ignore it, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And to me, that's fucking insane. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey And Connor laugh) Cause that's not a solution. </garnt>
<garnt> That's a coping mechanism, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's the only thing we can do </garnt>
<garnt> when we have to deal with hate. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure she won't mind if I share this </joey>
<connor> but Jessica Nigri- - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Really good friend of mine. </connor>
<joey> I asked her this- - Damn, is that a flex? </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) - Anime flex. </connor>
<joey> I asked this question to her because </joey>
<joey> when she blew up, </joey>
<joey> she was getting noticed by everybody. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time, when you blow up in that sense, </joey>
<joey> you also gain a lot of haters unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> That's just how it works, right. </joey>
<joey> And so I remember, </joey>
<joey> I think Aki asked her the question of, </joey>
<joey> "How do you, how did you get through that?" </joey>
<joey> Because we all saw, as a third person, </joey>
<joey> just how brutal her haters were- </joey>
<joey> - She got a lot of hate. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, she got a lot of hate in her primetime. </garnt>
<joey> And so Aki asked her, she was like, </joey>
<garnt> "So, how do you like deal with it?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I think Jessica said it in the most perfect way. </garnt>
<garnt> And she just said, "It's not that you deal, </garnt>
<garnt> you do end up dealing with it, </garnt>
<garnt> but it never stops hurting." </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, it- </garnt>
<joey> - And I think that just perfectly sums it up, </joey>
<joey> you learn to deal with it </joey>
<joey> but it never stops hurting. </joey>
<joey> Every time, if you see that one hate comment, </joey>
<connor> that's just, it just hits you in that, </connor>
<connor> the worst spot possible. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like you'll learn to deal with it </connor>
<joey> because you've seen so many examples of it. </joey>
<garnt> - But, no matter how immune you are, </garnt>
<joey> there's always that one comment every so often </joey>
<joey> that comes up that you're just like. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Aww. </connor>
<connor> - "Oh, that just ruined my whole day." </connor>
<connor> And I thought I was above this, </connor>
<garnt> but you're never above it. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] No, you're never. </connor>
<connor> - I'm a person who I'd say, </connor>
<joey> I'm not self-conscious about many things. </joey>
<joey> I'd say, on average, for people I speak to </joey>
<joey> there's maybe like one or two things </joey>
<joey> I'm self-conscious about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, - And it's just like. </joey>
<joey> Dude, they consider whatever they want, </joey>
<joey> but if they hit that one thing </joey>
<garnt> that I was worrying about that one day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That shit hurts. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<joey> - I think one story that I've experienced </joey>
<joey> on like a secondhand experiences. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure Sydney is fine with me telling this story </joey>
<joey> is that she was, she became a meme. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This was back when cringe culture was like at its prime. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So she made like, she made a video when she was a kid, </joey>
<joey> that was like, it was kind of </joey>
<joey> like a parody of like yanderes </joey>
<connor> and just like the anime weeb kind of girl. </connor>
<connor> But it was to the point </connor>
<connor> when people couldn't tell that it was satire. </connor>
<connor> - Cause they don't know the personality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah </connor>
<connor> They don't know the person. </connor>
<garnt> She wasn't really a YouTuber back then. </garnt>
<garnt> She was just a girl on the internet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Girl who uploaded a video. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> Then years later, Leafy featured it in a video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I remember that </connor>
<connor> - And that just fucking blew up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah </connor>
<connor> - She became a meme and I like, </connor>
<garnt> I was on YouTube at this point. </garnt>
<garnt> So I know like the right and wrong things </garnt>
<garnt> that you can do online. </garnt>
<garnt> But even seeing it from a secondhand perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like, it was hard. </garnt>
<garnt> Because she'd wake up </garnt>
<garnt> and she would just get death threats every single day. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to just delete Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> delete Facebook, because it got to the point when people </garnt>
<garnt> from her school were messaging her about it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how widespread it was. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I've never talked about this publicly </garnt>
<garnt> but it was fucking hard. </garnt>
<garnt> Because like I love Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> and like I did not know the right way </garnt>
<garnt> to deal with it. </garnt>
<joey> So, what I did was I was like, </joey>
<joey> okay, this is the only way </joey>
<joey> I could make it a bit better. </joey>
<joey> So I wrote like a parody video for her, which is </joey>
<joey> if you've seen Sydney's video called like </joey>
<joey> "How 2 be a Tsundere" or something along those lines, </joey>
<joey> where she basically satirizes it. </joey>
<joey> That was my way of trying </joey>
<joey> to help her get out of it. </joey>
<joey> Because you know on the Internet, </joey>
<joey> if you say something is bad </joey>
<joey> or if you say you're hurting, </joey>
<joey> that's only going to make it 10 times worse. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I tried to deal with it </joey>
<joey> by just trying to make a joke out of it. </joey>
<joey> And to an extent, it worked. </joey>
<joey> But to this day, </joey>
<joey> Sydney still like sometimes </joey>
<joey> she gets notifications on her Facebook </joey>
<joey> or her Twitter and </joey>
<joey> it's just... </joey>
<joey> It affects her. </joey>
<joey> It never went away. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, I bet. </joey>
<joey> - Because we went through like a whole year period </joey>
<joey> where she was just afraid of social media. </joey>
<joey> Because she was afraid of opening up a message, </joey>
<joey> and then someone new was like mocking her </joey>
<garnt> or someone she knew personally was mocking her. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is why I like, feel really strongly </garnt>
<garnt> about this because I don't feel like there's a right way </garnt>
<garnt> you can deal with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No. </garnt>
<garnt> - The only way we can deal with it </garnt>
<garnt> is just to make sure that we, as a community, </garnt>
<garnt> don't act shitty online. </garnt>
<garnt> And just know that there is a person </garnt>
<garnt> behind that avatar and we can, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so easy to forget, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the times, even for us, you see a number, </garnt>
<garnt> we see our view counts, </garnt>
<garnt> and we're just like, that's just the number. </garnt>
<connor> But like behind every number, </connor>
<connor> behind every avatar, </connor>
<connor> there is someone there. </connor>
<connor> And especially with what's been going on online nowadays, </connor>
<connor> you know I mean, and some of the stuff </connor>
<connor> that's been happening on Twitter and YouTube recently. </connor>
<connor> I think it's super important that, </connor>
<connor> we as a community, try to just act better. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because there's no way to regulate this. </joey>
<joey> So the only way I can think of </joey>
<garnt> is just to promote just acting better </garnt>
<garnt> and being better online. </garnt>
<joey> - Since when did it become so hard </joey>
<joey> for people on the internet to just act </joey>
<joey> like a normal fucking human being? </joey>
<connor> - It's... </connor>
<connor> weird </connor>
<connor> because the mentality people have is just strange. </connor>
<garnt> Like my old housemate used to do, like, K-pop dance videos. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, there may be like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> like 20-30 comments on most videos. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember there was one time when someone said </garnt>
<joey> that she looked like chubby in one of the dances. </joey>
<joey> And then she replied being like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then this person replied saying, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, I never thought you'd see it." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's the thing, right. </connor>
<connor> - That's the weird mentality </connor>
<connor> that I think some people have </connor>
<connor> where they think, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, they're never gonna see this." </connor>
<connor> Like, no, we'll see it. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - [Joey] Will see it. </connor>
<connor> - And I think every YouTuber has said that </connor>
<connor> time and time again. </connor>
<connor> We see it, we see it. </connor>
<connor> But then a part of me is like, </connor>
<connor> 'Is that like a bad thing to say </connor>
<connor> that we gonna see it?' </connor>
<garnt> Because then is that gonna make them comment more? </garnt>
<garnt> I just feel like this is a... </garnt>
<garnt> This is a problem that's never going to have a solution. </garnt>
<garnt> - No </garnt>
<garnt> - Except that just, </garnt>
<connor> maybe if we keep repeating the message of </connor>
<connor> "Be a little careful." </connor>
<garnt> Cause, I'm not going to get mad or upset about anything. </garnt>
<garnt> I might get a little bothered, but I'm gonna be fine. </garnt>
<garnt> But- - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - With some of the unfortunate stuff </garnt>
<connor> that has happened recently with, you know, </connor>
<connor> a lot of online personalities, some taking their own life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly </connor>
<connor> - It's really, it's pretty terrifying that </connor>
<connor> to think that maybe some of my friends </connor>
<connor> might not be able to handle that, right. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and that's why, </joey>
<joey> I think I'm sure we can all agree that </joey>
<joey> we all very strongly advocate for mental health </joey>
<joey> among YouTubers. - [Connor] Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And there's a reason why </joey>
<joey> so many YouTubers do have mental health issues. </joey>
<joey> Is because of stuff like this. </joey>
<joey> - Because of this. </joey>
<garnt> Cause we're never like, </garnt>
<joey> us, </joey>
<joey> just as human beings, </joey>
<garnt> evolution never taught us how to deal with </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> 50 million people sending you a clown emotes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. - You know what I mean. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't learn this in school. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no </garnt>
<garnt> - You just have to learn through trial and error. </garnt>
<garnt> And unfortunately, a lot of the times, </garnt>
<garnt> some people are just not psychologically equipped </garnt>
<garnt> to handle a certain amount of hate. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or a certain amount of backlash or anything like that. </garnt>
<joey> And yeah, I mean, you know. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you ever find that we like, </garnt>
<connor> did you ever like do YouTube or like watch YouTube videos </connor>
<connor> to like escape real life sometimes? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what it was. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But, like now sometimes you feel like </joey>
<joey> you have to switch off Twitter </joey>
<joey> and switch off YouTube and escape that in real life. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. - You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - Like isn't that messed up? (Garnt chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a bit weird - It's weird </garnt>
<garnt> cause it's so easy, </garnt>
<connor> just like going back to Satoshi Kon, right. </connor>
<connor> It is totally like getting sucked into another world. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah. - Right? </connor>
<connor> It is a separate world where you exist in that world. </connor>
<connor> And the best way I can describe getting a lot of hate </connor>
<garnt> is it just, I don't know why, but it just feels suffocating. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - You could be sitting in your living room. </garnt>
<garnt> No one's there, but you could just feel suffocated </garnt>
<joey> just with all these comments being thrown onto you. </joey>
<joey> It's really hard </joey>
<garnt> and there's no right way to deal with it as a person. </garnt>
<joey> You just- </joey>
<joey> - Because isn't it interesting that </joey>
<connor> we could upload a video and it get 200 dislikes </connor>
<connor> and we're saying, "Oh, it's only 200 people." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But if you think about it in real life, </connor>
<joey> that's like walking into a fully packed cinema </joey>
<joey> and all those people just immediately turning to you </joey>
<joey> and saying "Fuck you". (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> That's what it feels like. </joey>
<joey> That's what 200 dislikes looks like. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. - And it's so weird, </joey>
<joey> how so many YouTubers are just kind of numb to that now. </joey>
<joey> - It's also weird </joey>
<connor> 'cause there are a lot of YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who never got off the ground, </connor>
<connor> who I think should have. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because it really crippled them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know if she's will be okay with me </garnt>
<garnt> talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna fucking do it. </garnt>
<garnt> So, you know, like the 'Hit-Or-Miss' girl? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Remember that was a thing like two years ago? </connor>
<joey> - The one you interviewed? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, I should pretty introduce how I actually met her first </connor>
<connor> so that we can go into it. </connor>
<connor> So before she blew up as the Hit-Or-Miss girl, </connor>
<joey> she met me at a convention because she was a fan. </joey>
<joey> And one of my friends after she blew up </joey>
<joey> was like, "Yo, on her Instagram, </joey>
<joey> she's got a picture with you." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> I don't know this girl." </joey>
<joey> And then I went to an Instagram, </joey>
<joey> and sure enough, </joey>
<joey> she had a picture with me. </joey>
<joey> So I Dm'ed her and we were chatting. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Yeah, if you need any help with anything." </joey>
<joey> Cause normally when I speak to new YouTubers </joey>
<joey> or YouTubers who are blowing up, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Hey, if you need any help, </joey>
<joey> you know, with negotiating ad deals, </joey>
<joey> you need help dealing with anything. </joey>
<connor> Let me know, I'll give you advice. </connor>
<connor> I'll help you, get you all sorted." </connor>
<connor> It's chill - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Cause it's hard. </connor>
<connor> I wish someone had helped me. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So then, you know, she had all these plans </connor>
<connor> and stuff to make </connor>
<connor> content, </connor>
<joey> which I think she should have </joey>
<joey> because she was in a very rare position </joey>
<joey> where she could have gotten a career for, </joey>
<joey> at least like 5-10 years- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Off the fame, the level of fame that she had at that time </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was insane. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you were around this time, </garnt>
<garnt> you'll know she was like the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah - Right. </garnt>
<connor> It was, I mean, my video was garbage </connor>
<connor> and he got a million views. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Connor laugh) </connor>
<connor> It was a terrible video. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - It was purely based off her face and her name </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - A million views just like that, right, not even a problem. </connor>
<garnt> And there was compilations of her doing anything </garnt>
<garnt> with a million plus views on YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause she didn't upload anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah - And people wanted it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was telling her, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> we filmed a video for her channel. </garnt>
<garnt> I was trying to help get her started. </garnt>
<garnt> But she made a mistake, </garnt>
<garnt> which I tell other YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's going to be like, </garnt>
<joey> "What do you mean Connor?" Because you did this." </joey>
<joey> Is don't make a fucking Discord server. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> I think having a Discord server that you're involved in </joey>
<joey> like you're actually moderating yourself, </joey>
<joey> is the quickest way to get people to start disliking you. </joey>
<joey> It is cause if you have to ban someone, </joey>
<connor> they'll be like, "CDawgVA, he banned me for no reason. </connor>
<joey> Fuck that guy." </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right, so she made a Discord server </connor>
<connor> and bear in mind, </connor>
<garnt> she was already like kind of a target on 4Chan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah, right. </garnt>
<connor> - Because they wanted to find out information about it so- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This became like cesspit of a Discord. </connor>
<connor> I know she'll probably say that it isn't, </connor>
<connor> but like I've seen a few- </connor>
<connor> - As a third person. </connor>
<connor> - I've been around the internet. </connor>
<connor> I know a cesspit when I see one. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I know a 4Chan breeding ground- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they were out for blood for her. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they doxxed her like multiple times, </garnt>
<garnt> they were finding out where she was. </garnt>
<garnt> They found her boyfriend </garnt>
<garnt> which she hadn't revealed. </garnt>
<garnt> And they were making it hell for him and her. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like threatening </garnt>
<garnt> that they were gonna come to her house </garnt>
<garnt> then they would mentioned their address and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And like that was a, I reckon, her chance of </garnt>
<garnt> having anything was ruined because she was so preoccupied </garnt>
<garnt> with all this shit and trying to deal with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of people just hating on her, finding her address, </garnt>
<garnt> saying horrible things about her, </garnt>
<garnt> saying that she was a dude all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> It was horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> And like... </garnt>
<joey> Many times she would message me </joey>
<joey> like really upset about it being like, </joey>
<joey> "What do I do? </joey>
<joey> I don't know what to do, man." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Countless horrible stories. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what I can share </joey>
<joey> and what I can't share </joey>
<connor> so I just won't share anything. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Just really horrible things </joey>
<joey> that was happening to her left right and center. </joey>
<connor> Cause she didn't set up the precautions to deal with this. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh no. </connor>
<connor> - And she didn't know what she was doing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And- </garnt>
<garnt> - Because even then, </garnt>
<garnt> there's only so many precautions you can set up. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah </connor>
<connor> I mean, the bigger you get, </connor>
<garnt> you normally limit ways that people can communicate with you </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You normally make it very difficult </garnt>
<connor> for people to be able to one-to-one talk with you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Also, because it's just very hard to talk </connor>
<garnt> to that many people with that big an audience. </garnt>
<connor> - If I opened my DMs on Twitter </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Hey guys, open DMs." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - My DMs would be pretty much unusable </connor>
<connor> within two days, right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, and it's just like, it's really tragic </connor>
<connor> because she easily could have had a career. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, she could have. </connor>
<connor> - And she's watching this now thinking, </connor>
<connor> "Wow Connor, you should have told me this." </connor>
<connor> But it's like, how can I tell you to make a career? </connor>
<connor> Right? - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<joey> - I did my best to help. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And push </connor>
<joey> - If she's not the one acting on it, </joey>
<connor> then there's not much you can do. </connor>
<joey> - But she wanted to, </joey>
<joey> I remember she wanted to. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if she really wanted to or not, </joey>
<connor> but there was definitely opportunity there. </connor>
<garnt> And it was just, it was really sad seeing hate- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like hearing this, I understand how hard it can be </garnt>
<connor> especially in the situation she was in because, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That was a rare situation. </connor>
<connor> That doesn't happen, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it doesn't happen often. </connor>
<connor> But you know, when you get to that point when it's just, </connor>
<connor> you're scared to go online, </connor>
<connor> going back to what I experienced with Sydney. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I had to like just uninstalling everything. </connor>
<connor> Like I remember, I was </connor>
<connor> I took the phone off of her and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, just let me go through the hate comments. </connor>
<garnt> And I'll make sure it's safe for you." </garnt>
<garnt> And man, going through the phone on behalf of her, </garnt>
<garnt> I felt fucking shitty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - Because some of the things people can send </garnt>
<garnt> are fucking horrible, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially back then. </garnt>
<garnt> So I can totally understand being like, </garnt>
<garnt> dude I just don't want any involvement in this. </garnt>
<garnt> Because if you go into that </garnt>
<garnt> thinking that you can make a career out of this, </garnt>
<garnt> with that kind of toxic environment. </garnt>
<connor> I think, at that point, you do yourself more harm than good. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In the longterm. </connor>
<connor> And I think, there is always a time </connor>
<connor> when you can make a career online </connor>
<connor> but I think there is a healthy way to go about it. </connor>
<connor> - Absolutely. </connor>
<garnt> - And the less healthy way to go about it. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, </connor>
<connor> I think there was definitely room for her to do it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, I think that was if- </garnt>
<garnt> - Even if, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not trying to compare, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, it's like a similar situation </garnt>
<garnt> with the Neekolul girl. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - She became a huge streamer now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think at the peak of the Hit-Or-Miss thing, </garnt>
<joey> it was bigger than the Neekolul girl- </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I think it was easy, but she just didn't do anything. </joey>
<connor> And her parents were also pretty much like against anything. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah </garnt>
<connor> - Didn't take any of this seriously. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause the thing is, </garnt>
<garnt> if you want to make a career out of it, </garnt>
<garnt> you do need like a very good understanding of the internet. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, which is why- - And know how it operates. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is why I was trying to help her out. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not like, hey, and you know, </connor>
<connor> there was also like a ton of </connor>
<connor> opportunistic YouTubers coming out of the woodwork </connor>
<connor> to try and get that piece of the pie, if you will. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - She would tell me about all the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that some of these YouTubers are saying. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like "Oh my God!, </garnt>
<garnt> some of these dudes are slimy, bro." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just, I don't even know. </connor>
<joey> - Internet's a scary place man. </joey>
<connor> - It is. </connor>
<joey> Which is like, I'm so glad I didn't just blow up. </joey>
<joey> I'm so glad I got, </joey>
<connor> the slow climb. </connor>
<joey> - The slow burn. - Yeah, yeah </joey>
<joey> - Because I got to make every mistake, </joey>
<joey> I got to make all the fuck-ups, </joey>
<joey> I got to learn everything myself. </joey>
<joey> Before I actually had to learn all that, right. </joey>
<connor> So I can deal with it now, because I learnt it all. </connor>
<connor> But a lot of these people who blow up, </connor>
<connor> it's like, "How the fuck do you, </connor>
<connor> how do you learn how to negotiate an ad deal? </connor>
<connor> How do you learn how to deal </connor>
<connor> with like a hundred plus hate comments?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> - How do you know? </connor>
<joey> No one tells you how to deal with this </joey>
<joey> I don't get much hate, but you know, </joey>
<connor> everyone gets a little bit. </connor>

<joey> And once again, thank you </joey>
<joey> for sponsoring today's episode. </joey>
<garnt> - Back to the video. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I mean like, here's a question </garnt>
<garnt> for you guys then, </garnt>
<garnt> like what do you think of the state </garnt>
<garnt> of Anime YouTube right now? </garnt>
<garnt> And do you think it's in a healthy spot? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean I guess compared to what happening </joey>
<joey> on other communities right now. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I mean. </joey>
<joey> - Compared to the SMASH community, </joey>
<connor> Anime YouTube is like the Virgin Mary. </connor>
<joey> - Nintendo is probably thinking, </joey>
<connor> "Holy fuck, we dodged a bullet from being-" </connor>
<joey> - Super Smash Bros is for good boys </joey>
<garnt> and girls, remember kids. </garnt>
<garnt> (group laugh) </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I mean, there was a point, I will admit, </joey>
<joey> there was a point where I would look </joey>
<joey> at the Ani-Tube community </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Fuck this community". </joey>
<joey> (group laugh) </joey>
<joey> Like, legitimately, there was just like some people, </joey>
<joey> and just like, some fan bases as well especially. </joey>
<joey> Just some groups of people, </joey>
<joey> where I was just like, </joey>
<connor> "Man, we don't need that kind of mentality in here." </connor>
<connor> But what can you do, right? </connor>
<connor> The Ani-Tube community, </connor>
<connor> or at least the anime community online, </connor>
<connor> especially in the last 5 years or so, </connor>
<connor> has been growing so much more rapidly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like 5 years ago, it was still very much a niche. </connor>
<connor> But nowadays, it's gotten to the point now </connor>
<connor> where other communities are starting to recognize the size </connor>
<joey> and power of the anime and Ani-Tube community. </joey>
<joey> So obviously with that is gonna come </joey>
<joey> a lot of slimy behavior from a group of people, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like, it's been weird </garnt>
<garnt> seeing the Ani-Tube grow as much as it has. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember there was a point </garnt>
<joey> where you could just point to a group of people </joey>
<joey> and be like, this is the Ani-Tube community. </joey>
<joey> This is the Anime YouTube community. </joey>
<joey> And then everyone kind of tried to get along together </joey>
<garnt> because the group was small enough </garnt>
<garnt> where you would know everyone in the community. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. - So, you'd try to network </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, and we all tried to do that at one point, </joey>
<joey> didn't we? - No, no. </joey>
<garnt> And then it got to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where the community grew too big </garnt>
<garnt> for it to be under one banner. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And there were too many different personalities </garnt>
<garnt> for everyone to be able to mix. </garnt>
<joey> And it's, </joey>
<garnt> I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> that happened like 3-4 years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> And now, I feel like with Anime YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a lot of different small communities </garnt>
<garnt> that I'd grouped under one general banner, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, it's like the gaming community, right? </joey>
<joey> When it first started, </joey>
<garnt> I'm sure all these small creators </garnt>
<garnt> would come together and band. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But now that there are just so many of these groups, </garnt>
<joey> it's like small groups within small groups. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it's, I bet the Fortnite streamers </connor>
<joey> don't talk to the CSGO streamers. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. - You know what I mean. </joey>
<joey> It's like, it's different. </joey>
<joey> And it's the same with anime, right. </joey>
<joey> Like, dude, I don't know any fucking Dragon Ball YouTubers, </joey>
<garnt> but I know there are. </garnt>
<garnt> And like the Naruto YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> they all keep to themselves and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird. </connor>
<connor> - But it's weird </connor>
<connor> because it used to be a point </connor>
<connor> when if you made anime content- </connor>
<connor> - At all, yeah - You were an anime YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> And now there's people like Critical </connor>
<connor> making anime content, other people outside </connor>
<garnt> making anime content as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just become a bit more widespread. </garnt>
<connor> And it's less- - Everyone talks about anime. </connor>
<joey> - It's more general now - Yeah </joey>
<joey> - You don't necessarily have to advocate </joey>
<joey> as an Anime YouTuber for you to make anime content now. </joey>
<joey> Everybody can make anime content. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I always felt like, on the opposite end of you, </connor>
<connor> where you were, I've always been like a core of it </connor>
<connor> because you wanna be first, </connor>
<garnt> you're always one of the biggest. </garnt>
<joey> You've grown with it. </joey>
<connor> I felt like I was always on the outskirts of it, </connor>
<connor> where like, I was never friends with anyone in it, really. </connor>
<garnt> - The 93%. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I mean, </garnt>
<connor> the only friend I did have </connor>
<connor> turned out to do some really fucked up shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Should I tell the story? </connor>
<connor> I may have mentioned it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I know the story. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, go for it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah fuck it, I'm going to say it. </connor>
<connor> So when I first started making Black Butler content, </connor>
<connor> which if you don't know what Black Butler is, </connor>
<connor> it's a Victorian era anime </connor>
<joey> about a servant and a butler. - It's 93%: The Anime. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's very targeted towards a female audience. </connor>
<connor> When I started doing it, </connor>
<connor> I would do the voice of Sebastian. </connor>
<connor> Sebastian. - [Joey And Garnt] Sebastian. </connor>
<connor> - And I would do prank calls, </connor>
<connor> and I would call people up </connor>
<connor> and I would tell them, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my goodness, my refrigerator's running" </connor>
<connor> or blah, blah, blah. </connor>
<joey> - There's a group of people watching this right now </joey>
<joey> that are just frothing from the nostalgia. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> They're like, "HE DID THE SEBASTIAN VOICE!" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, "I'm simply one hell of a butler". </connor>
<connor> That line- </connor>
<connor> (Joey screams) </connor>
<connor> - Right so, I would do a lot of Sebastian content, right. </connor>
<connor> And so, in the show, there's a Sebastian </connor>
<connor> and then there's a Ciel, right. </connor>
<garnt> So I thought to myself, "I need to find someone </garnt>
<garnt> who sounds exactly like this guy, </garnt>
<garnt> because I sound exactly like this guy." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I found a person who insisted on being called Ciel, </garnt>
<connor> that's how into this character they were. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Right. - Right. </connor>
<connor> And at the time, they had a big following </connor>
<joey> and we were known together. </joey>
<joey> And everyone just thought we were best mates, </joey>
<joey> but like, I just thought they were really fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> First of all, I used to just do the Sebastian thing </joey>
<connor> and then the moment the camera turned off, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna go play games, uh, </connor>
<connor> I'm done pretending to be a British guy." </connor>
<connor> I mean, I am a British guy but I mean I dumped him </connor>
<connor> to be a British butler. </connor>
<joey> But for them, it was like- </joey>
<joey> - They were living it. </joey>
<joey> - They never turned off the persona </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You couldn't not call them that </garnt>
<connor> because they would be like, "What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> I'm called Ciel. You'll call me Ciel." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt cackles) </connor>
<connor> And bear in mind, this person's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, 26? </connor>
<joey> 27? </joey>
<joey> They should have, it was weird. </joey>
<connor> 27 year old should not be like </connor>
<connor> living with their parent- </connor>
<joey> - "I'm not Dave, I'm Ciel." </joey>
<connor> - Right so, </connor>
<connor> it was weird </connor>
<connor> and one time they came to London </connor>
<joey> and we hung out </joey>
<joey> and it was really, really, really weird. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, so you met him in person? </joey>
<joey> - I met him once in person, </joey>
<joey> cause I kinda felt like they'd help me out. </joey>
<joey> Because we did a lot of Black Butler content, </joey>
<joey> but then they started to be really shitty. </joey>
<joey> And they used to, like, flake on me. </joey>
<garnt> - And then- - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, one thing they did that was really suss was that, </garnt>
<joey> when we collab together, you don't ask for money from me. </joey>
<joey> We're collabing, we both had YouTube channels. </joey>
<joey> When they were on my channel, </joey>
<joey> they would ask me to pay them. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - And I used to be like, "That's not how YouTube works. </connor>
<connor> When you collab, it's a mutual interest." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But you know, they were like, "No, we wanna get paid." </connor>
<connor> Because my videos were doing better. </connor>
<connor> But I'm like that means that your channel will get a huge- </connor>
<connor> So that was also really frustrating to me. </connor>
<connor> So, I met them once in person </connor>
<connor> after about a year and a half of not speaking to them. </connor>
<connor> Because they were like, "I'm in London", </connor>
<connor> I lived in London. </connor>
<connor> They were like, "Wanna hang out?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Fine, we'll meet up for afternoon tea </connor>
<joey> as you do. - Afternoon tea. </joey>
<joey> - And then, like, </joey>
<connor> these Americans. </connor>
<connor> Filthy Americans, I'm joking. </connor>
<connor> So they turned up, </connor>
<joey> and there was like two other people there, </joey>
<joey> who looked very, very young. - [Joey] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I asked one of them, "How old are you?" </joey>
<joey> Cause they, it was really weird as well, </joey>
<connor> cause they were like attached to them. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - And I thought, </connor>
<connor> "That's really weird." </connor>
<connor> But they wouldn't- </connor>
<connor> They would take it in turns holding onto the person. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - I thought, "Wow, that's really suss" </connor>
<connor> And I just thought, "Americans do American things". </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Because as a British person, right, </connor>
<garnt> I don't understand things that Americans do that are weird </garnt>
<garnt> or fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause Americans are just quirky, right. </garnt>
<connor> Some Americans just do their own thing. </connor>
<garnt> - We all have our own con stories </garnt>
<joey> about people doing weird things- </joey>
<connor> - That one weird American. </connor>
<joey> (group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember asking one of these kids, </joey>
<joey> "How old are you?" </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "18." </joey>
<joey> And I remember thinking, "You don't look 18, </joey>
<joey> you look like 16." </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Is your parent </connor>
<connor> okay with you coming here alone?" </connor>
<connor> And they were like, "It's okay." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "All right, whatever." </connor>
<joey> And it was really weird, I went home, </joey>
<joey> I never spoke to them again </joey>
<joey> because I was really creeped out. </joey>
<joey> I left early cause I made an excuse </joey>
<connor> that I had to go. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause it was just weird. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause there was just like kids basically with him. </connor>
<connor> I didn't sign up for this, </connor>
<connor> I thought we were going to have </connor>
<connor> an awkward conversation </connor>
<connor> for like two hours, alone. </connor>
<connor> And then I'd go home. (Joey And Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> I thought that was what it was. </connor>
<connor> And then two, three months later, </connor>
<connor> it must have been. </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, it was like 8 months later. </connor>
<connor> I get a DM on Discord, "Hey, you should see this." </connor>
<connor> And it was a link to a local police report </connor>
<joey> and I thought, "What the fuck." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I click on it, </joey>
<joey> and it's like two counts of molestation </joey>
<joey> and one count of felony molestation. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Aww. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, aggravated molestation. </joey>
<joey> Which I think is under 14 years old. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah - Bruh. </joey>
<joey> - Now, yeah, and they were </joey>
<joey> person who identified as a male </joey>
<connor> but they were born female. </connor>
<connor> So I think that's why a lot of people </connor>
<connor> just never thought that they would do something. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I can't remember what happened with them. </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna keep up with it, </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't care, </garnt>
<connor> it's a mess. </connor>
<joey> - And I guess your hunch was correct </joey>
<connor> in that sense. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah - And it's one of those things </joey>
<garnt> where it's like fuck man, I collabed with this person a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the moment I found out </garnt>
<garnt> that they were being charged with all this stuff, </garnt>
<connor> you know, even if, </connor>
<connor> you are innocent until proven guilty, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But, it just didn't sit right with me, </connor>
<connor> leaving that stuff up. </connor>
<connor> Even if there's a chance, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna leave it up. </connor>
<connor> So I took all the videos down </connor>
<garnt> which is like 40 or 50. </garnt>
<garnt> If you go to my Social Blade, </garnt>
<garnt> you'll see like views, views, </garnt>
<garnt> minus 9 million views, views, views, views. </garnt>
<garnt> I took them down. </garnt>
<garnt> I still get comments being like, "Where are the videos?" </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like I don't want to break this bubble, you know. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I guess you just did. </joey>
<connor> - I guess I did now, </connor>
<connor> and it was just, oh god, it was terrible. </connor>
<connor> And you think back, </connor>
<connor> and you're like "Fuck, why? Why did you have to do that? </connor>
<connor> What's wrong with you?" </connor>
<connor> And I felt really guilty for ages </connor>
<connor> cause I was like, "Fuck, did I help them? </connor>
<connor> Did I facilitate this by giving them more of a platform?" </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was just fucked up. </connor>
<joey> Everyone I knew who was close to him </joey>
<joey> also was really weird. </joey>
<joey> And it was just like, </joey>
<joey> it was a thing of like just record this one thing </joey>
<connor> and then please leave me alone, all the time before. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - Because they were so weird </connor>
<connor> and I should have listened to my gut. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I did, I regret. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you always have that first kind of experience </garnt>
<garnt> where meeting people on the Internet </garnt>
<connor> might not be the best idea sometimes, </connor>
<connor> or some people are just really weird on the Internet- </connor>
<connor> - Some people are, some people are. </connor>
<connor> - And you don't always get that </connor>
<garnt> until you actually hang out in real life, </garnt>
<garnt> when it's not like in a Discord call. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, my early YouTube career was definitely that. </joey>
<garnt> Because when I was still doing gaming stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> naturally I would also bond together </garnt>
<garnt> with other gaming YouTubers </garnt>
<garnt> who were also trying to grow. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I think this is back when I had less than 10,000 subs. </garnt>
<garnt> I had this huge group of friends I used to collab with. </garnt>
<joey> And a lot of them I never met in real life </joey>
<joey> until much, much later. </joey>
<joey> And when you do, </joey>
<garnt> you really get, as you said, </garnt>
<connor> you finally get a sense of who this person actually is. </connor>
<joey> And unfortunately sometimes, they're completely different. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's scary how much some people can just fake that shit. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah </connor>
<connor> - Until they think they can get away with it, right. </connor>
<connor> - It's really made me listen to my gut </connor>
<garnt> when I have a bad feeling about someone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And now I don't even try, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't humor them, I'm just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, cause like right now, </garnt>
<garnt> it's made, like, my experiences have made me </garnt>
<joey> like a lot more careful when I meet people in real life. </joey>
<joey> Because you just have to be. </joey>
<joey> I wanna be, you know, when you started out, </joey>
<joey> you tried to be friendly to everyone. </joey>
<joey> And I wanna be friendly to everyone- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah - Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I want give everyone the benefit of the doubt. </garnt>
<garnt> But when there is just this many people that, </garnt>
<garnt> you just gotta be careful sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> And you gotta have that barrier up. </garnt>
<joey> - Also, over experience, I feel like you get a much more </joey>
<garnt> of a keener eye on stuff like that. </garnt>
<joey> Like you know if someone's doing something </joey>
<connor> for like suss reasons, you know. </connor>
<connor> - It just makes me sad the sheer amount of people </connor>
<joey> who do fucked up shit like this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah - And it's just like </joey>
<joey> I don't understand it </joey>
<joey> cause my head is not even remotely wired like that. </joey>
<joey> To me it's so foreign that people could do this shit </joey>
<garnt> and it's so confusing that so many people do shit like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - And it's like, "Why? </garnt>
<connor> Why the fuck do you?- - [Joey] Because the Internet- </connor>
<connor> - Don't fuck kids. </connor>
<connor> How hard is that? (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> How hard is it to not fuck kids? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand. - [Joey] I know, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Um, excuse me, are you telling me- </garnt>
<connor> (group laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's just the thing right, </joey>
<joey> I say that and then someone- </joey>
<garnt> - How do you argue about that? </garnt>
<connor> How do you argue about that? </connor>
<joey> It's not even an argument. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just like I don't- </garnt>
<garnt> - Also side note, if I ever do meet you in real life </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like an online personality </garnt>
<joey> that I might not know, </joey>
<joey> please introduce yourself as your Internet handle. </joey>
<joey> I've had so many times when- </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You're like, someone introduces them to you, </joey>
<garnt> and they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm Matt" </garnt>
<garnt> or something </garnt>
<connor> and it's just like, okay. </connor>
<connor> Do I- </connor>
<connor> - Fans do that too, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "Do you remember me?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Who?" </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "X girl with this avatar" </connor>
<joey> And I open up their profile </joey>
<connor> and they've changed it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, wait, how the fuck was I supposed to know </connor>
<garnt> who you are, if you don't even show your face. </garnt>
<garnt> What do you want me- - Especially, </garnt>
<garnt> especially people who don't show their face. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, what the fuck. - And like- </garnt>
<joey> - "I'm Jacob", it's like I know 70 Jacobs, </joey>
<garnt> which one of the 70 are you? </garnt>
<garnt> - I know right, so. </garnt>
<connor> - Should I go back on topic to the- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, no like introduce yourself by your Internet handle. </garnt>
<joey> Just- </joey>
<joey> - It's awkward. - I feel like, I get it. </joey>
<garnt> Because it's weird, like I feel weird being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, hi I'm Gigguk." </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I get it. </connor>
<garnt> - I just say, "Hi, I'm Connor, CDawg online." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like introduce yourself with that in mind. </garnt>
<garnt> So we know, because we don't. </garnt>
<garnt> Nowadays, people know each other by their Internet handles, </garnt>
<connor> a lot of the times. </connor>
<connor> - More people know you for Gigguk than Garnt, probably. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - That's cause, </garnt>
<connor> that's how it is. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's fine by me </connor>
<connor> because like, Gigguk, </connor>
<joey> I don't know how you guys got your names </joey>
<joey> but I mean. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't know the story with The Anime Man. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know how the fuck you thought of that name. </garnt>
<joey> - It's all that SEO, bro. </joey>
<joey> That's all it is, baby. </joey>
<connor> - To get his views in the Recommended. </connor>
<garnt> - But like, for me, Gigguk has always just been, </garnt>
<connor> it was a family nickname </connor>
<garnt> that my Dad thought up when I was born. </garnt>
<connor> So like, I'm just used to it. </connor>
<garnt> So if someone calls me Gig or Garnt, </garnt>
<joey> like my family to this day still call me Gig, </joey>
<joey> so like I'm used to hearing that. </joey>
<joey> I'm completely comfortable with people </joey>
<joey> just calling me Gigguk or Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - If my parents called me Anime Man, </joey>
<joey> I would think I was like disowned or something. </joey>
<garnt> - If you call me The Anime Zone, on the other hand, </garnt>
<garnt> then now we got a problem. </garnt>
<garnt> Now we got a fucking problem. </garnt>
<joey> (group laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I do that sometimes just to fuck with Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - We do it, we do it. </joey>
<connor> We like to joke around on this podcast. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that's the one thing I guess I- </joey>
<joey> It's really weird right </joey>
<joey> because I've never been used to introducing myself as like, </joey>
<joey> "Hi, I'm The Anime Man." </joey>
<joey> Because, before all of this, </joey>
<joey> it was just so natural for me, </joey>
<joey> and I'm sure it is with a lot of people, </joey>
<joey> to just be like, "Hi I'm Joey." </joey>
<joey> Because I just want you to get to know me as a person. </joey>
<garnt> But, it's weird now how, it's gotten to that point where </garnt>
<garnt> if you just say, "Hi I'm Joey.", </garnt>
<garnt> some people will just be like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Who the fuck's that? - Do I, do I know you? </garnt>
<garnt> - Which Joey are you? - How many subs do you have? </garnt>
<garnt> (group laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Are you even verified bro? </joey>
<joey> (group laughs) </joey>
<joey> If not, don't talk to me. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's scary, numbers on the Internet, man. </joey>
<joey> Scary shit. </joey>
<joey> It really scarily changes the perception </joey>
<joey> of how you see someone. </joey>
<joey> Even if you don't mean it that way. </joey>
<connor> - I think we touched on that roughly in episode 1- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How we met each other and how numbers played a factor. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Going back to what I was saying earlier </connor>
<connor> with the, how I always felt like I was on the outskirts </connor>
<connor> of the community, </connor>
<joey> I think that experience very much solidified to me like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm okay with not making friends" </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna keep to myself, </joey>
<connor> but yeah, obviously I have you guys. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I very quickly came to the realization </connor>
<connor> that again, you can't please everybody. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - So it's just best to like find that </connor>
<connor> however many group of people that you know are cool </connor>
<joey> from here til now. </joey>
<joey> And just stick around with them. </joey>
<connor> - One thing I always felt weird </connor>
<connor> about the Anime YouTube community specifically, </connor>
<garnt> and this was very much as an outsider looking in, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I was in the community, right, </garnt>
<garnt> like I made content. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I never participated in anything </garnt>
<connor> and I didn't make the videos </connor>
<connor> they would typically consider anime- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah right, right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No other community does this, </connor>
<connor> where they try and like rank who's the best </connor>
<connor> in their mind with content, which I find really odd. </connor>
<joey> You never see the meme channels being like, </joey>
<joey> "Here's the tier list of the best meme channels." </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? (Joey And Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> You never get like, "Oh yeah, no, Dolan Duck is better than- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> No one gives a fuck. </connor>
<connor> Everyone is just- - Yeah, no one gives a shit. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone's just like, "I like Grande." </connor>
<connor> No one does this weird thing, </connor>
<connor> but for some reason in the anime community, </connor>
<connor> they are obsessed with like ranking each other. </connor>
<connor> And seeing who has the best content. </connor>
<joey> - I only just noticed it's only the Ani-Tube community. </joey>
<connor> - No other community does this </connor>
<garnt> and it's so weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Does the gaming community do this? </garnt>
<connor> - No. - No. </connor>
<connor> - No one does tier. </connor>
<connor> And it's weird how like, </connor>
<connor> on the outside looking in, </connor>
<connor> "Wow, they really just normalized this amongst themselves. </connor>
<connor> They really just love stroking each others egos." </connor>
<connor> And it's weird cause no other content, no other community </connor>
<connor> does really does this where they like, </connor>
<connor> all they do is complement each other. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Damn, that was a good video." </connor>
<connor> It's like that business meme, you know where like- </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) - Like, yes we did business. </connor>
<connor> - Very good business. - Great business. </connor>
<connor> Great videos. </connor>
<garnt> - Business executed. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's weird. </garnt>
<connor> And as someone who didn't do the type of content, </connor>
<connor> that anime content that they considered- </connor>
<garnt> - You weren't 'officially recognized'. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - As somebody, I'm sure some of you are like, </garnt>
<connor> know nothing about the anime community, right. </connor>
<connor> So I'll break it down real quick to you, </connor>
<connor> how the anime community works as an outsider. </connor>
<garnt> And you can tell me if my understanding is wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I made anime content that was very entertainment based. </garnt>
<garnt> I would take characters and do weird stuff with them, </garnt>
<garnt> like prank calls. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The anime community has two types of videos </garnt>
<garnt> that they consider anime content. </garnt>
<garnt> If you see a tier list likely anything else </garnt>
<garnt> that is not this will be ranked lower. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's reviews or analytical videos. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And what I mean by that is obviously </garnt>
<garnt> reviews of shows if you review shows- </garnt>
<garnt> - Or episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or episodes, or manga, you know whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> Analytical videos, where you do that shit </garnt>
<garnt> that you did in English class </garnt>
<joey> where you break down why the curtains are blue- </joey>
<joey> - You basically write an essay about- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You write a 20 minute video on </connor>
<joey> why Deku fists in the appropriate way that he does, right. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt And Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> It's how Deku mastered his fisting technique. </connor>
<connor> 20 minute video, red circles, right. </connor>
<connor> It's that type of content </connor>
<connor> where they like, or the logic of Haruhi Suzumiya. </connor>
<connor> It'll have a title like that, right. </connor>
<garnt> - Basically, you gotta talk about a specific show </garnt>
<garnt> or you gotta talk about anime shows in general. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's a really strange obsession </connor>
<connor> where amongst themselves, </connor>
<connor> all these small YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> I'd say between </connor>
<connor> 10-100k. </connor>
<connor> They're obsessed with doing these videos </connor>
<connor> and who can do the best of these videos and ranking. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - And it's so odd looking from the outside in, </connor>
<connor> it's just like, weird watching them fight over this. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, what's happening? </connor>
<connor> This has gone beyond criticizing each other's work. </connor>
<connor> To a point of like extremes, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's gotten really strange. </connor>
<joey> - It's just become a giant circle- </joey>
<joey> - And they don't really- </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's a giant circlejerk. - It's a circlejerk, right. </joey>
<joey> - And they don't really recognize any other type of content, </joey>
<connor> and I'm okay with that cause- </connor>
<connor> What I think it comes down to most </connor>
<connor> is that most people who make videos, </connor>
<connor> I'd say most YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> make it to serve the audience </connor>
<connor> or to make content for the audience. </connor>
<connor> These YouTubers in the anime community </connor>
<connor> make content for each other. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And to be appraised by each other </connor>
<connor> and have their content, you know. </connor>
<connor> If Gigguk gives me the A+ on my video, </connor>
<joey> that's all I've ever wanted, right. </joey>
<joey> - I've passed this semester. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, cause obviously I want to be validated </joey>
<joey> by my peer, who doesn't right? </joey>
<joey> But that's not the only thing I wanted </joey>
<connor> when I started making content. </connor>
<joey> - No. - No. </joey>
<joey> - For these Ani-Tubers, it's the be-all-end-all, right. </joey>
<connor> - That's, I could be wrong, </connor>
<connor> and I'm sure a lot of them would disagree. </connor>
<connor> But from the outside looking in that's what it seems like. </connor>
<garnt> - I actually totally agree with you. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think it's just the anime YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen this specifically. </garnt>
<garnt> Or at least the Ani-Tube community. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I had a very similar experience </garnt>
<garnt> when I first started dipping my toes </garnt>
<garnt> into the abridging community. </garnt>
<garnt> Now, this was all the way back in the day </garnt>
<garnt> where abridging was like the shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Everyone wanted to be </joey>
<garnt> like TeamFourStar. </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone was making their own abridged content. </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone had, like, a lot of different approaches. </garnt>
<garnt> And a lot of them were shit, right. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor And Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> I- </garnt>
<garnt> - They all tried and they failed. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can say that though, you can say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - But a lot of them were shit- </garnt>
<garnt> - They were, they were. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because abridging is hard, it's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> I've done abridging, </garnt>
<garnt> I can wholeheartedly say it is fucking hard. </garnt>
<garnt> But what happened is this community formed </garnt>
<connor> and there was like these forums that popped up. </connor>
<connor> And what happened was people would just start to criticize </connor>
<connor> each other's work, each other's writing on comedy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right, and- </connor>
<connor> - Like they were all experts. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<joey> Cause it did become kind of a circlejerk, </joey>
<garnt> where people were, in the end, </garnt>
<garnt> making content to appeal to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> People were literally on these forums </garnt>
<garnt> reviewing comedy writing and abridging. </garnt>
<garnt> And not to say like- (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - That sounds so pathetic. </joey>
<garnt> - Not to say that comedy, there isn't a size around comedy. </garnt>
<joey> Or like there isn't like a framework </joey>
<joey> that you can work off of. </joey>
<joey> But what that did, </joey>
<garnt> it just made a lot of abridging so fucking stale. </garnt>
<garnt> And so fucking same-y. - Yeah cause everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> trying to please each other, </garnt>
<connor> so everyone's trying to write the same shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then I also feel like what happened </connor>
<garnt> is that when a big channel, say TeamFourStar right. </garnt>
<garnt> If they give positive praise to someone </garnt>
<garnt> who is up and coming, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe they will think, "Oh, they were nice to me </garnt>
<garnt> so I'll praise their writing." </garnt>
<connor> And then, it's just this giant circlejerk </connor>
<joey> of like the people who want to be respected </joey>
<joey> and the new guys who want to be respected. </joey>
<garnt> They all just pass around the compliments to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause they're like, "This is what we need, </garnt>
<connor> we need this respect from each other." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And, I see the exact same thing </garnt>
<garnt> with a lot of smaller Ani-Tubers now, </garnt>
<connor> where they try, </connor>
<connor> they try to make content </connor>
<connor> to appeal </connor>
<connor> to each other- </connor>
<joey> - Other YouTubers. - Other Youtubers, </joey>
<joey> which is why whenever you see, </joey>
<joey> whenever I see an Ani-Tuber </joey>
<joey> that just does something totally different. </joey>
<joey> You can tell, right, when an Ani-Tuber </joey>
<joey> makes a video </joey>
<joey> that is completely, and they don't watch other Ani-Tubers- </joey>
<garnt> - You can tell straight away. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause they always make a name for themselves. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the first time it happened </garnt>
<garnt> was with Demolition D. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you can tell, </garnt>
<connor> he had a completely new style </connor>
<connor> that no other Ani-Tuber </connor>
<joey> had before. </joey>
<joey> And I remember like, I remember watching </joey>
<connor> one of his videos early on. </connor>
<connor> I remember thinking, "He's gonna fucking blow up." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's exactly what happened </connor>
<connor> and now he's quit now. </connor>
<connor> He's like that urban legend for us Ani-Tubers, right. </connor>
<connor> But he's like one of the most respected content creators </connor>
<connor> in Ani-Tube. </connor>
<connor> But like I remember John, Super Eyepatch Wolf, </connor>
<connor> when he first came out, </connor>
<connor> I knew he didn't watch any other Ani-Tubers- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you can tell, you can tell. </connor>
<garnt> - He fucking blew up as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to think if there's anyone recently. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I've got one. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never talked about him before, </garnt>
<garnt> there's this guy called Scamboli Reviews. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay - You've mentioned him before. </garnt>
<joey> - He's like very, I can tell he's very new to the scene. </joey>
<joey> And I've seen a lot of opinions about him online </joey>
<joey> within the Ani-Tube community, </joey>
<joey> and a lot of it is very negative. </joey>
<joey> Just because the way he phrases it, </joey>
<joey> phrases things, </joey>
<joey> and the way he goes about his videos </joey>
<joey> is way more like different and some would say </joey>
<joey> brash and harsh, maybe arrogant. </joey>
<joey> But from like myself, a content creator's perspective, </joey>
<connor> comparing his content to a lot of things </connor>
<connor> the other Ani-Tubers are doing. </connor>
<connor> I could say he definitely has a more distinct personality. </connor>
<connor> And he definitely stands out, </connor>
<connor> even if I don't agree with all of his content </connor>
<connor> or the way he approaches the content. </connor>
<connor> I can see that he approaches it, he just feels- </connor>
<connor> - Got an angle right? </connor>
<connor> - He just feels different from the rest, </connor>
<connor> even though he's technically doing analytical content. </connor>
<garnt> And he's like grown a lot faster in a short period of time. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like we talked about this, </garnt>
<garnt> making content to appease other YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> and sometimes you can definitely tell that. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I think the reason why someone </connor>
<garnt> like John, Super Eyepatch Wolf, and yourself </garnt>
<garnt> are able to get plus a million views </garnt>
<garnt> on a video talking about a very specific thing </garnt>
<garnt> that maybe people aren't interested in. </garnt>
<garnt> Is because I think priority is make the video good. </garnt>
<joey> Don't, it's not about trying to appease someone </joey>
<joey> or trying to impress another YouTube. </joey>
<joey> Because I feel like when you do that, </joey>
<joey> you're just going to iterate on someone else's idea </joey>
<joey> that probably wasn't already good to begin with. </joey>
<joey> But you think it's good </joey>
<joey> cause in your mind, </joey>
<connor> that's what you've been told by the community </connor>
<connor> is the golden standard. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When it should be, just make the good content. </connor>
<garnt> - Just make content. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember going back to the abridged thing. </garnt>
<garnt> The meta-game was try to make something </garnt>
<garnt> better than TeamFourStar. </garnt>
<garnt> It was, it was like I'm going to make an abridged series </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm going to try and make this more respected </garnt>
<garnt> in this own circle than what the big guys are doing. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm pretty like TeamFourStar, </garnt>
<garnt> they didn't really give a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> They were innovating with DBZ Abridged </garnt>
<garnt> and HellSing Abridged. </garnt>
<garnt> And they were just doing their own stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> and they were doing stuff </garnt>
<garnt> cause they thought it was good, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> As someone who has been on YouTube for a very long time, </garnt>
<garnt> you can definitely feel when someone is making content </garnt>
<garnt> with a completely unique angle. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You get a lot of the same reactions </garnt>
<garnt> because a lot of, sometimes people come up very fast </garnt>
<garnt> and people are like, "Why is he coming up very fast?" </garnt>
<joey> - A lot of the small YouTubers get very bitter about that. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they're very harsh about it. </joey>
<joey> But then when I can look at the content, </joey>
<joey> or any of us, </joey>
<joey> and we can see exactly why it succeeded. </joey>
<joey> We can break that apart. </joey>
<connor> And like, talking about TeamFourStar, </connor>
<connor> I remember, I'm a voice actor, that's what I do a lot. </connor>
<connor> I've voiced a ton of abridges. </connor>
<connor> And the only time I've been laughing </connor>
<connor> while I was recording </connor>
<connor> was during the HellSing Abridged that I did. </connor>
<joey> And I remember I couldn't get the lines done </joey>
<joey> because I was laughing too much. </joey>
<connor> And I never have that problem with any other abridge, right. </connor>
<joey> - Taka's such an amazing writer. </joey>
<connor> - It was such a good abridge for the time, </connor>
<connor> it was incredible. </connor>
<joey> It's because they didn't give a fuck </joey>
<joey> about trying to copy </joey>
<joey> or trying to get the respect of someone else. </joey>
<connor> Because they would just focused on making the product. </connor>
<joey> - They just made shit that they thought was funny. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, that's what it is. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's just like, </joey>
<connor> not everyone who just makes stuff for themselves </connor>
<connor> makes good stuff, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's not like, we're not trying to say </connor>
<connor> you can't improve yourself by looking at other people. </connor>
<connor> - Respect doesn't pay your bills. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt And Joey laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - That's a good way to say it. </connor>
<joey> - Respect doesn't pay your bills, right. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - At the end of the day, you know. </connor>
<connor> If typically, with how the YouTube algorithm works, </connor>
<connor> like we all love to shit on it. </connor>
<connor> But at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> if you make something that people are watching, </connor>
<connor> YouTube will be like let's recommend it more. </connor>
<connor> If people are watching your videos, </connor>
<connor> you will get viewed. </connor>
<connor> That's just how it works, </connor>
<connor> it sucks that it's like that. </connor>
<connor> Yes, there are occasions </connor>
<connor> where YouTube does it's little fuckery and drops the ball </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But that doesn't happen </connor>
<connor> to every one of your videos. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And there are YouTubers </connor>
<connor> out there, you've seen a bunch of them </connor>
<connor> who are complaining like, "Oh, I've been shadow banned." </connor>
<connor> No, your videos are garbage. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's- </connor>
<connor> - That's the harsh truth, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - It's just the truth, right? </connor>
<connor> - Your videos are bad </connor>
<garnt> and I can say that </garnt>
<garnt> because my videos were bad at one point. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not just that, </connor>
<garnt> because I've seen many really fucking great YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> anime YouTubers as well, </garnt>
<garnt> who do fucking amazing content, </garnt>
<garnt> no idea how to market their stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> No idea, </garnt>
<garnt> no idea </garnt>
<garnt> how to like, title and thumbnail their videos. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a big- </garnt>
<garnt> - There are like some Ani-Tubers </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm like this is a fucking great video </garnt>
<joey> but I don't know what half these words </joey>
<joey> in your title mean, right? </joey>
<joey> How is anyone going to click on this video? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Am I clicking on an anime video </joey>
<garnt> or am I clicking on a scientific study?" </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause like some of these words, I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Wow, I didn't know these existed in the English language </joey>
<joey> and could be related to anime in such a way." </joey>
<joey> - And it does suck in a way </joey>
<joey> that you have to play to the YouTube meta </joey>
<joey> of just how to title and thumbnail a video. </joey>
<joey> Because, you know, I'm sure we've titled and thumbnailed- </joey>
<joey> - We don't wanna click bait, </joey>
<joey> we're forced to click bait. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, cause you do. </joey>
<garnt> And there's different levels of click bait, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, sometimes I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You know what? It hurts me </garnt>
<garnt> that I have to title it this way but." </garnt>
<joey> - It's the only way. </joey>
<joey> - It's the only way people- </joey>
<joey> - No one's gonna watch it otherwise. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> And that's just part of being a YouTuber, unfortunately. </joey>
<connor> - Hate the game, not the player. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay like, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> I did an Arch Knight sponsorship recently. </garnt>
<garnt> Love the game right, but I titled the video </garnt>
<garnt> "I Spent $800 On An Anime Mobile Game", right. </garnt>
<connor> It's not an anime, it's anime styled. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's a more accurate title, </connor>
<joey> would be something like, </joey>
<joey> "How To Play- </joey>
<joey> - I love Arch Knights - Yeah, like, </joey>
<joey> that would be way more accurate </joey>
<joey> but people aren't gonna click on that. </joey>
<connor> Because they don't know what Arch Knights is. </connor>
<connor> If I give them a generic enough title </connor>
<connor> that's interesting enough, </connor>
<garnt> they'll click on it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just trying to strike that balance, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Between not lying to the audience </garnt>
<garnt> but also being honest. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I had the exact same problem </connor>
<connor> with my Gacha game video. </connor>
<connor> Cause I put so much fucking work </connor>
<connor> into this Gacha game video </connor>
<garnt> that I'm like, a lot of people do not know </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck Gacha games even are, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> How do I, how do I get someone who has no idea </garnt>
<joey> about Gacha games to give this video a chance, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Cause I think it's a pretty good introduction </joey>
<joey> to the world of Gacha and everything, you know. </joey>
<joey> Go watch it, I put a lot of time and effort into it. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Links down below. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna shout myself out. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> I put like a month of work into that video. </garnt>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Gigguk. </joey>
<garnt> - But like, it was just really hard for me </garnt>
<garnt> to figure out how to properly market </garnt>
<garnt> this to an audience. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's part of the challenge </garnt>
<garnt> of being a YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, how long do you spend on your titles and thumbnails? </garnt>
<garnt> Out of curiosity. </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes you just know </connor>
<connor> and sometimes you sit there for 2 hours and get confused. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, nowadays, when I think of a video idea, </joey>
<garnt> the first thing I think of, </garnt>
<garnt> even before I start writing it a script </garnt>
<garnt> or getting the general idea down, </garnt>
<garnt> is what's the title and thumbnail. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think I do that like 80% of the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah because if no matter what, </connor>
<connor> I can't think of a good enough title or thumbnail for it. </connor>
<garnt> I usually don't even bother doing the video. </garnt>
<garnt> Until I can think of like, okay with this title, </garnt>
<garnt> people click on it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I can start working on it. </garnt>
<garnt> And try and base my content around that title </garnt>
<garnt> as much as I can, </garnt>
<garnt> so that it's not like, "Aw, this is completely click bait. </garnt>
<connor> This has nothing to do with the content of the video" </connor>
<connor> Which is hard and like annoying </connor>
<connor> because like sometimes I have to sacrifice content </connor>
<connor> for the sake of the title. - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Which is the worst thing you can do. </joey>
<connor> - Going back to the point I made earlier </connor>
<connor> where I was mentioning making shit content, </connor>
<joey> I've been guilty of making shit content. </joey>
<joey> - I think we all have. </joey>
<joey> - When I was only making Black Butler videos, </joey>
<garnt> I remember I couldn't watch my own videos. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is that bad? - No. </joey>
<connor> - Have you been there? </connor>
<joey> - I've always said to people, </joey>
<joey> if you can't watch your old stuff, </joey>
<connor> then that's good cause that means </connor>
<connor> you're not only getting- - More better. </connor>
<joey> - Harsher on your content, </joey>
<garnt> but now you know how to improve your content. </garnt>
<joey> Just don't make that shit. </joey>
<connor> - Do you ever feel like, right after you made it, </connor>
<joey> you're like, "This is bad." </joey>
<joey> But I'm gonna upload it anyway? </joey>
<joey> Cause I feel like you wouldn't do that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I don't get to that stage. </joey>
<joey> - I do have like a bar of quality, </joey>
<joey> where I have, I've literally, </joey>
<joey> there's been one video recently </joey>
<joey> where it's been, I've recorded it, I've scripted it, </joey>
<garnt> I've recorded it, edited it </garnt>
<garnt> and no matter I try to jig around with it- </garnt>
<garnt> - It just didn't work. - It just didn't work, </garnt>
<garnt> and I just scraped it. </garnt>
<joey> And that was like a good two weeks of work, as well. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - It hurt, but for me, if I'm not like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't always have to be like, "This is the best shit ever" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - This like 10/10 banger, </garnt>
<joey> every fucking time. - Just good enough. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes it's like, "Okay, this is good enough." </joey>
<joey> And even that hurts me to release sometimes. </joey>
<joey> Just like good enough. </joey>
<joey> But like question to you guys, </joey>
<garnt> have there been any videos that you've ever regretted? </garnt>
<connor> Or like you can't- - My first early part </connor>
<joey> of YouTube. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - My first four years. </joey>
<joey> - I, okay I'm gonna say this and I know it's not true, </joey>
<garnt> looking back I feel like I hated it </garnt>
<garnt> but I know I didn't, right. </garnt>
<garnt> I enjoyed what I used to make. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was never what I wanted to make. </garnt>
<garnt> I made one or two things that I did want to make. </garnt>
<connor> And then I made more of that </connor>
<connor> until I got stuck making only Black Butler stuff. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And that was a nightmare to get out of </connor>
<connor> because like anything I made that wasn't Black Butler, </connor>
<connor> no one watched it. </connor>
<garnt> No one. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, I remember I moved to London </garnt>
<garnt> and I was making like 1500 pounds a month, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Which in London, this is before tax, before tax. </connor>
<connor> - Scraping by, just scraping by. </connor>
<connor> - I was basically scraping by </connor>
<connor> and I remember and for some reason I was adamant. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I'm not fucking making these Black Butler videos </connor>
<connor> all the- </connor>
<connor> I was still making them </connor>
<connor> but I'm not making them all the fucking time. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And all of them bombed, </connor>
<connor> like straight up, all of them bombed. </connor>
<connor> I was getting like 1/3 the views I was normally getting. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "I'm gonna go homeless. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna have to go back to my parents </joey>
<joey> and be like I fucked up." </joey>
<joey> But, you know, I was persistent. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "No, I'm not. </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna make this fucking work. </connor>
<connor> They're funny, I think they're better than my old stuff." </connor>
<connor> And eventually it did take off. </connor>
<connor> But I remember, like, </connor>
<connor> the reason </connor>
<connor> why I realized I had to change </connor>
<connor> was cause someone told me, "Oh, that's weird </connor>
<connor> that you can't watch your own videos." </connor>
<connor> Like at all, like not even reviewing it. </connor>
<joey> I couldn't review it, I had to get someone else </joey>
<connor> to review for me. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really. </connor>
<connor> - Cause it was like, I would cringe too much watching them. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) Cause I didn't like it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I get exactly the same feeling sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> - But like now, when I make a good video, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "I fucking love this part." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey And Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - That guy's hilarious. </connor>
<joey> - You watch it like two or three times before it goes live, </joey>
<connor> it's just like, yeah, this is gonna be a banger. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Here comes the joke, ah yeah, I killed a joke, </connor>
<connor> I killed that joke.", you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I'm so happy with what I'm making right now. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like a whole, like I've been unchained </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's hard because I see a lot of YouTubers </joey>
<garnt> and I remember cause I used to help out </garnt>
<garnt> with a lot with comic doubles. </garnt>
<garnt> Who would dub like Undertale comics. </garnt>
<garnt> Remember that, when that was a thing. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> Homestuck comics. </connor>
<connor> - All of these people who would dub comics, </connor>
<connor> it was so easy to get hundreds of thousands of views, right. </connor>
<connor> Cause these had huge fandoms. </connor>
<connor> They would get to like 200k subs, </connor>
<connor> they'd wanna start branching out. </connor>
<connor> Boom. </connor>
<connor> None of the videos would get views, </connor>
<connor> and I was like trying to help them. </connor>
<connor> But a lot of people when they get one or two videos </connor>
<connor> that do bad or perform poorly, </connor>
<connor> they're immediately put off. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They won't try anything else. </connor>
<connor> They're just like it just doesn't do well, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't do well. </connor>
<connor> And they don't want to figure out how to make it work. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's basically like starting from zero, </connor>
<connor> with a little bit of an advantage. </connor>
<connor> But you basically have to get rid of all your old audience </connor>
<connor> and get a new one. </connor>
<joey> - It's probably less discouraging starting from zero </joey>
<garnt> because at least from zero- </garnt>
<garnt> - You've got nothing to lose, you know what I mean. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is why my number one piece of advice from the get-go </connor>
<connor> is make what you want, don't make what gets views. </connor>
<connor> Cause I did that and I fucked myself over. </connor>
<connor> I'm lucky </connor>
<joey> because I feel like I'm 1 out of 100, right, </joey>
<joey> who managed to change his content. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you got very, very lucky. </joey>
<connor> - And get away from it. </connor>
<connor> Cause I was persistent. </connor>
<connor> I did not stop. </connor>
<connor> - I was kind of in a similar situation- </connor>
<connor> - Right, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not to the extent of you with Black Butler, </connor>
<garnt> but I was kind of there when I did a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> Corpse Party stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, I remember that, I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I originally blew up playing Corpse Party 2? </garnt>
<connor> Which was like the new Corpse Party game </connor>
<connor> that just come out. </connor>
<connor> But it was only in Japanese. </connor>
<joey> The first let's play, that was like the first let's play </joey>
<joey> I ever did, I remember. </joey>
<joey> It was like my eighth video or something. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh my god. - [Garnt] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And it just immediately blew up because- </joey>
<connor> I didn't know how dedicated the Corpse Party fan base </connor>
<connor> was back then, </connor>
<connor> and it got to the point </connor>
<connor> where I would do Corpse Party 2, </connor>
<connor> it would just get insane amount of views. </connor>
<connor> Like way, way more than any of my anime content. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then I found a Corpse Party spinoff visual novel </connor>
<garnt> which no one also did cause it was only in Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> I did like 30 episodes of that. </garnt>
<garnt> All the episodes fucking killed it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it got to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where any other video I did during that period, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say like over 90% of the comments </garnt>
<garnt> were filled with Corpse Party Rpers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - Oh really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like replying to each other's comments </garnt>
<joey> as Corpse Party characters. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> And I looked at that </joey>
<joey> and I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Okay, I shouldn't get stuck in this rabbit hole. </garnt>
<garnt> This is bad." </garnt>
<garnt> - I gotta get out of here. </garnt>
<garnt> - I gotta get out of here, dude. </garnt>
<joey> I gotta get the fuck out. (Connor laughs) </joey>
<connor> - And one of the things that I tell other YouTubers </connor>
<garnt> who are like at 10-50,000, </garnt>
<garnt> who are stuck in a content </garnt>
<garnt> where they can't get out of it. </garnt>
<garnt> Where it's the only content </garnt>
<garnt> that gets views by doing the certain amount of thing </garnt>
<garnt> over and over again like a pet almost, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like do the thing you did but differently slightly. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I always tell them like, think of it this way, </joey>
<joey> maybe if you changed your videos up entirely, </joey>
<joey> the 50,000 subscribers that you're so desperately </joey>
<joey> clinging onto right now could be a million, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, don't worry about the subscribers you have, </joey>
<joey> cause most of them only care about that one thing, right. </joey>
<garnt> And if you want to change, you don't need them. </garnt>
<joey> - Subscribers change all the time, </joey>
<garnt> they always recycle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Subscribers don't really mean much </garnt>
<joey> in terms of view counts nowadays </joey>
<joey> because it's all about Recommended. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, look at this channel. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah no, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> We're at like 300k breaking over 500k every episode. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like how is that happening? </garnt>
<connor> - And it's like YouTube used to be able to show you </connor>
<garnt> how many people unsub from your channel, </garnt>
<garnt> but they removed it. </garnt>
<joey> But it used to show you at like 600k, </joey>
<joey> it was like plus 600,000 subscribers minus 80,000. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You will like siphon out people, in a good way. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, you'll lose the audience that you don't want. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's okay. </garnt>
<joey> But it's hard to teach people that. </joey>
<joey> Because like YouTube's hard. </joey>
<garnt> - Because all they see is that minus 80,000 </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like, "I could be at 680,000", </garnt>
<garnt> instead of 600,000 but. - Cause like for me, </garnt>
<garnt> part of the reason I feel like I've been able to </garnt>
<joey> be on this platform for so long, </joey>
<garnt> is that I always like try to change my content. </garnt>
<garnt> It's always like a conscious effort at this point. </garnt>
<joey> - Same, same. - Like if I look at my content </joey>
<garnt> last year, and I'm making the exact same content, </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't feel like you need to do </garnt>
<garnt> a big fucking change straight away. </garnt>
<garnt> But if you gradually change over the years, </garnt>
<garnt> it will be totally fucking different. </garnt>
<garnt> Because like, if you look at my content from 5 years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> totally different from what I do now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - The way you implement that </garnt>
<garnt> is you do things a little bit at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> How I see it is, if I'm doing exactly the same content </garnt>
<garnt> as I'm doing last year, </garnt>
<garnt> to me, I've failed. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've personally failed myself. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember last year, it was probably </garnt>
<garnt> like my best overall year, </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of views on my channel. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was actually like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was really unhappy with my channel. </garnt>
<garnt> Because this is exactly the same stuff I've been making </garnt>
<garnt> last year for an entire year. </garnt>
<garnt> And it hurt me, it like hurt me. </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't know what I wanted to do next. </garnt>
<garnt> So it took me, like, a little bit longer to figure out. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I want to try something different </garnt>
<garnt> in this way and that way. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's part of the secret </garnt>
<garnt> of being able to survive on YouTube for so long. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're evolving. - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like you constantly have to be looking </connor>
<joey> for that evolution. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah well that's the scariest thing, right. </joey>
<joey> There's nothing scarier than </joey>
<connor> YouTube viewers losing interest in a YouTube channel </connor>
<connor> than the actual YouTuber losing interest </connor>
<joey> in their YouTube channel. </joey>
<joey> - Like I feel like you've really upped your game </joey>
<joey> in the last year. - Oh no, you have. </joey>
<connor> - I definitely have, I mean. </connor>
<connor> I think late 2019, 2019 for me was a weird year. </connor>
<connor> Because at the beginning of 2019, </connor>
<garnt> I was kinda in the same boat </garnt>
<garnt> where I just kinda looked at my channel </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought, "This is the same shit I've been doing </garnt>
<garnt> since I moved to Japan. - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like a little bit better editing. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I think late 2019 was where I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You know what, I'm gonna kinda slow down </garnt>
<garnt> on the analytical stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> Like do way less scripted shit, </garnt>
<garnt> and kind of just do more fun, entertainment based stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - I don't have to </joey>
<joey> always be like the big brain boy of anime. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like we all rubbed off on each other almost. </connor>
<connor> - I think so - Yeah, I think definitely </connor>
<garnt> moving here and seeing how you guys work </garnt>
<garnt> has like given me like a different perspective </garnt>
<garnt> about how content can be made. </garnt>
<connor> And like different approaches. </connor>
<connor> Cause I feel like a lot of people </connor>
<connor> when they think about making their content better, </connor>
<connor> they're like, okay, maybe getting better equipment- </connor>
<connor> - There's definitely a factor of that. </connor>
<connor> - And there is a factor of that, </connor>
<garnt> or sometimes like I gotta make my writing better. </garnt>
<garnt> But sometimes it's just what if you just try </garnt>
<garnt> approaching your content in a completely different way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - And I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> going back to Ani-Tube </garnt>
<garnt> where everyone tries to make content </garnt>
<garnt> to appeal to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> What I see is content being approached exactly the same way. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - From like 5 different perspectives. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's all the same, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just an iteration on each other. </garnt>
<connor> Like, they don't do anything different. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is why I find it weird about the tier list </garnt>
<joey> because I can definitely see </joey>
<joey> how you can find X content's better </joey>
<joey> but to me, it's like, you're approaching it in the same way. </joey>
<joey> Someone might have better editing or better writing, </joey>
<connor> or just better or more interesting ideas, </connor>
<garnt> but it's still kind of in the same niche. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the same shit. - It's the same shit. </connor>
<connor> - They can, they'll sit here and talk about. </connor>
<connor> I remember, I don't know which YouTuber it was, </connor>
<connor> but they like, "His clip selection was poor". </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, who the fuck gives a shit </connor>
<connor> about his clip selection. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like, who cares? </connor>
<connor> Who watches a video of an anime review </connor>
<connor> and thinks this clip selection is rather disappointing. </connor>
<connor> You don't think that. </connor>
<connor> If the video is at a point </connor>
<connor> where you're nitpicking that much, </connor>
<connor> I feel like that- </connor>
<connor> - The content is stale at that point. </connor>
<connor> - Unless it's that egregious, right. </connor>
<connor> Where the clip selection is that poor, right. </connor>
<connor> It shouldn't be a factor. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When you're talking about anime, </connor>
<connor> picking the right clips doesn't fucking matter </connor>
<joey> it's what you're talking about. </joey>
<joey> - As long as the clips not in 240p, </joey>
<connor> no one gives a shit. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, which is why like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know like, </connor>
<connor> personally the thing that I try to improve the most on </connor>
<joey> is how comfortable I am on camera. </joey>
<joey> I'm always trying to up it. </joey>
<joey> Like I wanna make it feel like </joey>
<joey> it's just like my best friend in the room. </joey>
<joey> Like how you doing? </joey>
<connor> - I've always been trying to figure that out </connor>
<connor> for the past year or so, </connor>
<connor> even with scripted content. </connor>
<connor> How do I make scripted content </connor>
<connor> not look like scripted content? </connor>
<connor> Because a year ago, you could tell </connor>
<joey> if a video of mine was scripted. </joey>
<joey> It was very, very obvious. </joey>
<joey> - I never script anything. - From the way I presented it </joey>
<connor> and the way I talked, </connor>
<connor> but now recently, I've slowly kind of, </connor>
<connor> I've put more effort into remembering my scripts, </connor>
<joey> rather than reading a little bit of it </joey>
<joey> and then using my short term goldfish brain memory </joey>
<joey> to be like, "Recite these words in a natural way please." </joey>
<connor> (group laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Dude, I don't know how you, </connor>
<joey> I did a script recently for the first time </joey>
<joey> and I hated it so much. </joey>
<joey> - You get used to it, </joey>
<connor> I hated it at first too but. </connor>
<connor> - I just love being a crackhead, </connor>
<connor> just saying shit. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Just saying shit and then being like, </connor>
<garnt> we'll piece it together, we'll figure- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like completely opposite, </garnt>
<garnt> I need, I love making a script. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I was that kid, it's weird </garnt>
<joey> cause I was that kid who was just sitting in school </joey>
<joey> and I would just be sitting in silence </joey>
<joey> and I would just laugh at myself. </joey>
<joey> I would just be like (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> - Bruh. </connor>
<garnt> - Better run, better run. </garnt>
<garnt> - People thought I was like fucking crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I would, I would. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, it was because I had all these funny ideas </garnt>
<connor> and funny jokes that I couldn't- </connor>
<connor> - 13 year old Garnt: I'm a comical genius. </connor>
<connor> - Like I can- - I'm a comical mastermind. </connor>
<connor> - There's no way I can explain this funny thought </connor>
<connor> or funny joke I have in my head. </connor>
<connor> But as soon as I started making YouTube videos, </connor>
<joey> I'm like that's a funny thing, </joey>
<joey> let's make this into a funny meme. </joey>
<joey> (Joey And Connor laugh) </joey>
<joey> And like I can actually visualize </joey>
<joey> all the crazy shit going on in my head. </joey>
<joey> I'm not crazy, I swear to god. </joey>
<joey> - Out of context, it sounds slightly autistic. </joey>
<garnt> (group laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Just a little worrying. </joey>
<connor> - Sounds kinda rain man. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it is a little rain man-y. </joey>
<joey> - Good will hunting (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> Comedy good will hunting. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> My god. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know though, </joey>
<joey> cause I started with doing absolutely zero scripts. </joey>
<joey> I would maybe jot down bullet points, </joey>
<joey> but I found myself, finding, </joey>
<joey> running into that situation </joey>
<joey> where I would just be like "Er, uh" </joey>
<joey> like way too much in between </joey>
<joey> while I was trying to think up of something. </joey>
<joey> So, in the end, a video where I'm trying to convince you </joey>
<joey> that you should think about an anime in this certain way, </joey>
<joey> just ended up being this crackhead ramble </joey>
<joey> that just was not convincing whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Okay, I gotta start organizing my shit." </joey>
<garnt> - Sorry, I was just laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> I had the exact moment. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just laughing to myself </garnt>
<garnt> because I thought of a funny joke. </garnt>
<garnt> - God damn it, Anime Zone. </garnt>
<garnt> I am so- </garnt>
<garnt> - It just happened live on screen now. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like god fucking damn it. </joey>
<joey> - Can we get a repeat of that? </joey>
<garnt> At the moment you just see- </garnt>
<joey> - Cause I was like, </joey>
<garnt> I wasn't laughing at what you were saying, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just thinking of a funny joke. </garnt>
<connor> - You're not funny, Joey. - Fuck you. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry, I was derailing. </connor>
<connor> What were you talking about, Joey? </connor>
<garnt> I was totally intently listening- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm too in the moment, </garnt>
<garnt> I like don't find things funny </garnt>
<garnt> if I think about them too much. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, sometimes do you just have that joke </connor>
<garnt> where you just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you just like, the more you think about it, </garnt>
<garnt> the funnier it gets? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I have those jokes, </joey>
<joey> but it doesn't come to the point </joey>
<joey> where I'm just sitting there laughing. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think I'm funny enough to make those jokes </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, "Damn, I'm funny. </connor>
<connor> Damn I'm good." </connor>
<garnt> - I know, I don't think like, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I don't think I'm funny enough </garnt>
<connor> to think on my feet a lot of the times. </connor>
<connor> - I'm the type- - It's all I do. </connor>
<connor> Like, I can't. </connor>
<connor> If I think about a joke too much, I hate it. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like that type of guy </garnt>
<garnt> who spends 30 minutes in the shower slam dunking people. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> With like witty remarks that I didn't make </garnt>
<garnt> at the exact time. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't know this bro </garnt>
<joey> but I totally just fucking destroyed you in my head. </joey>
<joey> (Joey And Garnt laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - And then everyone clapped and cheered. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the end of Evangelion. </joey>
<garnt> - How often do you need to do this, Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> Where you need to think about this in the shower. </connor>
<connor> Are you thinking about your childhood traumas? </connor>
<connor> Like this guy- </connor>
<garnt> - Like Sydney sometimes wonders </garnt>
<joey> why I take 30-40 minutes in the fucking shower, </joey>
<joey> on the fucking toilet, </joey>
<joey> and most of the time it's just me thinking </joey>
<joey> about different, that's my most creative zone. </joey>
<joey> - It's like that meme where it's like </joey>
<garnt> "He's probably thinking about other girls" </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Meanwhile Garnt, "Hell yeah, I destroyed you in my head." </joey>
<garnt> (group laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Most of my video ideas come </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm shitting or in the shower. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know why, it's just my special place. </joey>
<joey> - It's the zen, man. </joey>
<joey> - It's the zen mo. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't, I feel like I'm on my phone </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm shitting. </garnt>
<garnt> When I'm in the shower, </garnt>
<connor> I'm also on my phone. </connor>
<connor> I have a little thing, I watch YouTube videos. </connor>
<joey> All of my videos come right before, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure this is common, </joey>
<joey> but right before I go to bed. </joey>
<joey> Where I'm just about to drift off, </joey>
<joey> I'm just about to enter that REM state </joey>
<connor> and then all of a sudden, </connor>
<connor> I wake up </connor>
<connor> - Activate. </connor>
<garnt> - I gotta write that down. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you ever had a really funny dream </garnt>
<joey> or a really great dream that you, </joey>
<joey> you wake up from that dream and you think, </joey>
<joey> "That will make an amazing video" </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you make notes about it </garnt>
<garnt> and then you read it in the morning </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like what the fuck was I saying. </garnt>
<joey> - I've never experienced this </joey>
<joey> - Half of my videos are like </joey>
<joey> where I'm drifting off and I'm like </joey>
<joey> this would make a fucking hilarious video. </joey>
<joey> Half eyed, I write it on my phone, </joey>
<joey> I go to open it up </joey>
<joey> and I'm like what the fuck, this is a shit idea. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never experienced that in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> I've texted in my sleep </garnt>
<connor> but I've never had that. </connor>
<connor> - I've written some mad gibberish. </connor>
<connor> I think it's a million dollar idea </connor>
<garnt> and then I wake up and there was like </garnt>
<garnt> Evangelion, Indian service call. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like what the fuck does this mean. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait is that a real thing? </garnt>
<joey> - Bye - [Garnt And Connor] Bye. </joey>
<joey> (jazzy outro music plays) </joey>
