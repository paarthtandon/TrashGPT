<garnt> i'm probably the one out of the four of </garnt>
<garnt> us who drinks the least okay </garnt>
<garnt> okay so so to give context this </garnt>
<garnt> conversation so a few weeks ago if </garnt>
<connor> you're a regular trash taste viewer </connor>
<garnt> you would know that we had our bi-annual </garnt>
<garnt> annual health check annual health check </garnt>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> which is something that a japanese </connor>
<connor> company forces every employee to do they </connor>
<connor> have to go for a checkup and the company </connor>
<garnt> also gets the results yes yes </garnt>
<garnt> and so we we did our health check up a </garnt>
<garnt> few weeks ago talked about it on trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste </garnt>
<garnt> and we just got our results back and </garnt>
<garnt> this is the first time i've ever gotten </garnt>
<garnt> results back </garnt>
<garnt> from like uh you know getting my health </garnt>
<garnt> check up in a foreign company </garnt>
<garnt> uh country sorry and i did not know that </garnt>
<connor> you get graded yeah i'm used to seeing </connor>
<connor> numbers and then saying like oh this is </connor>
<connor> bad i'm like oh well i mean it's just a </connor>
<garnt> funny number isn't it yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> no no you it literally i got my health </garnt>
<garnt> check up and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> wait they are literally grading you abc </garnt>
<joey> like it's like an end-of-year school </joey>
<garnt> report yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i felt like i was doing my gcses again </garnt>
<garnt> or a-levels like </garnt>
<garnt> my god and normally i don't really care </garnt>
<joey> too much </joey>
<joey> about my health check-up because </joey>
<joey> unless it's bad right you see numbers </joey>
<joey> you see you know you see the doctor's </joey>
<joey> suggestions and they're they're just </joey>
<joey> that they're </joey>
<joey> doctor's suggestions but i don't know </joey>
<garnt> why i think it's </garnt>
<garnt> seeing seeing my health being graded </garnt>
<garnt> like a school test </garnt>
<garnt> it just brought the asian blood out of </garnt>
<connor> me right yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i was i definitely felt more </connor>
<garnt> competitive yeah with my body </garnt>
<garnt> because i was going through my health </garnt>
<garnt> checkup and overall i i got a b </garnt>
<connor> so i was like okay i am a straight a </connor>
<garnt> student </garnt>
<garnt> what is what the [ __ ] does this </garnt>
<garnt> the first thing i did when i got my </garnt>
<garnt> results was i phoned up my mum </garnt>
<garnt> and told her that and told her how well </garnt>
<garnt> i scored in this exam like a good asian </garnt>
<garnt> song </garnt>
<garnt> i called up the doctor and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> just a check this wasn't ranked was it </garnt>
<garnt> this was this is casual right </garnt>
<garnt> this is free play right please say </garnt>
<garnt> please say this society </garnt>
<garnt> please say no but yeah so i mean my </garnt>
<garnt> results i got like all a's which is </garnt>
<garnt> great as you'd expect from someone who </garnt>
<garnt> is under the age of 30. you're </garnt>
<garnt> generally supposed to be quite healthy </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah yeah but i got i got a b </garnt>
<garnt> on bmi yeah which i mean obviously i'm </garnt>
<garnt> built a little different </garnt>
<connor> right yeah and this is japanese bmi </connor>
<connor> which i believe is slightly different i </connor>
<connor> don't know if </connor>
<connor> i'm led to believe that's correct but </connor>
<connor> yeah but i mean bmi is [ __ ] anyway </connor>
<connor> a lot of [ __ ] this is a hundred percent </connor>
<connor> muscle not fat don't happen </connor>
<connor> and i got a c on my cholesterol all </connor>
<connor> right but i got </connor>
<connor> i got like uh well i'm not sure how </connor>
<joey> cholesterol work exactly because i don't </joey>
<joey> know [ __ ] i'm dumb </joey>
<joey> but one of so there was like they had </joey>
<joey> like three different cholesterols and </joey>
<joey> all of them were like a little </joey>
<joey> you know all of them were kind of out of </joey>
<joey> touch right right right </joey>
<joey> um but i was like in my head i'm like </joey>
<joey> well they gave me three c's now for my </joey>
<joey> cholesterol like but what are the odds </joey>
<connor> of one of these cholesterol being good </connor>
<joey> and the others not being good right if i </joey>
<connor> go ahead and amazing cholesterol the </connor>
<connor> other two aren't going to be like well </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i mean where </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna pick it up i mean i don't know </connor>
<joey> to me it was odd i mean mine was worse </joey>
<joey> because i got a c </joey>
<garnt> on my liver and i think a b on my heart </garnt>
<connor> rate monitoring or something </connor>
<garnt> right really and everything else was an </garnt>
<connor> a what does that mean </connor>
<connor> that's the thing right it's like usually </connor>
<connor> on your thing like i think you two got </connor>
<joey> like a doctor's like </joey>
<joey> note right or like a doc did you guys </joey>
<connor> get a doctor so you can ask </connor>
<connor> when you get the thing i don't know if </connor>
<connor> you said yes or no you can ask if you </connor>
<connor> want advice </connor>
<connor> right and i said no i don't want advice </connor>
<garnt> i i said no you don't want to but i </garnt>
<garnt> still go like i've got i don't know if </garnt>
<garnt> it's the same doctor's note that we're </garnt>
<garnt> talking about right but it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> a </garnt>
<connor> summation of the test results which </connor>
<connor> didn't explain anything no it didn't </connor>
<connor> excite </connor>
<connor> it just said um some of the values are a </connor>
<garnt> bit you know abnormal which is you know </garnt>
<garnt> higher or lower than we expect </garnt>
<garnt> but there shouldn't be anything to worry </garnt>
<joey> about i didn't even get a summation did </joey>
<joey> you know my mind literally like </joey>
<garnt> overall i got a c and the summation box </garnt>
<garnt> was just blank i was like </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah yeah you're just going to tell </garnt>
<joey> me that my liver is bad and that's it </joey>
<connor> yeah i feel like should i be worried </connor>
<garnt> some context would help yeah </garnt>
<garnt> did did you have to get did you get a </garnt>
<garnt> note that said you had to come in three </garnt>
<garnt> months later as well </garnt>
<connor> like i did i got that they told me back </connor>
<joey> in three months but i don't but it's </joey>
<joey> optional i mean on the thing it says </joey>
<connor> like if you get a c </connor>
<connor> they recommend you come back three </connor>
<joey> months later but i didn't get like a </joey>
<joey> note saying that i should come back </joey>
<connor> so yeah mine said you should come back </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah you have to pay for it </joey>
<joey> and also i you know for cholesterol </joey>
<connor> he's oh i'm obviously going to turn up </connor>
<connor> and they're going to be like hey you </connor>
<connor> should uh </connor>
<connor> exercise and eat healthy i'm like thanks </connor>
<garnt> dog i was going to ask because </garnt>
<garnt> i heard i heard you're back on the </garnt>
<garnt> chicken and broccoli diet no no i </garnt>
<connor> haven't gone right back to the chicken </connor>
<garnt> breast okay i haven't i have started </garnt>
<garnt> eating a little more health </garnt>
<garnt> consciousness is it because of the test </garnt>
<garnt> results i think it helped helped me be a </garnt>
<garnt> bit more conscious it made me </garnt>
<joey> you know when you would you would maybe </joey>
<joey> just go for the karate or you would go </joey>
<joey> for the chips it may </joey>
<joey> be a little bit like second thing like i </joey>
<joey> mean i i definitely have like </joey>
<joey> stopped drinking okay </joey>
<connor> i think i've only drank like once or </connor>
<connor> twice is is is the liver 100 </connor>
<connor> all problems come from alcohol because i </connor>
<connor> feel like it's not just probably there's </connor>
<garnt> gonna be a whole host of others </garnt>
<garnt> because the problem with the test </garnt>
<garnt> results is that they they gave they gave </garnt>
<garnt> you the grade </garnt>
<garnt> but they didn't tell you how to improve </garnt>
<garnt> it and i guess i guess that was bad </garnt>
<garnt> because we literally </garnt>
<garnt> ticked the box that said we don't want </garnt>
<garnt> doctor's advice because i i had assumed </garnt>
<garnt> like any other health checkup that it </garnt>
<garnt> would just be like you know that you're </garnt>
<garnt> going to be good right yeah it was just </garnt>
<garnt> like the generic </garnt>
<garnt> you know are you doing well do i need to </garnt>
<garnt> go to the hospital to really </garnt>
<garnt> have a lifestyle change no but as soon </garnt>
<garnt> as i saw the [ __ ] bee </garnt>
<garnt> because i got a i got a b in my blood </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like how the [ __ ] do i </garnt>
<garnt> improve my blood </garnt>
<garnt> what am i doing wrong why is my blood at </garnt>
<garnt> b just improve your men </garnt>
<garnt> just like control it like because they </garnt>
<garnt> were they were like they were like going </garnt>
<garnt> on like </garnt>
<garnt> you know the the white blood or t cell i </garnt>
<connor> don't </connor>
<connor> i'm not a [ __ ] i i i </connor>
<connor> yeah i saw the b and i'm just like as as </connor>
<connor> as an asian student you know because </connor>
<garnt> whenever i saw a b in a test i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> okay i can improve this test score </garnt>
<garnt> i can study a bit more i can optimize </garnt>
<joey> this a bit more somehow </joey>
<joey> what i found interesting was that like i </joey>
<connor> always thought to myself that </connor>
<connor> i was very deaf for my age like because </connor>
<garnt> you know i went to like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> concerts growing up and just </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] basically destroyed my easter </garnt>
<garnt> like headphones and [ __ ] like that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but so i was expecting like on the </garnt>
<connor> hearing part </connor>
<connor> that i maybe get like a b or something </connor>
<connor> right i wouldn't even have complained </connor>
<connor> about it but then i saw i got an a </connor>
<connor> yeah so i was like oh it's not that i'm </connor>
<joey> deaf it's just that i don't listen </joey>
<garnt> it kind of made me realize i was like oh </garnt>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> i'm glad to know i don't have a hearing </joey>
<garnt> problem i just have like an attention </garnt>
<joey> problem i just don't give a [ __ ] that's </joey>
<garnt> not that's my that's my problem </garnt>
<joey> i was telling the company i was like </joey>
<connor> listen if my eyesight or my ears come </connor>
<connor> back [ __ ] i know exactly why that is and </connor>
<connor> that's because i don't know what the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] was happening when they were </garnt>
<connor> talking to me oh yeah they just put the </connor>
<garnt> headphones on me i'm like wait what wait </garnt>
<connor> whoa whoa whoa </connor>
<connor> they were like can you then she asked me </connor>
<connor> luckily i just caught her asking can you </connor>
<connor> hear in japanese </connor>
<connor> like can you hear it and i'm like here </connor>
<joey> what what am i listening for like and </joey>
<joey> then i realized because i had done the </joey>
<joey> human benchmark test </joey>
<joey> right right recently that it was the </joey>
<garnt> frequency thing yeah yeah same way you </garnt>
<garnt> can hear it yeah but i was like what are </garnt>
<garnt> you what do you want me to </garnt>
<connor> like what am i hearing for like a bulb </connor>
<joey> like what i didn't know what was </joey>
<joey> happening </joey>
<joey> but i was like oh okay [ __ ] all right </joey>
<joey> how did you because with the eyesight </joey>
<garnt> thing right you have to do like the </garnt>
<connor> it's like a circle yeah yeah it's cut </connor>
<garnt> out right yeah yeah how did you guys say </garnt>
<joey> that in english oh </joey>
<connor> no i said it in japanese what do you </connor>
<connor> just point out </connor>
<garnt> because i i really [ __ ] up in the </garnt>
<connor> eyesight thing because i didn't know </connor>
<garnt> what they were like looking for right so </garnt>
<connor> i thought it was like a normal eyesight </connor>
<garnt> test thing where now when i was just </garnt>
<garnt> like uh </garnt>
<garnt> e yeah because because okay so </garnt>
<garnt> to explain the eyesight thing they have </garnt>
<garnt> this circle and have like one of like </garnt>
<garnt> either up down </garnt>
<joey> left or right that's cartel and then </joey>
<joey> right now the diagonals as well cut out </joey>
<connor> i didn't see diagonals i didn't see </connor>
<garnt> diagonals diagonals yeah there were </garnt>
<joey> diagonals no </joey>
<garnt> no no no i only saw up down left right </garnt>
<connor> they were diagonal no because i caught </connor>
<connor> all of them right </connor>
<joey> yeah i did too but they were diagonal </joey>
<connor> there was no diagonals there was no </connor>
<joey> doubt my one they gave me they usually </joey>
<connor> have diagonals right </connor>
<connor> i've never seen diagonals because the </connor>
<garnt> only reason i knew about this test is </garnt>
<garnt> because when i </garnt>
<connor> exchanged my driving license from </connor>
<connor> british to japanese i had to do the </connor>
<connor> exact same thing </connor>
<connor> right yeah and i i was just it was this </connor>
<connor> exact same thing again </connor>
<joey> yeah and there was no diagonals i mean i </joey>
<joey> definitely got it right because i came </joey>
<joey> back with like a one point two she could </joey>
<connor> be like </connor>
<connor> just men talking about diagonals yeah i </connor>
<connor> don't know </connor>
<connor> yeah because right next to the circle </connor>
<connor> thing you had like the letters as well </connor>
<connor> so i was just reading out letters when </connor>
<connor> they were asking what direction </connor>
<garnt> i would have said what direction was </garnt>
<garnt> missing from the song </garnt>
<garnt> because i was wondering why she was </garnt>
<garnt> looking at me really weird </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like and she kept asking me </garnt>
<garnt> can you see can you see and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah let me just read out the </garnt>
<garnt> letters for you so why are they </garnt>
<connor> this is easy as [ __ ] yeah luckily i've </connor>
<garnt> done the simulation before so that's </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i was right not panicking as much </garnt>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> yeah man i mean i i clicked no to the </joey>
<garnt> health advice because i just figured </garnt>
<joey> that it was going to be the same old </joey>
<garnt> you know yeah just eat healthy listen </garnt>
<joey> yeah because let's be honest right if </joey>
<joey> it's if it's </joey>
<joey> unless it's something you know bad like </joey>
<joey> really bad that actually requires </joey>
<connor> treatment </connor>
<connor> right they're just going to tell me hey </connor>
<connor> you should exercise more and eat healthy </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> you know i do most of that anyway yeah </connor>
<garnt> because you know i mean like i think for </garnt>
<garnt> cholesterol it's pretty simple it's </garnt>
<garnt> pretty simple literally just </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but for some of them like for </garnt>
<garnt> example liver or blood </garnt>
<joey> you look at that results in little yikes </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like it's like a number of </joey>
<garnt> factors right like what do you </garnt>
<garnt> how do i improve my white blood cell </garnt>
<garnt> count i don't know do i just take an </garnt>
<garnt> injection </garnt>
<garnt> of why blood cells what do what do you </garnt>
<connor> want me to do i have a theory right </connor>
<connor> this is this could be a very uh pleasant </connor>
<connor> theory i don't know </connor>
<connor> my theory was because we got the health </connor>
<connor> checkup done right after like christmas </connor>
<garnt> and my theory was well i've just been </garnt>
<connor> drinking and eating straight for like </connor>
<connor> three weeks this is clearly come on we </connor>
<connor> got to write this off this doesn't count </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> of course my collateral's going to be </connor>
<connor> higher i had like 8 000 calories three </connor>
<connor> days ago </connor>
<connor> of course it's gonna be higher sure </connor>
<joey> maybe i don't know </joey>
<connor> but i didn't drink a lot in christmas </connor>
<garnt> so much yeah yeah i think that </garnt>
<garnt> definitely skewed the results that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i'm going to chalk it down </garnt>
<connor> to i mean </connor>
<connor> doctors out there please validate me in </connor>
<garnt> the comments </garnt>
<connor> i don't want i don't want to hear if you </connor>
<connor> have an alternative theory just say if </connor>
<garnt> i'm right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i just found i just found it funny </garnt>
<garnt> how like i think it's </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's this is different </garnt>
<garnt> definitely the difference between like </garnt>
<garnt> asian culture </garnt>
<garnt> and like western culture where i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like in asia living in asia they try to </garnt>
<garnt> make everything a test and everything </garnt>
<garnt> kind of competitive and that's just </garnt>
<garnt> i that's how i was raised as well so </garnt>
<garnt> whenever i see a grade </garnt>
<garnt> i like something in my blood drives me </garnt>
<garnt> to try and improve that grade </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's true yeah and i don't know if </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like over competitive or </garnt>
<connor> i just maybe well i think it's good </connor>
<connor> right because if you're the kind of </connor>
<connor> person who you are </connor>
<connor> yeah those things work really well but </connor>
<connor> there's obviously some personalities out </connor>
<connor> there that </connor>
<connor> when they hear oh by the way like your </connor>
<connor> bmi is bad or your live is bad where </connor>
<garnt> they just like instead of like wanting </garnt>
<connor> to be like well [ __ ] you i'm going to </connor>
<connor> improve it it's like </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] i guess it's just like there's </connor>
<connor> no hope like why why is it like </connor>
<garnt> working and then it should make it worse </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah but i don't know i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> as as you know as someone who grew up in </garnt>
<garnt> you know kind of kind of both cultures </garnt>
<garnt> i think a lot of toxicity can come in </garnt>
<garnt> putting so much value </garnt>
<garnt> into a grade or a test and i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> definitely living in asia </garnt>
<garnt> they put way too much value into test </garnt>
<joey> results and school results </joey>
<joey> do you think there are like some schools </joey>
<joey> and like companies where like they get </joey>
<joey> bullied if you got like a bad </joey>
<garnt> rating i think it's totally i it's </garnt>
<garnt> definitely a thing in asia </garnt>
<joey> because i heard because [ __ ] got </joey>
<garnt> a d in his blood yeah because because in </garnt>
<garnt> in in asia i i i don't know if i'm </garnt>
<garnt> talking about my ass but </garnt>
<joey> you see in like anime definitely where </joey>
<joey> you get the test results right </joey>
<joey> and it's like publicly posted yeah so </joey>
<joey> you you publicly know </joey>
<garnt> what your fellow classmates got and </garnt>
<garnt> that to me seems like a lot of pressure </garnt>
<joey> they do that for like university like </joey>
<garnt> entrance exams as well they're like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but create a huge billboard in </garnt>
<garnt> front of the school and it has like your </garnt>
<garnt> number on it and if your number doesn't </garnt>
<joey> show up you basically fail yeah brother </joey>
<garnt> so it's like a public execution they </garnt>
<garnt> literally make a public tournament arc </garnt>
<garnt> for your test results </garnt>
<garnt> like no one no wonder they put so much </garnt>
<garnt> value and testing </garnt>
<garnt> and i think that can that can definitely </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> to me from my experience can definitely </garnt>
<garnt> skew with your mentality when you </garnt>
<garnt> go out of schooling and you realize that </garnt>
<garnt> not everything in </garnt>
<garnt> life is graded and not everything in </garnt>
<garnt> life has a percentage or a grade that </garnt>
<connor> uh judges your results and how well you </connor>
<connor> do yeah i think especially because </connor>
<connor> given the industry that we've gone into </connor>
<garnt> which is entertainment if you will </garnt>
<connor> uh then if you call trash taste </connor>
<connor> entertainment but we're trying our best </connor>
<connor> here </connor>
<connor> um i feel like the skill set is nearly </connor>
<connor> 180 it compares of what what you learn </connor>
<joey> in school </joey>
<joey> right it's purely based on like i feel </joey>
<joey> like social skills and 90 percent of our </joey>
<joey> job oh yeah right being able to read a </joey>
<joey> room </joey>
<joey> yeah like talk but you know and i mean </joey>
<connor> obviously there is a lot of technical </connor>
<connor> aspect obviously like learning how to </connor>
<connor> set up all this equipment </connor>
<connor> but the majority of it can't be taught </connor>
<connor> in a classroom oh no and it's kind of </connor>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> i mean you know how can you grade </joey>
<garnt> someone's social skills imagine we </garnt>
<garnt> started doing that </garnt>
<garnt> oh i mean did you imagine oh </garnt>
<connor> connor you know you were on s but ever </connor>
<connor> since the event happened </connor>
<connor> you've been kind of a bomber you're kind </connor>
<joey> of a d now you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> like yeah it's like it's like getting </joey>
<connor> graded for every tweet you make right </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> honestly if you're like if you're just </joey>
<garnt> like oh how's the b plus tweet yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's true </connor>
<garnt> yeah he's just gonna fight away i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> went through a period in life where </garnt>
<connor> you know i was the stereotypical weave </connor>
<connor> that didn't go out and i had </connor>
<connor> zero social skills and how i learned was </connor>
<connor> i think everyone goes through that stage </connor>
<connor> especially if you go through university </connor>
<connor> where you kind of want to </connor>
<connor> you kind of want to reinvent yourself </connor>
<connor> right you move into someone new and you </connor>
<connor> want to </connor>
<connor> be a new person so what i did was i </connor>
<connor> basically just had like a full year </connor>
<connor> where i just went out as much as </connor>
<connor> possible </connor>
<connor> and talked to as many people as possible </connor>
<connor> just like try to go out my comfort zone </connor>
<connor> and that was [ __ ] hell for me as like </connor>
<connor> this introvert </connor>
<garnt> it's kind of like a trial by fire period </garnt>
<connor> of my life that i would never want to do </connor>
<connor> 300 spartan training social strategies </connor>
<garnt> it basically was because i </garnt>
<garnt> i literally i literally just did not </garnt>
<garnt> know how to socialize i didn't know how </garnt>
<garnt> to read a room i didn't know what the </garnt>
<joey> social network was that's like such a </joey>
<connor> common like cultural thing in japan that </connor>
<connor> we actually have like our own </connor>
<connor> like phrase for it which is university </connor>
<connor> debut yeah </connor>
<connor> really it's like it's like a cultural </connor>
<connor> thing in japan where like because there </connor>
<connor> are so many like anti-social kids </connor>
<connor> in middle school and high school and </connor>
<garnt> that when they go into university </garnt>
<garnt> they're like oh [ __ ] i'm like one step </garnt>
<garnt> closer to </garnt>
<garnt> where i have to socialize in order to </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] live </garnt>
<garnt> in society so university is literally my </garnt>
<connor> last chance before i'm </connor>
<connor> thrown into that world so i'm gonna like </connor>
<joey> make a 180 during university and just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] do </joey>
<joey> anything and everything possible to just </joey>
<connor> completely change myself around </connor>
<connor> i think it is a really op mindset when </connor>
<connor> you when you you know because </connor>
<connor> you know i wasn't cool at all in school </connor>
<connor> i was i was like </connor>
<connor> very much an in-betweener you know i </connor>
<connor> wasn't cool but i wasn't like i wasn't </connor>
<connor> like on the bottom of the social ladder </connor>
<joey> if you will you weren't like bullied to </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] right </connor>
<connor> i mean that's because i started fighting </connor>
<connor> back my way out of there </connor>
<connor> you know i was just kind of like </connor>
<garnt> whatever like nobody paid attention to </garnt>
<garnt> me never had any luck with like </garnt>
<garnt> you know dating or anything yeah i was </garnt>
<garnt> never had any of that but then i thought </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> oh wait like no one knows who i am in </garnt>
<garnt> university </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so like i don't know no one knows </garnt>
<joey> i'm a mid-tier social </joey>
<joey> i'm a i'm a ct on the social ladder </joey>
<joey> you know i didn't reinvent myself it's </joey>
<connor> just like you don't do the mistakes you </connor>
<connor> don't </connor>
<connor> fall back on crutches that you had like </connor>
<connor> like don't like you said right you go </connor>
<connor> out more you don't </connor>
<connor> you know i could play video games which </connor>
<connor> is what i probably would prefer doing </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<connor> if people invite me out i'll say yes </connor>
<connor> because you want to be seen as fun and </connor>
<connor> then seems fine everything goes easier </connor>
<connor> and you learn more you get more </connor>
<connor> confident </connor>
<joey> if for me it was go out of your comfort </joey>
<connor> zone for me it was like the complete </connor>
<connor> opposite </connor>
<connor> i was like the really social in middle </connor>
<garnt> school in high school and then when i </garnt>
<garnt> entered university because i started </garnt>
<joey> doing youtube yeah right i like kind of </joey>
<connor> regressed social media you also lived at </connor>
<joey> home right yeah i lived at home i can </joey>
<connor> imagine that's like </connor>
<connor> way you must feel did you feel like </connor>
<connor> different from like the other people who </connor>
<joey> are living on campus </joey>
<joey> oh yeah a little bit i mean our campus </joey>
<garnt> was weird because </garnt>
<garnt> i think the majority of people in my </garnt>
<garnt> class did live at home oh wow yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> only had maybe like </garnt>
<joey> a handful of people who actually lived </joey>
<garnt> on campus which uh which </garnt>
<garnt> which university did you go to again uh </garnt>
<garnt> sydney university okay so i guess it's </garnt>
<joey> because it's a city university yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean we have our own campus and like </joey>
<joey> dormitories and stuff like that </joey>
<joey> that uni students live in but i think </joey>
<connor> the majority of people because it's such </connor>
<connor> a </connor>
<connor> an accessible university because it's </connor>
<connor> like smack bang in the middle of like </connor>
<connor> sydney like city so people can just like </connor>
<joey> get on trains and buses and just go home </joey>
<connor> basically yeah because i i feel like no </connor>
<connor> one in my class </connor>
<connor> who lived locally to the area really </connor>
<garnt> from there well that's because you went </garnt>
<garnt> to swansea right and yeah </garnt>
<garnt> what is there to do in swansea well it's </garnt>
<connor> a good question guys </connor>
<connor> i'm still wondering that myself </connor>
<connor> i didn't live locally either i live like </connor>
<connor> an hour and a half by </connor>
<connor> bus [ __ ] so i didn't live close at all i </connor>
<joey> could have like i was at a distance </joey>
<joey> where i could have easily lived on the </joey>
<joey> dorm but then </joey>
<joey> i heard from people who were living in </joey>
<joey> dorms in sydney university they were </joey>
<connor> like don't do it that's a good </connor>
<connor> experience though </connor>
<garnt> you know being thrown into hell honestly </garnt>
<garnt> i i feel like i learned </garnt>
<garnt> more valuable social skills um and just </garnt>
<garnt> life skills going to university </garnt>
<garnt> than i did actual career skills that i </garnt>
<garnt> was </garnt>
<garnt> using that that i learned from my course </garnt>
<connor> i don't think i realized it until i left </connor>
<garnt> and then i actually started like </garnt>
<garnt> functioning </garnt>
<garnt> yeah on my own yeah i don't i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what i would have done without that </garnt>
<garnt> period in my life jesus said like </garnt>
<garnt> it basically taught me how to survive in </garnt>
<garnt> the world </garnt>
<garnt> and how people really are and all the </garnt>
<garnt> expectations i had </garnt>
<connor> growing up and like because as a kid </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> you kind of expect that as you grow up </connor>
<connor> and the more mature you get you assume </connor>
<connor> that everyone's just gonna </connor>
<connor> realize what they're doing get mature </connor>
<connor> and then you kind of realize </connor>
<connor> um going through university especially </connor>
<connor> especially that that was a [ __ ] lie </connor>
<connor> and then you go out of university you </connor>
<connor> start like the working world and you </connor>
<connor> realize oh everyone here is just like </connor>
<garnt> growing up university students and </garnt>
<garnt> everyone </garnt>
<garnt> nobody actually knows what they're doing </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone is still </garnt>
<garnt> secretly as immature adults aren't as </garnt>
<garnt> adult </garnt>
<garnt> as i thought they were right yeah i </garnt>
<joey> don't know i feel like i don't </joey>
<connor> it's either like people just have their </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] together or they don't like there's </connor>
<connor> no in-between like i don't know i've </connor>
<joey> never met anyone </joey>
<joey> most adults that i've met are just like </joey>
<joey> kids in suits essentially </joey>
<joey> that's basically the best way i can </joey>
<joey> describe it and um </joey>
<connor> it's it's especially especially here </connor>
<connor> it's like seeing some of the recent </connor>
<garnt> stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that's been happening um obviously stuff </garnt>
<garnt> like let's uh can we can we talk about </garnt>
<garnt> how uh the stonker market can we talk </garnt>
<connor> about the stock market that's uh that </connor>
<connor> we've recently just seen </connor>
<connor> yeah we're going to be very delayed we </connor>
<connor> are going to be very delayed because </connor>
<joey> it's so worried so what's it just </joey>
<joey> happened to us it's just happened </joey>
<joey> or is is happening i don't [ __ ] know </joey>
<connor> it's a constantly evolving situation by </connor>
<connor> so by the time this airs it's probably </connor>
<garnt> everything we're probably going to be </garnt>
<connor> saying is going to be outdated yeah </connor>
<joey> um who knows the stock market might not </joey>
<garnt> even exist by the time yeah my god when </garnt>
<garnt> reality is this entertaining who the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] needs tv this is what i'm saying </connor>
<connor> that's what i've always said </connor>
<connor> real life is so much more interesting </connor>
<connor> yeah you couldn't make a movie </connor>
<connor> about like if you'd pitch the movie </connor>
<garnt> being like right so what happens is a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch of redditors right </garnt>
<garnt> they buy gamestop stock and they like </garnt>
<garnt> they [ __ ] over these billion dollar head </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> no no everyone thinks that's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> stupid yeah it happens this is the </garnt>
<garnt> coolest [ __ ] story yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah thus documentaries are better than </garnt>
<garnt> movies yeah and i just think we are </garnt>
<garnt> reaching a time period </garnt>
<garnt> where you know it used to be a you know </garnt>
<garnt> a funny meme but now </garnt>
<garnt> memes are just real life memes </garnt>
<garnt> big memes now are basically just making </garnt>
<garnt> fun of like </garnt>
<garnt> real life events yeah you know and </garnt>
<garnt> having a real life </garnt>
<garnt> effect on the world that is that is the </garnt>
<garnt> modern that is what memes are growing </garnt>
<joey> inside </joey>
<joey> i think i think i saw someone on twitter </joey>
<joey> saying though like this is like kind of </joey>
<joey> the revitalization of it's just a prank </joey>
<joey> bro but </joey>
<joey> the pranks have just like gone actually </joey>
<joey> gone far like gone wrong </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm not gonna lie the first time i </joey>
<joey> saw that story i was like </joey>
<joey> i don't know what the [ __ ] is happening </joey>
<joey> and i'm really scared to ask </joey>
<garnt> dude i i like when it was happening i </garnt>
<garnt> was like what the [ __ ] does shorting a </garnt>
<connor> stock mean yeah and now i'm just like </connor>
<connor> now because of this meme i've done so </connor>
<connor> much research that i'm just like </connor>
<connor> maybe i should get into the stock market </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's really weird because i </connor>
<connor> have not your life now </connor>
<connor> you know that youtube look i'm not i'm </connor>
<joey> not a gambling addict okay as much as as </joey>
<connor> much as the gadget </connor>
<joey> episode uh might have it might have made </joey>
<joey> me look like i'm not a gambling addict </joey>
<joey> you're yellow on gotcha but not only </joey>
<joey> but it's made me think a lot about my </joey>
<garnt> you know grown-up investment </garnt>
<garnt> like uh grown-up investments uh talk </garnt>
<joey> that i just went with </joey>
<joey> because i've been doing stocks like </joey>
<joey> through </joey>
<joey> like my dad because my dad is like </joey>
<joey> really missing so i've been doing it but </joey>
<connor> when this [ __ ] happened i was like </connor>
<connor> should i be scared </connor>
<connor> like what's happening i don't i don't </connor>
<connor> know what that dad is on money he's my </connor>
<joey> dad is my money </joey>
<joey> daddy daddy please is my money okay </joey>
<connor> please </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean no one no one in my family </connor>
<connor> has anything about it i mean yeah </connor>
<connor> you know i think my my family always i </connor>
<garnt> think every single generation of my </garnt>
<garnt> family is just like made enough to get </garnt>
<garnt> by </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah do buy some nice things here </garnt>
<garnt> and there yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> they don't think stocks was ever on </garnt>
<garnt> their mind i think my my parents had </garnt>
<connor> some stocks in the companies they worked </connor>
<connor> for as like a gift right yeah so i think </connor>
<connor> my dad checks up on those stocks but in </connor>
<connor> terms of actually </connor>
<connor> knowing about the stock market yeah you </connor>
<connor> know no one in my family has any idea </connor>
<joey> well right because it's not something </joey>
<joey> that you know everyone commonly learns </joey>
<garnt> right but </garnt>
<connor> that's that's that's what i was thinking </connor>
<connor> fancy gambling for rich men yeah well </connor>
<garnt> that's that's what it's like marketed as </garnt>
<garnt> right but </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i'm doing my research and like </garnt>
<garnt> probably </garnt>
<garnt> probably reading into this um you know </garnt>
<garnt> like i was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> why the [ __ ] aren't we taught this in </garnt>
<garnt> school because i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> especially knowledge on the stock market </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the reasons why people don't </garnt>
<garnt> get into the stock market </garnt>
<garnt> from what i've realized is because </garnt>
<garnt> nobody knows [ __ ] about it it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> because no nobody was taught this in </garnt>
<garnt> school </garnt>
<garnt> and it sounds so complicated that nobody </garnt>
<garnt> has the effort </garnt>
<garnt> or energy to really read up and learn </garnt>
<garnt> about this i mean i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> and the only reason i started reading </garnt>
<garnt> about up about this was because </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] stock market was on fire and </garnt>
<garnt> it turned into a massive meme i </garnt>
<garnt> literally </garnt>
<garnt> started reading up about this because of </garnt>
<joey> a meme who would have thought that memes </joey>
<joey> get you to go into like </joey>
<joey> educational adventures it happens all </joey>
<garnt> the time man </garnt>
<garnt> but hey but like what this made me think </garnt>
<garnt> was why wouldn't we talk about this in </garnt>
<garnt> school like there's so many </garnt>
<garnt> growing up there's so many life </garnt>
<garnt> essential like knowledge that </garnt>
<garnt> i think should be that that i think </garnt>
<joey> everyone should know to be fair though </joey>
<joey> it's like i'm thinking back like when </joey>
<connor> you were like </connor>
<garnt> 15 14 right you wouldn't pay attention </garnt>
<connor> you wouldn't have paid attention </connor>
<garnt> no i mean they always say like oh why </garnt>
<joey> didn't they teach kids about taxes in </joey>
<joey> school as well because i don't think </joey>
<garnt> they're happy </garnt>
<garnt> no one would [ __ ] yeah i think even </garnt>
<garnt> if you aren't </garnt>
<connor> even with taxes i do think that there </connor>
<connor> should have been something yeah yeah no </connor>
<connor> i agree there should be something so at </connor>
<garnt> least you when you get to that point in </garnt>
<garnt> life </garnt>
<garnt> you are aware and you can go back to be </garnt>
<connor> like oh </connor>
<connor> this is why it was important because </connor>
<connor> there's there's so many things like for </connor>
<connor> example </connor>
<connor> i don't know why they're like it's not </connor>
<garnt> compulsory to have a financial </garnt>
<garnt> management course </garnt>
<garnt> in in in in school they should be they </garnt>
<garnt> should they </garnt>
<garnt> because financial management is such an </garnt>
<garnt> as like an </garnt>
<garnt> adult life essential skill and it's </garnt>
<garnt> something that you have to learn </garnt>
<garnt> by just by just either one your parents </garnt>
<garnt> teaching it to you </garnt>
<garnt> or two [ __ ] up and realizing that </garnt>
<garnt> this is an important skill you need to </garnt>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> instead of scores are like no let's </joey>
<joey> learn the quadratic equations yeah but </joey>
<garnt> we'll need that but no let's learn </garnt>
<connor> that's beautiful actually </connor>
<connor> yeah you're doing it on the quadratic </connor>
<connor> equation </connor>
<connor> let's let's let's learn that there are </connor>
<garnt> 180 degrees in the triangle </garnt>
<garnt> i've used that before in my life let's </garnt>
<garnt> learn about the tangents </garnt>
<connor> and the cosine of the side is the </connor>
<connor> powerhouse </connor>
<connor> well you know i think i think why they </connor>
<connor> should be teaching </connor>
<joey> like taxes and financial advice in </joey>
<joey> school is not so that like </joey>
<joey> you get because obviously kids aren't </joey>
<joey> going to [ __ ] come out of school </joey>
<joey> being like hello let me do your taxes </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> just so that when they leave school it's </connor>
<garnt> like it's on the back of their mind yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i've been taught that this is a thing </garnt>
<connor> that's going to come up and that i </connor>
<connor> should learn how it works </connor>
<garnt> for my value yeah exactly it's the whole </garnt>
<garnt> point of school i feel should be </garnt>
<garnt> at least preparing you for what you're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna face in the adult world and you </garnt>
<garnt> know there can be some specialized </garnt>
<garnt> courses yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> i i mean it up but i can understand why </garnt>
<garnt> they teach mathematics and algebra in </garnt>
<garnt> case you want to </garnt>
<garnt> pursue that right what i am saying is </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many </garnt>
<garnt> life essential knowledge that i had to </garnt>
<garnt> learn on the fly and everyone does and i </garnt>
<garnt> was just not taught this stuff in school </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm thinking </garnt>
<garnt> why the [ __ ] is this not taught in </garnt>
<joey> school yeah and the thing is is that </joey>
<joey> like yeah you know people can argue </joey>
<joey> being like you know oh </joey>
<joey> who needs to know the [ __ ] quadratic </joey>
<joey> equation what people are going to like </joey>
<joey> architecture or like math-based stuff </joey>
<joey> but like yeah </joey>
<joey> financial advice and taxes like that it </joey>
<joey> doesn't matter what job you go into </joey>
<joey> you're going to have to deal with it as </joey>
<connor> an adult yeah i mean it's like </connor>
<connor> there's so many things in my school that </connor>
<garnt> we were taught that like </garnt>
<connor> were were replaceable in my mind like we </connor>
<connor> were taught like </connor>
<garnt> we were like dude like media studies and </garnt>
<connor> like jesus where we just like analyze </connor>
<garnt> like newspapers and [ __ ] and just like </garnt>
<garnt> talked about like the media and how they </garnt>
<garnt> advertise this stuff </garnt>
<garnt> it's in my job now but i didn't even get </garnt>
<garnt> anything useful from that yeah i i had </garnt>
<garnt> to do that as well yeah </garnt>
<connor> i didn't have to do that and then i did </connor>
<connor> like cooking which was stupid because </connor>
<joey> i'm let's be honest i'm not a good cook </joey>
<joey> as i'm sure guys will find that to be </joey>
<joey> honest </joey>
<garnt> be honest make money get over easy </garnt>
<joey> that's what it's all about yeah </joey>
<garnt> no but like you could have replaced it </garnt>
<connor> and i think that um </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] what was i going to say [ __ ] i </garnt>
<garnt> totally forgot my point now [ __ ] i'm </garnt>
<garnt> done </garnt>
<connor> go back to you i'll i'll i'll figure it </connor>
<connor> out okay okay no i'm i'm just saying </connor>
<connor> like there's so many </connor>
<connor> important things in life that i just </connor>
<garnt> don't know about like i you know like </garnt>
<garnt> for example i have no idea about </garnt>
<garnt> anything about mortgages or anything </garnt>
<garnt> like that and when i say mortgage you </garnt>
<garnt> say the word mortgage right </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like oh okay you are grown up </garnt>
<garnt> but you know you know yeah </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid you hear the word mortgage </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like i i don't need to worry </garnt>
<joey> about that yeah that's grown-ups i had </joey>
<joey> to learn that [ __ ] on the fly i was like </joey>
<garnt> i don't know what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> the thing is everyone should you know </garnt>
<garnt> aim to own a house or own some property </garnt>
<garnt> that's like the one of the final goals </garnt>
<garnt> in life right </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah it's no nobody's taught this </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] isn't it bad the only time i've </joey>
<joey> ever heard the word mortgage was in a </joey>
<garnt> monopoly game </garnt>
<garnt> that's the only time i've heard and and </garnt>
<garnt> you know well i still would have never </garnt>
<joey> still don't know how to mortgage in a </joey>
<garnt> monopoly game yeah exactly i </garnt>
<garnt> i still i still have like the bare bones </garnt>
<garnt> basic idea about a mortgage because </garnt>
<garnt> i've i've not gone through the process </garnt>
<garnt> of buying house because that [ __ ] sounds </garnt>
<connor> scary to me yeah it is </connor>
<connor> and i i did go and see uh uh mortgage </connor>
<connor> advice </connor>
<connor> just because i wanted to learn more </connor>
<connor> about it and my bank had it for like </connor>

<connor> consultations i had no intention of </connor>
<connor> getting a mortgage i don't even know how </connor>

<connor> making a little bit of money on youtube </connor>
<connor> they were like okay you can talk to our </connor>
<connor> lawyer now who turned out to be a </connor>
<connor> financial advisor so i was like okay </connor>
<connor> um i don't know what to do with this </connor>
<connor> money please help me because otherwise </connor>
<joey> it's just going to collect in a bank </joey>
<joey> probably do [ __ ] nothing and he's </joey>
<joey> like well you could you know </joey>
<connor> mortgage and i'm like that would i </connor>
<connor> i don't know that word yeah ideally </connor>
<connor> anyone with any kind of savings would </connor>
<connor> have a financial advisor sadly you know </connor>
<joey> you know it's it's kind of difficult to </joey>
<joey> get a good one or get one that even you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> like understand yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> down to be like okay this is what i do </joey>
<connor> and he was like wait so you make videos </connor>
<joey> and you get paid to do that now like </joey>
<garnt> yeah and he's like </garnt>
<garnt> okay i mean i would love a financial </garnt>
<garnt> advisor because i </garnt>
<garnt> there's like like there's so little i </garnt>
<garnt> know about it and </garnt>
<garnt> this this kind of this you know the wall </garnt>
<connor> street's bets </connor>
<connor> thing that's been going on has really </connor>
<connor> just opened my eyes to </connor>
<connor> how little i know about this stuff that </connor>
<connor> i feel like i really should know </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah like a youtuber i've been </connor>
<connor> watching recently is a guy called </connor>
<garnt> i think it's graham specter i think </garnt>
<connor> yeah the millionaire guy who's like i </connor>
<connor> saw him in like other videos </connor>
<garnt> where he was talking about it's it's he </garnt>
<garnt> he seems like the most grounded </garnt>
<garnt> millionaire i've </garnt>
<connor> ever you know i couldn't stand him at </connor>
<connor> first he seemed like a dick </connor>
<joey> and then and i started watching him i </joey>
<connor> was like all right okay he's pretty cool </connor>
<connor> but he just came off as like an ass no </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> like the biggest thing that puts me off </garnt>
<garnt> is every episode he goes he does the </garnt>
<garnt> but don't forget to like and subscribe </garnt>
<garnt> if you like the video and </garnt>
<garnt> like no matter how cool a person you are </garnt>
<garnt> if you say it immediately and ironically </garnt>
<garnt> it just like </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah immediate turn off but like i </garnt>
<garnt> was watching some of the videos and some </garnt>
<garnt> of the </garnt>
<garnt> advice that he he gave which was some of </garnt>
<garnt> it was like just like </garnt>
<garnt> really basic financial advice about how </garnt>
<garnt> to like manage your money </garnt>
<garnt> and this the thing is he he gives advice </garnt>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> any person from any level of income can </connor>
<connor> you can like um </connor>
<connor> can can take to heart because uh like </connor>
<connor> one of the ideas that he </connor>
<connor> really tried to propagate is like no </connor>
<connor> matter how much you earn you can you can </connor>
<connor> everyone should get into the mindset </connor>
<connor> well that you can invest something yeah </connor>
<connor> that's that's what that's what i </connor>
<connor> because i i was i had grown up with the </connor>
<garnt> mindset of like </garnt>
<connor> people the word investment that's for </connor>
<garnt> rich people that's for privileged people </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> i can't invest i don't have the money to </garnt>
<garnt> invest but even just investing like </garnt>
<garnt> a fraction of your paycheck or something </garnt>
<garnt> in the long term </garnt>
<garnt> can really help you financially and give </garnt>
<garnt> you a lot of financial stability and </garnt>
<garnt> this this is the stuff that we just we </garnt>
<garnt> were just never taught like </garnt>
<connor> i i guess as well because you hear so </connor>
<connor> many horror stories about investments </connor>
<connor> going wrong and you also hear about like </connor>
<garnt> you know people who take advantage of </garnt>
<garnt> people with like you know </garnt>
<garnt> find a fake financial advisor who says </garnt>
<garnt> i'll help you out with your money and </garnt>
<garnt> then just </garnt>
<garnt> runs off with it right yeah yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> it's so scary to trust someone with any </garnt>
<garnt> amount of money </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and you know if even if you have </garnt>
<garnt> like barely anything </garnt>
<garnt> it's still all you have right it's scary </garnt>
<garnt> to give that to someone yeah yeah like </garnt>
<connor> oh i trust you </connor>
<garnt> to take care of this because because the </garnt>
<garnt> way that i was taught up because uh you </garnt>
<garnt> know i i </garnt>
<garnt> i also didn't come from like the most </garnt>
<garnt> well-off family so did i </garnt>
<connor> you didn't have a lawyer or a finance i </connor>
<garnt> i don't know i didn't have a family </garnt>
<connor> financially </connor>
<garnt> i just gave joey's parents i thought </garnt>
<garnt> everyone had one of those i mean my </garnt>
<connor> parents </connor>
<connor> my parents declared like bankruptcy when </connor>
<connor> i was a teenager it was you know it's oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah so you know i i was taught i was </connor>
<connor> like i grew up with the mentality that </connor>
<connor> you know you should try to keep your </connor>
<connor> money safe you should </connor>
<connor> you know gather up as much as possible </connor>
<connor> and i realized how much this mentality </connor>
<connor> had affected how i think about just </connor>
<connor> resources in general </connor>
<connor> so what what i realized is that i'm that </connor>
<connor> gamer right </connor>
<connor> i i am that gamer who whenever you know </connor>
<connor> you know whenever you play an rpg you </connor>
<connor> don't use anything </connor>
<connor> and you get you get it you get a rare </connor>
<connor> item don't use it i don't use it </connor>
<connor> and whenever i play like command and </connor>
<connor> conquer or something or some </connor>
<connor> rts games right i wait until i have a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ton of resources </connor>
<connor> and then i start buying stuff out and i </connor>
<connor> realized i realized this </connor>
<connor> this week when i when i was like where </connor>
<connor> did this come from and i realized oh </connor>
<connor> it's because that's just how i manage my </connor>
<garnt> money and that's just </garnt>
<garnt> i i've always come in the mindset of </garnt>
<garnt> i've got to save this just in case of a </garnt>
<garnt> rainy day i can't invest it </garnt>
<garnt> i need to save it because you know </garnt>
<garnt> investing money might be </garnt>
<garnt> risky so it's better to just save it and </garnt>
<garnt> you know i i kind of realized this as i </garnt>
<garnt> was doing research and i </garnt>
<garnt> learned a lot about myself uh this past </garnt>
<connor> week because of a [ __ ] meme </connor>
<connor> because a lot of like entrepreneurs are </connor>
<joey> like spending everything they have like </joey>
<joey> just goes like right into buying [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like they have like no savings it's just </joey>
<joey> all the businesses </joey>
<joey> it's all just high risk high rewards </joey>
<joey> yeah but then also as well you know </joey>
<joey> online there's so much of those fake </joey>
<garnt> stupid entrepreneurs </garnt>
<garnt> online that have just really like ruined </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind </garnt>
<connor> the image of an entrepreneur dude speed </connor>
<garnt> run ruin in like five years dude </garnt>
<garnt> if i go on like a twitter or a social </garnt>
<garnt> media and it has the word entrepreneur </garnt>
<connor> on it right you know two years ago </connor>
<joey> yeah entrepreneur was probably one of </joey>
<joey> the coolest things you could say like </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> you're an entrepreneur now i just think </garnt>
<garnt> oh you're just doing a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> multi-level marketing scam to me </garnt>
<garnt> oh you're selling me a course on how to </garnt>
<connor> be more confident have you seen those </connor>
<connor> courses yeah </connor>
<connor> those things are insane they cost like </connor>
<connor> it's like 1k for the first course and </connor>
<connor> then they're like </connor>
<connor> all right now you've unlocked the </connor>
<connor> ability to get the next level of the </connor>
<connor> course for only five thousand dollars </connor>
<joey> and it blows my mind they're like trying </joey>
<joey> to teach you [ __ ] that can't be learnt </joey>
<connor> yeah it but it blows my mind that that </connor>
<connor> people buy into this stuff </connor>
<connor> because they're obviously just people </connor>
<garnt> who have who are spending the money </garnt>
<garnt> you're giving them </garnt>
<garnt> on this lavish lifestyle but then they </garnt>
<garnt> sell back to you like </garnt>
<garnt> it's insane and i don't know how people </garnt>
<garnt> get sucked into this like </garnt>
<garnt> with like when we were talking about the </garnt>
<garnt> gambling stuff i can understand how </garnt>
<garnt> somebody can get into gambling you can </garnt>
<garnt> gamble away </garnt>
<connor> i don't understand how someone can watch </connor>
<connor> these entrepreneurs right these fake </connor>
<connor> entrepreneurs talk about how </connor>
<connor> they can make you loads of money and </connor>
<connor> they can tell you how to be like there's </connor>
<connor> loads like real </connor>
<connor> realtors have you seen those yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like i could teach you </connor>
<connor> the best real estate course of your life </connor>
<connor> just come here for a hundred dollars and </connor>
<connor> then </connor>
<connor> have someone else do [ __ ] and then have </connor>
<connor> five more classes i'm like how does </connor>
<connor> someone believe this [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> it's all fake obviously i don't get it i </garnt>
<garnt> mean someone believes the [ __ ] because </garnt>
<garnt> there's i think the biggest problem is </garnt>
<garnt> that there's </garnt>
<garnt> so much information out there right now </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't know who to believe </garnt>
<garnt> you don't you just gotta i mean i can </garnt>
<garnt> see </garnt>
<garnt> when someone knows nothing about yeah i </garnt>
<connor> i know nothing about many things </connor>
<garnt> yeah but i also know when someone's </garnt>
<connor> chatting out of them no no you know what </connor>
<garnt> i mean </garnt>
<garnt> you have you have a [ __ ] detective </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> a lot of people don't have a 500 pay </joey>
<connor> wall right out the gate for a lesson is </connor>
<connor> normally the first indication of </connor>
<joey> i think to a lot of people you know they </joey>
<joey> see that pay wall and they see the </joey>
<joey> presentation they think oh well this is </joey>
<garnt> probably legit yeah i mean i'm putting </garnt>
<garnt> money into this so that must be like if </garnt>
<joey> they're paid </joey>
<joey> if i have to pay this much for this </joey>
<joey> course then it must bring results yeah </joey>
<connor> maybe maybe i just can't see that </connor>
<connor> because obviously we're doing like </connor>
<joey> entertainment </joey>
<joey> we've been on the internet for long </joey>
<joey> enough to know what's going on </joey>
<joey> we're producing content i know i know </joey>
<connor> what fake content looks like right i can </connor>
<connor> imagine how it was made </connor>
<connor> whenever i see one of those like </connor>
<connor> marketing um </connor>
<connor> trailers of like oh you can learn x </connor>
<garnt> amount and earn x amount i swear they </garnt>
<garnt> they all have the same [ __ ] templates </garnt>
<garnt> and with the same inspiring stock the </garnt>
<connor> first </connor>
<connor> music i made three thousand dollars the </connor>
<connor> next month after that </connor>
<garnt> i made one million dollars and it's like </garnt>
<connor> oh i'm sure you did </connor>
<connor> i'm sure you did off off mugging </connor>
<garnt> everyone off yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's it's like the equivalent </garnt>
<garnt> of going on a piracy site and then </garnt>
<garnt> seeing the </garnt>
<garnt> adverts of i earned ten thousand dollars </garnt>
<garnt> from filling out surveys </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like who the [ __ ] actually </garnt>
<garnt> clicks on this and believes this stuff </garnt>
<connor> it is </connor>
<garnt> the fact that you're advertising on like </garnt>
<garnt> not even pornhub or like </garnt>
<garnt> some shady hentai website this pill and </garnt>
<joey> your dick will go </joey>
<garnt> three times the size in three months it </garnt>
<connor> must i don't think about it more it must </connor>
<joey> come from </joey>
<joey> like targeting insecurities right like </joey>
<joey> absolutely yeah like </joey>
<joey> some people are very insecure about </joey>
<joey> their financial amount yeah like </joey>
<joey> absolutely i'm sure there's other things </joey>
<joey> like that i mean i just realized now </joey>
<joey> why would they offer dick pills oh </joey>
<joey> because people are pretty insecure about </joey>
<joey> their dicks back looking right yeah </joey>
<connor> that's </connor>
<connor> probably the same kind of yeah and they </connor>
<connor> probably and they don't know any better </connor>
<joey> right they just think like well i want </joey>
<joey> just the quickest easiest like most </joey>
<joey> straightforward way to get a lot of </joey>
<connor> money oh look at this ad </connor>
<connor> it's a harsh lesson in life to learn </connor>
<connor> that miracles truly donate </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean i mean it's i'm sure </garnt>
<joey> it's really thought that you need to </joey>
<joey> actually put that </joey>
<connor> work and effort into it yeah that might </connor>
<joey> just be that might be a lifelong yes </joey>
<joey> i don't think any amount of pills is </joey>
<connor> going to save you only so many times you </connor>
<garnt> can pop that bag yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> exactly no i mean i feel like it's the </garnt>
<garnt> same reason why people fall for </garnt>
<connor> multi-level marketing scams apparently </connor>
<connor> this is really bad in the us i have a </connor>
<connor> lot of friends from the us who tell me </connor>
<connor> that they know </connor>
<connor> they've met loads of their friends from </connor>
<connor> high school who tell them that </connor>
<connor> constantly message him about it really </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> i don't know how bad it is because i'm </connor>
<connor> connected to strange people who have </connor>
<connor> strange friends but </connor>
<connor> meline do you have friends who are </connor>
<connor> multi-level marketing people you do </connor>
<connor> alkaline water all right so you are </connor>
<connor> live ladies and gentlemen i have one </connor>
<connor> case my proof is there </connor>
<garnt> i mean yeah i've i know a few people </garnt>
<connor> from america as well </connor>
<connor> yeah maybe not like directly but you </connor>
<connor> know people yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i know people and even i think sydney's </connor>
<connor> mom has like </connor>
<connor> on an off occasion message sydney about </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> you know nice little scheme that can </connor>
<connor> make him money but </connor>
<garnt> you know seeing the obviously like steps </garnt>
<connor> in and it's because i mean it </connor>
<connor> it really preys on people who are </connor>
<connor> looking for that out looking for that </connor>
<connor> out in their life that you know that you </connor>
<connor> when you're stuck at a dead-end job </connor>
<connor> and you are you're old enough where you </connor>
<connor> feel like </connor>
<connor> you're you're kind of stuck here you're </connor>
<connor> not young enough to do something crazy </connor>
<connor> or just quit everything you have </connor>
<connor> responsibilities </connor>
<connor> you know you kind of look for a way that </connor>
<connor> can </connor>
<connor> that can that can get you out of this </connor>
<connor> lifestyle whatever that is and sometimes </connor>
<connor> i mean that's why </connor>
<joey> that's why it's that's don't get me </joey>
<connor> wrong oh i was gonna say like don't get </connor>
<connor> me wrong like you know </connor>
<connor> in order to like get out of that kind of </connor>
<joey> stuff like risk taking is definitely </joey>
<connor> a thing that you have to do but there's </connor>
<connor> risk taking there's making mistakes </connor>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> there's there's responsible risk taking </joey>
<joey> where you'll always have a fallback </joey>
<joey> if it doesn't work out and then there's </joey>
<connor> just a risk take where you just yolo it </connor>
<connor> yeah at the end of the day right the </connor>
<connor> let's be honest right the way life works </connor>
<joey> if somebody had </joey>
<joey> a million dollar idea yeah right a </joey>
<joey> stranger isn't going to come up to you </joey>
<joey> and pitch it to you </joey>
<joey> they're going to [ __ ] do it </joey>
<joey> themselves yeah exactly right like if </joey>
<connor> anyone comes up to you promising to make </connor>
<connor> you money that should be the biggest red </connor>
<garnt> flag </garnt>
<garnt> in existence nobody nobody can promise </garnt>
<garnt> to make you money yeah yeah for for </garnt>
<garnt> example </garnt>
<garnt> like if if that person also promising to </garnt>
<connor> make you that money </connor>
<connor> is a billionaire themselves why the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> aren't they doing it yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> exactly which is when i realized where </garnt>
<garnt> like you know when </garnt>
<garnt> what i've realized growing up is you </garnt>
<garnt> know my my mom and dad would give me you </garnt>
<garnt> know advice </garnt>
<garnt> about how to be successful in x and why </garnt>
<connor> and i love my mom and dad </connor>
<connor> but then i came to a point when i </connor>
<connor> realized that some of the mentality </connor>
<connor> especially when managing money </connor>
<connor> was was not wrong per se because that's </connor>
<connor> what that's the </connor>
<connor> mentality that they had to survive </connor>
<connor> because that's the environment it was </connor>
<connor> just different </connor>
<connor> yeah it was a different environment i </connor>
<connor> got to realize i'm growing up under </connor>
<connor> different circumstances </connor>
<connor> and i have to you know i have to choose </connor>
<connor> sometimes whenever </connor>
<connor> some advice does pertain to me and when </connor>
<connor> it's when it doesn't and when someone's </connor>
<connor> promising you to make money that's like </connor>
<connor> okay we're three successful youtubers </connor>
<connor> right but as much as and as much advice </connor>
<connor> as we can give </connor>
<connor> we cannot promise a random person to </connor>
<connor> make them a successful youtuber </connor>
<connor> right we can give advice about how to </connor>
<garnt> increase their chances </garnt>
<garnt> and how to you know how to help work the </garnt>
<joey> algorithm for example but we're not </joey>
<joey> going to drop like a million dollar </joey>
<joey> video idea because </joey>
<garnt> we would just do that there's no way </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way that i can sit here and </garnt>
<garnt> guarantee you that yes </garnt>
<garnt> i can give you advice to make you a </garnt>
<garnt> youtuber that gets a million subscribers </garnt>
<garnt> nobody can do that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> earn x amount from you as far as i'm </garnt>
<joey> concerned we were all very lucky in that </joey>
<garnt> case as well right we had </garnt>
<connor> we had the we had the odds in our favor </connor>
<joey> but yeah it was but nobody taught us or </joey>
<garnt> like told us what to do </garnt>
<garnt> i mean like i i i preach by that you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> uh we we did we did a lot of things </garnt>
<garnt> right uh and </garnt>
<garnt> we all were also very lucky in a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> aspects there wasn't there wasn't one </garnt>
<garnt> without the other </garnt>
<garnt> um there are things that you can do to </garnt>
<garnt> increase your chances of success and </garnt>
<garnt> massively </garnt>
<garnt> get the odds into your favor but to </garnt>
<garnt> guarantee something to guarantee success </garnt>
<garnt> like that it's </garnt>
<connor> pretty much impossible yeah i think the </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> sad truth of life is that you just </connor>
<connor> realize this is like i think the stock </connor>
<garnt> market looks like a [ __ ] casino too </garnt>
<garnt> many people and </garnt>
<garnt> i thought it was a lot a lot of the </garnt>
<garnt> hedge funds do treat it like such yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly </garnt>
<garnt> we learned that today at the end of the </garnt>
<garnt> day </garnt>
<garnt> it's truly a sad moment when you realize </garnt>
<garnt> there isn't really a get-rich-quick </garnt>
<garnt> scheme </garnt>
<garnt> in life it doesn't exist right and like </garnt>
<joey> if you're looking for that i feel like </joey>
<connor> you're already setting yourself up to be </connor>
<joey> disappointed or organized if there was a </joey>
<joey> scheme that could 100 </joey>
<connor> give you like a success rate of like </connor>
<connor> you're gonna get famous </connor>
<joey> you wouldn't think everybody would be </joey>
<connor> doing that it might make someone rich </connor>
<connor> probably not gonna be you </connor>
<garnt> yeah okay like here's the thing like </garnt>
<garnt> dude like reading up </garnt>
<garnt> about a lot of like financial advice and </garnt>
<garnt> everything that i have for </garnt>
<garnt> the past you know the past week so this </garnt>
<garnt> is this is like take this with an exact </garnt>
<connor> same three people who don't know what </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] they're talking about financial </connor>
<garnt> discuss financially </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly okay we do not take any of </garnt>
<connor> our advice yeah </connor>
<connor> we do have to make a disclaimer about </connor>
<connor> this but from what i've read and from </connor>
<connor> what i've seen it's it seems like </connor>
<connor> you know you you can definitely increase </connor>
<connor> your chances of you know </connor>
<connor> being successful in life but the problem </connor>
<connor> is that a lot of </connor>
<connor> a lot of the i love the legitimate </connor>
<connor> advice i've seen </connor>
<connor> it it seems to stem from uh you don't </connor>
<connor> get rich quick it's all boring stuff </connor>
<garnt> it's all put your money in safe places </garnt>
<connor> it's the longest wait ten </connor>
<garnt> wait 10 to 20 years and you'll be well </garnt>
<connor> off in life and nobody wants to hear </connor>
<garnt> that advice that's just </garnt>
<connor> boring that shit's boring but you </connor>
<garnt> you don't want to hear about [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> roth iras or put your put your money in </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] cash i want a game stop oh </connor>
<connor> my games </connor>
<connor> yeah exactly they want to hear something </connor>
<connor> exciting but when you hear like </connor>
<connor> boring financial advice you just kind of </connor>
<garnt> tune out and you're like oh okay so </garnt>
<garnt> i can get rich but just not now but like </garnt>
<garnt> in </garnt>
<garnt> 10 20 no no more like when i retire i'm </garnt>
<connor> gonna have a retirement fund </connor>
<connor> unless god figured out why all the old </connor>
<connor> people hold all the wealth in nearly </connor>
<connor> every </connor>
<connor> developed country yeah why because i </connor>
<connor> noticed right when i was i was just </connor>
<garnt> looking around for maybe like i wanted </garnt>
<garnt> to just talk to about financial advisors </garnt>
<garnt> not like do anything </garnt>
<connor> i just wanted to talk to them yeah and </connor>
<garnt> just have like the free consultations </garnt>
<connor> and talk to them just figure out what </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] like what do they do what can </connor>
<connor> they do what's a good one with a bad one </connor>
<connor> yeah and i noticed on all of the </connor>
<connor> websites at least in the uk every single </connor>
<connor> one </connor>
<garnt> right was just like it was picture of </garnt>
<garnt> some some young man </garnt>
<garnt> helping an old person out on a laptop </garnt>
<garnt> pointing at the monitor like </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was all stalking yeah it was </garnt>
<garnt> it was like oh it was </garnt>
<garnt> all just like pension advice pension </garnt>
<garnt> pension pension and like </garnt>
<garnt> long term long term like none of it was </garnt>
<garnt> like risky </garnt>
<garnt> yeah none of it was for young people </garnt>
<connor> because yeah because you know let's be </connor>
<connor> honest </connor>
<connor> young people don't don't do that don't </connor>
<connor> do that no no </connor>
<connor> um so yeah it was just it was really you </connor>
<connor> kind of just like a lot of the things </connor>
<connor> that you'd noticed about the world </connor>
<connor> started to fall in place when you start </connor>
<connor> looking you're like </connor>
<connor> yeah ah okay everything's starting to </connor>
<garnt> make sense now yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah like my best advice to anyone </garnt>
<garnt> young watching this </garnt>
<garnt> is um if if this conversation leads to </garnt>
<garnt> anything just </garnt>
<garnt> go out and do your research actually </garnt>
<garnt> read up about this [ __ ] because i i </garnt>
<connor> don't [ __ ] sign up to a 500 </connor>
<garnt> no i will [ __ ] i will disown you </garnt>
<garnt> don't don't do that just read up </garnt>
<connor> about basic financial advice everything </connor>
<connor> you need to know is free every yeah </connor>
<connor> that's the thing everything you need to </connor>
<connor> know is free and the only thing stopping </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> is your own laziness because that's that </connor>
<connor> is me reading </connor>
<connor> me reading up about this felt like i had </connor>
<garnt> just gained five levels of </garnt>
<garnt> of info that i should have known when i </garnt>
<garnt> was in my twenties and i'm just like why </garnt>
<garnt> why didn't i know this [ __ ] before i i </garnt>
<garnt> was stupid i was lazy </garnt>
<connor> and yeah don't don't expect to get rich </connor>
<garnt> off the [ __ ] gamestop stonks and sure </garnt>
<garnt> they're like </garnt>
<joey> the road is going to be long and </joey>
<joey> probably really boring yeah i'm </joey>

<garnt> fun okay actually i love stuff so </garnt>
<connor> we have the classic to start with what </connor>
<connor> is that </connor>
<connor> so this is as i've said a text to my </connor>
<connor> personal number okay what how did they </connor>
<joey> get your personal number that's what i </joey>
<joey> want to know gone i don't know </joey>
<joey> so this happened about i think four or </joey>
<joey> five months into my youtube </joey>
<joey> career if you will yeah i thought great </joey>
<joey> i haven't leaked anything </joey>
<joey> 2015. yeah i was wondering how the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> someone had done this yeah yeah um so it </joey>
<joey> turned out at the time </joey>
<joey> i had an iphone and the email that i </joey>
<connor> listed </connor>
<connor> was actually like my email link to my </connor>
<connor> iphone account </connor>
<connor> right and someone had just connected the </connor>
<connor> dots of like oh i should put </connor>
<connor> this email in my iphone text connor </connor>
<garnt> don't use iphone anymore oh </garnt>
<garnt> that's how because they didn't they did </garnt>
<connor> they did the imessage thing </connor>
<connor> right right so i deleted that email so </connor>
<garnt> yeah it doesn't exist immediately yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i was like [ __ ] this but </garnt>
<garnt> at the time it was very creepy to wake </garnt>
<garnt> up to a text from an american number </garnt>
<connor> being like </connor>
<connor> hi is this connor by the way it's not </connor>
<connor> exactly being hit on but </connor>
<connor> stopped it before it could get there </connor>
<connor> yeah that's the first one i think it's a </connor>
<garnt> stock image </garnt>
<garnt> i've actually had something similar </garnt>
<joey> happened to me admire my stuff i have a </joey>
<garnt> lot of questions about the stocking </garnt>
<connor> why is there a potato there what is that </connor>
<connor> stock image i don't know these are all </connor>
<connor> strange stock images so </connor>
<connor> she's just saying no to the potato but </connor>
<garnt> like yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> i've had something i've had similar </garnt>
<garnt> things happen to me where i'm not gonna </garnt>
<garnt> name </garnt>
<garnt> what uh messaging app or whatever it was </garnt>
<garnt> on but uh </garnt>
<garnt> like i've realized that you could find </garnt>
<garnt> my username </garnt>
<garnt> obviously pretty easily through this </garnt>
<garnt> messaging app and i i would get like </garnt>
<garnt> people adding me and just messaging me </garnt>
<garnt> randomly on it and then </garnt>
<garnt> and that that that was that was a humble </garnt>
<joey> experience to realize oh okay i can't </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<garnt> yeah i [ __ ] up i can't use this email </garnt>
<connor> for everything now </connor>
<connor> all right the classy the fan mail the </connor>
<joey> actual </joey>
<joey> handwritten letter oh oh like physical </joey>
<connor> okay is this essentially your p.o box </connor>
<connor> this was sent to my po box okay </connor>
<garnt> i was about to ask how they found your </garnt>
<connor> address yeah p.o box you know </connor>
<garnt> had a you know had a few letters that </garnt>
<garnt> were asking if i was you know </garnt>
<garnt> because they would know what conventions </garnt>
<connor> i'm going to and then they would say hey </connor>
<connor> is it possible that maybe we could you </connor>
<connor> know go on a date or something </connor>
<joey> and obviously you know i never got that </joey>
<joey> even when i was single </joey>
<connor> no no what uh maybe the times have </connor>
<connor> changed joey yeah but </connor>
<joey> youtubers weren't cool back then you </joey>
<connor> know right this is like two three years </connor>
<connor> ago this used to happen it didn't happen </connor>
<connor> that often </connor>
<connor> but like people would attach their </connor>
<connor> numbers and like and they never </connor>
<garnt> i mean by the time when i first started </garnt>
<joey> really blowing up on the anime community </joey>
<joey> i was already </joey>
<joey> pretty much dating sydney oh yeah and </joey>
<joey> you know if if </joey>
<joey> like sydney makes a let's see she marks </joey>
<garnt> the territory </garnt>
<garnt> she wards off the laser </garnt>
<joey> on a and then this one is the modern the </joey>
<joey> fan email obviously you get emails okay </joey>
<garnt> yeah we still get that </garnt>
<connor> classic you know you can get that </connor>
<connor> classic yeah </connor>
<connor> um and then this is the the stock image </connor>
<connor> because this is me putting the emails in </connor>
<connor> the trash </connor>
<joey> uh when you send them to me this is all </joey>
<joey> the fan mails we get for trash taste </joey>
<garnt> i hate you it's not funny all pretty </garnt>
<garnt> standard so far for youtubers </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah okay okay next we have uh </connor>
<connor> the the </connor>
<connor> extra classy i would have a i used to do </connor>
<joey> patreon fan letters </joey>
<joey> where you could pay to be pen pals with </joey>
<joey> me okay that sounds </joey>
<joey> like that doesn't sound like a nightmare </joey>
<joey> is about to happen that </joey>
<joey> when i made that i didn't think it was </joey>
<joey> gonna so it's not on there anymore but </joey>
<connor> it used to i used to think that it was </connor>
<connor> like oh this is such a cool way to </connor>
<connor> connect with me </connor>
<connor> yeah and i didn't realize about like the </connor>
<garnt> logistics yeah yeah because you never do </garnt>
<garnt> with patreon you never think about the </garnt>
<garnt> logistics until you realize </garnt>
<joey> oh i have to do this every month yeah </joey>
<connor> basically i agreed to write like 20 </connor>
<garnt> letters </garnt>
<joey> a month which uh i'm not good at writing </joey>
<joey> either and i don't like writing yeah so </joey>
<joey> writing one </joey>
<joey> one letter for me takes like 30 minutes </joey>
<joey> i've seen it i've seen your handwriting </joey>
<joey> so it's not </joey>
<joey> writing so much so it was just painful </joey>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> it was really frustrating as well sorry </connor>
<connor> i'll go on to have got hit </connor>
<connor> after but it was frustrating as well </connor>
<connor> because like people would join patreon </connor>
<connor> for like one month and leave so i would </connor>
<garnt> send out a letter </garnt>
<garnt> that would just be like hi how are you </garnt>
<garnt> nice to meet you tell me about yourself </garnt>
<garnt> and then not get a response but i'd have </garnt>
<garnt> to write </garnt>
<connor> but i'd have to write like seven of </connor>
<connor> those letters a month yeah every month </connor>
<garnt> and i was like doing them all by hand </garnt>
<garnt> how how long was the letter itself uh </garnt>
<connor> like a page or two </connor>
<connor> jesus jeez that's a long for how much a </connor>
<connor> month i think it was on like the 40 </connor>
<connor> tier but that was included with the </connor>
<garnt> voicemail so like how much how much </garnt>
<garnt> would uh </garnt>
<connor> let's let's break this down cost to </connor>
<garnt> effort-wise how much would it take you </garnt>
<connor> too long write a letter not long </connor>
<connor> i mean i guess if they paid 40 dollars </connor>
<connor> for 30 minutes worth of work but </connor>
<connor> i always get distracted and i couldn't </connor>
<connor> focus because i just didn't want to be </connor>
<connor> doing it </connor>
<connor> yeah right so it was awful but yeah i </connor>
<connor> had i had someone as well </connor>
<connor> same same with a fan letter who was like </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> they like it was this really weird </connor>
<connor> situation where i'm not really sure what </connor>
<connor> happened </connor>
<connor> because i was just being like ah yeah </connor>
<connor> cool i like pokemon too </connor>
<connor> i like these things because i would try </connor>
<connor> and be honest and try and make a </connor>
<connor> friendship with them </connor>
<connor> yeah and then they were like they </connor>
<connor> replied one time being like oh </connor>
<connor> yeah so i told my my co-workers at work </connor>
<connor> that i have a boyfriend and i said it </connor>
<connor> was you </connor>
<connor> and i was like and then they asked like </connor>
<connor> is that okay and i was like </connor>
<connor> uh sure i don't give a [ __ ] like i'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna go wrong i'm not gonna go around </connor>
<connor> saying that </connor>
<garnt> you can say that like she she </garnt>
<garnt> she brings up the sea dog va youtubers </garnt>
<garnt> that's amazing </garnt>
<connor> she's like you wanna see my boyfriend my </connor>
<garnt> boy look at that guy </garnt>
<garnt> sebastian he's he's his name's sebastian </garnt>
<connor> i'm just thinking </connor>
<connor> i'm like is that a brag because if they </connor>
<connor> pull up my videos half of them is either </connor>
<joey> going to be me reading bl </joey>
<joey> or me uh in the cosplay yeah and i think </joey>
<joey> i think they were from like midwest </joey>
<joey> somewhere </joey>
<joey> it's a very conservative state so i </joey>
<joey> couldn't imagine they would take too </joey>
<joey> kindly to </joey>
<connor> me being like naked in my room basically </connor>
<connor> going ah you know like </connor>
<connor> so yeah that was interesting that was </connor>
<joey> fun um also it's a boyfriend that never </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] responds to like </joey>
<joey> messages already it's a boyfriend this </joey>
<connor> is a one-way boyfriend boyfriend that </connor>
<connor> yeah that replies uh </connor>
<connor> once a month via mail yeah but yeah i </connor>
<connor> ended up getting rid of that because uh </connor>
<joey> yeah just stuff like that sounds like </joey>
<joey> effort yeah and also just way too much </joey>
<joey> effort and this is the stock image to </joey>
<garnt> accompany it </garnt>
<garnt> oh what is that </garnt>
<connor> this is this was this is me writing the </connor>
<connor> reply email to the hitman that they </connor>
<connor> hired if i didn't say yes they were </connor>
<garnt> dating and then yeah this is </garnt>
<connor> the obvious this is called nutting </connor>
<connor> during fan courses i've popped i made a </connor>
<connor> video about this you can watch it yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's really old now </garnt>
<garnt> i i know the story but yeah so </garnt>
<connor> essentially there was this time </connor>
<connor> where i was doing uh fan call as hetalia </connor>
<joey> characters </joey>
<joey> where she sounds like cringe already </joey>
<connor> yeah so i was doing it i was doing it </connor>
<connor> with someone else who was doing another </connor>
<connor> voice </connor>
<connor> and we were on the call with the person </connor>
<connor> and i thought </connor>
<garnt> like there's some weird breathing sounds </garnt>
<garnt> coming from them but like </garnt>
<garnt> i was like huh this sounds a little </garnt>
<connor> weird but i didn't think much of it </connor>
<connor> wasn't melon </connor>
<garnt> you bring a ducky mackerel of someone </garnt>
<connor> from like vampires </connor>
<connor> so like yes so like what happened was </connor>
<connor> that we were on this call i thought </connor>
<connor> that's weird then when we got off the </connor>
<connor> call it was only like </connor>
<connor> six seven minutes all right i was like </connor>
<connor> was that was that weird that call was </connor>
<connor> weird </connor>
<connor> right yeah like oh no i don't i don't </connor>
<connor> think so but i was editing the audio </connor>
<connor> yeah so i go back and listen to the </connor>
<connor> audio </connor>
<connor> and i'm like she's definitely nothing </connor>
<connor> that ain't like that isn't like </connor>
<connor> that isn't like hyperventilating breath </connor>
<connor> that is like it was like slow </connor>
<connor> deep breaths </connor>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<connor> like that and i was like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> so i made a video about it but i i pitch </connor>
<connor> shift it and changed it and it sounds </connor>
<connor> even creepier </connor>
<connor> it sounds like a two-year-old scary yeah </connor>
<joey> because i wanted to protect their </joey>
<garnt> you know particular identity obviously </garnt>
<garnt> because right i don't know if it was i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if it wasn't but like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we don't say it don't sound good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah but yeah there's all </garnt>
<garnt> that i had cut a lot of people oh that's </garnt>
<garnt> a bit of yikes there yeah </garnt>
<garnt> how did you handle that you just you're </garnt>
<garnt> playing character right so </garnt>
<connor> i'm would you when you do those calls </connor>
<connor> you're in character so like when people </connor>
<connor> would say stuff </connor>
<connor> i would reply as if like in character </connor>
<joey> like to reject them i just i just </joey>
<joey> like to imagine he's just like you just </joey>
<connor> hear like </connor>
<garnt> like which italian character were you </garnt>
<connor> playing i was playing france from </connor>
<connor> italian </connor>
<connor> but he's like he's like uh i i've never </connor>
<connor> watched italia </connor>
<connor> but i assumed he was like a bit of a </connor>
<joey> player from what i understood but </joey>
<joey> i would have loved it if he was playing </joey>
<joey> like italy and he was just like they </joey>
<garnt> were playing </garnt>
<garnt> france they were playing yeah they were </garnt>
<garnt> playing italy </garnt>

<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> to be fair it would happen fairly often </garnt>
<garnt> but i nearly always cut them because it </garnt>
<garnt> was just cringe </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i just feel like i want to </garnt>
<garnt> date about sebastian i'd be like no no </garnt>
<garnt> no no one is worthy of me like that i </garnt>
<connor> would like because i don't know why </connor>
<connor> because because like it's really like </connor>
<connor> dude when you're because i wear them in </connor>
<connor> the zone </connor>
<garnt> and i would do these calls like i would </garnt>
<garnt> like fully believe in that moment that i </garnt>
<garnt> was like that like because </garnt>
<garnt> you have to if you want to do it good i </garnt>
<garnt> mean you're you're playing a character </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah so when people would </garnt>
<garnt> say stuff like that i would just like </garnt>
<garnt> snarkily just insult them straight away </garnt>
<garnt> because they loved it yeah like it was </garnt>
<garnt> and it was fun like </garnt>
<garnt> everyone dude imagine being an [ __ ] i </garnt>
<garnt> was like oh my god he's amazing how long </garnt>
<garnt> did you do this for </garnt>
<joey> these calls yeah i did them for like two </joey>
<garnt> three years how is this how </garnt>
<joey> no because when it was when it went well </joey>
<garnt> it was really fun because people had </garnt>
<garnt> such a genuine like </garnt>
<joey> happy response great it was just you had </joey>
<joey> to just deal with some weird [ __ ] that's </joey>
<joey> fast </joey>
<joey> fairly often yeah um and so i was like </joey>
<connor> all right i'm a head out </connor>
<connor> like this like the stock image uh from </connor>
<connor> that they're </connor>
<garnt> that cool am i right i'm only joking </garnt>
<garnt> melon you and you're probably never that </garnt>
<connor> bad right yeah no no she was </connor>
<connor> she still is she is worse </connor>
<garnt> i've seen her when she gets around to no </garnt>
<joey> prince all right </joey>
<garnt> next is the uncomfortable as if and none </garnt>
<garnt> of them were right yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> the last one wasn't uncomfortable uh no </garnt>
<connor> i can deal with that okay because that's </connor>
<connor> in character yeah </connor>
<connor> that's sebastian that's france that's </connor>
<garnt> not my fault </garnt>
<garnt> that's francis she's getting real hot </garnt>
<garnt> for france </garnt>
<garnt> um so yeah so i up until very recently i </garnt>
<joey> used to do patreon phone calls and uh </joey>
<joey> not in character no it's me yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so i would offer </joey>
<joey> and it's gonna sound like a lot for like </joey>
<joey> a hundred dollars an hour uh to have a </joey>
<joey> call with me but then if you ask any </joey>
<joey> youtubers around our size they'll be </joey>
<joey> like wow that's too little </joey>
<garnt> yeah because it's just i know it sounds </garnt>
<garnt> absurd it sounds stupid my parents all </garnt>
<garnt> thought it was dumb they were like </garnt>
<garnt> people </garnt>
<garnt> people pay to speak to you connor that's </garnt>
<garnt> absurd </garnt>
<garnt> my parents got the same reaction why </garnt>
<garnt> would anyone want us to pay to speak to </garnt>
<garnt> you connor </garnt>
<garnt> like mum [ __ ] off mama um so anyway up </garnt>
<garnt> until recently i used to do patreon </garnt>
<connor> phone calls like </connor>
<connor> like i said uh i would have like i'd </connor>
<connor> call it like generations i don't really </connor>
<connor> know why </connor>
<connor> but people would always leave in mess </connor>
<connor> and join a mess and there was only 10 </connor>
<connor> spots on </connor>
<connor> my course so only 10 people at a time </connor>
<connor> could clear these calls all right um </connor>
<connor> and i would only maybe have like one </connor>
<connor> person who was on it for like two plus </connor>
<connor> years </connor>
<connor> but the rest of the time is like </connor>
<connor> rotating people and like </connor>
<connor> i had some really [ __ ] uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> ones that i haven't really spoke about </connor>
<connor> because i'm just like this is so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> weird but i mean this will speak about </connor>
<connor> it now </connor>
<connor> yeah so this is one time this is by far </connor>
<connor> the most uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> um where i'd done two calls to the </connor>
<joey> person and they were like okay they were </joey>
<joey> like oh </joey>
<joey> all right they seem pretty decent seem </joey>
<joey> pretty normal they're from from vegas </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> okay represent yeah i don't know why </joey>
<joey> you're pointing at me </joey>
<joey> and uh they were like i'm sorry i didn't </joey>
<joey> do webcam it was only ever a voice but </joey>
<connor> one time they were like can we do webcam </connor>
<connor> and i was like all right sure </connor>
<connor> i mean what a one-off right like i'll </connor>
<connor> what </connor>
<connor> what's the worst that could happen yeah </connor>
<connor> of course yes yes </connor>
<connor> you guys know what happened yeah but so </connor>
<connor> and i'm like okay sure sure let's do it </connor>
<connor> let's just do webcam whatever </connor>
<connor> you know you've been you've been on the </connor>
<connor> patreon for a while we can do this so we </connor>
<connor> boot up the the call </connor>
<connor> i turn on my webcam sheet on she turns </connor>
<connor> on her webcam </connor>
<connor> uh yeah she's naked she's fully naked </connor>
<connor> but wearing like body paint but like you </connor>
<connor> can </connor>
<garnt> like put the look on ash's face </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> immediately i was like yo what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> and then </connor>
<connor> i was like oh oh no the connection's </connor>
<connor> breaking up </connor>
<garnt> and then like can you hear me i was like </garnt>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<garnt> gosh i'm going through the tunnel oh </garnt>
<connor> yeah i'm just just literally </connor>
<connor> literally the moment it happened like it </connor>
<connor> flashed on the screen i was like smash </connor>
<connor> the red red </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] end before i was like [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> you know how hard british internet man </connor>
<connor> it keeps going out </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm so mad at them man oh i know </connor>
<garnt> i gotta stay on voice you know yeah my </garnt>
<connor> internet can't handle the webinar </connor>
<connor> my webcam just imploded so i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that's awful it wasn't terrible </connor>
<connor> and i had some other uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> things come up and yeah generally just </connor>
<connor> just just not very good things happen </connor>
<connor> that was just like why why are they </connor>
<connor> doing this like they were just hit on </connor>
<connor> you in really uncomfortable ways and </connor>
<connor> you know and to the point where it was </connor>
<garnt> just like you know some people were </garnt>
<garnt> think </garnt>
<garnt> would think that you know you would meet </garnt>
<garnt> some people </garnt>
<garnt> who had clearly never been rejected in </garnt>
<connor> their their their circle right </connor>
<connor> yeah and that they paid they pay me to </connor>
<connor> talk to me and then i'm like </connor>
<joey> well i've never been rejected so it's </joey>
<connor> it's not going to start now right </connor>
<joey> they think i'm going to like well i'm </joey>
<connor> this is a work thing for me i'm there </connor>
<garnt> doing business you know </garnt>
<garnt> it sounds like you had a [ __ ] babe </garnt>
<connor> station call center </connor>
<garnt> honestly it's like it's great 90 people </garnt>
<garnt> it was chill it was just talking to them </garnt>
<garnt> get maybe give them a bit of youtube </garnt>
<connor> advice maybe help them with things </connor>
<connor> super normal calls it's just like some </connor>
<connor> people were like bro this is my end </connor>
<connor> this is my way to get to get like connor </connor>
<connor> to like hang out with me and </connor>
<connor> stuff and like i know all sorts of weird </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like people would go around and um </garnt>
<garnt> like i think recently i used to do like </garnt>
<garnt> voice recordings </garnt>
<garnt> i still do to be fair yeah they're </garnt>
<garnt> really easy but people would go around </garnt>
<garnt> take the voice recordings and say look </garnt>
<garnt> me and connor are best friends </garnt>
<garnt> nah like connor me i have a message from </garnt>
<connor> connor saying hi </connor>
<connor> to me yeah we're kind of like best </connor>
<connor> friends and i'm like do people know like </connor>
<garnt> why do people do this why do you think </garnt>
<garnt> you're getting clout are you comfortable </garnt>
<garnt> with that </garnt>
<connor> that's whatever i wouldn't be </connor>
<joey> comfortable i would not be comfortable i </joey>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<joey> that that that's me someone going around </joey>
<joey> saying that their friend of mine to like </joey>
<connor> get their way is like not good yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean it's it's also you know it's big </connor>
<connor> brain because you know i could be like </connor>
<connor> any time i let's say right god forbid i </connor>
<garnt> say something stupid on a live stream </garnt>
<garnt> we're like no no that's just recording </garnt>
<connor> it just recording </connor>
<garnt> it patreon recording not me no </garnt>
<connor> mean yeah i i never i never recorded </connor>
<joey> anything inappropriate yeah it's just </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> obviously because some people want like </connor>
<garnt> a uh an uplifting message </garnt>
<garnt> down recently and i'm more than happy to </garnt>
<garnt> do that because i'm like you know if me </garnt>
<garnt> giving you a voice message saying hey </garnt>
<connor> man just just </connor>
<connor> you know things will get better just </connor>
<connor> just keep trying i mean i've i've done </connor>
<connor> that before as well but </connor>
<connor> at the same time if i found out that </connor>
<connor> that person oh my god i don't like the </connor>
<garnt> voice of messages anymore yeah what was </garnt>
<joey> going on telling people hey </joey>
<joey> i'm best friends with giggling i'm </joey>
<garnt> impressed friends we've gone and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like okay </garnt>
<garnt> get the [ __ ] out of my life please i </garnt>
<connor> mean that's right </connor>
<connor> i emailed them basically saying hey uh </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm removing you from patreon what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you doing this is sad </connor>
<joey> like yeah like oh yeah of course that's </joey>
<connor> not cool because </connor>
<connor> it wasn't the worst thing was that she </connor>
<connor> wasn't going around to like her close </connor>
<connor> friends for some reason she was going </connor>
<connor> around sending them to other youtubers </connor>
<connor> oh saying i'm friends with connor look i </connor>
<connor> have this message and </connor>
<connor> unfortunately some of those youtubers </connor>
<connor> didn't know that i was doing the patreon </connor>
<garnt> but i mean i i've gone through that as </garnt>
<connor> well where i've had people going around </connor>
<connor> saying that they know me and saying that </connor>
<connor> they it happens </connor>
<connor> i've been friends with me when they </connor>
<connor> weren't just to try and get in with </connor>
<connor> other people </connor>
<connor> and yeah it's like that's that's the </connor>
<garnt> biggest [ __ ] red flag for me but </garnt>
<connor> that's why i </connor>
<connor> that's kind of one of the big reasons as </connor>
<connor> well as time is why i removed the </connor>
<connor> ability to call me on patreon i don't do </connor>
<connor> it anymore you can't have a </connor>
<garnt> phone call with me i mean i i think the </garnt>
<garnt> worst thing that happened to me was it </garnt>
<garnt> literally happened to me at a convention </garnt>
<garnt> where you know i had a guy who was going </garnt>
<garnt> around telling people </garnt>
<garnt> telling companies that they knew me and </garnt>
<garnt> that that they they were trying to use </garnt>
<joey> that as an inn that's </joey>
<joey> that's that's somehow even worse isn't </joey>
<joey> that when they're going around to like </joey>
<connor> because they're potentially ruining your </connor>
<joey> name yeah yeah exactly but they're also </joey>
<connor> trying to profit themselves yeah </connor>
<joey> i can deal with someone being a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> creep i could that's that's insular i </joey>
<joey> can i can i can just immediately shut </joey>
<joey> that down </joey>
<joey> right someone does that that's repairing </joey>
<garnt> i have to do yeah yeah that's horrible </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah luckily </connor>
<connor> you know that's i guess that's why it </connor>
<connor> triggers me so much because i i hear </connor>
<connor> that i'm just i just think </connor>
<connor> too like the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> i would gladly have someone hit on me on </garnt>
<garnt> a call a hundred times </garnt>
<garnt> rather than them go to a company saying </garnt>
<joey> that we're friends yeah you know what i </joey>
<connor> mean because i can you know that's fine </connor>
<garnt> don't do that </garnt>
<garnt> do not do that that is the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] move you could do we have gone </garnt>
<garnt> in uh </garnt>
<connor> 50 years it's egg </connor>

<connor> we came out and there's the two girls </connor>
<joey> there at midnight but there's another </joey>
<connor> time </connor>
<connor> where i came back and this wasn't as </connor>

<garnt> was that an anime convention this was </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>

<garnt> stupid like make sure no one was </garnt>
<garnt> following me </garnt>
<garnt> right as god should have yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> yeah are you this is why i do it even </garnt>
<garnt> though it sounds like </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> i wouldn't have understood until i got </garnt>
<connor> followed back to my room yeah i just </connor>
<connor> i just don't want people to know yeah </connor>
<connor> right like you know um </connor>
<connor> and there was just like for some reason </connor>
<connor> like one girl who looked like in her 30s </connor>
<connor> just like you know how the door frame is </connor>
<connor> like like this just sitting like like </connor>
<connor> this in my door frame like blocking the </connor>
<connor> door </connor>
<connor> what and i was like well like the door's </connor>
<connor> here yeah so that's the frame </connor>
<garnt> that's the frame okay and this is the </garnt>
<garnt> other frame so they're they're just </garnt>
<garnt> there right in front of your door yeah </garnt>

<joey> i think maybe they wanted i don't know </joey>
<joey> if they knew me uh obviously they did </joey>
<connor> when i went but my first thought was </connor>
<connor> like are they just chilling here because </connor>
<connor> i get it because sometimes the </connor>
<connor> the lobby is really crowded and [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> wanna just go to the the alleyway or </connor>
<connor> whatever in the [ __ ] room because </connor>
<connor> they're long </connor>

<garnt> this was my door that's really </garnt>
<garnt> concerning i wanted to ask her never </garnt>

<garnt> why she was in front of my door </garnt>
<garnt> i don't this isn't a know good guy </garnt>

<garnt> the umbrella </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is the youtube clickbait </garnt>
<connor> we're gonna say hit on in yeah </connor>
<connor> this is true and then this is the stock </connor>
<connor> image that i found for this one </connor>
<garnt> although there is that one script or the </garnt>
<connor> audio only listeners this does make me </connor>
<connor> realize about the person who isn't on </connor>
<garnt> the list but the person who named </garnt>
<garnt> that baby after me have we told that </garnt>
<garnt> story </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so back in like when i was really </garnt>
<garnt> doing black butler a lot there was this </garnt>
<garnt> one person </garnt>
<garnt> um who oh this is it i remember i just </garnt>
<garnt> remember the canonical order in my head </garnt>
<garnt> um i went to the black butler meetup the </garnt>
<garnt> canonical order </garnt>
<garnt> this is head canon they're saying the </garnt>
<connor> filler art </connor>
<connor> so what happened was i this was like my </connor>
<connor> first ever ax i can't remember how long </connor>
<garnt> i was doing youtube for but i thought it </garnt>
<garnt> would be cool just to go to the black </garnt>
<garnt> butler meetup and just like be </garnt>
<garnt> like say hi hey man like yeah i'm i'm </garnt>

<connor> content about black butler </connor>
<garnt> because it was like how many years after </garnt>
<garnt> black butler dead and yeah i feel like i </garnt>
<connor> almost made like a mini like renaissance </connor>
<connor> of the fact yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> in terms of western yeah um because it's </connor>
<connor> like the community </connor>
<connor> became way more active and like kind of </connor>
<garnt> like what </garnt>
<garnt> uh the abridged series did for the </garnt>
<garnt> yu-gi-oh anime back in the day i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to say it was like no not </garnt>
<connor> heavy but like i feel like it was </connor>
<connor> definitely a bump because of all the </connor>
<connor> black </connor>
<joey> stuff i was pumped yeah yeah the stuff </joey>
<joey> but anyway so </joey>
<joey> a year goes by right and i go to the you </joey>

<connor> and she's like oh do you want to hold </connor>
<connor> connor </connor>
<connor> i'm like connor i'm like oh that's a </connor>
<connor> funny coincidence </connor>
<connor> i said oh no no it's not a coincidence i </connor>
<connor> named him after you and i'm like </connor>
<connor> okay this is [ __ ] weird this is </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> weird my favorite ever photo is of you </garnt>
<joey> holding baby connor with the most </joey>
<garnt> uncomfortable smile i've ever seen </garnt>
<garnt> how did you even react to that uh just </garnt>
<connor> pure confusion and </connor>
<connor> again you got an insane gun i just go </connor>
<garnt> with everything his face all the babies </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> i mean i would do exactly the same thing </connor>
<garnt> i wanted the picture to reflect like how </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable i was yeah so that i could </garnt>
<garnt> i could like tell the story later on </garnt>
<garnt> now yes there's a picture out there if </garnt>
<garnt> you just google connor with baby maybe i </garnt>
<garnt> don't [ __ ] know what's going on with </garnt>
<garnt> baby </garnt>
<garnt> dog baby well i don't know what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> comes up </garnt>
<garnt> c dog v82 too fat this baby was [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> cute </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but like there's something wholly </garnt>
<connor> uncomfortable about holding a stranger's </connor>
<connor> baby that i just </connor>
<connor> i don't know it's like holding someone's </connor>
<connor> expensive vars you know it's like </connor>
<garnt> i still don't know how to handle babies </garnt>
<connor> like someone asked me if i want to hold </connor>
<connor> if i want to hold their baby and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like does it come with an </connor>
<garnt> instruction manual </garnt>
<garnt> what do i do like i i feel so inadequate </garnt>
<connor> when it comes to handling babies they're </connor>
<connor> great for the 10 seconds where they're </connor>
<connor> not </connor>
<connor> like crying and then the moment you pick </connor>
<garnt> them up and they start crying i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> oh god oh god </garnt>
<garnt> what what do you think please please </garnt>
<connor> stop yeah but like </connor>
<connor> you know as as odd as that is and and </connor>
<connor> almost creepy you could say yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> it's flattering more than anything i </connor>
<connor> guess but it was i mean don't get me </connor>
<joey> wrong they were very nice it's probably </joey>
<garnt> flattering </garnt>
<garnt> in a sense it's flattering i just i i </garnt>
<garnt> would feel that if anyone named a baby </garnt>
<garnt> after me that's a bit that's a bit </garnt>
<connor> too much pressure on me i feel like </connor>
<connor> naming your baby after any influencer is </connor>
<joey> a bad idea did you find them mainly </joey>
<connor> what did you type in </connor>
<connor> okay then found it by typing in c dog </connor>
<connor> baby apparently it comes off i just </connor>
<connor> think it's a bad idea </connor>
<joey> naming your your baby after any </joey>
<garnt> influencer yeah we all know we're just </garnt>
<garnt> one bad team </garnt>
<joey> yeah don't name your kid after your </joey>
<joey> family it's like it's like it's like </joey>
<garnt> getting a tattoo but </garnt>
<connor> yeah favorite but youtuber luckily </connor>
<connor> luckily </connor>
<connor> it was just connor and not c dog v8 yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah that would like it i i have </garnt>
<garnt> i have like no idea how corpse husband </garnt>
<connor> feels whenever </connor>
<joey> when he sees like his voice like what </joey>
<joey> what would you call it </joey>
<joey> his wave file yeah of him </joey>
<garnt> breathing as a tattoo i'm just like man </garnt>
<connor> how did you handle that </connor>
<connor> yeah um yeah so that was </connor>
<garnt> that's how that happens yeah that is </garnt>
<garnt> very bold indeed that is very bold </garnt>
<connor> uh i've got i've got like the next one </connor>
<connor> it's called the smooth paper </connor>
<connor> i've been handed uh pieces of paper </connor>
<connor> before just at conventions you know i'll </connor>
<connor> do i'll just like sign something or i'll </connor>
<connor> i'll take a picture and i'll show me a </connor>
<connor> piece of paper </connor>
<connor> right i'll be like hey here's my number </connor>
<connor> come text me i think that's kind of </connor>
<connor> smooth </connor>
<connor> that's very old stuff i don't know why </connor>
<connor> that's smooth i never replied to any of </connor>
<connor> them because i'm like bro </connor>
<garnt> my phone doesn't work in the u.s sorry i </garnt>
<garnt> just have the internet but </garnt>
<garnt> it's very smooth i like it i actually </garnt>
<garnt> like that one i think it's classy now </garnt>
<garnt> now you're going to get this every </garnt>
<garnt> conversation because it's like it's like </garnt>
<garnt> with this one </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's not intense it's like i i </garnt>
<garnt> if i want to call you i'll call you i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not gonna call you just letting you know </garnt>
<garnt> because i'm too [ __ ] just the casual </garnt>
<garnt> right that's that's how i imagine people </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there's something simple about it </garnt>
<garnt> that's so inoffensive </garnt>
<joey> but maybe it's because i'm a guy i feel </joey>
<joey> like if i was a girl and guys kept doing </joey>
<joey> it to me i'd be like annoyed yeah that'd </joey>
<joey> be very creepy </joey>
<garnt> yeah i kind of like it it's very </garnt>
<garnt> flattering when someone is </garnt>
<connor> attractive and they send you you know </connor>
<connor> they hit on you it's like oh wow </connor>
<connor> this league really oh no get out of here </connor>

<joey> that like </joey>
<joey> he realizes a bit weird yeah he realized </joey>
<connor> that's a bit strange golden rule don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] your fans right </connor>

<garnt> i i just think that's like oh yeah </garnt>

<garnt> because i thought unfortunately there's </garnt>
<joey> a lot of youtubers who probably use that </joey>
<connor> as an ego boost right </connor>
<connor> i mean okay getting in the whole topic </connor>
<connor> of [ __ ] your fans or dating your fans </connor>
<garnt> there is a way to go about it there is a </garnt>
<garnt> right way and there is </garnt>
<garnt> definitely a wrong way like yeah they </garnt>
<garnt> they met through being fans </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and there was a that no one ever </garnt>
<garnt> would question the </garnt>
<garnt> the what's the word legitimacy the </garnt>
<garnt> legitimacy or </garnt>
<garnt> the efficacy of that right that's a </garnt>
<garnt> legitimate relationship </garnt>
<garnt> but there are ways doing it that that it </garnt>
<connor> like taking advantage of your power and </connor>
<connor> i think that's why people have the </connor>
<connor> problem </connor>
<connor> yeah and unfortunately a lot of </connor>
<garnt> youtubers don't understand when they are </garnt>
<connor> just kind of taking advantage of their </connor>
<garnt> own power yeah in the situation yeah i i </garnt>
<garnt> feel i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> like hooking up like i say hooking up </garnt>
<garnt> hooking up with the wrong words </garnt>
<joey> because if hooking up with your fans </joey>
<joey> implies that yeah you you are just kind </joey>
<joey> of just like </joey>
<joey> you're not doing anything you're just </joey>
<joey> kind of throwing throwing your </joey>
<joey> fame out there and everything like that </joey>
<joey> yeah and i feel like you have to be </joey>
<joey> really self-conscious about this and i'm </joey>
<joey> glad that </joey>
<joey> people are like looking more into this </joey>
<joey> and like i'm like put putting more </joey>
<joey> attention </joey>
<joey> getting smarter about it yeah and fans </joey>
<joey> are getting smarter about this as well </joey>
<joey> as they really should be </joey>
<joey> um and it's the responsibility you hold </joey>
<joey> as a youtuber </joey>
<joey> and sometimes you just don't want to </joey>
<joey> worry about that you just want to meet </joey>
<garnt> someone where you don't want to have to </garnt>
<garnt> worry about this power imbalance because </garnt>
<garnt> you you are you know we're all just </garnt>
<garnt> people as well we're all just people and </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes we just want to </garnt>
<garnt> switch off this part of our lives and </garnt>
<garnt> just be a normal [ __ ] person like </garnt>
<connor> anyone else </connor>
<connor> um yeah i don't want someone who's </connor>
<connor> watches my videos and has an expectation </connor>
<connor> of me in general that i can from that is </connor>
<joey> portrayed through right </joey>
<garnt> right it's funny because most of the </garnt>
<garnt> friends i've made </garnt>
<garnt> who started off as fans like as we </garnt>
<garnt> became </garnt>
<garnt> friends they just started watching less </garnt>
<garnt> and less of my stuff and because that's </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> that's that in a lot of the ways that </garnt>
<garnt> made me more comfortable or they we </garnt>
<garnt> stopped talking about it because </garnt>
<garnt> they were just mates and we would talk </garnt>
<garnt> like mates and talk about </garnt>
<garnt> whatever else apart from my job as i'm </garnt>
<joey> sure that </joey>
<joey> i kind of feel that works in the same </joey>
<connor> way with like friends between two </connor>
<connor> youtubers right </connor>
<connor> yeah i definitely like watch like less </connor>
<garnt> of like my </garnt>
<garnt> youtuber friends videos after we just </garnt>
<joey> kind of went </joey>
<garnt> past that point just became friends no </garnt>
<garnt> you you keep up with it just just to see </garnt>
<joey> what your mates are doing yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but you're not like damn bro that last </joey>
<joey> video [ __ ] banger bro like i would </joey>
<garnt> have done this differently </garnt>
<joey> yeah like i showed i like showing sports </joey>
<joey> my mates you know yeah </joey>
<joey> it's different from being like yo i'm a </joey>
<garnt> huge fan of what you did </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yes [ __ ] banger right there yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's </connor>
<connor> man life's hard if you're you should </connor>
<connor> if you want to just be safe don't [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> your face rule number one </joey>
<connor> working good for me yeah yeah oh my god </connor>
<joey> uh this is my stock image can you </joey>
<joey> explain </joey>
<joey> why you chose this one okay so there is </joey>
<garnt> a labrador </garnt>
<garnt> with a gun holding her i just thought </garnt>
<connor> this one was fun you know </connor>
<joey> okay sure i don't know it's kind of fun </joey>
<garnt> this is what happens when you </garnt>
<garnt> reach like the end of your project and </garnt>
<connor> you just like i'll just throw whatever </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i put up oh we're about halfway </garnt>
<garnt> we're about halfway okay okay the next </garnt>
<garnt> one start getting a bit more obviously </garnt>
<garnt> okay uh you've been hit on the youtube </garnt>
<garnt> comment section of course </garnt>
<garnt> yeah of course yeah take me on a date </garnt>
<connor> next time i visit japan </connor>
<garnt> that happens yeah that happens a few of </garnt>
<garnt> those comments it's like </garnt>
<connor> uh no how about how about you pay for my </connor>
<garnt> date yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i wonder if anyone is ever in the </garnt>
<garnt> history of youtube probably has </garnt>
<garnt> would have taken a comment like that </garnt>
<garnt> seriously and i mean they tried to </garnt>
<joey> pursue it </joey>
<joey> i mean i mean maybe if you like you're </joey>
<connor> if you're a smaller youtuber maybe yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean i i did something similar along </connor>
<garnt> with like email someone emailed me </garnt>
<garnt> asking me to go on a date </garnt>
<garnt> but there's a </garnt>
<joey> um anyone can write a youtube call </joey>
<connor> they're live and then obviously you know </connor>
<connor> people ask you on dates on live streams </connor>
<connor> all the time you're streaming </connor>
<connor> yeah i get comments sometimes being like </connor>
<connor> oh we're on a date and we go in japan or </connor>
<connor> people people subtly ask questions that </connor>
<connor> are like </connor>
<connor> i think that they think they're being </connor>
<connor> subtle right but it's very obvious what </connor>
<joey> they're asking </joey>
<joey> like for example one very big giveaway </joey>
<connor> as to what some people are asking um are </connor>
<connor> like hey </connor>
<connor> uh would you ever do like long distance </connor>
<connor> relationships by the way just uh </connor>
<connor> and like some people might genuinely be </connor>
<connor> curious right but there's like a way </connor>
<garnt> that certain people ask it that is like </garnt>
<joey> uh no no you know it kind of gives you </joey>
<joey> that vibe of like </joey>
<joey> you're asking this for a purpose yeah </joey>
<joey> and also </joey>
<joey> i get donations sometimes which i think </joey>
<joey> that's another one actually </joey>
<garnt> but um where people will be like oh um </garnt>
<garnt> just like wondering like what kind of </garnt>
<garnt> age age group do you go for </garnt>
<garnt> uh if it isn't obvious by now uh milfs </garnt>
<connor> so you know you know if you're if you're </connor>
<connor> around my age lonely housewives </connor>
<garnt> the walls for the next stream is your </garnt>
<connor> husband just not cutting it i don't want </connor>
<connor> to know who he is but </connor>
<connor> i'm kidding yeah i mean yeah stuff like </connor>
<connor> that what else do i get there's ones as </connor>
<connor> well you know what i get asked a fair </connor>
<connor> amount which </connor>
<connor> is like the least subtle which is like </connor>
<connor> would you ever date someone who like </connor>
<connor> doesn't do youtube and i'm like would </connor>
<connor> you think i exclusively date psychopaths </connor>
<connor> like whatever you think no i only </connor>
<joey> exclusively date youtubers that's weird </joey>
<connor> i don't have at least ten thousands you </connor>
<connor> guys date youtubers but i couldn't </connor>
<joey> imagine dating a youtuber i mean i </joey>
<joey> started dating her when she had like </joey>
<joey> less than a thousand subs so it's a </joey>
<garnt> little bit different i mean i convinced </garnt>
<garnt> my girl to become a youtuber yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah so you brought them into the play </connor>
<garnt> yeah we brought them in yeah i wouldn't </garnt>
<joey> want my significant other to be a </joey>
<joey> youtuber why </joey>
<joey> i don't know i don't want to [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> deal with another me that's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> awful </joey>
<connor> and like my schedule is such a mess </connor>
<connor> already i wouldn't like a relationship </connor>
<connor> to me like that would be such a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> mess if both of us had similar schedules </connor>
<joey> like that i mean i don't blame you </joey>
<joey> there's lots of people who are like that </joey>
<garnt> i mean </garnt>
<garnt> that's just me i mean that's just what i </garnt>
<joey> want yeah i feel like that's just how </joey>
<joey> our relationships ended up </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah true true it's just a standard </garnt>
<connor> word schedule and like this </connor>
<connor> stock image which is uh </connor>
<joey> again it doesn't really have anything to </joey>
<joey> do with the point but it's a funny story </joey>
<connor> i just wanted to put a stock integer in </connor>
<joey> there yeah this one uh donations again </joey>
<garnt> um this is the charitable i'm pretty </garnt>
<garnt> sure these are called simps right yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah these are called uh yeah yeah you </connor>
<joey> can't say that anymore oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> off twitter no i don't call them prime </garnt>
<joey> members </joey>
<joey> tier three subs are you a prime member </joey>
<joey> well we're going on a date soon </joey>
<connor> uh yeah obviously you get that a lot </connor>
<connor> actually instagram </connor>
<connor> message requests get that a lot yeah you </connor>
<garnt> actually check them </garnt>
<connor> no i don't i know every now and then </connor>
<connor> just because i used to i used to </connor>
<garnt> yeah i used to as well and then i </garnt>
<garnt> realized that these are useless and like </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah stop checking it you would </connor>
<connor> people just it's like throwing a coin </connor>
<connor> down a while hoping for to grow it into </connor>
<connor> a tree </connor>
<joey> right it's like it's not gonna happen um </joey>
<joey> but yeah this is the stock image to go </joey>
<joey> along with it </joey>
<joey> i don't really know what is happening </joey>
<joey> they're on a carb on it yeah </joey>
<joey> and definitely having sex i'm not really </joey>
<joey> sure it's going no idea what's going on </joey>
<joey> there </joey>
<joey> yeah so that's that seems instagram </joey>
<joey> messages completely useless don't do it </joey>
<connor> it's not gonna work </connor>
<connor> um unless you have a [ __ ] ton of </connor>
<connor> followers i think it pops up and the </connor>
<connor> instagram tells you </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah someone begs me there's </joey>
<joey> like some kind of threshold </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's like having that blue tick </garnt>
<joey> mark on </joey>
<connor> twitter already mentioned this one but </connor>
<joey> uh just just </joey>
<joey> uh tinder yeah i mean </joey>
<garnt> wait is that the is that the same girl </garnt>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<garnt> in front of the burning house it does </garnt>
<garnt> look like it looks like her doesn't it </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah it kind of does yeah could be it </garnt>
<garnt> could maybe she found a </garnt>
<garnt> nice career in stock images afterwards </garnt>
<connor> that who knows </connor>
<connor> uh also actually believe it or not i've </connor>
<joey> been here on fiverr but </joey>
<joey> of course you have no joke no of course </joey>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<connor> why am i not surprised </connor>
<connor> i've got a great deal for you let me </connor>
<connor> give you a custom offer on fiverr </connor>
<connor> all right so yeah actually funny enough </connor>
<connor> they already they're a really good sport </connor>
<connor> about it though but they were basically </connor>
<connor> just kind of like </connor>
<connor> um i think i had hired them for one of </connor>
<garnt> the videos i think they were an artist </garnt>
<garnt> what what were they uh what were they </garnt>
<connor> trying to buy from you </connor>
<connor> no no so i hired them yeah and then when </connor>
<connor> the video came </connor>
<connor> out they were like oh thanks for </connor>
<connor> including me in the video bye i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> if you like want to ever like just call </connor>
<garnt> or hang out </garnt>
<garnt> here's my discord and i'm like oh okay </garnt>
<joey> all right okay </joey>
<connor> this man's an absolute chick magnet no </connor>
<connor> no this is what i'm saying right when </connor>
<connor> when you have you know you get how many </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] views we get a month on our own </connor>
<connor> chat like </connor>
<connor> eight nine million views a month right </connor>
<connor> all it takes is one person to think i'm </connor>
<connor> attractive </connor>
<connor> why i don't know to then go on and then </connor>
<connor> do something right i don't think </connor>
<connor> i'm inherently more attractive than </connor>
<joey> anyone or most people yeah but the thing </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<connor> that like you should have a platform </connor>
<joey> like right but the thing is that like </joey>
<joey> i've never experienced i don't think </joey>
<joey> gonzo experienced that </joey>
<garnt> really well not not to this but then i </garnt>
<connor> also i i </connor>
<connor> also i also but also like i feel like </connor>
<connor> your content </connor>
<connor> yeah i do videos about like dating and </connor>
<garnt> stuff yeah yeah i mean i mean like </garnt>
<joey> it doesn't surprise me because you do </joey>
<joey> more appeal more to that kind of thing </joey>
<garnt> and any any anyone who </garnt>
<garnt> like has because a lot of your content </garnt>
<connor> base started off with literal fan </connor>
<connor> interaction </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah for me i did i literally </connor>
<connor> didn't start </connor>
<garnt> like even for most of my videos i don't </garnt>
<garnt> show my face on like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> whereas we don't give a [ __ ] about us </garnt>
<garnt> my whole youtube like career in the show </garnt>
<connor> which built off interaction and i'm very </connor>
<garnt> grateful right which is why like it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't surprise me why some of the </garnt>
<garnt> weirdest fan interactions have </garnt>
<garnt> come from come from you i guess so yeah </garnt>
<connor> that makes sense if you give avenues for </connor>
<connor> people to talk to you they'll find a way </connor>
<connor> to hit on you that's how it works </connor>
<connor> and this is the stock image oh my god </connor>
<connor> what is that that was me at the end of </connor>
<joey> the figurine like </joey>
<joey> true true truth that's what it felt like </joey>

<connor> this wasn't so much uh odd this wasn't </connor>
<connor> being hit on but this is just a funny </connor>
<connor> story i wanted to tell </connor>
<connor> you so uh one time uh there was uh i was </connor>
<connor> at a convention </connor>
<connor> and i actually had this guy on facebook </connor>
<connor> still so it was really nice but it was </connor>
<connor> just it was very strange </connor>
<connor> and things get added on and adding on </connor>
<joey> where i went to it and they were like </joey>
<joey> okay so you when you go to convention as </joey>
<joey> a guest </joey>
<joey> you typically if it's like a big </joey>
<joey> convention you'll get like a handler </joey>
<joey> like it's like an assistant yeah </joey>
<joey> basically someone who makes sure that </joey>
<joey> you turn up to your appointments on time </joey>
<connor> and also if you need anything or like </connor>
<connor> you say you're signing things </connor>
<connor> and you you know you run out of sharpies </connor>
<connor> like give me a shop real quick </connor>
<connor> uh they'll do stuff like that and um uh </connor>
<connor> the guy i had he was like oh yeah my </connor>
<connor> daughter's a big fan </connor>
<connor> i'm like oh cool cool that's that's </connor>
<connor> awesome would you mind like saying hi to </connor>
<connor> her and i'm like yeah of course of </connor>
<connor> course like i'll hang out with them yeah </connor>
<joey> and then he was really nice and he </joey>
<joey> helped me out a lot he always got me </joey>
<joey> whatever i needed </joey>
<joey> and then uh he was like yeah do you want </joey>
<joey> to like come for like a </joey>
<joey> family dinner with me and my family </joey>
<joey> would say oh okay </joey>
<joey> uh i mean i i felt like i had to say yes </joey>
<joey> but like i was like oh sure i mean of </joey>
<joey> course like i don't mind i mean this </joey>
<joey> guy's helping you out right yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i mean i literally had </joey>
<joey> nothing better than you i was like yeah </joey>

<garnt> yeah it was like it was like being in </garnt>
<garnt> the middle of a half a dozen what's that </garnt>
<garnt> movie called like does it </garnt>
<garnt> double does what the [ __ ] is that i i </garnt>
<garnt> know what you're talking about </garnt>
<garnt> i was like by the dozen or something </garnt>
<garnt> something like that yeah but it was </garnt>
<connor> really cool because i i think i think he </connor>
<connor> was like a foster parent or something </connor>
<connor> and it was really cool the story was </connor>
<connor> really unique </connor>
<connor> not being hit on by the way quite the </connor>
<garnt> opposite just thought it was a cool </garnt>
<garnt> story to tell </garnt>
<garnt> so it was really odd that i got like </garnt>
<connor> roped into this and i was like what is </connor>
<connor> happening </connor>
<connor> why is there 12 kids i thought all i can </connor>
<joey> envision is the </joey>
<connor> scene from annie where they're they're </connor>
<garnt> all like eating on the real </garnt>
<connor> table you're just in the middle like </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm in the middle of it </joey>
<joey> i felt bad because the dad was trying to </joey>
<garnt> talk to me but obviously all the kids </garnt>
<garnt> were like yeah it's a youtuber they </garnt>
<garnt> wanted my attention </garnt>
<garnt> they kept asking me questions and they'd </garnt>
<joey> be like do you pay taxes or something </joey>
<joey> like that </joey>
<joey> are you avoiding taxes are you the irs </joey>
<connor> yeah it was it was just pretty cool </connor>

<connor> know why this was a stock image but </connor>
<garnt> getty why do you have in what sometimes </garnt>
<connor> you look at stock images and you think </connor>
<garnt> in what context </garnt>
<joey> would someone want to use this something </joey>
<joey> what was the direction they had when </joey>
<garnt> someone said honestly honestly i i do </garnt>
<garnt> think there is a like small market </garnt>
<garnt> i'm a small market of stock image </garnt>
<garnt> photographers that are like i'm hoping </garnt>
<joey> this is going to become a meme </joey>
<joey> i'm i'm betting that this is i'm going </joey>
<joey> to take some meme photos and hope that </joey>
<joey> this is </joey>
<joey> this is like they're all like racing to </joey>
<joey> be the next meme right yeah </joey>
<garnt> to become the next jealous girlfriend </garnt>
<garnt> meme guy like that </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is definitely giving me </garnt>
<garnt> that energy right now for sure </garnt>
<joey> all right this is the the unexpected if </joey>
<garnt> you will let me show you the stock image </garnt>
<joey> first of all what a good stocking </joey>

<connor> very serious right and she was very </connor>
<garnt> disappointed that we didn't have that </garnt>

<connor> listen the problem with the whole like </connor>
<connor> milf dynamic in real life is there a lot </connor>
<connor> of hurdles that make it </connor>
<connor> very uncomfortable and very awkward </connor>
<garnt> right i would feel so sorry for the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] daughter imagine being a fan i </connor>
<connor> felt sorry for the daughter imagine </connor>
<connor> being a fan of a youtuber </connor>
<garnt> and then they become your dad but let's </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<connor> let's just think about that for a second </connor>

<connor> making </connor>
<garnt> he was my favorite youtuber but now he's </garnt>
<garnt> my dad </garnt>

<connor> mom just gets carried away sometimes </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> i'm like yeah your mum's on like the </connor>
<connor> prowl what's going on </connor>

<connor> to be like scouting out the prey with </connor>
<garnt> each other you know what i mean mom's </garnt>

<garnt> wing woman </garnt>
<connor> it's like it's like love triangles you </connor>
<connor> know in a porno or a hentai yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> very attractive and </garnt>
<joey> but you realize in real life [ __ ] it's a </joey>
<joey> nightmare yeah it's messy as far as you </joey>
<joey> have anything like that never ends well </joey>
<joey> that was definitely unexpected that's </joey>
<joey> what that was that was the unexpected </joey>
<joey> yeah uh </joey>
<connor> i actually got hit on overwatch one time </connor>
<connor> oh yeah that was fun also </connor>
<connor> oh someone recognized who i was and then </connor>
<connor> added i added them i started playing </connor>
<connor> with them </connor>
<connor> and just casually started inquiring you </connor>
<connor> know about my love life and stuff and </connor>
<joey> that's normal well they're like </joey>
<joey> role-playing </joey>
<joey> or anything like this like what like </joey>
<connor> which part of this i wish part of your </connor>
<connor> career was the sin which part of the </connor>
<connor> career </connor>
<connor> when did overwatch come out it was like </connor>
<connor> literally like three or four months into </connor>
<connor> overwatch being released oh okay okay </connor>
<joey> that was a while ago then i was like </joey>
<joey> four or five years yikes </joey>
<connor> i'm old whenever i watch came out this </connor>
<joey> happened um </joey>
<connor> and yeah i i remember just being a bit </connor>
<joey> awkward because they kept asking like </joey>
<joey> when someone normally inquires about </joey>
<joey> your love life </joey>
<connor> a bit of a comfortable amount you don't </connor>
<connor> really know them which is </connor>
<connor> fine i mean you can ask me about that </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty open about it i don't really </connor>
<connor> want talking about it but then when you </connor>
<connor> proceed to like ask me like </connor>
<connor> the next step you live in like you live </connor>
<connor> in like </connor>
<connor> norway i don't know it's kind of far i </connor>
<connor> don't really know what's in norway </connor>
<connor> there's no benefits to getting married </connor>
<connor> someone in norway you know yeah i'm </connor>
<connor> joking i'm joking </connor>
<garnt> uh yeah and then this is uh yeah this is </garnt>
<garnt> it wow </garnt>
<joey> this is almost what it was like at the </joey>
<connor> urinal for me </connor>
<connor> so when we when we see each other the </connor>
<connor> urinal uh or you know </connor>
<garnt> what are you saying urinal urinal </garnt>
<joey> is that what americans say that's why </joey>
<connor> that's what the british say right no we </connor>
<joey> say </joey>
<connor> uranus yeah i thought the british say </connor>
<connor> urinal no americans say urinal </connor>
<joey> yeah i guess i've never heard someone </joey>
<garnt> say urinal before </garnt>
<joey> i said you're right i've only yeah i've </joey>
<joey> only heard british people say you know </joey>
<connor> what i </connor>
<connor> it gets i get confused on what words i'm </connor>
<garnt> saying i'm british and american because </garnt>
<garnt> people constantly correct me yeah i know </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not wrong </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but they say why does he say it </garnt>
<garnt> like that and then i end up </garnt>
<connor> unconsciously changing it </connor>
<connor> so i go back to the uk and all my </connor>
<connor> everyone mocks me for sounding america </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't even know </garnt>
<garnt> what like sometimes i say a word and i </garnt>
<garnt> don't even know if that's said in a </garnt>
<joey> british way or an american yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah but that's it that's the powerful </connor>
<connor> presentation boom done </connor>

<connor> presentation thank you thanks thank you </connor>
<garnt> for your ted talk </garnt>
<connor> sir thanks guys thank you why aren't you </connor>
<garnt> clapping </garnt>
<garnt> clap ladder mail i couldn't hear you </garnt>
<joey> what lessons did we learn um </joey>
<joey> connors fans are [ __ ] weird if you </joey>
<garnt> are </garnt>
<garnt> a woman above the age of 35 yeah is that </garnt>
<connor> what you think my demo is yeah i don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] know </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't know i just like all of </garnt>
<joey> them you aren't correct </joey>
<joey> older than you like i i okay listen </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> you can see well how are you right now </joey>
<joey> 24 i'm 24 right okay </joey>
<garnt> so like 20 24 24 and a half year olds </garnt>
<garnt> are gonna be like </garnt>
<garnt> some some people age like wine man they </garnt>
<connor> age better man they </connor>
<connor> they they get more attractive why are </connor>
<garnt> you laughing man it's true though </garnt>
<connor> it's true like you see pictures of like </connor>
<garnt> uh you see them when they're younger </garnt>
<connor> like celebrities you see them when </connor>
<connor> they're older you're like </connor>
<connor> holy [ __ ] he's 50 but he's hotter than </connor>
<connor> he ever was yeah right i agree </connor>
<connor> you know honestly to me it's like as </connor>
<connor> long as the mindset is there that you're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you know you're in my world and you're </connor>
<connor> on the same wavelength of thinking and </connor>
<connor> you treat life the same way i don't give </connor>
<garnt> a [ __ ] about your age </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i feel like some people use </garnt>
<connor> your heart i just don't want you to be </connor>
<garnt> younger than me </garnt>
<garnt> because i i feel like some people just </garnt>
<garnt> hit a certain age and then they just </garnt>
<garnt> stop giving a [ __ ] about how they look </garnt>
<garnt> and taking care of themselves right </garnt>
<garnt> or alternatively they just think they </garnt>
<garnt> can get away with the lifestyle they had </garnt>
<garnt> in their 20s </garnt>
<garnt> and just bring that to like their the </garnt>
<garnt> their 50s </garnt>
<garnt> like 30s 40s and 50s because you know i </garnt>
<garnt> think being 30 now </garnt>
<garnt> as the only 30 year olds i i've heard </garnt>
<garnt> that being 30 is just basically being 20 </garnt>
<connor> with one debuff </connor>
<connor> um that's [ __ ] blood yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah and uh yeah i mean i feel like some </garnt>
<garnt> people do age like [ __ ] fine wine and </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of asians just don't age at all i </garnt>
<garnt> guess </garnt>
<garnt> until they've reached like this cap and </garnt>
<garnt> then they just start aging and then </garnt>
<joey> they're like oh oh we have to age </joey>
<garnt> oh okay okay honestly um also going back </garnt>
<connor> to the </connor>
<connor> naming after my baby it wasn't an insult </connor>
<connor> by the way trying to make sure that's </connor>
<connor> clear i don't think that's like a bad </connor>
<connor> thing </connor>
<connor> just thought it was very intense just i </connor>
<joey> mean it's a very light a lot i mean i've </joey>
<joey> never heard any other story like that </joey>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> like it's so overwhelming that you're </connor>
<connor> like which emotion do i take away </connor>
<garnt> like i put myself in your shoes and the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest like </garnt>
<garnt> if if i'm like trying to be like pov you </garnt>
<connor> are connor holding a baby that's named </connor>
<connor> duffy i'm like </connor>
<connor> how do i even pump music </connor>
<garnt> how do i even manage what to say right </garnt>
<connor> now i wouldn't even know how to react </connor>
<connor> it's like a mixture of like overwhelming </connor>
<joey> flattery </joey>
<joey> overwhelming like what the [ __ ] yeah are </joey>
<joey> you sure about this </joey>
<joey> are you sure about that yeah yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like is this a mistake are you going to </joey>
<connor> regret this because </connor>
<connor> i'm not all that right yeah um what else </connor>
<connor> we take away from the powerful </connor>
<joey> presentation boys </joey>
<joey> what did you learn you get hit on a lot </joey>
<joey> no no no it's actually you know we get </joey>
<joey> hit on </joey>
<connor> so my audience has gone from as we know </connor>
<connor> 93 percent </connor>
<connor> it's uh recently it went to like like 60 </connor>
<joey> mail um is my jojo i think also </joey>
<joey> there was a good amount of time where i </joey>
<connor> think because of my thumbnails because </connor>
<connor> the tops i was covering youtube just </connor>
<connor> didn't recommend me to guys </connor>
<connor> yeah and now it suddenly started being </connor>
<garnt> like oh wait guys can watch this guy too </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i started getting a massive influx </garnt>
<garnt> of guy viewers that i never had before </garnt>
<garnt> right right um and i stopped doing as </garnt>
<garnt> much yowie stuff and slowed down on that </garnt>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's still like nearly it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it depends on the month it's like </garnt>
<connor> depending on the videos i make yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> about 50 50 now which is nice and it's </garnt>
<garnt> slowed down a lot </garnt>
<garnt> uh but there's ups and down sides right </garnt>
<garnt> like it was mainly like i i know that i </garnt>
<garnt> spoke about like mainly like it was like </garnt>
<garnt> girls coming up to me but </garnt>
<garnt> dude guys hit on me just as much uh </garnt>
<garnt> really yeah yeah i've had that which is </garnt>
<garnt> flattering because there was like one </garnt>
<garnt> dude who's in </garnt>
<garnt> my instagram message request matt was </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] ripped as [ __ ] and i was like </garnt>
<connor> wow </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm very flattered this man had like </connor>
<connor> the body of a greek statue and this man </connor>
<connor> thought i was worthy of being hit on i </connor>
<connor> was very i was very fast </connor>
<connor> oh man jealous yeah right i was like </connor>
<connor> damn </connor>
<connor> but uh yeah i mean it's it's it's it's </connor>
<connor> whatever it's </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] youtube yeah i mean what what i </garnt>
<garnt> can take about this is that if there is </garnt>
<garnt> going to be an avenue not necessarily to </garnt>
<garnt> be hit on but </garnt>
<garnt> for someone to get in contact with </garnt>
<garnt> contact with you because half </garnt>
<garnt> i would say half of these were just you </garnt>
<garnt> know the fan interactions or people </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get in contact with you if </garnt>
<garnt> there's an avenue </garnt>
<garnt> people are going to find a way and i've </garnt>
<garnt> definitely felt that as a youtuber as </garnt>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean you can hit on me it's very </connor>
<connor> flattering i don't care you don't have </connor>
<joey> to stop doing it just don't be creepy </joey>
<joey> just do it in a sophisticated way yeah </joey>
<connor> man you do it slick i'll be like thank </connor>
<connor> you for the ego boost i'm going to go </connor>
<connor> away feeling great though yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah who doesn't dude when you get hit </garnt>
<garnt> on you're like damn i'm a tan </garnt>
<garnt> and then you go back to your hotel room </garnt>
<connor> in a whole bag of flaming hot cheetos </connor>
<garnt> and realize you're truly a five </garnt>
<garnt> and also the on the opposite end any </garnt>
<garnt> uh taking this advice for any like young </garnt>
<garnt> budding youtubers out there </garnt>
<garnt> like tread carefully with fans hitting </garnt>
<joey> on you don't [ __ ] your fans man </joey>
<joey> it never works out listen you know it </joey>
<joey> might work out one tenth of the time but </joey>
<connor> there's the problem is is that but are </connor>
<joey> you willing to take the risk yeah </joey>
<garnt> i mean you have to be really careful and </garnt>
<garnt> i think the biggest problem </garnt>
<garnt> is that whenever whenever you're like a </garnt>
<garnt> youtuber starting out especially when </garnt>
<garnt> you're a small youtuber i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> this is more a message to small </garnt>
<garnt> youtubers </garnt>
<garnt> um who don't have the experience or </garnt>
<garnt> don't think they're gonna get big </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't [ __ ] know if you're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna get big </garnt>
<garnt> right but you should treat you should </garnt>
<garnt> treat the fans or you should treat your </garnt>
<garnt> audience </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how big you are exactly the </garnt>
<connor> same and it's it's stay grounded yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean i'm sure there's cringy messages </connor>
<connor> out there of me hitting on someone at 19 </connor>
<connor> that would just embarrass me but it's </connor>
<joey> again i'm 19 you know just [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> but like you're you're like </joey>
<connor> it wasn't like hit on fans of me like </connor>
<joey> shimmy nudes you know what i mean it's </joey>
<connor> just like </connor>
<joey> just me being an average 19 year old </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly like when you're younger </joey>
<joey> like you don't you don't really have </joey>
<joey> like the senses to know what exactly is </joey>
<joey> cringe you're not </joey>
<garnt> also when you're younger you're just </garnt>
<joey> hoarding as [ __ ] yeah exactly and </joey>
<joey> and you think you can get away with you </joey>
<garnt> know being horny </garnt>
<garnt> and you grow up and you realize man i </garnt>
<connor> did a lot of stupid [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah young dumb and full of calm that's </joey>
<connor> as they say </connor>
<connor> lovely joey words to live by yeah but i </connor>
<connor> mean it's </connor>
<connor> it's like because there's some people </connor>
<connor> you know there's a lot of youtubers </connor>
<connor> out there very very openly happy to </connor>
<connor> admit that they date fans they're like </connor>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> you know the normal famous celebrities </connor>
<connor> get to [ __ ] their fans and no one bets </connor>
<connor> an eye </connor>
<joey> and it's like well i mean yeah that </joey>
<joey> double standard is like </joey>
<connor> this is the way i interpret it and why </connor>
<connor> that's the case that normal celebrities </connor>
<connor> they don't bank on the fact of </connor>
<connor> relatability they don't bank on the fact </connor>
<joey> of being </joey>
<joey> they're like people above the club well </joey>
<connor> their whole like every like pop star </connor>
<connor> is supposed to be like a character like </connor>
<connor> an absurd kind of </connor>
<connor> not real person yeah right they never </connor>
<connor> pretend to be your friend </connor>
<connor> they never like pretend to give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> about you yeah and if you have sex with </connor>
<connor> them they'll probably don't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> about it right maybe </connor>
<connor> maybe right it's just a joke but i mean </connor>
<garnt> if you do it with an influencer right or </garnt>
<garnt> crossword or a youtuber right i i hate </garnt>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> i guess it's almost kind of a betrayal </garnt>
<garnt> of what you built up which is like </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the people who watch us right i </garnt>
<joey> guess i don't know if you guys know like </joey>
<joey> you guys feel this way like there's a </joey>
<joey> you form like a bit of a bond right </joey>
<joey> where you like you respect the creator </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> yeah you look up to them and you enjoy </joey>
<joey> their stuff and you feel a lot closer to </joey>
<joey> a youtuber than you would say </joey>
<joey> yeah because and so it's that that's </joey>
<joey> being taken advantage right it's because </joey>
<connor> most youtubers are more </connor>
<connor> i guess grounded right you feel more </connor>
<connor> real so when you do watch them you're </connor>
<joey> just like oh </joey>
<joey> this is an actual person i'm watching </joey>
<garnt> yeah like like i would say </garnt>
<garnt> to be like the right way to go about it </garnt>
<garnt> is if you're if you're going to get </garnt>
<garnt> involved with your fans </garnt>
<joey> that you just one of the biggest things </joey>
<joey> is you don't do it straight away </joey>
<joey> like you need to treat as a friend start </joey>
<joey> as a friend treat them like a human </joey>
<garnt> being </garnt>
<garnt> get the get to know each other first </garnt>
<connor> like any normal [ __ ] relationship </connor>
<connor> you need to like immediately like break </connor>
<connor> down or disassemble any like power </connor>
<connor> dynamic in play </connor>
<garnt> i was like and and like you put yourself </garnt>
<garnt> on equal footing yeah and with stuff </garnt>
<garnt> like one night stands or something </garnt>
<garnt> that's </garnt>
<garnt> that gets so messy and there's no way to </garnt>
<garnt> like differentiate </garnt>
<garnt> is there a power dynamic there is is is </garnt>
<garnt> the person is the person gonna do this </garnt>
<garnt> and then you know regret it afterwards </garnt>
<garnt> and just </garnt>
<garnt> it it's too messy to be able to justify </garnt>
<garnt> i feel um and if there is a right way to </garnt>
<garnt> go about it and </garnt>
<connor> there's nothing about it but like most </connor>
<connor> of the time it's like you know </connor>
<connor> it's like do you want to defuse a bomb </connor>
<connor> like you if you know how to </connor>
<joey> yeah you want to do that yeah go ahead </joey>
<connor> there's a right way to do it but it's </connor>
<connor> not worth it right yeah but like is it </connor>
<joey> worth is it like </joey>
<connor> is it worth the risk literally blowing </connor>
<connor> yourself up in terms of career like is </connor>
<connor> it worth it or you could just </connor>
<connor> i don't know be do what everyone else </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] does i don't know well </garnt>
<garnt> date normally and i feel like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> smaller youtubers don't </garnt>
<garnt> like they they don't really think about </garnt>
<garnt> this because they think i've got nothing </garnt>
<connor> to lose so i'm just going to do this </connor>
<garnt> right now while </garnt>
<joey> while i can because you grew up in a </joey>
<joey> culture where yeah you do see you know </joey>
<joey> celebrities and like groupies cats like </joey>
<joey> sleeping with </joey>
<joey> you know music artists and everything </joey>
<joey> like that you think man </joey>
<joey> that sounds like an awesome lifestyle i </joey>
<joey> kind of like that stuff so when they get </joey>
<joey> like a </joey>
<garnt> smidgen of that they think i gotta take </garnt>
<garnt> advantage of this </garnt>
<joey> while i still can rock and roll </joey>
<joey> lifestyle works if you're in that field </joey>
<joey> the rocker roll lifestyle is not the </joey>
<joey> youtuber lifestyle it's two completely </joey>
<joey> different things i find </joey>
<connor> yeah it's it's tough it's so tough and </connor>
<joey> it's like is it just like it's not even </joey>
<connor> worth </connor>
<garnt> like getting into yeah right because i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like to get involved in this is </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> you are literally navigating a minefield </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah 100 </connor>
<connor> it's like if you really want to do it </connor>
<connor> you can do it yeah but </connor>
<garnt> the reason why i think most youtubers </garnt>
<garnt> will say don't [ __ ] your fans is because </garnt>
<connor> it's just like it's so much it's so much </connor>
<connor> risk you're taking on for no reason </connor>
<connor> like it and and to me it's like do you </connor>
<connor> really want someone who wants to be with </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> for your videos is that like why is that </connor>
<joey> attractive like </joey>
<joey> they're looking at you only for the </joey>
<connor> right because to me it's a competitive </connor>
<garnt> mindset </garnt>
<garnt> to me that's like a massive turn off if </garnt>
<garnt> they're only with me </garnt>
<connor> because of my content then that's like </connor>
<connor> the same thing if you're only my friends </connor>
<connor> for my content then you i'm saying you </connor>
<connor> can't be my friend because that's that's </connor>
<connor> not how i would see a friend yeah </connor>
<garnt> the same way i that's how i wouldn't see </garnt>
<garnt> like a possible partner </garnt>
<joey> like that's like saying like also if i </joey>
<joey> change my content then you're suddenly </joey>
<connor> not my friend </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i there is no bigger turn on </connor>
<connor> right than meeting someone who just </connor>
<connor> likes you for you yeah like </connor>
<connor> what why why i'm sitting there i'm </connor>
<connor> thinking like how the [ __ ] am i supposed </connor>
<connor> to be into this </connor>
<connor> and then like get my dick hard when i'm </connor>
<joey> all i'm thinking about you're thinking </joey>
<joey> is like what's the next upload going to </joey>
<joey> be </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] that no i i want someone who </joey>
<joey> like speaks to me knows nothing about </joey>
<joey> youtube and it's like holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like this guy's [ __ ] cool i like him </joey>
<joey> yeah he's so nice you want people to see </joey>
<joey> you as connor not c dog </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah which obviously i made a bit </connor>
<connor> difficult for myself obviously but </connor>
<garnt> i can still go about it yeah of course </garnt>
<garnt> you know you don't want to be with a </garnt>
<garnt> girl </garnt>
<garnt> be in bed and be like yo if you enjoyed </garnt>
<garnt> that session hit the subscribe button </garnt>
<garnt> click the like button </garnt>
<joey> if we get to 5 000 likes i'll do round </joey>
<connor> two </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<garnt> i want a youtube video of someone trying </garnt>
<joey> to do that </joey>
<joey> oh my god yeah i feel like oh my god </joey>
<garnt> yeah there's </garnt>
<garnt> so many [ __ ] douche tubers out there </garnt>
<garnt> who do [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> i'm sure there's youtubers out there who </garnt>
<garnt> just admit every single [ __ ] day like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i [ __ ] my fans so well and like </garnt>
<joey> i mean screw them but if you want to </joey>
<joey> have like you know something if you want </joey>
<joey> to be respected by the community </joey>
<connor> yeah if you want to be seen as like a </connor>
<garnt> role model don't know what that is </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like douche tubers i feel </garnt>
<connor> just exist on a different plane of </connor>
<connor> existence where </connor>
<garnt> i don't know how they function or you </garnt>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> i i just i just want youtubers to have a </connor>
<connor> better rap right like </connor>
<connor> not all of us are [ __ ] psychopath </connor>
<connor> uh chasing you know </connor>
<connor> like yeah a lot of a lot of us are horny </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] and that's that's just </garnt>
<connor> the that's just human nature that is the </connor>
<garnt> only </garnt>
<joey> we are three horny guys but at least </joey>
<garnt> we're horny on main and uh </garnt>
<connor> we we keep to being horny on maine and </connor>
<connor> uh that's pretty much it yeah </connor>
<connor> pretty much man a part of me is part of </connor>
<connor> me as glad is that you i have like </connor>
<connor> youtube to keep me in chat almost </connor>
<connor> not that i would start doing awful [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> if i wasn't a youtuber but </connor>
<connor> the fact that there is this kind of like </connor>
<connor> obvious moral lines that </connor>
<connor> right that it's not like oh no man </connor>
<connor> should i do no no it's not they're like </connor>
<joey> these unspoken guidelines and rules to </joey>
<joey> like make sure you're not </joey>
<connor> right yeah it really makes me cautious </connor>
<connor> about how i come up to people and what i </connor>
<connor> say to people makes me way more </connor>
<connor> conscious about how i speak </connor>
<connor> in a way that i think is you know i the </connor>
<connor> way i speak </connor>
<connor> on live streams the way i speak you know </connor>
<connor> on the video is how i'll speak to </connor>
<connor> most people in my life and how yeah you </connor>
<connor> know and i like that </connor>
<connor> it's kind of taught me in a way to just </connor>
<connor> it sounds awful right but just give a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] about everything </connor>
<connor> and pay attention even if it is draining </connor>
<connor> at times it sounds awful i'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> you should taught me to be </connor>
<connor> not an [ __ ] like but like you know </connor>
<connor> how some things you take for granted </connor>
<connor> yeah that you when you're you know when </connor>
<connor> you're an individual who isn't like uh </connor>
<garnt> open person yeah i mean for me it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> not it didn't teach me to </garnt>
<garnt> you know give a [ __ ] about everything </garnt>
<connor> but it did teach me to really </connor>
<garnt> question my own values yeah and </garnt>
<connor> and really justify if is is this value i </connor>
<garnt> hold right </garnt>
<garnt> right as opposed to like i just think </garnt>
<connor> about </connor>
<connor> i just think it this way because i was i </connor>
<connor> grew up in that kind of environment </connor>
<connor> and it really made me self-reflect and i </connor>
<garnt> feel like that that is like </garnt>
<garnt> a healthy part of youtube that has has i </garnt>
<garnt> think i've become </garnt>
<garnt> a better person because of youtube yeah </garnt>
<joey> like it's it's about that mentality of </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> okay if i wasn't doing youtube then do </joey>
<garnt> is the things that i do and the way that </garnt>
<garnt> i talk to people and what kind of stuff </garnt>
<garnt> would that be still considered </garnt>
<garnt> respectful to other people </garnt>
<connor> regardless of if i were if i had this </connor>
<connor> job or not like would i still be a good </connor>
<connor> person if i didn't have youtube </connor>
<connor> and if the answer is yes then i think </connor>
<connor> you're following it right if you're </connor>
<connor> worrying if the answer is no </connor>
<connor> yeah well i mean you know look at all </connor>
<joey> the douche tubers right apparently you </joey>
<joey> can get away with that [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> if you have a youtube channel i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know do they get away with that [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> though </joey>
<joey> like i mean i mean there's a reason why </joey>
<joey> they have an audience are they they are </joey>
<garnt> on borrowed time are they like a twit </garnt>
<garnt> longer waiting to happen </garnt>
<joey> because they're definitely like a limit </joey>
<garnt> like they're not going to be like </garnt>
<joey> at the point that they are for very long </joey>
<garnt> because i feel like a big </garnt>
<garnt> i mean this is getting to a really deep </garnt>
<garnt> topic now but a big problem with </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of these like apology videos and </garnt>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of this kind of culture that that </garnt>
<garnt> has been built up i understand where it </garnt>
<garnt> comes from where we we do need to keep </garnt>
<garnt> in </garnt>
<garnt> uh we do need to keep each other in </garnt>
<garnt> check and make sure that people aren't </garnt>
<garnt> abusing their power </garnt>
<garnt> but a part of it just makes me feel like </garnt>
<garnt> man people are just treating this like </garnt>
<garnt> one big reality tv show </garnt>
<connor> it's not keeping each other checked </connor>
<joey> we've just made it a modern coliseum </joey>
<connor> yeah we just we just gamified it </connor>
<joey> basically we've just you know </joey>
<connor> could we can't kill each other that's </connor>
<connor> the best thing we can do is [ __ ] get </connor>
<garnt> each other's throats </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which is which is why right now now </garnt>
<garnt> when i see an apology video or twit </garnt>
<garnt> longer </garnt>
<garnt> you know like a lot a lot of like as we </garnt>
<garnt> said we were taught to you know </garnt>
<garnt> have to give a [ __ ] about this thing but </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes i see this and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't have the energy to keep the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> to care about this this doesn't involve </garnt>
<garnt> me </garnt>
<garnt> you know sometimes it it it [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> sucks when i </garnt>
<garnt> when i hear about you know some some </garnt>
<garnt> person in the community or in some </garnt>
<garnt> community </garnt>
<garnt> that i'm not even involved with doing </garnt>
<garnt> like having like a five </garnt>
<garnt> five fifty page more like 50 page </garnt>
<garnt> dissertation breaking down every shitty </garnt>
<garnt> thing they've done </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like i'm sorry that this </garnt>
<garnt> happened but at the same time </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't have the energy to invest </garnt>
<garnt> myself into this </garnt>
<garnt> can someone literally give me a cliff </garnt>
<garnt> notes of what's going on and like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to be the guy to be like </garnt>
<garnt> can you tell me what to think </garnt>
<garnt> but there there reaches a point where </garnt>
<garnt> there is too much happening right now </garnt>
<connor> that's you can you can it's it's it's </connor>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<connor> sensory overload yeah yeah it's just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> at the end of the day all i'm seeing is </connor>
<connor> someone's getting [ __ ] paid leave </connor>
<connor> that's all i'm seeing yeah it's like i </connor>
<joey> have limited time i've limited energy </joey>
<connor> and i want to be able to use it on [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> i actually </joey>
<garnt> care about yeah yeah like i i would like </garnt>
<garnt> to care about </garnt>
<garnt> every big scandal every big thing that </garnt>
<garnt> gets you know brought up on twitter </garnt>
<garnt> and you know that's that logically </garnt>
<garnt> and if i think about it that's what i </garnt>
<garnt> want to value but </garnt>
<garnt> logistically you can't you can't you </garnt>
<garnt> can't care about this much [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> and i feel like a big problem right now </garnt>
<garnt> is that </garnt>
<garnt> this this entire environment just feels </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> big brother or this feels like a real </garnt>
<garnt> reality tv show where </garnt>
<garnt> people care but do they really care like </garnt>
<garnt> they get to a point where </garnt>
<garnt> this is really what i think does this </garnt>
<garnt> really involve me does this </garnt>
<garnt> you know am i doing something right to </garnt>
<garnt> society by getting involved with this </garnt>
<garnt> or am i just feeding the fumes and the </garnt>
<connor> fire and just making the environment </connor>
<connor> more toxic </connor>
<garnt> nothing's stopping if you don't care </garnt>
<garnt> that everyone hates you </garnt>
<connor> yeah and you're fine with that there's </connor>
<connor> literally nothing stopping you from </connor>
<connor> succeeding i mean there's people who </connor>
<joey> make a career off of being hated right </joey>
<garnt> so funny </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean it's one of the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> examples of course logan paul </garnt>
<garnt> and one of i i can't remember who said </garnt>
<garnt> this quote but </garnt>
<garnt> it was you know i think it was like </garnt>
<garnt> muhammad ali or </garnt>
<connor> a boxer where they say well they said </connor>
<connor> something like </connor>
<connor> if uh people will pay to like </connor>
<connor> what was it people will pay to watch you </connor>
<connor> to shut you up </connor>
<connor> yeah people will pay to watch you get </connor>
<connor> punched yeah watch get punched or watch </connor>
<connor> you or watch </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] something along man logan paul </connor>
<connor> has capitalized that </connor>
<connor> to the max i mean i i'll [ __ ] admit </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<garnt> you know i i got involved with whenever </garnt>
<garnt> logan paul gets and uh gets into a </garnt>
<garnt> boxing match </garnt>
<joey> of course i did i want to see logan paul </joey>
<garnt> get punched bunch yeah she's funny you </garnt>
<joey> know i mean </joey>
<joey> i don't really have anything personally </joey>
<garnt> against the guy obviously but no it's </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> fun seeing two usually smack each other </garnt>
<garnt> in the face this [ __ ] is funny as [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'd do that if the right target came up </garnt>
<connor> i'm like yo how much money did he make </connor>
<connor> put me in the ring y'all give me some </connor>
<connor> beef please </connor>
<connor> give me some beef to fight over </connor>
<connor> pay-per-view yeah like </connor>
<joey> yeah that's scary how it's evolved to </joey>
<garnt> that point isn't it it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it makes you wonder what the next step </garnt>
<garnt> is like we're going we're going back to </garnt>
<garnt> where we started where </garnt>
<garnt> you know when reality is this </garnt>
<garnt> entertaining who the [ __ ] needs tv </garnt>

<joey> time gone reality has always been more </joey>
