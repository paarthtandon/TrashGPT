<connor> yeah because you know we have we have a </connor>
<garnt> setup that works here and everyone's </garnt>
<connor> like why are you moving why are you </connor>
<garnt> moving you know but you got to mix it up </garnt>
<garnt> you know keep it fresh yeah also you'll </garnt>

<connor> after dark vlog because we have no </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] space in here i am glad that i </connor>
<connor> don't have to like i'm i dread whenever </connor>
<garnt> i'm the host because people don't know </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] obstacle course you have to </garnt>
<garnt> go around to get to this host [ __ ] i </garnt>
<joey> feel literally bad for every guest that </joey>
<joey> comes yeah yeah we do have to like </joey>
<joey> perform parkour together </joey>
<joey> a lot of tripping hazards and uh yeah </joey>
<joey> ladybird nearly uh tested the limits of </joey>
<garnt> ourselves yeah in multiple ways not just </garnt>
<garnt> the shelf behind you but all the wires </garnt>
<connor> and stuff that man was too large in </connor>
<garnt> charge for those wives yeah i can't </garnt>
<garnt> imagine how the guest feels having to </garnt>
<garnt> sit here and having like what if you </garnt>
<garnt> need to go to the toilet right because </garnt>
<garnt> because the reason okay the reason i </garnt>
<garnt> hate going on flights and sitting on the </garnt>
<garnt> window seat is i hate not being able to </garnt>
<joey> access the toilet under my own will oh i </joey>
<joey> did i i know now my limits of my own </joey>
<joey> bladder so now whenever i'm on a long </joey>
<joey> flight i'm like i'll seat give me a dial </joey>
<joey> seat immediately i don't have to look at </joey>
<joey> the view i've seen yeah i know what the </joey>
<garnt> outside of a plane looks like i know i </garnt>
<joey> know what sky looks like i don't need to </joey>
<garnt> look at sky i i know what a city looks </garnt>
<garnt> like from above i will sacrifice all </garnt>
<garnt> right hold up </garnt>
<garnt> okay this is gonna be our first topic </garnt>
<connor> for fun listen i </connor>
<connor> i am a firm window seat fan why why i'll </connor>
<connor> tell you why because right what's the </connor>
<connor> biggest downside of being in the isle </connor>
<garnt> gentleman what is it come on there's got </garnt>
<garnt> to be one downside because there is no </garnt>
<garnt> there [ __ ] that you don't you don't see </garnt>
<garnt> one there is one glaring gigantic </garnt>
<connor> annoying issue and that is [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> people in the window and middle seat </connor>
<connor> wanting to get out and and god forbid </connor>
<connor> they're [ __ ] clumsy as [ __ ] and </connor>
<connor> they're like </connor>
<joey> oh like [ __ ] falling over everything </joey>
<joey> and they've got like 10 [ __ ] that they </joey>
<joey> got on their lap they got like the whole </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] family buffet and [ __ ] like 10 </joey>
<joey> headphones portable charger it's like </joey>
<joey> for [ __ ] sake put it in your [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> bag they're trying to shimmy around like </connor>
<connor> get that [ __ ] away from me i want to go </connor>
<connor> in the window because i want to sleep </connor>
<joey> and i don't want to be disturbed i but </joey>
<joey> you're okay with disturbing disturbing </joey>
<garnt> yeah because </garnt>
<connor> that just shows like the difference in </connor>
<connor> mentality because i would rather i'm i'm </connor>
<garnt> fine with being disturbed i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to go to the toilet man i know </garnt>
<garnt> you need it </garnt>
<connor> it's moisture </connor>
<connor> fine with being disturbed </connor>
<connor> listen i don't okay i don't know if </connor>
<connor> everyone else sees it the same way as i </connor>
<connor> do because i know that i get annoyed by </connor>
<connor> minor things my house could burn down </connor>
<connor> and i'll be like well that's [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> that's really inconvenient that hasn't </joey>
<connor> it but if someone moves in the aisle </connor>
<joey> seat for [ __ ] sake no because for me </joey>
<garnt> there's like there's like a counter </garnt>
<garnt> right because i i i know how much i piss </garnt>
<joey> i mean i'm glad that i don't need to </joey>
<joey> worry when i how much i piss on trash </joey>
<joey> taste because i piss a lot on trash </joey>
<joey> taste yeah but in the confines of an </joey>
<connor> airplane you are stuck there and you ask </connor>
<connor> to go to the toilet once all right </connor>
<connor> that's reasonable right everyone has </connor>
<connor> everyone knows everyone needs to go to </connor>
<connor> the toilet yeah but twice okay that's </connor>
<garnt> that's that's kind of pushing it you </garnt>
<garnt> know what if i need to go three times </garnt>
<garnt> when everyone's sleeping what if what if </garnt>
<connor> that just happens oh you're more worried </connor>
<garnt> about pissing them off yeah i'm more </garnt>
<garnt> worried about this </garnt>
<garnt> picture you're only on the isle right </garnt>
<joey> what is the limit before you start to </joey>
<connor> get annoyed with how many times people </connor>
<joey> get up to go and pee </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't matter because no matter what </garnt>
<joey> i'm going to be pissing more yeah these </joey>
<garnt> two people combine for me for me for me </garnt>
<connor> i i never get pissed off because i'm </connor>
<garnt> like i get him see that's i i know the </garnt>
<connor> pain that's my i know the trouble you're </connor>
<connor> in i got your brother that's my </connor>
<garnt> mentality right the isle people the isle </garnt>
<garnt> chumps are used to being annoyed that's </garnt>
<garnt> my theory right so i don't really feel </garnt>
<garnt> bad about disturbing i'm [ __ ] zen on </garnt>
<garnt> the all you know </garnt>
<connor> the middle c just lose so yeah i mean </connor>
<garnt> they already knew that they already knew </garnt>
<garnt> they lost the middle c is just the </garnt>
<garnt> loser's seat no one ever wants to sit in </garnt>
<garnt> the middle see unless i think that </garnt>
<garnt> you're a [ __ ] psychopath if you </garnt>
<garnt> actually choose to sit in the middle see </garnt>
<connor> well this is like okay well i mean you </connor>
<connor> know in your the only time i don't give </connor>
<joey> a [ __ ] about middle c is if we're on </joey>
<joey> like an hour or two flight i'm like yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah that's fine literally i watch one </connor>
<joey> jason statham and i'm there right </joey>
<connor> but </connor>
<connor> i mean i do care on a 12-hour flight but </connor>
<joey> you've already lost at that point and </joey>
<joey> you should have pre-booked that's your </joey>
<joey> fault yeah exactly exactly but do you </joey>
<joey> ever do that gamble where you're like i </joey>
<joey> want the whole road to myself this plane </joey>
<garnt> looks just empty enough where i think i </garnt>
<garnt> can pull this off you're like i'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> book just the middle seat in a clean row </garnt>
<garnt> of three no i know no </garnt>
<garnt> that's the i like to live life on the </garnt>
<garnt> edge because then i know that </garnt>
<garnt> what what sick [ __ ] is gonna want to sit </garnt>
<connor> next to a a madman that would willingly </connor>
<connor> choose the ilc in a row of three that </connor>
<connor> should send dangerous that should like </connor>
<joey> be like a danger sign no because what i </joey>
<joey> do is that i i get the safe seat of just </joey>
<joey> an aisle seat because i know that no </joey>
<joey> matter what even if that aisle is full i </joey>
<joey> get the extra leg room i get immediate </joey>
<connor> access to the toilet i don't disturb </connor>
<joey> anybody and win like like but then the </joey>
<connor> moment i get on the plane and i see oh </connor>
<connor> not a lot of people waiting in this in </connor>
<joey> this waiting room right now right then </joey>
<joey> then that's when i go like </joey>
<joey> so uh how many how many aisles are open </joey>
<joey> today how many hours can i can i sneak </joey>
<joey> into one of those and like i just asked </joey>
<joey> and a lot of the times they're just like </joey>
<connor> yeah that's when it's that's when it's </connor>
<connor> empty and also i don't ask i just go oh </connor>
<joey> okay the moment the plane like the seat </joey>
<joey> belt things come on i'm like that's a </joey>
<joey> free aisle that's mine i i could see </joey>
<joey> other people on the plane i see their </joey>
<joey> eyes looking at the free seats i'm like </joey>
<joey> no it's mine i'm getting everything </joey>
<connor> get down </connor>
<joey> well that's the other benefit of being </joey>
<connor> in the aisle right you immediately just </connor>
<connor> go </connor>
<garnt> but yeah i mean it's rare that i've been </garnt>
<connor> i'm on a plane where it's like that </connor>
<connor> where there's an aisle there you're like </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty sure the gamble you're making </connor>
<connor> is like it's like [ __ ] gotcha odds </connor>
<connor> i am talking about when the plane is </connor>
<joey> like basically like </joey>
<joey> 70 to 80 percent full right yeah right </joey>
<joey> because again like i said no one if you </joey>
<joey> if you're on the booking page of the </joey>
<connor> plane you get to see the layout as you </connor>
<connor> do you're not going to sit next to the </connor>
<connor> guy who picked willingly in the middle </connor>
<connor> because that that's a bad sign i </connor>
<connor> wouldn't do that if i saw someone in the </connor>
<connor> middle i'm like he's a psychopath that's </connor>
<joey> a psychopath he wants to socialize </joey>
<connor> yeah i'm like no no no no no no i'm not </connor>
<connor> formed for this </connor>
<joey> i'm not here to [ __ ] socialize i </joey>
<joey> don't want to join a cult today i'm sure </joey>
<garnt> i'm sure there'll be some cult some </garnt>
<garnt> stuff yeah yeah yeah but then i don't </garnt>
<connor> mind going okay so okay okay i'll do </connor>
<connor> that gamble if it doesn't work out i </connor>
<connor> might just </connor>
<connor> i might go to the like whoever's next to </connor>
<connor> me like you want to swap </connor>
<connor> want to swap you actually yeah sometimes </connor>
<connor> i'm like listen i'm going to sleep do </connor>
<connor> you want to swap </connor>
<garnt> and then they're like yeah wait how </garnt>
<garnt> easily do you sleep on planes because i </garnt>
<joey> i remember when i was like </joey>
<joey> with great difficulty so like for me </joey>
<joey> sleeping on the window seat is actually </joey>
<joey> less comfortable than sleeping on the </joey>
<joey> aisle seat as well because </joey>
<joey> because for some reason like you but </joey>
<joey> like mine you know your nature is you </joey>
<joey> know you can lean on the on the wall </joey>
<connor> right yeah but the wall </connor>
<connor> of the plane is i don't know why it's </connor>
<connor> just tilted at such an angle where you </connor>
<connor> can never get a comfortable </connor>
<connor> leaning on that ball it's </connor>
<connor> i don't know what engineer designed it </connor>
<connor> to make planes especially on the window </connor>
<connor> seats the most uncomfortable angle to </connor>
<connor> lean your head by yeah that is true </connor>
<garnt> and it is so weird because i have no </garnt>
<garnt> trouble sleeping on cars cars trains or </garnt>
<garnt> any other kind of moving vehicle i sleep </garnt>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] baby put me on a plane </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like insomnia like insomnia </garnt>
<joey> speed running it's just like </joey>
<joey> well i normally wear a hoodie and a </joey>
<connor> jacket no matter what the weather yeah </connor>
<joey> i'll use them as padding </joey>
<connor> yeah because it also gets [ __ ] cold </connor>
<connor> because i like i need to be i need my </connor>
<joey> hair to be at least like a 45 degree </joey>
<garnt> angle right </garnt>
<garnt> that's called privilege right no no no </garnt>
<connor> no no no like like like how does the how </connor>
<garnt> does the aisle make this solution better </garnt>
<garnt> because i can't i can't tilt my neck </garnt>
<garnt> enough that it's like it's almost like </garnt>
<garnt> horizontal here's how i </garnt>
<joey> i kind of go like the wall is here and </joey>
<garnt> the seat is here i kind of nestled into </garnt>
<garnt> this corner yeah because it's kind of </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because because like like for me like i </garnt>
<garnt> said my head needs to be like at least a </garnt>
<garnt> 45 degree angle so you know not not yet </garnt>
<garnt> not my entire body but at least my head </garnt>
<garnt> you know so it feels at least like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> lying down even though i'm i wake up i </garnt>
<garnt> get [ __ ] neck cramps or whatever like </garnt>
<joey> i just just go business </joey>
<connor> like at that point </connor>
<connor> i am honestly i have no problem just </connor>
<connor> sleeping like i put my head down and </connor>
<joey> sleep on my arms on my lap </joey>
<garnt> i can't do that i could do that i've </garnt>
<joey> attempted to do that as well and </joey>
<joey> i'm too tall </joey>
<garnt> that sounds like a short personal </garnt>
<garnt> solution to me this is why you're lower </garnt>
<garnt> than six foot </garnt>
<connor> you get you can just the world opens up </connor>
<joey> to you it's like a [ __ ] origami level </joey>
<joey> the 511 club over here </joey>
<garnt> honestly every time i go on a plane now </garnt>
<connor> i'm just like damn man i wish i wish i </connor>
<garnt> was a bit shorter i wish i was off the </garnt>
<connor> 511 club oh </connor>
<connor> god how does it feel to be sure oh my </connor>
<connor> god </connor>
<joey> well that's the other benefit of being </joey>
<joey> in the lc right is that you can stick </joey>
<joey> your legs out and actually stretch you </joey>
<connor> know you can't you you do for 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> and the woman comes over she's like hey </connor>
<connor> put your [ __ ] legs in oh the cart </connor>
<connor> comes by and you like your legs it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] cool i'm like [ __ ] up right </connor>
<joey> up against the seat though yeah like it </joey>
<joey> just slides pause i don't know i don't </joey>
<connor> know man jackie chan </connor>
<joey> i don't know if i can do this now </joey>
<connor> because it's been fine like two years </connor>
<garnt> since i've been on a long flight yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's been a while yeah yeah it's been </connor>
<connor> like two years but i used to i used to </connor>
<connor> stay up all night working </connor>
<connor> and then my flight would be at like what </connor>
<connor> like maybe midday if i was lucky yeah </connor>
<garnt> maybe 8 a.m if i was even luckier yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so i'd stay up all night working and </garnt>
<garnt> then right before i got on the plane i </garnt>
<garnt> would just take like one of those like </garnt>
<garnt> over-the-counter </garnt>
<garnt> really cheap weak sleeping pills yeah </garnt>
<garnt> the uk ones yeah they're super they're </garnt>
<joey> they're not like american melatonin no </joey>
<connor> no melatonin is the good [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<joey> that's like illegal in the years or you </joey>
<garnt> need a prescription to get melatonin oh </garnt>
<connor> really yeah i think the one that you get </connor>
<joey> from those stores like similar to hay </joey>
<joey> fever medicine i think uh like </joey>
<garnt> i swear to god that's your sugar pills </garnt>
<connor> it's so very good it doesn't actually </connor>
<connor> do much but it's enough to like kind of </connor>
<connor> get your head going and you're like all </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> i'm already sleep deprived i stayed up </connor>
<connor> all night working yeah and now i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> go to bed because like when i would when </connor>
<connor> uh what was it two and a half years ago </connor>
<joey> maybe the latin the last con season i </joey>
<joey> actually did before pandemic </joey>
<joey> i went back and forth from america like </joey>
<connor> four times in one month um to the uk </connor>
<joey> yeah and the only way i could do it was </joey>
<joey> by sleeping i just like i if if i need </joey>
<connor> to sleep on a plane and i don't have </connor>
<connor> like melatonin or like sleeping pills </connor>
<connor> i've never taken melatonin yeah i just </connor>
<connor> go like just give me like two gin and </connor>
<joey> tonics just </joey>
<garnt> just down fashion </garnt>
<connor> alcohol doesn't work on me just to make </connor>
<connor> me sleep i don't know really like to me </connor>
<connor> i never drink alcohol on planes because </connor>
<connor> alcohol just makes the </connor>
<connor> fluids run through my body faster so i </connor>
<connor> just gotta pee more so that that's just </connor>
<connor> that just adds an extra layer of stress </connor>
<garnt> for me because i'm sorry i gotta pee </garnt>
<connor> more now i'm on this plane i cannot pee </connor>
<connor> i i can hold the pin i cannot pee </connor>
<connor> of oh i i can hold the p for like the </connor>
<joey> whole 12 hours </joey>
<joey> you're a mad man like </joey>
<connor> i unload before i get on the plane i </connor>
<joey> load i fully </joey>
<connor> unleash it and i drink minimal water on </connor>
<garnt> the plane yeah well i'm pretty sure i'm </garnt>
<garnt> pretty sure i unload as much like </garnt>
<garnt> possibly can i go to p like five times </garnt>
<garnt> before i get on the plane on and like i </garnt>
<garnt> sit down immediately as i know probably </garnt>
<connor> being five times forgetting the plane </connor>
<connor> your bladder already sounds like it's </connor>
<connor> failed you before you even got to the </connor>
<connor> gate i'm only peeing like once i don't </connor>
<joey> know what it is though it's like it's </joey>
<connor> like a pavlovian effect where like the </connor>
<joey> moment you hear the doom of like the </joey>
<joey> seatbelt sign it's like a [ __ ] i have to </joey>
<connor> pee </connor>
<connor> every time i mean that's what i can hold </connor>
<connor> it and i can sleep so i'm like i tell </connor>
<garnt> the people next to me like if they seem </garnt>
<garnt> nice if they don't seem nice i won't say </garnt>
<garnt> anything because you could just tell us </garnt>
<garnt> tell them what i should be like don't if </garnt>
<connor> the food comes don't work me out i don't </connor>
<garnt> care about you don't wake me up for </garnt>
<garnt> anything so you're gonna say don't worry </garnt>
<garnt> uh don't worry if you have to pee </garnt>
<garnt> because uh i'm i'm all for it man </garnt>
<connor> sometimes if you're in like if you're </connor>
<connor> asleep and they ask you do you want food </connor>
<connor> and they think that you're like actually </connor>
<joey> like conked out like completely yeah </joey>
<joey> they might think like oh my god he's </joey>
<joey> like he's fainted or something or like </joey>
<joey> you know no i've done i've just </joey>
<joey> if i'm if you don't wake up if you don't </joey>
<joey> wake up yeah if i'm on a plane and i'm </joey>
<joey> asleep while the food goes past like </joey>
<connor> i've never been woken up for food oh my </connor>
<connor> god people wake me up so many times dude </connor>
<garnt> that is i hate that and i'm like do you </garnt>
<garnt> know how hard i worked </garnt>
<garnt> exactly right </garnt>
<garnt> i waited two hours to get to sleep for </garnt>
<garnt> five [ __ ] minutes so you could wake </garnt>
<connor> me up this is why i also don't want to </connor>
<joey> sit in the [ __ ] in the aisle because </joey>
<joey> the moment i fall asleep some person </joey>
<joey> could be like </joey>
<connor> excuse me can i go to the toilet </connor>
<connor> you literally waited you waited until i </connor>
<connor> felt fall asleep all right [ __ ] piece </connor>
<connor> of [ __ ] i hate you you're a scum of the </connor>
<connor> earth i will watch the moment i see them </connor>
<connor> about to fall asleep i'm like i'm going </connor>
<connor> to pee if i'm in the thing because i </connor>
<garnt> want to give you something yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and like there's only one thing that </garnt>
<garnt> annoys me more about getting woken up </garnt>
<garnt> just just to eat you know on a plane </garnt>
<garnt> which i wasn't even hungry in the first </garnt>
<garnt> place and that is </garnt>
<joey> babies on a plane i don't know man </joey>
<garnt> crying babies on a plane just triggers </garnt>
<garnt> something in me man i think it should be </garnt>
<joey> legally allowed cancelling headphones i </joey>
<joey> don't </joey>
<joey> they're a lifesaver literally the what </joey>
<joey> are they called dude i i i feel like i i </joey>
<garnt> feel like a baby's cry pierces any kind </garnt>
<connor> of anything dude those sony wx fourth </connor>
<connor> out whatever the [ __ ] they are the </connor>
<connor> stupidest name they've ever picked for </connor>
<connor> them those amazing noise counting </connor>
<connor> headphones you won't hear a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> thing yeah yeah because i've </garnt>
<connor> i don't know i don't i don't usually use </connor>
<connor> noise cancelling headphones that might </connor>
<garnt> be my problem because right now i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like i think it should be legally </garnt>
<garnt> allowed to punch babies if they cry on a </garnt>
<garnt> plane like that's can we </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> oh my god </connor>
<connor> i never thought i needed noise-canceling </connor>
<connor> headphones until i had them and then i </connor>
<connor> can't i literally go everywhere with </connor>
<connor> them like you you see me i'm always </connor>
<connor> where you are yeah i do not go anywhere </connor>
<garnt> without my noise cancel headphones now i </garnt>
<garnt> would only use noise cancelling </garnt>
<joey> headphones for the airplane that's </joey>
<joey> because that's what you think okay what </joey>
<connor> in what are the like situations it's so </connor>
<connor> nice on the train or any form of </connor>
<connor> transport walking around just getting </connor>
<connor> isolated and hearing your music and just </connor>
<connor> the music and if you want you can hear </connor>
<joey> some background noise it doesn't really </joey>
<joey> matter dude it's like living through an </joey>
<joey> amv it's [ __ ] awesome it's great i </joey>
<joey> want to hear phil defranco when i'm </joey>
<joey> walking downtown going what's up </joey>
<garnt> beautiful bastards in my ear right in my </garnt>
<joey> it's like right in my ear all i want to </joey>
<garnt> hear is fill in my i know i feel like i </garnt>
<garnt> zone out enough as it is i don't need </garnt>
<garnt> noise cancelling headphones like me i </garnt>
<connor> literally just walk in front of a truck </connor>
<garnt> or something i've had noise cancelling </garnt>
<joey> you learn to adapt </joey>
<joey> you </joey>
<garnt> you take out one sense so you gotta </garnt>
<garnt> compensate for it with your other sense </garnt>
<garnt> or something just buy them you'll see </garnt>
<joey> you'll see yeah they're great because i </joey>
<garnt> always thought like expensive headphones </garnt>
<connor> are like i don't need more than 20 bucks </connor>
<connor> or 50 bucks headphones what a scam and </connor>
<joey> then i'm like i'm such a fool i was so </joey>
<connor> wrong the whole time the beeps and boobs </connor>
<joey> sound even better oh they are amazing </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i changed everything i did </garnt>
<connor> used to have like really really good </connor>
<connor> headphones but they were just real happy </connor>
<garnt> they were just like a real hassle to uh </garnt>
<connor> just lug around well i stopped using </connor>
<connor> them that's right mine are like they </connor>
<garnt> fall in themselves pretty easy to put a </garnt>
<joey> coat pocket or something i just use the </joey>
<garnt> airpods yeah that's why that's why i'm i </garnt>
<connor> like i like using like you know </connor>
<joey> earbuds whenever it's daily life if it's </joey>
<garnt> on a plane yeah i'll bring the </garnt>
<joey> headphones yeah no i wear the headphones </joey>
<connor> everywhere see like especially this time </connor>
<joey> like i don't mind the headphones either </joey>
<joey> but like this time of year when it gets </joey>
<joey> hot as [ __ ] yeah i hate having </joey>
<connor> headphones around i need something to </connor>
<joey> distract me from the heat so just </joey>
<garnt> blasting the audio add more heat </garnt>
<garnt> take one more insulation take one of the </garnt>
<connor> sensors away from me so i can just go to </connor>
<connor> another world i don't have to [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> pay attention to japan anymore no i hate </joey>
<joey> that because i start sweating here like </joey>
<joey> on my ears and then when i take it off </joey>
<joey> it's like well you have a lot of hair </joey>
<connor> though so that might be why because i </connor>
<joey> don't really have like that much hair </joey>
<joey> around here so </joey>
<connor> what i mean that's pretty </connor>
<garnt> i'll be good i'll be good </garnt>
<garnt> shoot enough i'll have no hair and then </garnt>
<garnt> looking forward to getting sunburned on </garnt>
<connor> your head connor no i'm just going to </connor>
<connor> become a hat guy </connor>
<garnt> beanie guy </garnt>
<garnt> you're already starting to become a hat </garnt>
<connor> guy every time i see you in the summer </connor>
<connor> oh yeah because i realized that like it </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hurts to not wear a hat it hurts </connor>
<connor> yeah the the sun hurts so much i think </connor>
<connor> that's what the biggest thing that </connor>
<connor> changed me i i was i was walking today </connor>
<connor> uh to the train and i was like </connor>
<connor> when did i just like hate seeing the sun </connor>
<joey> like when does that happen cause i </joey>
<joey> remember i didn't mind being outside </joey>
<joey> right now i hate the thought of having </joey>
<connor> the sun on my skin at all </connor>
<connor> i loved it </connor>
<garnt> sounds like the most british thing i've </garnt>
<connor> ever heard honestly i didn't used to be </connor>
<garnt> this way i don't know what happened i </garnt>
<joey> just now i can't the sun wait can you </joey>
<joey> literally tan uh no i just burn right </joey>
<joey> but now i actually like if i stay in the </joey>
<garnt> sun too long i feel like nauseous real </garnt>
<garnt> fast without like a hat or anything yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know if that's like a difference </garnt>
<joey> is it just because it's too hot i think </joey>
<joey> maybe here yeah yeah i think cause this </joey>
<connor> is just way harder than i'm using it's </connor>
<joey> also yeah it's also because the humidity </joey>
<garnt> right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i </garnt>
<connor> feel like i feel like you're just it's </connor>
<joey> more it's not it's not the sun it's just </joey>
<connor> the heat because it's both </connor>
<garnt> in like england the sun [ __ ] tickles </garnt>
<connor> you you know </connor>
<garnt> it's like i feel like they play off each </garnt>
<garnt> other so </garnt>
<connor> the sun makes the humidity worse and </connor>
<connor> humidity makes the sun yeah absolutely </connor>
<joey> because when the sun's beaming on you in </joey>
<joey> like la or whatever yeah it's not too </joey>
<joey> bad obviously i don't want to stand </joey>
<joey> really it hurts </joey>
<joey> but i don't know i'm not saying it's </joey>
<joey> it's great but i mean it's better than </joey>
<joey> it is in japan just because the humidity </joey>
<joey> makes it feel ten times worse i mean i </joey>
<connor> don't know if there's some like ray </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like mimic like you know going </connor>
<connor> in the water droplets in the edge </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] the the frogs are making the </connor>
<connor> horse turn down </connor>
<connor> i don't know if there's some [ __ ] going </connor>
<joey> on now </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i don't know if there's probably </joey>
<connor> some someone smarter than me because </connor>
<joey> figured it out it's honestly i think </joey>
<joey> it's just like a preference thing right </joey>
<joey> like some people are like yeah humidity </joey>
<joey> is whatever and then there are others </joey>
<joey> who are like oh yeah my skin is like </joey>
<garnt> physically burning </garnt>
<connor> i i like a little bit of humidity </connor>
<garnt> japanese humidity is like way too much </garnt>
<connor> yeah well last summer i could like only </connor>
<joey> survive by going around with like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] uv umbrella i felt like an old </joey>
<joey> that's right i would just go around like </joey>
<connor> this foldable umbrella that i would just </connor>
<connor> go around i'd be like don't talk to me </connor>
<joey> yeah because i could the first time i </joey>
<joey> saw you with that i thought </joey>
<joey> oh i was like are you are you waiting </joey>
<joey> for me to like say a joke or like you're </joey>
<connor> taking a piece i realized it's not </connor>
<connor> enough to protect my head is this is </connor>
<connor> this a bit it was i </connor>
<connor> it started like even the hat didn't </connor>
<connor> really help that much and i needed to </connor>
<connor> cover like my neck and like my arms and </connor>
<joey> shoulders so you need to get those like </joey>
<connor> like visors </connor>
<connor> i'm one step away from being the old </connor>
<connor> woman at the supermarket because they </connor>
<connor> wear like sleeves like shade sleeves and </connor>
<garnt> like a full like neck thing for the sun </garnt>
<garnt> shout out to those of us who've never </garnt>
<connor> been sunburned in our lives </connor>
<connor> this is this white man problem that i </connor>
<joey> just don't get i think so i think i </joey>
<joey> think i'm aging rapidly imagine imagine </joey>
<connor> sunburning </connor>
<joey> imagine sunburning oh god imagine being </joey>
<garnt> hurt by this natural occurring thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's existed since the beginning of </garnt>
<connor> our planet i feel like my body didn't </connor>
<connor> age and then it decided that everyone </connor>
<connor> everything would just kick into </connor>
<connor> overdrive and start aging rapidly from </connor>
<connor> age like 23. i don't know what happened </connor>
<connor> moving to japan just made me feel old i </connor>
<joey> don't know why so now now i literally </joey>
<joey> the youngest man yeah </joey>
<connor> my uv umbrella broke it was [ __ ] it </connor>
<joey> snapped it broke it broke i don't know </joey>
<joey> how bro did the sun snap it i don't know </joey>
<joey> the rays were too heavy </joey>
<connor> i i like to what broke about how did it </connor>
<garnt> break how long did it break when i you </garnt>
<garnt> know when you pull it out because it was </garnt>
<joey> one of the foldable ones so it goes on </joey>
<garnt> so i could fit it like a small bag yeah </garnt>
<joey> um it's just like when i pulled it out </joey>
<connor> one time it just [ __ ] came off </connor>
<garnt> and i was like oh </garnt>
<garnt> my god i guess no sun protection for the </garnt>
<connor> day then no so now i need to buy a new </connor>
<connor> one i've been looking on amazon but this </connor>
<connor> one hasn't caught my fancy yet so </connor>
<garnt> i'm very picky is this a fashion </garnt>
<garnt> statement or something as well like no i </garnt>
<connor> just i just wanted one that wouldn't </connor>
<connor> break you know because i i've been burnt </connor>
<connor> once </connor>
<connor> twice now from the sun and from the </connor>
<garnt> other then just by uh more sturdy one </garnt>
<connor> surely oh thanks guys it's an umbrella </connor>
<connor> it's a [ __ ] doing that it's a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> umbrella how wrong can you how wrong can </garnt>

<connor> do surely well i mean you know because </connor>
<connor> why the [ __ ] you worried about like the </connor>
<connor> design well because i already look like </connor>

<joey> of like a little like down time before </joey>
<joey> we get on </joey>
<garnt> i guess we're going straight into it </garnt>
<joey> let's just go straight into depression </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> how can we say this boys one of one of </joey>
<joey> the greatest manga one of my [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> heroes one of the </joey>
<connor> one of the greatest manga artists of all </connor>
<connor> time just passed away recently and it's </connor>
<connor> kind of old news by the time this year </connor>
<connor> by the time this comes out this would be </connor>
<connor> like a month old news now </connor>
<joey> um but yeah kentaro miura author of </joey>
<joey> berserk has passed away and uh age 54 </joey>
<joey> right yeah age 54 of like what what did </joey>
<joey> he die of i forgot the scientific name </joey>
<joey> of it but it's like one of his like main </joey>
<garnt> arteries in his heart just like </garnt>
<garnt> exploded [ __ ] essentially so basically </garnt>
<joey> it's a heart attack yeah yeah but yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's a [ __ ] horrible way to die i'll </garnt>
<garnt> tell you honestly after hearing about </garnt>
<garnt> this news i'm never gonna make fun of a </garnt>
<joey> hiatus ever again yeah honestly </joey>
<joey> oh no like legit like it's scary man </joey>
<joey> like because </joey>
<joey> yeah because you know obviously no one </joey>
<joey> really knew as to why he was on hiatus </joey>
<joey> right yeah no no one knew they they </joey>
<joey> normally don't usually give reasons </joey>
<connor> they're just like he's on </connor>
<connor> people are extremely personal yeah he </connor>
<joey> she's on hiatus just deal with it kind </joey>
<connor> of yeah um but yeah apparently i guess i </connor>
<joey> don't know was he sick at all or was it </joey>
<joey> just completely sudden i don't really i </joey>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<connor> at the time of recording i haven't read </connor>
<connor> enough about what happened you know if </connor>
<joey> it was like a reoccurring health problem </joey>
<joey> or </joey>
<joey> if it was just a sudden thing but man </joey>
<joey> like like we all know how much pressure </joey>
<joey> manga artists get put through anyway um </joey>
<joey> and how much work they have to do on a </joey>
<joey> weekly basis right um i mean it's it's </joey>
<joey> crazy to think that most of the big </joey>
<joey> manga artists we know about you know you </joey>
<joey> know working showing and jump or </joey>
<joey> whatever get like two weeks off no less </joey>
<joey> than two weeks off for a year right it's </joey>
<joey> like golden week and then like one extra </joey>
<connor> week yeah as well yeah i doubt they take </connor>
<connor> it and they don't really i doubt they </connor>
<garnt> take it off as well it's just one week </garnt>
<connor> that where they are forced to take a </connor>
<connor> break right i mean i wasn't too familiar </connor>
<garnt> with berserk i'd only watch the uh the </garnt>
<garnt> 90s anime i mean that's familiar enough </garnt>
<garnt> which i really enjoyed yeah that's very </garnt>
<garnt> good it's great </garnt>
<connor> um but [ __ ] i mean it's kind of sad </connor>
<connor> hearing like a legend of the industry </connor>
<connor> who's kind of influenced a lot of things </connor>
<garnt> that we've done yeah </garnt>
<joey> because i remember we were filming </joey>
<joey> another project when the news broke to </joey>
<joey> us yeah and it didn't hit me immediately </joey>
<joey> because i was in like work mode i was </joey>
<joey> filming most obviously i was like okay </joey>
<connor> gotta do this this this and then i got </connor>
<connor> home </connor>
<connor> listened to gutz's theme once and he </connor>
<connor> just played continuously for like the </connor>
<connor> entire night and i'm just i'm just </connor>
<garnt> sitting there just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like my soul part of my soul had died </garnt>
<joey> yeah i literally went home and i was </joey>
<garnt> like i'm gonna reread berserk and then </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i feel like everyone did yeah i </garnt>
<connor> started reading it yeah i i couldn't get </connor>
<joey> past volume one without feeling like </joey>
<garnt> this [ __ ] wave of like [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> cause like i i always know that berserk </garnt>
<garnt> is one of the greatest manga that has </garnt>
<garnt> ever been made and then going back home </garnt>
<garnt> and realizing just </garnt>
<garnt> remembering everything that was in the </garnt>
<garnt> story and in this manga </garnt>
<garnt> it just hit even [ __ ] harder because </garnt>
<garnt> i just had forgotten </garnt>
<garnt> how good it was before i really took the </garnt>
<garnt> time to remember what it had achieved </garnt>
<garnt> and some of its greatest moments um if </garnt>
<garnt> you hadn't read berserk </garnt>
<garnt> there's always a there's always a </garnt>
<garnt> perfect time to read berserk because any </garnt>
<garnt> time is the perfect time to read berserk </garnt>
<joey> so please read [ __ ] berserk it's </joey>
<joey> amazing i mean the manga single-handedly </joey>
<joey> inspired the dark souls series i mean it </joey>
<garnt> spied a lot it wasn't just dark souls </garnt>
<joey> yeah a lot of things wouldn't exist </joey>
<joey> right now if not for berserk oh yeah </joey>
<joey> and i don't know what i don't know what </joey>
<joey> it is about berserk but it's literally </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> it's literally the one </joey>
<joey> show or not not even one shirt the one </joey>
<joey> story or the one manga that seems to be </joey>
<garnt> like no matter how tough this person is </garnt>
<garnt> no matter </garnt>
<garnt> how like detached they are from the </garnt>
<garnt> world or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> berserk seems to be that one story that </garnt>
<garnt> seems to be able to affect anyone who </garnt>
<joey> reads it yeah because like fundamentally </joey>
<connor> you know it's like this whole like dark </connor>
<connor> fantasy thing with these like mythical </connor>
<connor> creatures and it's bloody gory and you </connor>
<connor> know epic </connor>
<connor> but like the main themes mostly are just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you know one person trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] they want to do in life </connor>
<connor> yeah and like that's a theme that </connor>
<connor> literally anyone can get behind right </connor>
<connor> like i'm kind of in this world </connor>
<connor> shit's happening around me </connor>
<joey> i don't really know what my purpose is </joey>
<joey> in life yeah i forgot how brutal it was </joey>
<joey> it's bro </joey>
<connor> i've what again i watched all the other </connor>
<joey> 90s enemies yeah holy [ __ ] the 90s </joey>
<joey> obvious brutal as [ __ ] yeah i was like </joey>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] i was like oh my god it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it just it just hurts to read yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> does it's so uncomfortable at times yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i think it's incredible because it </garnt>
<garnt> is really really [ __ ] brutal there </garnt>
<garnt> are some like </garnt>
<garnt> like his art obviously we haven't talked </garnt>
<garnt> about his audio it's like some of the </garnt>
<garnt> best art to ever exist in the world of </garnt>
<garnt> manga like some of the horrific imagery </garnt>
<garnt> he was managed to conjure up and </garnt>
<garnt> some of like the creature designs and </garnt>
<garnt> everything were just something straight </garnt>
<garnt> out of a nightmare you know oh yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> it was a brutal show and it's an </garnt>
<garnt> action-packed show as well for his guts </garnt>
<garnt> is like one of the biggest badasses </garnt>
<garnt> in anime and manga and yet </garnt>
<garnt> having said all that </garnt>
<garnt> the moments that people remember are </garnt>
<garnt> like the really intimate moments which </garnt>
<garnt> is which isn't what you think if you </garnt>
<garnt> looked at berserk on a surface level </garnt>
<joey> right you look at berserk you see these </joey>
<joey> horrific creatures you see guts with a </joey>
<joey> massive sword tearing [ __ ] up and you're </joey>
<joey> like yeah this is a manly man's show and </joey>
<joey> then you read it and you're just like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] crying inside because you know </connor>
<connor> you see he's just trying to see guts </connor>
<connor> like get through his trauma and find his </connor>
<connor> journey and everything like that it's </connor>
<connor> like it's the real intimate moments that </connor>
<connor> always stand out and it's the real </connor>
<connor> serene moments that always stand out and </connor>
<connor> i think that's what that's what really </connor>
<joey> sets berserk apart from like so many </joey>
<joey> other series where it's the serene </joey>
<joey> moments juxtaposed against all like the </joey>
<joey> horrific moments that make it one of to </joey>
<joey> me like it's one of my the favor one of </joey>
<connor> my favorite pieces of fiction that's </connor>
<joey> ever been made 100 i got reminded of </joey>
<connor> that after </connor>
<garnt> remembering everything that's </garnt>
<connor> everything that berserk did it's like if </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] doom guy had like a a wife </connor>
<connor> and family and he just went home </connor>
<connor> sometimes </connor>
<connor> you get reminded you get reminded like </connor>
<joey> oh [ __ ] this is good because when you're </joey>
<joey> where you're guys </joey>
<connor> because i don't know why someone </connor>
<connor> compared it on twitter and i thought oh </connor>
<connor> that would be i guess so but then i i </connor>
<connor> read because i'm like </connor>
<connor> but it is kind of like you do forget </connor>
<connor> because sometimes it's like you're </connor>
<joey> reading it you're like this is like so </joey>
<joey> doom esque where he's just literally </joey>
<joey> just beheading horses yeah yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> then you're like oh it's just like dude </joey>
<connor> but then it's like really sad you're </connor>
<connor> like this isn't like </connor>
<garnt> this is true it's literally that meme </garnt>
<garnt> where the girls were like i can't </garnt>
<garnt> believe you didn't cry during titanic do </garnt>
<connor> boys even have feelings and then like </connor>
<connor> this there's just the boys crying over </connor>
<connor> the guts theme which was literally what </connor>
<joey> i was doing </joey>
<joey> was playing and i was just like crying </joey>
<joey> in bed just like oh my god yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know it's just yeah like every time i </joey>
<connor> reread it it's just because you know </connor>
<connor> every time a new volume came out because </connor>
<connor> there was so much time in between like </connor>
<connor> the later volumes i was like well [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> guess i have to read it from scratch </connor>
<connor> again and so i would keep reading it </connor>
<connor> from scratch over and over again and </connor>
<connor> it's just one of those shows where i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<joey> how does this not </joey>
<connor> get like stale yeah because i probably </connor>
<joey> re i probably read it like the first 30 </joey>
<joey> volumes probably like a good like maybe </joey>
<joey> 10 20 times yeah i'm just like how does </joey>
<joey> this keep just getting better like how </joey>
<joey> do i keep finding new things in this i </joey>
<connor> mean you guys know me i don't [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> re-watch anything and yeah i refuse to </joey>
<joey> re-watch but i even just re-reading the </joey>
<garnt> first uh what was the first art called </garnt>
<garnt> the ordination golden age that just </garnt>
<garnt> rereading that again i'm like holy [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> this was so good yeah like even though </garnt>
<connor> i've i've seen this i i've read it </connor>
<connor> earlier like i tried to read it again </connor>
<connor> ages ago for some reason now i'm like </connor>
<joey> sometimes when i'm bored i just like go </joey>
<connor> to the eclipse arc and just look at the </connor>
<connor> art yeah this is something like this </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] wait how can one person think of </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah i know this is insane and </garnt>
<joey> dude was like 15 as well when you like </joey>
<joey> first came up with the concept of </joey>
<garnt> berserk yeah did you see like did you </garnt>
<joey> see the manga he made before berserk </joey>
<joey> when he was actually 50. he was like 15 </joey>
<joey> or 16. it's better than most </joey>
<joey> modern manga artists you </joey>
<joey> not the art skill of a 15 year old </joey>
<joey> exactly exactly and like he paired that </joey>
<connor> talent and he he just kept improving on </connor>
<connor> it to the point where literally i i </connor>
<connor> don't know there's only if like a few </connor>
<garnt> people in the world who i think can even </garnt>
<garnt> match you know the talent that he put </garnt>
<joey> into the panels that he did i mean i saw </joey>
<joey> this like really interesting interview </joey>
<joey> uh with him like after you know his </joey>
<joey> death was announced um where like </joey>
<connor> apparently one of the big reasons as to </connor>
<connor> why he was on hiatus was because he got </connor>
<connor> so infatuated with detail that it would </connor>
<connor> literally get to the point where he </connor>
<connor> would zoom in and like actually edit </connor>
<joey> every [ __ ] pixel oh yeah oh my god </joey>
<joey> honestly and like and sounds like a </joey>
<connor> prisoner to perfect yeah and he kept and </connor>
<joey> he kept you know getting like on hiatus </joey>
<joey> over and over again and his you know </joey>
<joey> editors would be like you can't even see </joey>
<joey> this detail on paper yeah so like just </joey>
<joey> stop and he was just like no i have to </joey>
<garnt> get this right i have to get this </garnt>
<garnt> perfect honestly like some of the panels </garnt>
<joey> he's done </joey>
<joey> belongs in a museum you know yeah </joey>
<joey> because like i cause the the reason for </joey>
<joey> that is because i just remembered like </joey>
<joey> that night when i went back i just like </joey>
<joey> went to look at some of the panels and i </joey>
<joey> just remember staring at them for such a </joey>
<joey> long time because you know when you're </joey>
<joey> reading a story sometimes you know </joey>
<joey> you're you wanna you wanna you wanna see </joey>
<joey> what happens next so you don't read it </joey>
<joey> you don't appreciate the arts </joey>
<joey> um at the moment </joey>
<joey> when you first read it but i went back </joey>
<joey> to look at some of the panels and i just </joey>
<joey> the amount of </joey>
<joey> work and amount of detail and the amount </joey>
<joey> of vision that was put into these panels </joey>
<joey> were [ __ ] amazing and i did not </joey>
<joey> appreciate it fully the first time even </joey>
<joey> though i could like tell these were </joey>
<joey> amazing i didn't take the time to fully </joey>
<joey> appreciate how [ __ ] amazing these </joey>
<joey> some of these panels are because they </joey>
<joey> are incredible oh hundred percent and </joey>
<joey> they they you know they </joey>
<garnt> they are just basically the same as any </garnt>
<garnt> other painting or any other art i really </garnt>
<connor> wanna you know see if they have like a </connor>
<connor> berserk art book of some kind because i </connor>
<connor> would [ __ ] purchase that in the </connor>
<connor> heartbeat dude i i i can imagine that </connor>
<connor> they'll probably end up doing something </connor>
<joey> soon yeah celebrate the legacy right i </joey>
<connor> hope they do like open up an exhibit or </connor>
<connor> something yeah because that would be </connor>
<connor> absolutely amazing because if there's </connor>
<connor> one you know one manga that deserves an </connor>
<garnt> exhibit that deserves that artwork to be </garnt>
<garnt> plastered on the wall </garnt>
<connor> it's [ __ ] berserk </connor>
<connor> yeah it was kind of sad to see that a </connor>
<connor> lot of people were just like what's </connor>
<joey> going to happen to the story and it's </joey>
<joey> like those aren't fans of bizarre yeah </joey>
<connor> it's frustrating that like when i saw </connor>
<connor> the announcement on twitter saying </connor>
<connor> people being like does this mean it's </connor>
<connor> not gonna finish it's like like yes no </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that's to me it's just so it's like </connor>
<connor> how about you just give them a chance to </connor>
<connor> like grieve before you ask these </connor>
<joey> questions if anything i'm kind of your </joey>
<joey> answer's probably gonna be no because </joey>
<joey> there were a lot of people as well being </joey>
<joey> like oh but you know they could probably </joey>
<joey> just get like mirror's assistance to </joey>
<joey> finish it and like no no no no no i </joey>
<joey> would rather it just be where it is yeah </joey>
<joey> just end it i'm i'm fine with it being </joey>
<joey> an unfinished masterpiece you know </joey>
<joey> that's that's fine that's fine for me </joey>
<connor> yeah it's berserk was it realistically </connor>
<connor> ever gonna finish do you think </connor>
<joey> i mean i don't think i don't think like </joey>
<connor> not not a single one of like the you </connor>
<joey> know the kings yeah were like killed i </joey>
<garnt> think only one of them was i think one </garnt>
<garnt> of them was yeah </garnt>
<joey> so that was a long there was a long long </joey>
<garnt> way to go yeah we we were so early in </garnt>
<garnt> the story and the pace that the story </garnt>
<connor> was progressing i doubt it would have </connor>
<connor> finished in our lifetime or you know i i </connor>
<connor> think it was always going to be </connor>
<connor> unfinished but i think berserk's already </connor>
<garnt> achieved enough </garnt>
<garnt> that it doesn't need to be finished yeah </garnt>
<connor> it was like what i said when we talked </connor>
<connor> about i think last time we spoke really </connor>
<connor> manga where i just get to i often get to </connor>
<connor> a point when reading margaret i'm like </connor>
<connor> i'm satisfied i </connor>
<connor> genuinely it would be cool if this ends </connor>
<connor> nicely </connor>
<connor> but i've read up to a point where i feel </connor>
<garnt> like i'm happy with what i've been given </garnt>
<connor> yeah and i feel like berserk has </connor>
<garnt> definitely done that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> there's been plenty of moments in </garnt>
<joey> berserk that have felt like a resolution </joey>
<joey> moment yeah like a big resolution moment </joey>
<joey> even though not every plot detail was </joey>
<joey> resolved even though not every loose end </joey>
<connor> was tied up i feel like it's </connor>
<connor> resolved enough in my heart to make it </connor>
<connor> like impact me </connor>
<connor> this much already you know and i think </connor>
<connor> the berserk you know the journey of guts </connor>
<connor> is already amazing enough as it is and </connor>
<connor> some journeys you know some some </connor>
<connor> journeys don't need to come to an end on </connor>
<connor> paper you know that's it's i've seen </connor>
<garnt> enough of the journey where i'm </garnt>
<connor> satisfied it's yeah it's just knowing </connor>
<joey> that he's he's out there somewhere still </joey>
<connor> yeah looking for the end right exactly </connor>
<joey> the biggest [ __ ] sword </joey>
<joey> the fat [ __ ] sword </joey>
<garnt> yeah and honestly i don't know what else </garnt>
<garnt> to say it was just it's it's a story </garnt>
<joey> that has impacted me if there's anything </joey>
<garnt> we can say on this trash days episode </garnt>
<garnt> it's please go read berserk please give </garnt>
<garnt> it a go pay respect to the king yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah honestly honestly he he's he's he's </garnt>
<garnt> a [ __ ] coat man i i hope you know </garnt>
<connor> uh if we find out more about the details </connor>
<connor> of uh you know what might have caused </connor>
<connor> his early death um </connor>
<connor> that if it is something to do with being </connor>
<connor> overworked or anything that lifestyle </connor>
<joey> that i hope it does make a change if it </joey>
<joey> is yeah we don't know that obviously and </joey>
<joey> you might never know but if we do find </joey>
<connor> out more details and it becomes publicly </connor>
<connor> available and we you know we know that </connor>
<connor> maybe being overworked yeah yeah i think </connor>
<joey> it would be good to at least you know </joey>
<joey> kind of put into the public discussion </joey>
<connor> right because you know you know even if </connor>
<connor> you are </connor>
<connor> uh you know you have because normally </connor>
<connor> with uh heart problems and this kind of </connor>
<connor> blood stuff it's normally there is some </connor>
<joey> hereditary stuff at play yeah but i mean </joey>
<connor> still at 54 is young like that yeah </connor>
<connor> lifestyle would have to have player i </connor>
<connor> don't exactly </connor>
<connor> i i just want monkeys to not </connor>
<connor> not have so much stress on their body </connor>
<connor> where it fails you know yeah i don't </connor>
<garnt> know i feel bad man it makes you feel </garnt>
<garnt> shitty yeah yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it's it sucks because i you know there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's not really much i can add to </garnt>
<garnt> that because manga artists work a hell </garnt>
<connor> of a lot we know we know they're getting </connor>
<connor> we we we </connor>
<connor> or not the deadlines that they set </connor>
<garnt> themselves or set on them yeah too much </garnt>
<connor> yeah and it doesn't help that fans are </connor>
<joey> so demanding and that for some [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> reason the first question that some fans </joey>
<joey> have when an author dies is what happens </joey>
<joey> to the story yeah it's like i mean </joey>
<joey> it feels so selfish and it feels that </joey>
<connor> you know because we we as fans also have </connor>
<connor> something where we're selfish and we </connor>
<joey> want yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't know like surprisingly from what </joey>
<connor> i saw there weren't as many of those </connor>
<joey> yeah every now and then i saw it i'm </joey>
<joey> like okay clearly you don't really give </joey>
<connor> a [ __ ] but yeah i mean none of that fans </connor>
<joey> are great and yeah i understand yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah there were just some of the </joey>
<garnt> insensitive ones yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it reminds me of uh but it's like when </garnt>
<connor> there's earthquakes and stuff right yeah </connor>
<garnt> people are always just like oh the manga </garnt>
<garnt> it's uh it's delayed because of an </garnt>
<joey> earthquake and it's like </joey>
<joey> what do you mean like there's people </joey>
<joey> like people die like </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<connor> like earthquakes are no [ __ ] joke </connor>
<connor> exactly and it's like people that most i </connor>
<connor> mean you know obviously with this </connor>
<connor> situation is very sensitive you know and </connor>
<connor> it was very fresh and people a lot of </connor>
<connor> people care but i i know it's especially </connor>
<connor> with like earthquakes and stuff people </connor>
<connor> are very quick to be like oh who gives a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] it's just an earthquake it happens </connor>
<connor> all the time yeah yeah and it's like </connor>
<connor> well i think it plays into the </connor>
<connor> the overall </connor>
<connor> sentiment of that a lot of anime fans </connor>
<connor> and manga fans are very demanding for </connor>
<connor> the stuff that they want yeah and i feel </connor>
<connor> like we as fans need to chill out a </connor>
<joey> little bit </joey>
<joey> yeah they they care about the product </joey>
<joey> but not so much about the person making </joey>
<connor> yeah i feel like we're just fans </connor>
<connor> generally to chill out about our passion </connor>
<connor> for anime and manga i'd say external </connor>
<connor> things happen they happen it is what it </connor>
<joey> is remember that some actual person is </joey>
<connor> making your product yeah you know </connor>
<connor> whether it be an earthquake or personal </connor>
<joey> stress they're all valid reasons for </joey>
<joey> work to be delayed </joey>
<joey> you know i i just i just want i just </joey>
<connor> want creators to be able to create the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] to the best of you exactly not have </garnt>
<garnt> to worry i mean it kind of reminds me of </garnt>
<garnt> hope that's not controversial for me to </garnt>
<garnt> say </garnt>
<connor> sure everyone can agree on it it's just </connor>
<connor> more you know we i'm sure 99 percent of </connor>
<connor> people watching this don't do that it's </connor>
<connor> just that one percent right it's always </connor>
<connor> that one percent because i remember this </connor>
<connor> reminds me of like the game of thrones </connor>
<connor> thing with joara martin where i remember </connor>
<connor> like seeing an interview with him and he </connor>
<connor> was he said that he got annoyed that </connor>
<connor> some people were worried about his </connor>
<connor> health not because they were worried </connor>
<connor> about his health but they're worried if </connor>
<connor> he would be alive to finish game of </connor>
<connor> thrones right right and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> yeah that's pretty [ __ ] up yeah like </connor>
<garnt> fans are saying that to you aren't they </garnt>
<joey> jesus christ yeah and even if they </joey>
<connor> didn't say it i'm sure he knows that </connor>
<joey> people are probably thinking yeah he can </joey>
<joey> read between the lines yeah of course </joey>
<joey> yeah i only care about his well-being in </joey>
<connor> terms of the book like he's being </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] held hostage by the story yeah </connor>
<joey> like you know what i mean you can't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] do anything if anyone knows the </joey>
<connor> intention of game of thrones fans it's </connor>
<connor> the guy who made kevin harris </connor>
<joey> that's just sad that's just sad i don't </joey>
<connor> know yeah it's like this makes me sad </connor>
<garnt> for like many reasons you know there's </garnt>
<garnt> just so much at play this does this this </garnt>
<garnt> is what i mean it's a sad topic </garnt>
<joey> unfortunately it's all about the respect </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's all it is respect the </garnt>
<connor> creators respect the artists yeah give </connor>
<joey> them some space if they're feeling sick </joey>
<garnt> or need a break yeah </garnt>
<garnt> moving on to light topics though </garnt>
<connor> i heard you've been watching anime </connor>
<connor> recently connor </connor>
<connor> which is which is a rare </connor>
<connor> which is a rare feat </connor>
<connor> i remember i used to do that i know the </connor>
<garnt> anime man </garnt>
<connor> what happened did you guys watch </connor>
<connor> castlevania yeah the new season i </connor>
<garnt> haven't not season four now but we </garnt>
<joey> haven't talked about castlevania yeah </joey>
<joey> it's so good it's so good i mean with </joey>
<joey> how well i mean i watched up to season </joey>
<joey> three </joey>
<connor> yeah if there's one anime i have like </connor>
<joey> kind of caught up to it's castlevania </joey>
<garnt> but like what did you get up to </garnt>
<connor> castlevania uh i got up to season three </connor>
<joey> so i haven't finished season three i'm </joey>
<connor> about halfway through season three yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i mean but i mean it's just been </joey>
<connor> for me it's been getting better and </connor>
<connor> better every season because it's been </connor>
<connor> going on and i just haven't had time to </connor>
<garnt> binge it yet so </garnt>
<connor> um i don't know man everything about </connor>
<connor> that anime especially the past season </connor>
<connor> just blew out the waterfall what's so </connor>
<joey> good about it like i feel like </joey>
<joey> everything that was good in previous </joey>
<joey> seasons was at its best this season yeah </joey>
<joey> really the story was the best the </joey>
<joey> animation was just insane like some of </joey>
<joey> the fights even though in season three </joey>
<joey> the fights like the final fight was so </joey>
<connor> good even season one had some great </connor>
<connor> animations yeah it just feels like </connor>
<connor> they've stepped it up like again like i </connor>
<connor> think one of the strongest points of </connor>
<connor> castlevania has been the voice acting </connor>
<connor> yeah it's voice acting english is </connor>
<joey> fantastic it's insane </joey>
<joey> the fact that they have like all the all </joey>
<connor> the accents on point none of the </connor>
<joey> accidents feel silly yeah every single </joey>
<connor> accent that the characters have it feels </connor>
<connor> genuine every single british accent is </connor>
<joey> on point yeah and it's like holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> how do they do this this never happens </joey>
<joey> how do they get an actual accent it's </joey>
<joey> like they hired british actors like i </joey>
<connor> love the fact that for example that jojo </connor>
<joey> in the dub like tried to do the accent </joey>
<joey> yeah i wish they'd got the native people </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah because like in jojo </joey>
<garnt> part one it's uh johnny and bosh doing </garnt>
<garnt> in a british accent which is yeah it is </garnt>
<joey> which isn't bad but i know there's no </joey>
<connor> shortage of native english uh british </connor>
<joey> accents in that can work in l.a yeah you </joey>
<garnt> know like </garnt>
<garnt> it it feels like the voice actors they </garnt>
<connor> hide for castlevania's were just outside </connor>
<joey> of your usual they were just amazing </joey>
<joey> yeah they were just like they felt like </joey>
<garnt> general actors that would act in like a </garnt>
<garnt> tv series or like a live-action movie </garnt>
<connor> well yeah because they have like they </connor>
<connor> have such a good variation of british </connor>
<connor> accents like they have like the whole </connor>
<connor> spectrum and each and they've chosen it </connor>
<connor> like the character has given the accent </connor>
<connor> based very specifically on like </connor>
<connor> where what it would be in the uk like </connor>
<joey> you're where you were born your wealth </joey>
<joey> your socio-economic background it sounds </joey>
<joey> like it's so stupid but it it fits every </joey>
<joey> single character and uh it's just insane </joey>
<joey> because i mean i i you we can't </joey>
<joey> appreciate it i mean i could we can't </joey>
<joey> appreciate that in the japanese one </joey>
<joey> where they might get regional accents on </joey>
<joey> point within their own show right </joey>
<joey> sometimes you get like the subtitles </joey>
<connor> where they're supposed to be a bit more </connor>
<connor> like oh sakura </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah a bit rough i can't </garnt>
<connor> really appreciate that yeah honestly </connor>
<connor> i've been appreciating japanese voice </connor>
<connor> acting a lot more recently yeah um </connor>
<connor> yeah because i've actually i've actually </connor>
<joey> started to watch anime without subtitles </joey>
<joey> on right so i'm like properly forced wow </joey>
<joey> you are like listen level 100 we right </joey>
<garnt> now oh yeah exactly </garnt>
<connor> you're at the final stage before you </connor>
<joey> graduate </joey>
<garnt> exactly exactly so like the final test </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i'm like trying trying to pick </garnt>
<connor> up more of my japanese and you know part </connor>
<connor> of the exercise i've been putting myself </connor>
<connor> through is like everything i watch now </connor>
<connor> not subtitled like yeah my enjoyment has </connor>
<connor> definitely of anime gone down but it's </connor>
<connor> like this helps it it helps so much more </connor>
<garnt> it's it's a night and day watching with </garnt>
<garnt> subtitles without subtitles when you </garnt>
<connor> don't understand something that's being </connor>
<connor> said how do you do you go back and turn </connor>
<garnt> subtitles on or just yeah so normally i </garnt>
<garnt> watch anime on crunchyroll or netflix </garnt>
<garnt> right so crunchy will also have the </garnt>
<garnt> opportunity to select no subtitles so i </garnt>
<connor> can select no subtitles if there's </connor>
<connor> something that i really really want to </connor>
<connor> know what they said i just rewind a bit </connor>
<connor> turn on subtitles like oh okay that's </connor>
<connor> what he said right move on right same </connor>
<connor> thing with netflix as well yeah um i </connor>
<connor> mean it's it it turns anime to </connor>
<connor> not just like a passive watching thing </connor>
<connor> and you're just like actively studying </connor>
<connor> material yeah so it is study material </connor>
<connor> but if you're going to have study </connor>
<connor> material at least have study materials </connor>
<connor> um it's just it's just a different kind </connor>
<connor> of watching in my eyes but </connor>
<connor> um since then i like i remember </connor>
<connor> recently i've been watching nagatoro </connor>
<connor> without subtitles </connor>
<joey> and i had like my first emotional </joey>
<joey> response to watching an anime and </joey>
<joey> without having subtitles on it was just </joey>
<joey> felt it felt nice because i'm just like </joey>
<joey> oh i i i get what's going on i'm getting </joey>
<joey> emotional with these japanese people is </joey>
<joey> this this is this one yeah that's </joey>
<connor> exactly what i found it's like oh i'm </connor>
<connor> i'm feeling some stuff now </connor>
<connor> japanese people feel i'm not i'm not </connor>
<garnt> reading the subtitles and getting </garnt>
<garnt> feelings i'm actually hearing it i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> listening to it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't know how to quite describe </garnt>
<connor> it because it was it was a new feeling </connor>
<garnt> for me well gone i do the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> just with hentai </garnt>
<connor> because they don't have subtitles most </connor>
<connor> of the time so i i just watched it fair </connor>
<connor> enough i feel big brain when i kimochi </connor>
<joey> i'm like yeah </joey>
<joey> i got that one i understand that i </joey>
<connor> i remember going through my japanese </connor>
<connor> classes and it like i was like uh so </connor>
<connor> naka means inside and i was like where </connor>
<connor> have i heard the term knucker </connor>
<joey> center yeah yeah like inside well i've </joey>
<connor> heard oh that's the way i've heard that </connor>
<joey> before </joey>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> a word you'll hear quite often yeah </joey>
<joey> that's been many different contexts yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's that's that's the word i've i've </garnt>
<garnt> learned from hentai that i can all i can </garnt>
<connor> always go using daily life </connor>
<garnt> it's like the the [ __ ] they're gone </garnt>
<garnt> drinking with the [ __ ] coffee </garnt>
<garnt> watching subtitles anime with no </garnt>
<connor> subtitles watching </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> yeah the voice acting is just [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> stellar man i i yeah dude </connor>
<connor> was like castlevania we would i would </connor>
<garnt> only be watching dubbed out i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> do you think it's it played a massive </garnt>
<connor> part to i i assume it's a big part of it </connor>
<connor> is because it was dubbed first in </connor>
<connor> english rather than </connor>
<joey> uh rather than dubbed from japanese to </joey>
<garnt> english is there a japanese top four i'm </garnt>
<garnt> pretty sure be i've never seen it in </garnt>
<joey> japanese </joey>
<connor> i don't know if i'll be able to when you </connor>
<connor> watch when you watch the dub it's so </connor>
<connor> goddamn good it's actually a shame to </connor>
<connor> watch it in any other language yeah </connor>
<connor> maybe this is how japanese people feel </connor>
<connor> with something yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> we'd have a choice but when we have a </connor>
<connor> choice why would you you know you know </connor>
<connor> pick the one thing that is best right </connor>
<connor> yeah and uh this is definitely one of </connor>
<connor> those shows where i'm like it's it's </connor>
<connor> it's not even a competition yeah because </connor>
<joey> like then obviously it was yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because when i watched season one i was </joey>
<connor> like all right well the default is in </connor>
<connor> english yeah because it's an english </connor>
<joey> production all right i'll watch episode </joey>
<joey> one if this is </joey>
<joey> you know voice acting is kind of subpar </joey>
<joey> then whatever i'll change it yeah but </joey>
<joey> literally first five minutes i was like </joey>
<joey> all right english then all right so this </joey>
<connor> is this is it's fantastic it's like an </connor>
<connor> anime that is written with kind of </connor>
<joey> pretty pretty [ __ ] good american i </joey>
<joey> would say that's american writers right </joey>
<joey> so i feel like it's it's a lot easier </joey>
<connor> for the actors to because it's like very </connor>
<joey> scripted yeah because the dialogue is </joey>
<garnt> like very witty and very soft </garnt>
<garnt> because you hear the dialogue and it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't feel like anime dialogue it's so </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] funny it's good it's very very </joey>
<joey> witty and like facetious </joey>
<garnt> it's just like it </garnt>
<garnt> it's so rare to find an anime dub where </garnt>
<connor> people actually swear you know like i </connor>
<connor> can count them on one hand you know when </connor>
<garnt> someone says [ __ ] or [ __ ] i'm like oh </garnt>
<connor> oh this this stuff's going hard no we're </connor>
<connor> not in japan anymore </connor>
<connor> yeah so like hearing hearing it just </connor>
<connor> like said so naturally you know like </connor>
<connor> like any like talk to any other brit or </connor>
<connor> aussie you know it's it's it's it's </connor>
<connor> something that's like just ingrained </connor>
<garnt> into our speech if you listen to trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste you'd [ __ ] know that </garnt>
<joey> um but it's crazy because it doesn't </joey>
<garnt> feel forced no no yeah because there's a </garnt>
<joey> lot of times where they're like we're </joey>
<connor> gonna be a little uh explicit just just </connor>
<connor> to you know be like oh edgy and </connor>
<connor> everything but in castlevania it's like </connor>
<joey> yeah i can imagine that yeah yeah that </joey>
<garnt> would totally say that because like when </garnt>
<garnt> you hear it in an anime or like an anime </garnt>
<connor> video game because i remember the most </connor>
<connor> recent example i can think of is playing </connor>
<connor> persona five of dubs and hearing </connor>
<garnt> ryuji say [ __ ] i'm just like eugene wash </garnt>
<garnt> your mouth sir you want us a child </garnt>
<connor> excuse me </connor>
<connor> when trevor belmont's like oh for [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> sake yeah </connor>
<joey> it's so good dude i [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> everything about that like i feel like </connor>
<connor> even though it gets a lot of good good </connor>
<connor> you know people say it's very good i </connor>
<connor> feel like it should be way bigger than </connor>
<connor> it is it's genuinely like </connor>
<joey> one of my favorite animes that i've </joey>
<joey> watched in the past like yeah i i i </joey>
<joey> really it's really it's really yeah i </joey>
<joey> can't wait to watch season four fully </joey>
<joey> and yeah i really need to you're gonna </joey>
<garnt> be like all right okay hold up i mean i </garnt>
<joey> mean for me right now it doesn't even </joey>
<joey> feel like an anime you know it's </joey>
<joey> i mean i mean it's like it's it's an </joey>
<garnt> american production obviously it's kind </garnt>
<joey> of like we're about to get into that </joey>
<joey> it feels in the same area as uh avatar </joey>
<joey> avatar yeah yeah then i also consider </joey>
<connor> avatar anime i mean japanese people </connor>
<connor> consider it anime it's anime like i </connor>
<joey> didn't know i started anime until i </joey>
<joey> actually watched all of avatar and i'm </joey>
<joey> like okay i can see where this argument </joey>
<garnt> never ends yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> you know with this we're getting into </garnt>
<joey> semantics you know it's it's it's </joey>
<joey> whatever because the only thing i would </joey>
<joey> say </joey>
<joey> it's fantastic yeah anime or no it's </joey>
<joey> fantastic i don't give a [ __ ] if you </joey>
<joey> think it's it's an anime or not it's </joey>
<joey> just a fantastic show in general all i </joey>
<garnt> was trying to say is like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think people </garnt>
<garnt> more people in the anime community are </garnt>
<garnt> talking about it's just because it feels </garnt>
<connor> different yeah yeah yeah yeah let me </connor>
<joey> feel let me give you an anecdotal story </joey>
<joey> i was talking to a guy and i asked him i </joey>
<joey> was like which animes do you like and he </joey>
<joey> goes </joey>
<joey> one anime that i watched recently that i </joey>
<joey> really like this is all japanese like i </joey>
<joey> recently watched despicable me 2. it was </joey>
<joey> one of my favorite animes of recent and </joey>
<joey> i was like </joey>
<joey> that completely hold up maybe it made me </joey>
<joey> it made me realign this whole argument </joey>
<joey> of like is that is this anime is this </joey>
<joey> not i'm like listen this guy dead ass </joey>
<joey> this otaku self-proclaimed attack who </joey>
<connor> told me despicable me is a good anime </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<garnt> you know what why are we arguing </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's like i think it's a stupid </garnt>
<connor> argument this is a clown argument yeah i </connor>
<joey> just killed the argument it's literally </joey>
<joey> just like the west versus the west yeah </joey>
<joey> we made this argument out of nothing </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah the japanese are like </joey>
<garnt> we're not we're not part of this </garnt>
<connor> it's that simpsons picture where like </connor>
<connor> the people are surrounding the two </connor>
<connor> monkeys fighting that's that's that's </connor>
<garnt> the japanese watching anime fans argue </garnt>
<connor> about if this is anime i felt like we </connor>
<garnt> were like this is how all religious </garnt>
<garnt> fighting started right yeah like the </garnt>
<garnt> 100th century </garnt>
<connor> we just made we just made an argument </connor>
<joey> out of nothing </joey>
<joey> because yeah because i mean [ __ ] you </joey>
<connor> ask a japanese person monster zinc shrek </connor>
<connor> it's all anime it's just crazy to me </connor>
<joey> because in japan anime just means </joey>
<joey> animation i've never just had like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] hi i got hit by a truck when he </connor>
<joey> said despicable me as an animator it hit </joey>
<connor> me man it hit me real like [ __ ] i was </connor>
<connor> like this man's built different saying </connor>
<joey> that right yeah yeah definitely a </joey>
<joey> different story if you was like the </joey>
<joey> minions of my waifu like that would have </joey>
<garnt> been different dude i don't know i don't </garnt>
<connor> know why they obsessed with minions </connor>
<connor> you're obsessed with indians in japan </connor>
<garnt> it's [ __ ] everywhere i hate it so we </garnt>
<joey> visited joey's new apartment like last </joey>
<joey> week yeah and uh joey just like youtube </joey>
<joey> yeah joe's slight detour it will get </joey>
<joey> back on topic because he was showing us </joey>
<joey> around he shows us into the last room </joey>

<garnt> rid of that [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> we're doing you a favor yeah it was </garnt>
<joey> despicable oh my god i'm break time </joey>
<joey> this episode is sponsored by vessy </joey>
<connor> you're probably wondering what is versi </connor>
<connor> well i'm glad to answer that question </connor>
<connor> it's a comfortable stylish everyday </connor>
<connor> sneaker that you can wear even in winter </connor>
<connor> and the best part about it is that it's </connor>
<connor> waterproof 100 waterproof shoes yes and </connor>
<connor> one of the best parts about vessi is </connor>
<connor> that it is super easy to clean just toss </connor>
<connor> on some water to it or throw it in the </connor>
<garnt> washing machine and it'll be brand new </garnt>
<garnt> vessy shoes are made via dimetex a dual </garnt>
<garnt> climate knit that keeps you cool in the </garnt>
<garnt> summer and warm in the winter it doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> feel like it should be waterproof at all </garnt>
<connor> and one of the best things about bessie </connor>
<connor> is that it just looks like an everyday </connor>
<connor> sneaker so you can just wear it every </connor>
<connor> single day and i'm very lazy and only </connor>
<connor> like to have like one pair of shoes to </connor>
<joey> wear so this is perfect for me plus </joey>
<joey> vessy shoes are sustainably made with </joey>
<joey> less material waste less water waste and </joey>
<joey> no animal byproducts so you vegans can </joey>
<connor> enjoy these as well also personally and </connor>
<connor> i know the boys can relate it's rainy </connor>
<connor> season right now in japan and having a </connor>
<joey> shoe that's waterproof is very nice </joey>
<joey> because you don't have to worry about </joey>
<joey> those goddamn massive deceptive puddles </joey>
<connor> getting your shoes and socks worse than </connor>
<joey> a wet sock so if that sounds interesting </joey>
<garnt> to you check them out in the description </garnt>
<connor> or use coupon code trash taste to get 25 </connor>
<connor> off your vessy orders look at these boys </connor>
<connor> back to the episode speaking of another </connor>
<garnt> anime that has like really </garnt>
<garnt> unique voice actors in their cast are </garnt>
<garnt> you guys excited for eden </garnt>
<joey> yeah i am actually that is like one that </joey>
<garnt> i saw i saw little bits and pieces i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i knew of it because yeah a boy </garnt>
<garnt> care my boy kevin </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of those things that wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> really on my radar massively it was just </garnt>
<garnt> like i know kevin's doing the soundtrack </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm probably gonna watch so i could </garnt>
<garnt> be like great job kevin yeah i wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> excited until i saw the clips that we </garnt>
<garnt> were shown which is by the time this </garnt>
<garnt> podcast comes out the entire series </garnt>
<garnt> would have already been released right </garnt>
<garnt> but from the clips that we were shown i </garnt>
<garnt> was genuinely like surprised how excited </garnt>
<garnt> for this i was i wasn't that excited </garnt>
<joey> before because i didn't really know what </joey>
<joey> it was about or how you know good it was </joey>
<joey> going to be all i know were the names </joey>
<joey> involved and what stood out to me was of </joey>
<joey> course kevin doing the soundtrack so of </joey>
<joey> course i was always going to watch it </joey>
<joey> but then the cast list got released and </joey>
<joey> people like david tennant are in there </joey>
<joey> yeah neil patrick harris yeah i was like </joey>
<connor> what is going on </connor>
<connor> sorry my favorite movie my favorite </connor>
<connor> yeah it looks really good i mean the </connor>
<connor> clips we saw as well the animation </connor>
<connor> looked really [ __ ] good yeah like the </connor>
<connor> way they matched uh the 3d with the </connor>
<garnt> amazing 2d backgrounds yeah [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amazing and again the music we should </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] bang it yeah yeah i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> what else to say i kind of want to just </garnt>
<garnt> wait till i watch it i don't get too </garnt>
<garnt> hyped for it just in case okay but it </garnt>
<garnt> looked good it's literally out this week </garnt>
<connor> so yeah i feel like it's gonna be a </connor>
<connor> seven out of ten for me really i feel i </connor>
<garnt> get that maybe maybe i get that it </garnt>
<garnt> depends because it depends if it's like </garnt>
<garnt> how it's going to play out whether it's </garnt>
<garnt> going to be one long series because it's </garnt>
<garnt> a four episode series so is it going to </garnt>
<garnt> be only four episodes or is it gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of like a movie mini series </garnt>
<connor> kind of thing that's what i want to know </connor>
<garnt> i'm hoping it [ __ ] me up you know makes </garnt>
<garnt> me very emotional yeah but i have a </garnt>
<garnt> feeling i'm gonna play it really safe </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna be quite like a safe story </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i just </garnt>
<garnt> i just got that vibe from the clips we </garnt>
<connor> watched so we'll see i got that i might </connor>
<garnt> be pleasantly surprised i got that vibes </garnt>
<garnt> that i was going to fuel things by the </garnt>
<connor> end of it and </connor>
<connor> yeah the same way i did in the end of </connor>
<connor> monsters inc you know </connor>
<connor> i feel like that's what are you talking </connor>
<connor> about well when they finally you know </connor>
<connor> they got rid of randall then they're </connor>
<garnt> rascals and they say goodbye to them </garnt>
<connor> very much is a great match </connor>
<connor> that's a terrible example </connor>
<garnt> i was just like if there's anything like </garnt>
<connor> monsters saying i'm gonna be happy as </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm only thinking of great movies </connor>
<garnt> right now but so i don't say the </garnt>
<connor> incredibles i'm like no that's fantastic </connor>
<connor> like i feel like they've i feel like </connor>
<connor> these are the movies that have just been </connor>
<joey> memes so much that you forget but </joey>
<connor> they're actually bad </connor>
<joey> point the point is is that i feel like </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<garnt> i again i want it to be a super </garnt>
<connor> emotional [ __ ] me out but i just kind </connor>
<connor> of got the feeling it looked really safe </connor>
<connor> but again yeah i hope it does yeah i'm </connor>
<garnt> just wondering watch it i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> wondering because it was a netflix </garnt>
<garnt> adaptation was it cast first in english </garnt>
<garnt> or was it dubbed first in english </garnt>
<garnt> because that's what i thought it was an </garnt>
<joey> original story i have a feeling it might </joey>
<garnt> have been cast first in english yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because these are some big [ __ ] names </garnt>
<connor> to put behind an anime and you don't </connor>
<connor> normally see these names unless it's </connor>
<connor> like a ghibli movie where disney is </connor>
<connor> dubbing it right so that's that's what </connor>
<connor> that's what that's what i'm most </connor>
<connor> interested about because we talked about </connor>
<garnt> how </garnt>
<garnt> you know in which order gets dubbed </garnt>
<garnt> really does i feel affects how a dub </garnt>
<connor> feels well it depends </connor>
<garnt> well what language is the script written </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly that's the big question </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you can't really </garnt>
<connor> write two scripts simultaneously that </connor>
<joey> are like one to one yeah so it's oh </joey>
<joey> especially when it comes to like english </joey>
<joey> in japan it's like fundamentally </joey>
<connor> completely different yeah where the </connor>
<garnt> sentence structure is opposite at times </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i think the more i learned japanese </garnt>
<garnt> the more i appreciate what translators </garnt>
<garnt> have to do and especially when it comes </garnt>
<garnt> to localization a dub by the same time </garnt>
<joey> the more i understand japanese the more </joey>
<joey> i'm just like man this just this just </joey>
<joey> doesn't give like i i get the </joey>
<joey> localization thing but there's just </joey>
<joey> sometimes a sentence just doesn't give </joey>
<connor> me the same feeling when i'm reading in </connor>
<joey> english versus hearing it in japanese </joey>
<connor> yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> yeah i think this is why when you first </connor>
<connor> start out as an anime fan you really </connor>
<connor> start to get into it you got this thing </connor>
<connor> where you're like i only want pure 100 </connor>
<connor> translation that's all i want don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] don't you dare change any of the </connor>
<connor> meanings of the words right i think when </connor>
<connor> you get when you get into it more and </connor>
<connor> you start you start watching a lot more </connor>
<connor> anime and then it becomes a bit tedious </connor>
<connor> to watch anime and you just kind of want </connor>
<connor> to watch it dubbed you kind of start to </connor>
<connor> appreciate when they appreciate it when </connor>
<connor> they just localize it and they do it </connor>
<joey> well yeah well it's also the fact that </joey>
<connor> sometimes there are just some you know </connor>
<joey> phrases and like you know meanings they </joey>
<connor> just don't translate at all right again </connor>
<connor> i mean like one of the best dabs of all </connor>
<connor> time back in it like there's a lot of </connor>
<joey> sentences that were just like changed to </joey>
<joey> an extent where it's not even remotely </joey>
<joey> what the guy said yeah but it's but it's </joey>
<joey> the same it makes sense contextually </joey>
<joey> yeah it's the same kind of feeling but </joey>
<joey> they've instead of playing it super safe </joey>
<joey> they were like no no we think we could </joey>
<joey> improve this for an english audience </joey>
<joey> which is a bold thing to do you know </joey>
<joey> we've had a lot of failures yeah we've </joey>
<joey> had a lot of uh </joey>
<garnt> things that have gone wrong questionable </garnt>
<garnt> but i do really appreciate when it's </garnt>
<garnt> done right and i appreciate it more so </garnt>
<garnt> than an attempted translation because i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like the actors have a way harder </garnt>
<connor> time because i bring japanese dialogue </connor>
<connor> essentially i mean that's what they do </connor>
<joey> yeah because it's really hard to also </joey>
<joey> perform directly translated to japanese </joey>
<connor> dialogue to make it sound natural in </connor>
<connor> english because there's sometimes where </connor>
<connor> it's like that doesn't sound like </connor>
<joey> something someone would say in english </joey>
<joey> yeah you know like i especially felt </joey>
<connor> that more when i because like when i did </connor>
<connor> like a bit of translation work during </connor>
<connor> like school and stuff like that and i </connor>
<connor> like learnt linguistics and stuff like </connor>
<connor> that's where i was like because i also </connor>
<connor> used to be like how hard could it be </connor>
<connor> just like direct translating you know to </connor>
<connor> get the meaning across but then when i </connor>
<connor> actually started doing i was like oh no </connor>
<connor> you just can't like it's not a matter of </connor>
<connor> like preference or anything like that </connor>
<connor> it's just like you physically can't </connor>
<connor> there were just some japanese like ways </connor>
<joey> of saying things that were just like if </joey>
<joey> i did directly translate it it would </joey>
<connor> just be a bunch of words yeah </connor>
<connor> i think because i don't know if uh </connor>
<connor> even though i spoke </connor>
<connor> two languages from birth </connor>
<connor> i always thought as languages as like </connor>
<connor> they're all just the same thing just </connor>
<joey> said in different ways but then like if </joey>
<garnt> that makes sense where everything can be </garnt>
<garnt> one-to-one translation </garnt>
<garnt> everyone i i can't wait </garnt>
<joey> yeah absolutely and i think because </joey>
<joey> we've been spoiled because things have </joey>
<garnt> been our whole life we've just had </garnt>
<garnt> things that haven't been </garnt>
<garnt> read english so we've never known what </garnt>
<garnt> the other side is english it's been </garnt>
<joey> translated for us and even again even </joey>
<joey> though i spoke two languages i could </joey>
<joey> never wrap my head around this concept </joey>
<joey> until i started learning japanese yeah </joey>
<joey> where i was like oh it's just like </joey>
<connor> it's it's like another planet where it </connor>
<connor> hasn't even touched anything i don't </connor>
<connor> know how to i don't know how to describe </connor>
<garnt> that describe this like mentality it's </garnt>
<garnt> so hard to describe for someone who only </garnt>
<garnt> speaks one language right because i </garnt>
<garnt> remember the first time i noticed this </garnt>
<garnt> was i was watching a thai film with </garnt>
<garnt> sydney right and i you know she </garnt>
<garnt> obviously had english subtitles on and </garnt>
<joey> as someone who you know speaks both and </joey>
<joey> can read english it was really </joey>
<joey> distracting one because </joey>
<joey> it felt like i was hearing something and </joey>
<joey> seeing something and they both meant the </joey>
<joey> same thing but they felt different for </joey>
<connor> me it's it's it's this it's this </connor>
<joey> language dissonance that i can't quite </joey>
<connor> describe right but yeah but it's it's </connor>
<connor> something that i think i feel like </connor>
<connor> having now trying to learn the language </connor>
<connor> that you know part of part of a culture </connor>
<connor> and part of like i mean like an entire </connor>
<connor> country's you know way of thinking and </connor>
<connor> culture is just ingrained into a </connor>
<connor> language just it's just so much deeper </connor>
<connor> than just i say one thing it means </connor>
<connor> another thing like </connor>
<connor> i would say that depending on what </connor>
<connor> depending on what language i speak my </connor>
<connor> personality kind of shifts as well </connor>
<connor> because it's it's a different it's a </connor>
<connor> different kind of way of thinking when </connor>
<garnt> you're speaking another language it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's so hard to describe for anyone </garnt>
<garnt> who only speaks one language but anyone </garnt>
<garnt> who does speak two languages will </garnt>
<garnt> probably understand that you probably </garnt>
<garnt> have a slightly different personality </garnt>
<garnt> speaking one language compared to </garnt>
<joey> another because i apparently have a </joey>
<joey> completely different personality when i </joey>
<connor> speak japanese compared to english </connor>
<garnt> you're a lot softer i'd say yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you're a lot smaller english japanese </garnt>
<joey> japanese really i think so i always </joey>
<garnt> thought it was the opposite i don't </garnt>
<connor> maybe i don't know </connor>
<connor> i don't know yeah but like i i i also </connor>
<connor> realize as well because you know </connor>
<connor> sometimes you're in you're in class or </connor>
<joey> whatever you're asking oh what is how do </joey>
<joey> i say this in japanese like no you can't </joey>
<joey> you can't say that in japanese it </joey>
<joey> doesn't exist in japanese yeah it's not </joey>
<joey> a concept yeah they've never thought of </joey>
<joey> that yeah oh god you just [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> flashback to me in school everyone being </connor>
<connor> like how do you say [ __ ] in japanese </connor>
<connor> okay how do i explain </connor>
<connor> yeah and then like i realized because </connor>
<connor> welsh and english because although </connor>
<connor> they are entirely different languages </connor>
<joey> and everyone thinks oh they're just oh </joey>
<joey> while she's just another version of </joey>
<joey> english </joey>
<joey> it's like completely different it's you </joey>
<joey> know but you're in the uk </joey>
<joey> like german is closer to english than </joey>
<joey> welshes like um </joey>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> it it's the reason why i think that i </connor>
<connor> never had this realization before was </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> it's the culture that you grew up in </connor>
<connor> yeah and because the countries are have </connor>
<connor> a similar culture now at least in the </connor>
<garnt> modern day the concepts do sort of </garnt>
<connor> translate because we've made them </connor>
<connor> translate like we've made the concept of </connor>
<connor> felt by both and so </connor>
<joey> there isn't there isn't like the </joey>
<joey> cultural gap right right because the </joey>
<joey> cultural gap is like inherently there's </joey>
<connor> just sayings and stuff that will never </connor>
<connor> ever have a meaning no matter how much </connor>
<connor> you try and translate them no because </connor>
<connor> it's just an inherent it's a feeling and </connor>
<connor> it's a i don't know this is just a weird </connor>
<connor> the concept that we're going down and it </connor>
<connor> seems so obvious </connor>
<garnt> none of us none of us are linguists this </garnt>
<connor> is this is all just our thoughts from </connor>
<connor> learning a different language from </connor>
<connor> speaking multiple languages um but i </connor>
<connor> think the best thought experiment i can </connor>
<connor> think of is like any anyone who speaks </connor>
<connor> english like how would you explain the </connor>
<connor> concept of the word [ __ ] to someone who </connor>
<connor> doesn't speak english and someone who </connor>
<connor> didn't grow up here yeah </connor>
<connor> that's like it's it's so i did i don't </connor>
<connor> even know where i would begin to start </connor>
<connor> you know like </connor>
<connor> like if you didn't if you don't know </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> the you know if you didn't grow up in </connor>
<connor> the culture if you didn't grow up with </connor>
<garnt> people saying it around you see hearing </garnt>
<garnt> that word everywhere i'm just like how </garnt>
<garnt> do i explain the right way to use the </garnt>
<joey> word [ __ ] i mean i literally made a </joey>
<garnt> video with because they made an entire </garnt>
<joey> textbook purely for the word [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> it's like it's like a 70 page textbook </garnt>
<joey> that goes through all the different ways </joey>
<joey> you can use for yeah and like i thought </joey>
<garnt> it was a gag at first when i bought it </garnt>
<garnt> but then when i actually started reading </garnt>
<joey> i was like </joey>
<joey> okay that's how you explain it </joey>
<joey> apparently there is a way to explain it </joey>
<garnt> it just takes 70 pages and the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> it takes 70 pages just shows how </garnt>
<garnt> complicated it is even though for us </garnt>
<garnt> it's just second nature and it just </garnt>
<joey> makes sense right and like the opposite </joey>
<joey> can be said for like japanese to english </joey>
<joey> right like how do you explain to an </joey>
<joey> english speaker what yoroshuku means </joey>
<joey> because like it's it's a purely cultural </joey>
<joey> thing that like it makes complete sense </joey>
<joey> in japanese but then every time like </joey>
<joey> every time in anime they say like </joey>
<joey> yoroshu there's always a different way </joey>
<garnt> of that i mean it's a different way to </garnt>
<garnt> translate depending on the um context of </garnt>
<connor> the scene right yeah </connor>
<connor> what he's saying and then </connor>
<connor> like saying i guess so like i guess so </connor>
<connor> it's like it's not a thing in japanese </connor>
<connor> right translate it it's not yeah even </connor>
<connor> even in wash it's not yeah like it's </connor>
<connor> it's such an english thing that because </connor>
<garnt> none of the words mean what the </garnt>
<garnt> they mean all together yeah it's a weird </garnt>
<joey> concept that we just make up we do that </joey>
<garnt> with a lot i find that faster dude </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> i literally just learned that word today </garnt>
<garnt> man i can't even keep up with my own </garnt>
<garnt> language how the [ __ ] are japanese </garnt>
<garnt> people meant to keep up with my language </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<connor> but going back to anime yeah going back </connor>
<garnt> again i appreciate exactly so much more </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<connor> obviously i don't know if you i i </connor>
<connor> watched like two episodes of yasuke that </connor>
<connor> was that was pretty good the voice </connor>
<joey> acting i really enjoyed i need to watch </joey>
<joey> that as well um </joey>
<connor> from two episodes i wasn't really sold </connor>
<connor> on the story again i knew about the if </connor>
<connor> you don't know about yasuke the plot is </connor>
<connor> about essentially uh nobunaga uh way </connor>
<connor> back in the edo period uh had single </connor>
<connor> period single computer sorry singapore </connor>
<connor> period had uh </connor>
<connor> just met a black guy at a market and was </connor>
<joey> like i want him to fight for me yeah and </joey>
<joey> he was based on a real person as well </joey>
<connor> yeah and was one of his closest uh like </connor>
<connor> allies i guess he was very and the story </connor>
<connor> kind of explodes </connor>
<connor> expands on it but i saw a bunch of this </connor>
<connor> on youtube yeah i thought this would be </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] badass anime [ __ ] you're not </connor>
<connor> like two weeks later got announced on </connor>
<connor> netflix and i was like wow i guess i </connor>
<connor> should start wishing for things yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah it was really it's really there's i </joey>
<connor> highly encourage you to go read up about </connor>
<connor> it it's super interesting </connor>
<joey> and you just wouldn't expect it it's uh </joey>
<connor> it's also done by sean thompson </connor>
<garnt> thomas yeah i don't know who the </garnt>
<garnt> animation studio is but oh is it map but </garnt>
<connor> i do think that </connor>
<connor> if you want to learn act this is not </connor>
<garnt> like the best at explaining at least </garnt>
<garnt> from the first two episodes i was like </garnt>
<garnt> this is wildly different uh from because </garnt>
<garnt> i mean you said there was like magic </garnt>
<garnt> there's magic there's mechs and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like i'm like i'm pretty sure </garnt>
<garnt> that didn't exist in feudal japan well </garnt>
<joey> yeah i mean that was literally sean </joey>
<joey> thomas going [ __ ] it well yeah i get it </joey>
<joey> you're gonna throw everything in go </joey>
<joey> crazy with it </joey>
<connor> in some aspect i'm also like this is </connor>
<connor> such a [ __ ] badass story by itself </connor>
<connor> yeah that it doesn't need anything at it </connor>
<connor> it's so goddamn like the best parts of </connor>
<connor> like again i've only watched two out of </connor>
<connor> six the best parts the first two </connor>
<connor> episodes where the parts were like </connor>
<connor> pre because there's a there's a time </connor>
<connor> skip pre-time skip where there's like no </connor>
<connor> magic or [ __ ] where you're fighting sort </connor>
<garnt> of sword </garnt>
<garnt> yeah man-to-man combat it's so goddamn </garnt>
<garnt> good and the story and it builds on </garnt>
<garnt> although obviously because you know back </garnt>
<garnt> then it could be a lot of issues with </garnt>
<joey> race with that yeah of course yeah </joey>
<connor> actually of course yeah </connor>
<connor> they weren't too happy about it when </connor>
<connor> nobunaga was like this is my best friend </connor>
<connor> yeah um you know and building on that </connor>
<connor> was so interesting and i thought like </connor>
<connor> the best parts anime were that and uh </connor>
<connor> again yeah i the story is just so cool </connor>
<connor> like don't read up about it because </connor>
<connor> there's tons of youtube videos about it </connor>
<joey> i actually i actually like went and like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] researched so [ __ ] like the </connor>
<garnt> real life yesterday just because like i </garnt>
<garnt> had no fun it's a badass story oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's [ __ ] badass yeah yeah it's it </connor>
<connor> it's like it's just stupid it could be </connor>
<garnt> fictional like </garnt>
<garnt> you feel like the mech and magic aspects </garnt>
<garnt> added to that story or do you think it </garnt>
<connor> felt out for me personally i didn't </connor>
<garnt> really enjoy it like i wanted i was </garnt>
<garnt> hoping you just hope you you just wanted </garnt>
<garnt> the story </garnt>
<joey> you liked what i wanted you wanted like </joey>
<connor> a samurai champagne style like </connor>
<connor> that yeah yeah but then again like that </connor>
<connor> historically </connor>
<connor> well i mean there was a break dancing </connor>
<connor> samurai but i wanted magic in mexico </connor>
<joey> the music in the first two episodes is </joey>
<joey> pretty [ __ ] good yeah yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> really good the voice acting top [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> notch even in the japanese it's really </joey>
<joey> good and like uh you know even in the </joey>
<connor> japanese jazz game is played by a black </connor>
<connor> japanese guy which oh okay </connor>
<garnt> you know it's really cool seeing that </garnt>
<garnt> you know why why wouldn't you want that </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah i mean everything else about it </garnt>
<connor> i was digging everything i i you know i </connor>
<connor> haven't really been motivated to watch </connor>
<connor> the rest of it right i think that's </connor>
<connor> because the next thing is going to put </connor>
<joey> me off in the magic and stuff </joey>
<joey> i mean the short clips i watched of it </joey>
<joey> was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like i didn't realize it was like going </joey>
<joey> to be that [ __ ] bloody and gory as </joey>
<joey> well oh dude it's good like some of the </joey>
<connor> scenes like reminded me of like a 90s </connor>
<connor> over like ninja scrolls </connor>
<connor> yeah it was like kill build ninja scroll </connor>
<joey> like levels of like oh </joey>
<garnt> oh that's oh that's brutal it's so good </garnt>
<garnt> i love it yeah yeah i still haven't seen </garnt>
<garnt> it but i i don't check it out </garnt>
<garnt> i will definitely check it out you'll </garnt>
<connor> know if it's for you in the first two </connor>
<connor> episodes it's like i really like the </connor>
<connor> sean thomas's work anyway so i was going </connor>
<connor> to watch it </connor>
<connor> just it's just hard to find time with </connor>
<connor> all the [ __ ] anime are in the season </connor>
<connor> and everything right which you two don't </connor>
<connor> know about carl i've been meaning to </connor>
<connor> watch a bunch i mean they need to watch </connor>
<connor> 86. 86 is actually really yeah </connor>
<connor> i i </connor>
<connor> i probably say that's my </connor>
<connor> favorite oh i can't say favorite it's </connor>
<connor> hard it's it's definitely top top three </connor>
<connor> of my favorite anime out this season </connor>
<connor> right now </connor>
<connor> and it just it just feels good to have </connor>
<connor> an original mecca show that just gives </connor>
<connor> me the same feeling as like some of the </connor>
<connor> og mecha shows that made me really </connor>
<connor> really like the genre because it feels </connor>
<connor> like it's been so long since we've just </connor>
<connor> had a non-gundam </connor>
<connor> non-code geass or non-big franchise </connor>
<connor> mecha show that true has actually been </connor>
<connor> really really good because most of the </connor>
<connor> mecha shows i remember that's been </connor>
<connor> coming out recently have either been </connor>
<garnt> like darling in the franxx where i get </garnt>
<garnt> invested and it kind of does [ __ ] that </garnt>
<garnt> falls flat or like i really enjoyed </garnt>
<joey> great trigger is like let me introduce </joey>
<garnt> you </garnt>
<garnt> well then you've had things like uh sss </garnt>
<joey> grid man which [ __ ] amazing show but </joey>
<joey> it's like it's a mecca show but it's </joey>
<joey> also a bit togesatsu so it's not like </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's like it's like it's not </joey>
<joey> like a vanilla make </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> yeah but 86 you know gives me the same </joey>
<joey> feelings of when i was when i will first </joey>
<joey> watch code gas are seven all the mechs </joey>
<joey> that i watched in the mid-2000s that </joey>
<garnt> really made me love the [ __ ] genre um </garnt>
<garnt> it's still early days i don't know if </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna be like 24 episodes or 12 </garnt>
<garnt> episodes where there's gonna be a </garnt>
<garnt> complete </garnt>
<garnt> story i'm really hoping so but it's just </garnt>
<garnt> really really good </garnt>
<garnt> i mean </garnt>
<connor> do you know do you know the story of it </connor>
<connor> at all i don't want to know anything oh </connor>
<garnt> i've heard that that's good yeah i'm </garnt>
<joey> going to watch it yeah </joey>
<joey> just going to a blind is the best way i </joey>
<garnt> think i watched uh the way of the </garnt>
<garnt> husband on netflix as well i have the </garnt>
<garnt> house husband that's it yeah yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i enjoyed it a lot i thought it was very </garnt>
<joey> funny i was i haven't had an anime maybe </joey>
<connor> laugh out loud constantly it's fine it's </connor>
<joey> hilarious it's like two hours i mean </joey>
<connor> it's i thought it was gonna be like 10 </connor>
<connor> episodes 24 minutes but it's like five </connor>
<garnt> episodes of like 12 15 minutes yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> only saw three episodes i was like i got </garnt>
<garnt> the rest of the season to binge i didn't </garnt>
<connor> know it was only five episodes yeah okay </connor>
<connor> i kind of it kind of sucked that it </connor>
<connor> literally just like it was just ended </connor>
<connor> it was like this is less skit bye-bye </connor>
<connor> and then it was like there was no ending </connor>
<joey> or anything it wasn't right see you next </joey>
<connor> time or anything and there was it was </connor>
<connor> just like okay skid over go the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> home get out of here </connor>
<joey> because because each of the chapters in </joey>
<connor> the manga are really really short yeah </connor>
<connor> they're like maybe like five six pages </connor>
<connor> like max well i thought the pacing was </connor>
<garnt> fantastic um i know obviously it caused </garnt>
<connor> a lot of controversy with the animation </connor>
<garnt> yeah i saw a lot of people claiming on </garnt>
<garnt> twitter </garnt>
<connor> ah i just couldn't decide i flip-flopped </connor>
<connor> there were some sketches where i felt </connor>
<connor> they did it really good yeah and there </connor>
<connor> was somewhere i'm like holy [ __ ] this </connor>
<garnt> was so lazily done right and it depended </garnt>
<garnt> on the sketch well i think it just went </garnt>
<connor> down to the classification because i </connor>
<connor> think we've briefly talked about this in </connor>
<connor> trash days after that like my opinion of </connor>
<connor> it was that it's not so much an </connor>
<garnt> anime in the traditional sense where </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically just a motion comic it is </garnt>
<garnt> it is just a moment </garnt>
<garnt> that and advertises that yeah instead of </garnt>
<joey> but i i adapted i do yeah but i feel if </joey>
<garnt> you've labeled it as motion comic </garnt>
<joey> adaptation then i think less people </joey>
<joey> would have been interested in it right </joey>
<connor> unfortunately unfortunately but then </connor>
<garnt> also you said because i've set this </garnt>
<connor> expectation that this is going to be a </connor>
<garnt> thing that might happen because i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like it was that and it being on netflix </garnt>
<connor> as well netflix really picking this up </connor>
<connor> which gave it like people what </connor>
<connor> preconceived expectations because to me </connor>
<connor> i watched it i thought it was funny as </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i thought the animation worked for </garnt>
<connor> some of the jokes </connor>
<connor> like it's it's up there with like i </connor>
<garnt> thought it was just as funny as like </garnt>
<garnt> sakamoto for me if not funnier yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like it was so goddamn funny and it </garnt>
<garnt> scratched that itch that i didn't know i </garnt>
<connor> was longing for yeah i was every single </connor>
<connor> episode i was [ __ ] cackling laughing </connor>
<connor> out loud it's like that weird like </connor>
<connor> surrealist comedy right he's so good you </connor>
<joey> just don't know what's what he's going </joey>
<joey> to say next yeah </joey>
<connor> right and every time you feel like </connor>
<garnt> you've figured out how absurd he is he </garnt>
<joey> just does something else </joey>
<garnt> yeah he's [ __ ] funny if you have if </garnt>
<garnt> you haven't watched it please go and </garnt>
<garnt> watch it it's just about like a yakuza </garnt>
<connor> member who gets married and straightens </connor>
<garnt> out and has become a housewife yeah </garnt>
<connor> and yeah it's just really funny but </connor>
<connor> it would have been like a it would have </connor>
<connor> been a nine or a 10 for me if again like </connor>
<connor> i don't know if i don't really like the </connor>
<connor> the motion comic style </connor>
<garnt> well would you do you think it would </garnt>
<connor> have been funnier with say just mediocre </connor>
<connor> adaptation </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> mediocre animation so really genuinely </connor>
<connor> yeah because there was so little </connor>
<connor> animation on it anyway and there's just </connor>
<connor> times i'm like i wish they just did a </connor>
<garnt> little bit on this just to help sell the </garnt>
<connor> joke i i feel like the lack of animation </connor>
<joey> help sell some jokes if anything i agree </joey>
<joey> i agree some of them just just because </joey>
<garnt> it some of it just looked ridiculous and </garnt>
<connor> that to me just made it more funny </connor>
<connor> but imagine this anime in like nintendo </connor>
<garnt> style yeah but like name another comedy </garnt>
<connor> anime that's on niche joe level </connor>
<connor> there isn't but i'm just saying like if </connor>
<garnt> you had the choice </garnt>
<garnt> no if i had the choice between that i'd </garnt>
<connor> always go for [ __ ] nietzsche </connor>
<connor> animation even like corner super </connor>
<connor> animation right yeah because connoisseur </connor>
<connor> i think a lot of people underestimate </connor>
<connor> how good the character animation in </connor>
<connor> conor super is that really sold so much </connor>
<connor> of the voice acting performance where a </connor>
<connor> lot of other comedy anime i feel have </connor>
<connor> fallen flat because you have amazing </connor>
<connor> voice acting performance you have </connor>
<connor> amazing source material and the </connor>
<connor> animation is just like the okay </connor>
<garnt> okay animation everybody does nothing to </garnt>
<garnt> enhance these </garnt>
<connor> i think i was just shocked at how little </connor>
<garnt> there was yeah whereas with where the </garnt>
<garnt> house husband had amazing voice acting </garnt>
<garnt> obviously had amazing source material </garnt>
<garnt> and i feel like because they didn't try </garnt>
<garnt> it kind of like suited that comedy style </garnt>
<garnt> perfectly </garnt>
<garnt> right and and and and i feel like to me </garnt>
<garnt> if you couldn't have amazing animation i </garnt>
<garnt> would have preferred to have it have </garnt>
<garnt> like just not not even like bad </garnt>
<garnt> animation just like a very </garnt>
<garnt> unique style of limited animation that </garnt>
<garnt> really helps sell some of the weirder </garnt>
<garnt> and more ridiculous parts of the manga </garnt>
<garnt> because it is a ridiculous manga and i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like the animation style helped </garnt>
<garnt> incentuate some of the ridiculous </garnt>
<connor> moments to me yeah there's some moments </connor>
<connor> where i was like yeah okay this joke </connor>
<connor> works with this animation there's others </connor>
<connor> where i'm like yeah this really needed </connor>
<connor> more to help some of this joke i don't </connor>
<garnt> know that personally i feel like maybe a </garnt>
<garnt> mix could have like really really </garnt>
<connor> propelled it did you have you seen clips </connor>
<garnt> of the there's a japanese live-action </garnt>
<garnt> adaptation have you seen this i've seen </garnt>
<connor> it it's so bad it's it's so funny it's </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> it's it's tragic wait what's uh describe </connor>
<garnt> it to me it's just like okay the main </garnt>
<joey> guy it looks like a cosplay </joey>
<joey> it doesn't it is a cosplay yeah like it </joey>
<joey> looks like a cosplay not like an actual </joey>
<joey> actor and yeah huh like the guy </joey>
<connor> isn't like built enough </connor>
<joey> he's quite it is like formal alchemist </joey>
<connor> like that and then his friend oh </connor>
<connor> and then his friend in the anime who was </connor>
<connor> really young and supposed to be like the </connor>
<connor> young gang member yeah looks really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] old </connor>
<joey> and like </joey>
<joey> i mean i didn't watch it like fully i </joey>
<joey> only watched like clips of it on youtube </joey>
<connor> and i was like oh no </connor>
<connor> it's bad because i i there's like a </connor>
<connor> there's a i watch the same ski both of </connor>
<connor> them compared yeah like the the humor </connor>
<connor> just wasn't nearly as good in uh the </connor>
<connor> live action like the i don't know why i </connor>
<connor> feel like they didn't like because with </connor>
<garnt> animation you can really sell the </garnt>
<garnt> absurdity and then the like that's </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah but yeah but they didn't work </garnt>
<garnt> very well yeah yeah i feel like also </garnt>
<garnt> japanese acting and tv shows i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know how they are so bad but i've never </garnt>
<garnt> seen japanese acting in a tv show and </garnt>
<garnt> been like that's fantastic unless it's </garnt>
<connor> like ken watson literally he's the only </connor>
<connor> one yeah i feel bad saying that cause i </connor>
<connor> feel like there's such a broad statement </connor>
<connor> but i've i've watched so much japanese </connor>
<connor> tv and all the drama acting is appalling </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's not it's so bad yeah </garnt>
<garnt> especially in like the live action like </garnt>
<garnt> especially when a live-action anime </garnt>
<connor> adaptation of a japanese tv show or a </connor>
<connor> japanese anime it's it's always </connor>
<connor> it's so weird seeing live-action actors </connor>
<connor> try to act like anime characters or </connor>
<connor> doing like the anime style </connor>
<connor> because because you watch like korean </connor>
<connor> dramas and korean adaptations of stuff </connor>
<connor> and it's so much better korea like i </connor>
<connor> watched uh </connor>
<joey> like sweet home </joey>
<joey> uh the webtoon uh adaptation okay into </joey>
<joey> netflix and the actors were [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> amazing in it was a live action app it's </joey>
<joey> a live action and the actors </joey>
<joey> every single time i've watched a korean </joey>
<joey> movie or korean drama i'm always so </joey>
<joey> impressed at how [ __ ] good not not </joey>
<joey> saying that the acting isn't bad but </joey>
<joey> yeah i just thought for some reason i'm </joey>
<connor> like oh i've seen japanese acting it's </connor>
<joey> gonna be right yeah it's gonna be over </joey>
<connor> the top dramatic </connor>
<garnt> all the time it's like i mean i i feel </garnt>
<connor> like especially in recent years korean </connor>
<connor> movies and korean dramas and shows have </connor>
<connor> just like they they are like </connor>
<garnt> they are way ahead of like japanese </garnt>
<connor> j-dramas and dream movies i mean there's </connor>
<connor> so many movies where i'm like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> competitive english like [ __ ] something </connor>
<connor> like some of the like old boy is like i </connor>
<garnt> love that movie [ __ ] and that's like </garnt>
<connor> that's actually based on a manga did you </connor>
<connor> know i didn't yeah oh really yeah oh old </connor>
<garnt> boy was originally a manga oh i got </garnt>
<connor> adopted into a korean movie and like oh </connor>
<connor> that's cool that is that that movie is </connor>
<joey> like one of my favorite movies of all </joey>
<joey> time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> it's so goddamn good in that movie i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] said that photography is </joey>
<garnt> fantastic that's one of the greatest </garnt>
<garnt> foreign films of all time and it's so </garnt>
<garnt> you know it's so good you know it's up </garnt>
<garnt> there as with like parasites is like </garnt>
<garnt> from to me it's one of the best career </garnt>
<connor> korean movies i've seen so i've seen a </connor>
<connor> lot there are so many good korean movies </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and i feel like people are now just </connor>
<connor> figuring out that man koreans make good </connor>
<connor> movies yeah they're very good yeah train </connor>
<connor> to busan as well i remember the first </connor>
<connor> time fantastic first time watching train </connor>
<connor> to busan i was like i've seen zombie </connor>
<connor> movies i know how this works and for </connor>
<connor> some reason it didn't do like on like uh </connor>
<garnt> you know on paper it doesn't do that </garnt>
<garnt> much different to every other zombie </garnt>
<garnt> movie but it's just so [ __ ] good yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i i i can't pinpoint why it was so good </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just </garnt>
<connor> i don't know what it is like when i </connor>
<connor> watch japanese tv i feel like it's like </connor>
<connor> a pantomime you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> it does feel like it feels like that </connor>
<connor> level of acting where it's like is there </connor>
<connor> somebody behind me i better not look and </connor>
<connor> then no </connor>
<garnt> it's like because i feel i feel like </garnt>
<connor> with japanese acting it's it's very </connor>
<connor> reminiscent to anime or anime acting </connor>
<connor> which anime acting works for anime but </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't work for live-action acting </garnt>
<connor> at all yeah well i was asking some </connor>
<connor> friends i'm like oh i was like because i </connor>
<connor> was watching with them like oh are they </connor>
<connor> famous are they famous they're like oh </connor>
<connor> yeah they're a famous voice actor it's </connor>
<connor> like when you're a famous voice actor </connor>
<joey> you can get roles in tv shows yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's kind of strange because it's </joey>
<joey> normally the other way around yeah right </joey>
<joey> with uh you know western stuff and it's </joey>
<joey> just odd to think because i feel like </joey>
<joey> you know as someone who does voice </joey>
<joey> acting it does not translate to the like </joey>
<joey> irl </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> like it's a completely different skill </joey>
<joey> set yeah yeah i mean you </joey>
<joey> you understand the fundamentals of </joey>
<joey> acting but you know can you hit the mark </joey>
<joey> you know you're not being told how to </joey>
<joey> walk you're not being told how to act </joey>
<joey> physically yeah that's it you do have to </joey>
<garnt> learn that is separate </garnt>
<garnt> but there's a lot you don't think about </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah and it's interesting i i </garnt>
<garnt> just wonder why i sit there and i'm just </garnt>
<connor> confused i'm like why is japanese acting </connor>
<connor> like generally not as good and not not </connor>
<connor> saying that there's no there's zero </connor>
<connor> japanese good actors just saying in </connor>
<connor> general the tv production </connor>
<joey> is pretty lackluster i think maybe it's </joey>
<joey> because like </joey>
<joey> they don't really think of like the outs </joey>
<connor> like outside of japan movie industry as </connor>
<connor> much of a competition like they might </connor>
<connor> think it's like because you know with </connor>
<connor> like you know hollywood films or like </connor>
<connor> english-speaking films right like you're </connor>
<connor> not only competing with hollywood but </connor>
<connor> you're competing with literally every </connor>
<connor> other english-speaking country right </connor>
<connor> every other english speaking production </connor>
<connor> whereas i feel the japanese film </connor>
<joey> industry is kind of in its own bubble </joey>
<joey> but they're kind of just like no no </joey>
<joey> driving force there's no like driving </joey>
<joey> force like a threat to make them be like </joey>
<joey> we got to step up our game or like or </joey>
<joey> maybe the fact that like they're </joey>
<joey> probably like just unaware right they </joey>
<joey> probably just think like well you know </joey>
<joey> english-speaking productions and like </joey>
<joey> other productions that aren't japanese </joey>
<joey> do this in this way but for us this </joey>
<joey> works with our type of audience so </joey>
<joey> there's no like they they probably don't </joey>
<joey> even think this is bad acting right i'm </joey>
<connor> sure people are going to comment be like </connor>
<connor> there are so many good japanese films </connor>
<joey> there are a lot of good japanese films </joey>
<joey> but it's a lot rarer to find a really </joey>
<garnt> really good japanese they can't find a </garnt>
<joey> few in between yeah yeah because </joey>
<joey> especially in like j dramas i feel like </joey>
<garnt> even hot holy [ __ ] that's what i mean </garnt>
<connor> that's where you really i i feel like i </connor>
<garnt> feel you see the pinnacle yeah i i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like the right way to describe j dramas </garnt>
<connor> from like the majority i've watched is </connor>
<connor> just they are very campy yeah that's </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> right yeah yeah yeah everything is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] so campy and you know there </connor>
<connor> there's there's an audience for that and </connor>
<connor> there's like a um you know there's you </connor>
<garnt> know i do enjoy some j dramas but it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's less of i think this is a good </garnt>
<garnt> show and more just like i i can just get </garnt>
<garnt> behind this show you know i i like i </garnt>
<garnt> like whatever source material is </garnt>
<connor> adapting and also i don't frankly i </connor>
<connor> don't give a [ __ ] about cinematography </connor>
<connor> right i don't really care too much i'm </connor>
<joey> not very picky you know well that's good </joey>
<joey> because j drama has zero well that's </joey>
<joey> what we're going to say well j dramas </joey>
<joey> they shoot it like a [ __ ] like a </joey>
<connor> daytime tv commercial </connor>
<connor> why does it look like that like i never </connor>
<connor> thought i would give a [ __ ] about that </connor>
<garnt> until i watched jade </garnt>
<garnt> that's the point you don't give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> about cinematography until you use </garnt>
<garnt> something you see something that has no </garnt>
<connor> cinematography yeah right it's like what </connor>
<connor> are you gonna [ __ ] advertise me a </connor>
<connor> plunger that does four in one any second </connor>
<connor> now i'm waiting for it so how it's shot </connor>
<connor> it's ridiculous i don't know why it </connor>
<garnt> looks like that it's so weird yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like i've seen some youtube videos </garnt>
<garnt> with better cinematography than some of </garnt>
<garnt> the stuff out there in jade </garnt>
<connor> broad in japan channel yeah 100 percent </connor>
<joey> that'll make christmas day </joey>
<joey> that'll make up for the lack of his </joey>
<connor> signature </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean i i hate [ __ ] on it i </connor>
<connor> don't really know i don't really </connor>
<connor> understand why i don't really know if </connor>
<connor> they care i don't really know if there's </connor>
<connor> a want to improve i i just i </connor>
<garnt> just don't i just don't think the </garnt>
<joey> audience is there no no the audience </joey>
<connor> doesn't give a [ __ ] well it's normal i </connor>
<connor> mean i mean the majority of the </connor>
<connor> population he was older so yeah </connor>
<joey> generally i mean to be fair i have seen </joey>
<joey> a bunch of j dramas where the </joey>
<connor> cinematography is absolute ass but i've </connor>
<connor> still enjoyed it because the story was </connor>
<joey> just genuinely really really good yeah </joey>
<connor> and it wasn't until like it was like an </connor>
<joey> afterthought of like oh yeah that was a </joey>
<connor> good j drama but the cinematography was </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i saw this one and it was like i </connor>
<connor> think it was like a james bond show </connor>
<connor> and it was like a this japanese guy </connor>
<joey> looked like japanese george clooney it </joey>
<connor> was really cool really i mean holy [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> this guy's hot i think i know who you're </joey>
<joey> talking about actually yeah he's kind of </joey>
<connor> he looks kind of western he looks </connor>
<connor> western but he's but i looked it up and </connor>
<connor> he's a hundred percent japanese yeah but </connor>
<joey> he looks like george clooney if he was </joey>
<joey> japanese </joey>
<joey> and he was just like a no-nonsense </joey>
<joey> attitude guys like i'm coming to get the </joey>
<joey> information and just like beat this guy </joey>
<joey> up </joey>
<joey> but with just terrible lighting and </joey>
<joey> cinematography </joey>
<joey> but it was like really i don't know why </joey>
<joey> i'm talking about this i was just </joey>
<joey> fascinated by him i was like that meant </joey>
<joey> so goddamn hot good for him i wish i was </joey>
<joey> that because i've always because i've </joey>
<joey> had like the movie experience of wow </joey>
<connor> this movie has [ __ ] fantastic </connor>
<garnt> cinematography yeah unfortunately the </garnt>
<joey> rest of the movie is [ __ ] you know </joey>
<garnt> what was that what was that movie it was </garnt>
<garnt> a </garnt>
<joey> it was the something still water or </joey>
<joey> something where it's like </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> no no </joey>
<joey> it was originally supposed to be the </joey>
<garnt> bioshock movie but then they like </garnt>
<garnt> changed it halfway through </garnt>
<garnt> i have no </garnt>
<garnt> yeah let me look it up yeah i know </garnt>
<joey> exactly what it is but like the movie </joey>
<joey> had like the most like amazing [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> cinematography it looked </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] incredible like it was stylized </joey>
<garnt> perfectly </garnt>
<garnt> really creepy photography yeah look it </garnt>
<joey> up um yeah i mean i remember a cure for </joey>
<connor> wellness i haven't seen that movie yeah </connor>
<connor> that was those that's a horror movie </connor>
<connor> yeah the horror movie yeah for wellness </connor>
<connor> that was apparently that was originally </connor>
<garnt> supposed to be the bioshock movie and </garnt>
<garnt> you can tell nothing like bioshock no </garnt>
<joey> obviously they like completely change </joey>
<joey> the story once </joey>
<garnt> that threw me off when you said it's </garnt>
<joey> meant to be the bioshock movie and his </joey>
<joey> supposedly was supposed to be the </joey>
<joey> bioshock movie but then something </joey>
<joey> happened with lee gal d wise and they </joey>
<joey> were like all right time to rewrite the </joey>
<joey> story completely but like when you just </joey>
<joey> look at the cinematography and like the </joey>
<joey> sets and stuff like that i'm like okay i </joey>
<joey> can kind of see what they were going for </joey>
<joey> like this looks cool it's very stylized </joey>
<joey> cinematography is great unfortunately </joey>
<joey> the story was like </joey>
<joey> what like what the [ __ ] is happening </joey>
<joey> nothing makes sense characters were all </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> so like </joey>
<joey> that's when i got to the point i was </joey>
<joey> like would i have preferred this movie </joey>
<joey> if it had [ __ ] cinematography but a good </joey>
<joey> story versus great cinematography but a </joey>
<garnt> shoot story and this is like the </garnt>
<garnt> animation versus story debate the anime </garnt>
<joey> fans go through right like which do you </joey>
<joey> prefer </joey>
<garnt> i mean if you had to choose story story </garnt>
<joey> story like has to be well acted you know </joey>
<connor> you can't tell me on a bad story with </connor>
<connor> not with actors who don't sell the </connor>
<connor> moment for you right the room is pretty </connor>
<connor> good </connor>
<joey> yeah i mean no because like i i feel </joey>
<joey> like i guess watching a lot of j drums </joey>
<connor> reminds me of like the </connor>
<connor> old thai soap operas i would see my mom </connor>
<connor> watching and i'm just like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> is this mom like what the hell are you </connor>
<connor> watching i i feel like the indian shows </connor>
<connor> as well yeah i feel like that's just i </connor>
<connor> feel like that's just a </connor>
<connor> genre of itself where </connor>
<connor> you got like the campiest most melodrama </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] going on you don't know what's </connor>
<connor> going on you see out of context clips i </connor>
<joey> think i think even some korean dramas do </joey>
<joey> this as well it's just not as well known </joey>
<joey> like i remember seeing one clip where it </joey>
<joey> was a korean drama and somebody's </joey>
<joey> falling down the stairs no that's the </joey>
<joey> bollywood one right there i think that's </joey>
<joey> the </joey>
<garnt> takes this bollywood like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> cabbage of kimchi and just slaps this </garnt>
<garnt> guy with it </garnt>
<garnt> and i just like i just want to know the </garnt>
<garnt> context of this because context it just </garnt>
<joey> makes no sense we just have to remind </joey>
<joey> our audience that this is a korean </joey>
<garnt> production </garnt>
<joey> bring out the kimchi </joey>
<connor> didn't like uh didn't pewdiepie react to </connor>
<garnt> like a bollywood clip and then there was </garnt>
<garnt> like drama or something about it like </garnt>
<garnt> they're like </garnt>
<garnt> i swear there was draw i don't know if </garnt>
<garnt> man if i'm remembering this incorrectly </garnt>
<garnt> but like he there was like a clip that </garnt>
<connor> he reacted to and it was because there </connor>
<connor> was like a reaction image where she was </connor>
<connor> like oh and then it was like 20 shots of </connor>
<connor> it going </connor>
<joey> like zooming in yeah it's the woman </joey>
<joey> falling off like the bell straight right </joey>
<connor> is that oh i've seen that one the guy's </connor>
<connor> like slow motion trying to catch him but </connor>
<connor> like it's like going back and forth and </connor>
<garnt> it's like this woman's been in the air </garnt>
<joey> for five minutes </joey>
<garnt> it's the second floor why is this woman </garnt>
<joey> like literally [ __ ] air bending right </joey>
<connor> in front of my eyes </connor>
<connor> everyone's just like watching it in slow </connor>
<garnt> motion it's [ __ ] hilarious i love </garnt>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> i swear she got into some spat or </connor>
<garnt> something because of it you keep talking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah no that's what i i would love </garnt>
<connor> to react to indian like soap operas out </connor>
<connor> of context yeah i feel like there's </connor>
<garnt> every other soap opera and then there's </garnt>
<garnt> just indian soap operas oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> they take campiness to the next level </joey>
<garnt> and it's so amazing have you ever have </garnt>
<garnt> you ever seen like many bollywood movies </garnt>
<joey> there was a period in my life where i </joey>
<joey> tried to get into bollywood movies but </joey>

<connor> i watched it was because it was on the </connor>
<connor> imdb top 100 at the time right like what </connor>
<connor> is this and it's </connor>
<joey> it's a concept i feel like that was made </joey>
<joey> for indians right because it's a con </joey>
<joey> it's a film get this about engineers </joey>
<connor> and i think i think it was like actual i </connor>
<connor> can't remember if they were mechanical </connor>
<connor> engineers or electrical engineers it </connor>
<connor> doesn't matter they're engineers </connor>
<connor> it was just so weird seeing this </connor>

<connor> musicals i'm just like [ __ ] whatever </connor>
<joey> but then if you like like i could watch </joey>
<connor> like rocky horror like 30 times i feel </connor>
<garnt> like muse i feel like to me musical </garnt>
<joey> works well on like when it's a stage you </joey>
<connor> know when it's oh </connor>
<connor> it's a really really amazing experience </connor>
<joey> like i remember watching lesbians of </joey>
<joey> robs </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> miserables there's miserables um i </joey>
<joey> remember watching that uh in england at </joey>
<garnt> the west end [ __ ] amazing experience </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um and then i remember watching the </garnt>
<garnt> movie and i'm just like this is really </garnt>
<joey> boring i don't know i watched it for the </joey>
<connor> first time because like like pretty </connor>
<connor> recently just because aki was like oh </connor>
<connor> you have to watch it it's like you're </connor>
<connor> dead </connor>
<joey> it's great like i'm just like okay well </joey>
<connor> you know i always give musicals a go so </connor>
<connor> it's whatever this this might be the </connor>
<connor> rare time where like rocky horror where </connor>
<connor> it's like oh my [ __ ] fall in love </connor>
<joey> with it i'm just like </joey>
<joey> god damn they haven't stopped singing </joey>
<connor> for like two hours it just feels like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] quick time event like when </connor>
<connor> you're in a musical </connor>
<connor> it just feels like it doesn't [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> end it's like unskippable cut scenes and </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] it's like get the [ __ ] out of here </connor>
<joey> well what i like about like rocky horror </joey>
<joey> for instance right is that like one it's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] weird two it's [ __ ] tim curry </joey>
<joey> in like leggings which is just like </joey>
<joey> amazing just conceptually yeah but like </joey>
<joey> what i like about rocky hard compared to </joey>
<joey> like say like les les miserables is like </joey>
<joey> les miserables just like 90 singing and </joey>
<joey> then 10 dialogue whereas rocky horror is </joey>
<joey> like 50 50. so it's like you get the </joey>
<garnt> enjoyment of like an actual movie like </garnt>
<joey> type of story yeah but when it's every </joey>
<garnt> now and then it goes into like song but </garnt>
<joey> when i'm watching a musical i'm just </joey>
<joey> like just get to the story </joey>
<joey> why am i here i don't care about this </joey>
<garnt> song and dodge just get to the story </garnt>
<connor> give me the story the only time actually </connor>
<connor> i actually think i liked musical was um </connor>
<connor> what is it there's a </connor>
<connor> little little shop of horrors right that </connor>
<connor> has like a lot of music in it the one </connor>
<connor> with the big plan </connor>
<connor> oh yes yes yes that's musical right yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i think i like that because it </connor>
<connor> made the thing [ __ ] terrifying when </connor>
<joey> it started singing </joey>
<connor> i was like it sold me on the horror </connor>
<joey> because when there's this giant plant </joey>
<connor> puppet started singing i was getting </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] is it like a 15 year old kid like </connor>
<connor> hold on [ __ ] it's like the kind of like </connor>
<joey> jazzy style like yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's terrifying </garnt>
<connor> did you have uh did you ever watch bugs </connor>
<connor> me alone as a kid but what luckily </connor>
<connor> malone </connor>
<connor> i know the name yeah i don't know </connor>
<connor> anything about it though yeah it's uh i </connor>
<connor> i can't remember because i only have </connor>
<connor> vivid memories of watching as a kid all </connor>
<connor> i know it was like it's like set in like </connor>
<connor> you know in the prohibition era right uh </connor>
<connor> and it's about a bunch of people running </connor>
<connor> speakeasies but for some reason everyone </connor>
<connor> every one of the gangsters who are you </connor>
<connor> know who are in this movie everyone's </connor>
<connor> played by kids right and when they have </connor>
<connor> tommy guns </connor>
<connor> instead of firing bullets they fire like </connor>
<connor> a cream pie so whenever someone gets hit </connor>
<connor> by a cream pie in the face they're dead </connor>
<connor> it's like thinking back as a kid it's </connor>
<connor> the most like this is the weirdest fever </connor>
<garnt> dream i'm describing right now but it </garnt>
<garnt> exists this is right it sounds like a </garnt>
<joey> david lynch film you know it's like it's </joey>

<joey> who doesn't look at that trailer and </joey>
<joey> thinks </joey>
<connor> this looks like [ __ ] i'ma watch it you </connor>
<connor> know when you uh you just see ads so </connor>
<connor> often for something that you've decided </connor>
<connor> that you've decided you're gonna dislike </connor>
<connor> this thing before you even see anything </connor>
<connor> that was me with cats because it was </connor>
<connor> just everywhere it was so obnoxious and </connor>
<connor> they do that thing where like this has </connor>
<connor> never been done before yeah this is this </connor>
<connor> is literally never been done before like </connor>
<connor> they just say that about anything like </connor>
<connor> we've never had this we've never </connor>
<connor> experienced this we all felt amazing on </connor>
<joey> the set well the thing is with cats </joey>
<joey> the things with cats is that i've seen </joey>
<joey> it uh on stage before yeah and like i </joey>
<joey> actually thought not my favorite musical </joey>
<joey> but i was like okay out of all the </joey>
<joey> musicals i've seen on stage it's pretty </joey>
<joey> alright it's pretty decent like it's </joey>
<joey> good story the songs are pretty alright </joey>
<joey> but then when you watch that trailer and </joey>
<joey> you see the horrific things in that </joey>
<joey> trailer you're just like </joey>
<joey> well i've you have peaked my interest </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> yes [ __ ] green screen like huge </joey>
<joey> artists like on these like [ __ ] cat </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> basically these huge actors being </joey>
<connor> furries i swear there was like real </connor>
<joey> displays i spent those like really funny </joey>
<connor> like cached interviews </connor>
<joey> really well like the cast were like i </joey>
<connor> don't [ __ ] know </connor>
<connor> what do you want to say </connor>
<connor> i love it when actors like give </connor>
<connor> interviews and they just [ __ ] [ __ ] on </connor>
<joey> what they're in all i hope is like </joey>
<connor> there's something really cathartic about </connor>
<joey> it and like they're like yeah it shucks </joey>
<joey> like the [ __ ] robert patterson one </joey>
<connor> right yeah the wrong person is like i </connor>
<connor> can't [ __ ] twilight i can't [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> stand twilight like robert patterson </connor>
<connor> please have we spoke about this before </connor>
<garnt> the podcast </garnt>
<joey> yeah i think we're talking about him </joey>
<joey> friday well like </joey>
<joey> hated being in twilight and his </joey>
<garnt> interviews about it are so [ __ ] funny </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and please as well going uh like </garnt>
<garnt> daniel craig </garnt>
<garnt> in james bond did we talk about this i </garnt>
<garnt> don't remember literally can't remember </garnt>
<garnt> if we talked about apologies apologies </garnt>
<garnt> if we said it already sorry </garnt>
<garnt> we must spoke about it on set i think </garnt>
<garnt> because daniel craig hates being in </garnt>
<garnt> double 07 and james bond yeah the </garnt>
<garnt> interviews that he gave were so [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> funny well he did he said he did like a </connor>
<connor> quote where he said like i'd rather cut </connor>
<connor> myself than do another bond film </connor>
<connor> and then he did another bond </connor>
<connor> it's so funny it's just like </connor>
<connor> it's so tragic it's like imagine getting </connor>
<joey> hired back again by the people you're </joey>
<connor> just [ __ ] on yeah i would rather die </connor>
<joey> than work for you again </joey>
<connor> and they're like let's get them back </connor>
<connor> let's get this guy back </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> how out of options must they be </joey>
<connor> to have to like bring daniel craig back </connor>
<connor> here they must have thrown so much money </connor>
<joey> because i'm pretty sure he must have </joey>
<joey> signed a contract before otherwise is </joey>
<joey> this like really yeah because you know </joey>
<joey> once </joey>
<joey> if you break contract i'm pretty sure </joey>
<joey> that you're just like blacklisted from </joey>
<garnt> hollywood right because that's why no </garnt>
<joey> one's like no one really breaks contract </joey>
<joey> either that'll they must have given </joey>
<connor> daniel craig a fat [ __ ] paycheck i'm </connor>
<connor> sure they gave him a lot of money yeah </connor>
<joey> i'm pretty sure they just gave him a lot </joey>
<connor> of money didn't they have to do </connor>
<connor> something because he like in the which </connor>
<connor> which movie was it was it uh </connor>
<joey> what was the most recent film </joey>
<connor> uh there was one the one off the skyfall </connor>
<joey> right yeah the one up the sky there's </joey>
<garnt> one off the skyfall yeah </garnt>
<joey> god i'm so behind on my body well there </joey>
<connor> was there was one where in the casino </connor>
<connor> it was a casino scene it's knocking </connor>
<connor> around where he </connor>
<garnt> he </garnt>
<joey> was about to say </joey>
<connor> whether that one yeah </connor>
<connor> type and daniel craig gloves there was a </connor>
<connor> thing where they had to like cgi i think </connor>
<connor> gloves on or off of him because he just </connor>
<connor> left them on because he liked them or </connor>
<connor> something </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so yeah he bought he bought gloves </connor>
<connor> yeah before like filming and he really </connor>
<connor> wanted he really wanted to wear them and </connor>
<connor> so they had to like cgi the gloves off </connor>
<connor> of him </connor>
<connor> because he wanted to wear them is that </connor>
<connor> right can you google it it was something </connor>
<connor> like that where he was so [ __ ] done </connor>
<connor> with this [ __ ] that he impulse bought </connor>
<connor> gloves and was like i'm wearing them on </connor>
<connor> the film i don't give a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] just cgi them off of them see </joey>
<joey> jonathan like cracking their necks being </joey>
<connor> like all right </connor>
<connor> i couldn't do that just out of a </connor>
<connor> feeling horrible to the people who have </connor>
<connor> to work on that cgi but oh you've got to </connor>
<garnt> respect the level of i don't give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> that's just that's just a new level of </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just you don't give a [ __ ] you just </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] most passive aggressive way of </joey>
<joey> being like don't call me back please </joey>
<connor> you're literally on like a half a </connor>
<connor> billion dollar movie and you just don't </connor>
<joey> give a [ __ ] about wearing your like 20 </joey>
<joey> 200 gloves you're like ah who cares </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> it's just </joey>
<joey> it's also just like the choice of gloves </joey>
<joey> as well of all things you could have put </joey>
<joey> on it's just like the biggest [ __ ] you </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<connor> it's just i don't know what a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hilarious it's just so cathartic to just </connor>
<connor> hear this i don't know why it's so funny </connor>
<connor> just hearing individuals be like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you big movie corporation i'm going to </connor>
<connor> do what i want and then they just roll </connor>
<garnt> with it like i i guess we'll fix it in </garnt>
<garnt> post yeah i guess we can't </garnt>
<garnt> get him to take his gloves off </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> and he's in the new one as well and i </joey>
<joey> think the new one is supposedly his last </joey>
<joey> one yeah but it got delayed because </joey>
<joey> covered so pretty sure that's what they </joey>
<joey> said about skyfall as well yeah they </joey>
<joey> said that about last like three films </joey>
<joey> but they don't know who's going to </joey>
<joey> replace himself well that's so weird </joey>
<joey> right because i remember a time like you </joey>
<joey> know in like the late 90s early 2000s </joey>
<joey> where like i feel i feel every james </joey>
<joey> bond movie there was a different james </joey>
<joey> bond no they did like two or three i </joey>
<garnt> think each at least but i feel like they </garnt>
<garnt> were like replacing them like quicker </garnt>
<garnt> than daniel craig right no i mean </garnt>
<garnt> chris brosnan did a lot here's roswell </garnt>
<garnt> yeah maybe yeah but he probably also </garnt>
<joey> enjoyed it </joey>
<connor> okay maybe </connor>
<garnt> what else has daniel craig done apart </garnt>
<connor> from james bond he's done a few pretty </connor>
<connor> good films not i can't remember any off </connor>
<connor> the top of my head he did like </connor>
<connor> i really liked him in like layer cake </connor>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<connor> i like him in everything else but james </connor>
<connor> bond i think he's really good in </connor>
<garnt> everything but james bond yeah but i i </garnt>
<connor> feel like in layer cake he also just </connor>
<connor> played daniel craig right </connor>
<connor> he just kind of played james bond in a </connor>
<garnt> different skin you know it was </garnt>
<garnt> it it kind of very felt james bond it </garnt>
<joey> was daniel craig playing james blonde </joey>
<garnt> playing daniel yeah i feel like james </garnt>
<connor> bond is just an outdated archetype like </connor>
<garnt> i feel like it is you watch it nowadays </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like they've they've tried </garnt>
<garnt> their best to kind of introduce it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but it still feels like when they're </garnt>
<connor> trying to put like the playboy scenes in </connor>
<connor> you're like this is kind of cringe yeah </connor>
<joey> i don't know why but just seeing a guy </joey>
<joey> just go yes </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> it's a very stated archetype like i </garnt>
<garnt> can't imagine anyone like imagine if i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like my name's manny tappo </garnt>
<connor> tapper </connor>
<connor> with that outfit </connor>
<connor> you're wearing the turtlenecks </connor>
<garnt> well that's why i really enjoyed uh </garnt>
<garnt> king's name right </garnt>
<garnt> steve steve </garnt>
<joey> kingston was good until the second movie </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah that's why i really liked the </joey>
<joey> first movie because it completely just </joey>
<joey> like almost made fun of that like it was </joey>
<connor> really good i really liked it and then </connor>
<connor> and then it became the architect and </connor>
<joey> then it became the archetype yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly yeah so </joey>
<garnt> that was how the [ __ ] did we get on </garnt>
<garnt> about james bond films i don't [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> we're talking about musicals oh have you </connor>
<connor> ever seen the i was thinking about </connor>
<connor> musicals i was thinking about musicals i </connor>
<joey> actually liked the only ones i probably </joey>
<joey> actually like were </joey>
<connor> um the south park movie uh </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> did you guys ever see the book of mormon </connor>
<connor> live i've it's literally been the one </connor>
<connor> the musical that i've always wanted to </connor>
<connor> watch dude that's </connor>
<garnt> a [ __ ] amazing musical yeah and the </garnt>
<connor> reason i like those musicals is the </connor>
<joey> music is funny and it plays offline joke </joey>
<joey> and it doesn't it like i don't care </joey>
<joey> about the story i don't know </joey>
<connor> i don't care about the story of south </connor>
<connor> parks i i'm there for the jokes and that </connor>
<connor> helps add on to the jokes that's why </connor>
<connor> it's it's the only musical i can get </connor>
<connor> behind </connor>
<garnt> but yeah i'm i'm not really that much of </garnt>
<connor> a broadway or west end guy so i've </connor>
<connor> already seen him really really i thought </connor>
<connor> you seem like a broadway kind of </connor>
<garnt> gentleman can't stop you from singing </garnt>
<garnt> why do i seem like a theater kid to you </garnt>
<joey> have you ever been tempted to go watch </joey>
<joey> like the the anime like musicals have </joey>

<garnt> course </garnt>
<joey> yeah wow i mean it felt a lot longer </joey>
<garnt> than a year to be honest </garnt>
<garnt> i don't remember the studio being this </garnt>
<garnt> full you know i don't remember i don't </garnt>
<garnt> remember what it looked like before it's </garnt>
<joey> scary going back to like episode one </joey>
<garnt> yeah and being like it doesn't look like </garnt>
<garnt> the same room i'll tell you what </garnt>
<garnt> after you mentioned it on the trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste awards i remember looking at the </garnt>
<connor> first episode again as well and i forgot </connor>
<connor> that we originally had our camera all </connor>
<connor> the way back there </connor>
<connor> yeah so it kind of looked like you were </connor>
<connor> peeking through like like you know </connor>
<connor> you're peeking through being like oh </connor>
<connor> what are they getting onto and now it </connor>
<connor> just feels like way too close hello this </connor>
<garnt> is the new camera angle that we changed </garnt>
<joey> to you know </joey>
<joey> well like 30 episodes ago yeah just it </joey>
<garnt> just feels it just feels weird i forgot </garnt>
<joey> that we changed camera angles and the </joey>
<joey> different feeling that they gave off </joey>
<joey> um and yeah like i'm impressed how many </joey>
<garnt> guests we got this year as well </garnt>
<connor> that's uh yeah given the limited </connor>
<joey> circumstances of all nine of them </joey>
<garnt> yeah uh but yeah i'm sure chris will be </garnt>
<connor> on again yeah of course </connor>
<connor> no man i'm sure chris is going to come </connor>
<garnt> knocking on this is he going to be the </garnt>
<connor> first guest on in season two as well he </connor>
<garnt> said he wants to be </garnt>
<connor> just asserting dominance to every other </connor>
<connor> guest i don't see why not i didn't ask </connor>
<joey> what else is there to talk about with </joey>
<connor> chris what do you mean just have chris </connor>
<connor> on each insanity and shoes </connor>
<connor> chris christie makes funny moments by </connor>
<connor> being on your bully chris chris bully's </connor>
<garnt> ours you know that's a good deal looking </garnt>
<garnt> forward to what drip he's gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> wearing next after after winning laziest </garnt>
<joey> drip in season season one </joey>
<joey> he's you know like after that episode </joey>
<connor> goes on he's gonna be like oh </connor>
<joey> i gotta come with like a suit i told </joey>
<joey> chris i was like you won an award by the </joey>
<joey> way he's like you want two awards no no </joey>
<joey> no no he said and i was like oh yeah </joey>
<connor> you're one of the awards he's already </connor>
<connor> really i was like yeah yeah just one </connor>
<garnt> i was like [ __ ] off </garnt>
<connor> yeah but i guess uh yeah i guess by the </connor>
<connor> time you see us next week we'll be in a </connor>
<connor> hopefully brand new setup yeah it'll be </connor>
<connor> like a month for us we'll be like one </connor>
<garnt> week for you guys yeah sweet for you </garnt>
<garnt> guys yeah we want to remodel and uh </garnt>
<connor> change the setup a little bit get the </connor>
<garnt> angles down we're not gonna have like a </garnt>
<garnt> completely different setup right off the </garnt>
<garnt> bat i think it's it's gonna be similar </garnt>
<connor> to season one where we </connor>
<connor> kind of grow our set as the season goes </connor>
<connor> on you know i i feel i i like well you </connor>
<connor> haven't decided everything yet but we </connor>
<connor> have no idea what the new set's gonna </connor>
<connor> look like i wanna get all new figures </connor>
<joey> that's what i want that get rid of that </joey>
<joey> involves having another akihabara </joey>
<joey> special which is going to be pretty hard </joey>
<connor> right now considering yeah everything is </connor>
<connor> locked down </connor>
<connor> so maybe you'll have to wait a little </connor>
<connor> bit longer compared to season one to get </connor>
<connor> a new akihabara special um but we do </connor>
<connor> want to do one in the future </connor>
<connor> um apart from that i don't know what </connor>
<connor> other plans i'm i'm just excited to show </connor>
<connor> you guys like </connor>
<garnt> the new set though yeah and having a </garnt>
<garnt> proper trash taste office not just an </garnt>
<garnt> apartment that we just remodeled into a </garnt>
<joey> set i mean you'll get you guys will see </joey>
<joey> it in the after dark vlog i mean like </joey>
<joey> speaking of like there'll be way more </joey>
<joey> after content as well yeah </joey>
<garnt> we're gonna have two sets now so the </garnt>
<garnt> after dark specials aren't just going to </garnt>
<garnt> be trash taste 1.5 yeah oh yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> that's the main i think that's one of </garnt>
<garnt> the big reasons why we want to move is </garnt>
<garnt> just to allow us to make </garnt>
<connor> more yeah more content </connor>
<connor> because right now it's you know i mean </connor>
<joey> you can make content in this room i'm </joey>
<joey> sure we could but it's one of those </joey>
<joey> things where but at what cost well yeah </joey>
<connor> when you're in a room that you just </connor>
<connor> despise </connor>
<connor> yeah it's too cramped you don't want to </connor>
<connor> make like stuff you don't feel creative </connor>
<joey> you don't feel like you want to do </joey>
<joey> anything like you guys will see when we </joey>
<joey> vlog it but like behind the set is an </joey>
<connor> absolute mess and actually i mean the </connor>
<joey> set is a mess yeah the entire room is </joey>
<joey> the entire place is a mess everything </joey>
<garnt> the beauty of camera angles is </garnt>
<garnt> everything looks bigger but this is </garnt>
<garnt> it is not as neat as you think it is in </garnt>
<garnt> fact like i get actually like physically </garnt>
<garnt> embarrassed whenever a guest comes oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah that's pretty embarrassing yeah </joey>
<joey> because the one thing the one mutual </joey>
<joey> thing that every guest says is wow this </joey>
<joey> place is a lot smaller than it looks </joey>
<garnt> like yeah we know we know it's it's like </garnt>
<connor> you know when your mom comes in and your </connor>
<connor> room isn't tidy that's what i feel like </connor>
<connor> you know the first thing i feel like </connor>
<connor> saying is apologizing </connor>
<connor> and then the second thing is like </connor>
<connor> whoever has to explain to the guest that </connor>
<garnt> they're going to be sitting here and the </garnt>
<garnt> first thing you have to explain to them </garnt>
<garnt> is how to get here and you're just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh you just gotta go around the set i </garnt>
<garnt> think like you cannot see any of the </garnt>
<garnt> desk and we have three desks over there </garnt>
<garnt> yeah at the wall you can't see any of </garnt>
<connor> the desk my desk is a [ __ ] war zone </connor>
<garnt> that melee is turned into which would </garnt>
<garnt> you which was the guest that </garnt>
<connor> thought you had to go under again who </connor>
<joey> was that reyna oh yeah yeah i think it </joey>
<joey> was great enough there was so little </joey>
<joey> space reynolds literally thought that </joey>
<connor> you had to go under the table are they </connor>
<connor> honestly there's pretty more room under </connor>
<garnt> the table yeah honestly probably i don't </garnt>
<joey> know i can't believe there's less of a </joey>
<garnt> trippy hazard under here i can't fault </garnt>
<connor> her for thinking about honestly </connor>
<connor> yeah everything every the way we've done </connor>
<joey> it is all it works but it's literally </joey>
<joey> the meme of like the cheeto holding the </joey>
<joey> door along yeah yeah yeah yeah like </joey>
<joey> everything works </joey>
<joey> but it's not clean </joey>
<joey> it can be about like it looks good i'm </joey>
<joey> happy with how it look considering what </joey>
<connor> we've done it's the most scuffed way we </connor>
<connor> can of it looking as good as it does and </connor>
<connor> sounding as good as it does but yeah we </connor>
<connor> want to we already want to upgrade it </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> i don't know get a better system in </connor>
<connor> general just for everything have more </connor>
<connor> guests on you know have guests on after </connor>
<connor> dark you know just having everything </connor>
<connor> upgraded everything better you know and </connor>
<joey> uh you know it's because of you guys </joey>
<joey> that we're even able to [ __ ] move </joey>
<connor> toward you know yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> without the patreon stuff we would </connor>
<connor> definitely be able to consider the </connor>
<garnt> upgrades that we're doing absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> basically when we started this podcast </garnt>
<garnt> we we were just like what's the minimum </garnt>
<garnt> we can get away with in case this </garnt>
<garnt> podcast is like zero crashes just </garnt>
<connor> crashes and burns immediately yeah so we </connor>
<connor> planned this on like as much of a budget </connor>
<garnt> as much money as we were willing to put </garnt>
<connor> in yeah essentially yeah how much money </connor>
<connor> do we want to lose and then also hours </connor>
<connor> do we want to lose yeah exactly yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly but like yeah i mean again like </connor>
<connor> we said this in the previous episode </connor>
<joey> with the the trash taste awards </joey>
<joey> obviously but we're very we're very </joey>
<joey> grateful i think for the crazy amount of </joey>
<joey> support i think if you told us that we'd </joey>
<connor> be this close to a million subs after </connor>
<connor> one year i think we'd have been like </connor>
<garnt> funny that'd be like a thing </garnt>
<connor> a hundred thousand subs that's a success </connor>
<connor> because we only we only pushed this </connor>
<garnt> channel </garnt>
<garnt> like once twice on our main channels </garnt>
<garnt> yeah once in a at the end of the start </garnt>
<joey> of a video or end of a video and then </joey>
<joey> the happy and then the academic </joey>
<joey> especially considering it's everything </joey>
<joey> else is </joey>
<joey> driven by like twitter and you guys just </joey>
<joey> enjoying the show yes you guys spreading </joey>
<connor> the good word it's uh it's crazy man </connor>
<garnt> it's crazy to see it and it's like </garnt>
<garnt> because normally with a lot of podcasts </garnt>
<connor> i see you have like with big names in </connor>
<connor> them you have like the big announcements </connor>
<connor> so you've got the big trickle of views </connor>
<connor> yeah and then the view the view just </connor>
<connor> like drips down which is what i was </connor>
<connor> expecting and i wasn't expecting us to </connor>
<garnt> maintain like </garnt>
<garnt> the view count yeah for 50 episodes </garnt>
<garnt> it's also intimidating because now i </garnt>
<garnt> know that </garnt>
<connor> the stuff the dumb [ __ ] i say will be in </connor>
<connor> front of more people than ever yeah </connor>
<garnt> right yeah one thing one thing i </garnt>
<garnt> certainly was surprised by was just </garnt>
<garnt> like just realizing that some of the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] we say to each other people like </garnt>
<garnt> hundreds of thousands of people are now </garnt>
<connor> listening to you yeah </connor>
<garnt> i forget about everything i [ __ ] say </garnt>
<garnt> like same here all the dumb [ __ ] like i </garnt>
<garnt> got emailed today about baked beans </garnt>
<garnt> about one of the semi-baked beans i </garnt>
<joey> totally forgot i said i like baked beans </joey>
<joey> and someone's offering to send me a ton </joey>
<joey> of baked beans and i'm like i'm </joey>
<joey> flattered you can't say no to that </joey>
<connor> i just can't remember </connor>
<connor> why i said this i i've totally think </connor>
<joey> about this </joey>
<joey> just sounds like a random person wanting </joey>
<connor> to sing beans i know i went on the rant </connor>
<connor> about loving baked beans but that was </connor>
<garnt> one of those things where i'm very </garnt>
<garnt> passionate at the moment and then when i </garnt>
<joey> when i leave i totally forget that i had </joey>
<joey> a rant about it exactly yeah and i'm </joey>
<connor> like i did i did talk very passionately </connor>
<garnt> about baked beans that is me i feel </garnt>
<garnt> that's a lot of moments right i mean </garnt>
<connor> sometimes you just get passionate when </connor>
<connor> you're talking with your mates or when </connor>
<connor> you're in like a [ __ ] is it kaya or </connor>
<connor> having like an argument where it's not </connor>
<connor> really an argument and you're just </connor>
<garnt> you're just very passionate in the </garnt>
<connor> moment you reckon we'll get any comments </connor>
<connor> people like men </connor>
<joey> i like the old set more there's a better </joey>
<connor> vibe to it </connor>
<joey> well the table's gonna be the same i </joey>
<joey> stopped watching after season one </joey>
<connor> season one is when it went downhill yeah </connor>
<garnt> two is a real letter </garnt>
<connor> i mean essentially it's not too much is </connor>
<connor> going to change really </connor>
<garnt> really okay two two two </garnt>
<garnt> to like bring down expectations really </garnt>
<garnt> the reason we want to change </garnt>
<garnt> um change offices is because this is not </garnt>
<garnt> a convenient office at all um on camera </garnt>
<garnt> we don't want too much to change uh we </garnt>
<garnt> just want to work more comfortably </garnt>
<garnt> instead of having this like the most </garnt>
<garnt> jank [ __ ] setup for everything we do </garnt>
<garnt> i mean right now trash chase after dark </garnt>
<connor> is running off of my laptop okay there's </connor>
<garnt> five three giant ass hdmis going into </garnt>
<joey> this man's laptop yeah the cable </joey>
<joey> management is </joey>
<garnt> atrocious literally literally it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's a laptop that's sitting um that's </garnt>
<connor> like hooked up on a like on a foldable </connor>
<garnt> chair </garnt>
<garnt> that's like that's like connected with </garnt>
<garnt> wide internet that's just running in the </garnt>
<joey> middle of the floor that's that's it </joey>
<joey> that's that's trash tastes awesome it is </joey>
<joey> jank is fun that's because we can't </joey>
<garnt> afford more space right now so </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the most jank it's mostly for </garnt>
<connor> us </connor>
<connor> enough of us complaining about </connor>
<connor> our problems i guess </connor>
<garnt> uh everything should hopefully be better </garnt>
<garnt> we don't know because we haven't moved </garnt>
<connor> yet but we're hoping that everything </connor>
<connor> goes really smoothly </connor>
<garnt> offset i want to shout out to the </garnt>
