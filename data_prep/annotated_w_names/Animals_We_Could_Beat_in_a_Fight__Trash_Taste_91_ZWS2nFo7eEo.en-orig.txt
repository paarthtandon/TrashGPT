<joey> day is just cancel council council </joey>
<joey> council council council cancelled um so </joey>
<joey> how bad was the storm it was really </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] bad it was like </joey>
<connor> i've obviously not had much experience </connor>
<joey> in like cold weather and snow yeah so </joey>
<joey> this was the first time </joey>
<joey> this was the first time i'd ever been </joey>
<joey> like i guess caught in a snowstorm and i </joey>
<joey> remember um i remember when like during </joey>
<joey> the snowstorm we had to take a taxi to </joey>
<garnt> the airport because um all of the trains </garnt>
<garnt> had stopped running so it wasn't just </garnt>
<garnt> planes we were we were looking at oh can </garnt>
<garnt> we take you know the shinkansen or the </garnt>
<garnt> train back from hokkaido to tokyo nope </garnt>
<joey> everything everything was gone which </joey>
<joey> says a lot with hokkaido right because </joey>
<connor> like hokkaido is one of those places </connor>
<connor> where it snows so often yeah even like </connor>
<connor> just like a little bit of snow or like a </connor>
<connor> substantial amount of snow it's still </connor>
<joey> like yeah we'll just power through it </joey>
<connor> yeah unlike tokyo where it's like 10 </connor>
<joey> centimeters of snow stop the trains stop </joey>
<joey> everything bro the uk can't imagine man </joey>
<joey> the uk can't imagine right i remember we </joey>
<joey> we like constantly go through grit </joey>
<garnt> shortages in the uk because we're just </garnt>
<garnt> so ill prepared for just the tiniest bit </garnt>
<joey> of snow they always do this the exact </joey>
<connor> same speech every time </connor>
<joey> they were like why aren't the buses </joey>
<joey> running the buses were running during </joey>
<connor> world war ii and now they've stopped </connor>
<connor> because of a bit of snow what is this </connor>
<connor> but they do this every single time right </connor>
<joey> yes they say how dare the buses stop the </joey>
<joey> absolute state it's like what what </joey>
<joey> because another country attacks or </joey>
<garnt> because nature attacks yeah what do you </garnt>
<garnt> think is scarier nature </garnt>
<garnt> definitely yeah so i remember like i </garnt>
<garnt> remember during the snowstorm um i had </garnt>
<garnt> to go outside for just a few seconds um </garnt>
<garnt> to go to to go from my hotel front door </garnt>
<garnt> to the taxi in the road in front of me a </garnt>
<garnt> simple one to two minute walk you know </garnt>
<joey> ever we've all done it and i remember </joey>
<joey> thinking it's just a bit of snow it's </joey>
<joey> just a bit of wind i've handled that </joey>
<joey> before i go out and then i've never felt </joey>
<joey> like nature's just like beating the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> out of me just as soon as i stepped out </joey>
<joey> the door right </joey>
<joey> because like this snow i'm like i've </joey>
<joey> felt snow before it's like it's you know </joey>
<joey> i felt snow before it's soft it's fluffy </joey>
<joey> it's soft it's fluffy enough this snow </joey>
<joey> was like [ __ ] ice man yeah like the </joey>
<joey> wind had turned this soft fluffy snow </joey>
<joey> into like an into like a [ __ ] wmd or </joey>
<garnt> something like that </garnt>
<garnt> like my face literally like i felt like </garnt>
<garnt> my face was like getting cut from like </garnt>
<connor> the brief moment that i didn't have my </connor>
<garnt> hood up the weekend album </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah and so and seeing you caught in </joey>
<joey> like a pokemon attack yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> basically it like this was literally </garnt>
<garnt> just blizzard </garnt>
<joey> i could feel like the hail just like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] beating the [ __ ] out of my face </joey>
<joey> that 120 power point </joey>
<joey> oh like and it was even worse for sydney </joey>
<joey> as well because for some reason uh </joey>
<joey> sydney decided that she shouldn't bring </joey>
<joey> any footwear to hokkaido other than </joey>
<joey> heels so i mean it was like it was like </joey>
<joey> boots right but it was like boots with </joey>
<joey> like heels on them yeah yeah um that's </joey>
<garnt> uh like yeah i know i know i know you </garnt>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> what was she expecting up in hokkaido </joey>
<garnt> i think it's just been so long since </garnt>
<connor> she's seen snow right that she has </connor>
<garnt> forgotten what you know other </garnt>
<joey> well other environments it's like </joey>
<joey> wisconsin right doesn't it snow like a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] up always yeah it does it </garnt>
<garnt> does because i was i was just like i </garnt>
<garnt> remember asking her oh i remember </garnt>
<garnt> telling her oh i've never seen like snow </garnt>
<joey> like this in my life and she was like oh </joey>
<joey> it's been a long time and i was like so </joey>
<joey> it's been a long time for you and yet </joey>
<joey> you are still so </joey>
<joey> less prepared you're so prepared for </joey>
<joey> this weather </joey>
<joey> um but yeah i mean we just weren't </joey>
<joey> obviously we weren't expecting it to uh </joey>
<connor> be that harsh yeah the weather </connor>
<connor> conditions would be that hard so hard um </connor>
<connor> and yeah we had to stay in hokkaido </connor>
<connor> basically we were living out of an </connor>
<connor> airport hotel for two days uh because we </connor>
<connor> woke up the next day uh we i remember </connor>
<connor> because i messaged these guys uh guys </connor>
<connor> we're gonna have to possibly delay the </connor>
<connor> recording by like an hour or two maybe </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna get an early flight it's all </connor>
<connor> gonna be good it's only like the weather </connor>
<connor> forecast it's only scheduled for the </connor>
<connor> snow to be really bad on this day i wake </connor>
<connor> up i look out my window uh the </connor>
<connor> blizzard's still [ __ ] going </connor>
<connor> and i'm like guys the guys okay we okay </connor>
<connor> i can make it back i swear to god i can </connor>
<connor> make it back the flight's on cancel yeah </connor>
<connor> the flight sign council yeah and i </connor>
<connor> remember like trying to like reorganize </connor>
<connor> with these guys to be like okay i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna make it back on this hour i can </connor>
<connor> make back of this to the studio at this </connor>
<connor> hour we can record we can still stream </connor>
<connor> yeah it's all good it's all good it's </connor>
<connor> fixed guys we can still do trash days </connor>
<connor> yeah um and an hour passes and then </connor>
<connor> every flight is cancelled again </connor>
<connor> and in in the </connor>
<garnt> the defeated manner boys guy and going </garnt>
<garnt> like sorry boys i'll let you down i'll </garnt>
<joey> let you down boys i'll let you down it </joey>
<joey> wasn't so much you that let us down it </joey>
<connor> was the [ __ ] weather yeah like it </connor>
<connor> wasn't your fault </connor>
<joey> yeah and just fight through it yeah just </joey>
<garnt> walk back just walk back it's walkable </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like because like we've </garnt>
<garnt> been through hokkaido like a few times </garnt>
<garnt> before yeah and like i swear to god it </garnt>
<garnt> just like like sweating on every time </garnt>
<garnt> you go to hokkaido you're playing gacha </garnt>
<garnt> with the planes </garnt>
<garnt> right because a lot of planes get </garnt>
<garnt> cancelled like very frequently right </garnt>
<garnt> obviously not as not in this kind of </garnt>
<garnt> state where like literally the entire </garnt>
<garnt> airport was shut down but you're </garnt>
<garnt> normally playing gacha when you go to </garnt>
<garnt> hokkaido because one or two planes will </garnt>
<garnt> normally get cancelled or rescheduled or </garnt>
<joey> like heavily heavily delayed but then </joey>
<joey> that's when you discovered why </joey>
<joey> airport which is the airport in hokkaido </joey>
<garnt> is so well equipped right right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it is actually like chitose airport </garnt>
<joey> is like one of the best airports </joey>
<joey> i've been to in the world i think just </joey>
<joey> just i mean just with like how many </joey>
<garnt> restaurants and how many like resources </garnt>
<joey> are there there's basically like a </joey>
<joey> shopping mall inside the airport yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah basically because like </garnt>
<joey> because like the airports that stick out </joey>
<joey> to me are airports like singapore </joey>
<joey> airport yeah which is just that that's </joey>
<joey> like an amazing airport like uh the </joey>
<connor> hokkaido airport is more like </connor>
<connor> that's that's more like a shopping mall </connor>
<connor> with an airport attached to it yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah where most because most of the </connor>
<connor> stuff you see is before you go into the </connor>
<connor> departure zone whereas most airports </connor>
<connor> like it's the departure zone which </connor>
<connor> really has all of the restaurants all of </connor>
<connor> the shops and all the everything but </connor>
<connor> yeah in chitosa i mean there's even like </connor>
<joey> a uh there's even like a cinema there as </joey>
<connor> well yeah which uh there were there was </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i don't know yeah i mean </joey>
<connor> if you watch something i didn't the only </connor>
<connor> film they were playing was uh the jiu </connor>
<connor> jitsu tyson movie do this just go watch </connor>
<connor> it just go watch it i mean i i i i am </connor>
<connor> actually gonna go watch it this weekend </connor>
<connor> which is which is the only reason why i </connor>
<connor> didn't watch it when i was in </connor>
<connor> hokkaido um but yeah i mean i mean it </connor>
<connor> wasn't it wasn't too bad because of the </connor>
<connor> airport there luckily i was able to get </connor>
<joey> an air uh get a hotel at the airport </joey>
<joey> um it was just more annoying because </joey>
<joey> obviously i wanted to be back i wanted </joey>
<joey> to be working </joey>
<joey> um but yeah i mean that was there's not </joey>
<joey> there's not really much to say about it </joey>
<joey> i mean like i'm sure this is like every </joey>
<garnt> other day for a canadian yeah i like i </garnt>
<joey> remember like there's going to be a </joey>
<joey> million [ __ ] people in the comments </joey>
<connor> being like </connor>
<joey> imagine living with sort of that every </joey>
<connor> day of the week </connor>
<joey> yeah it was just weird just like because </joey>
<joey> i'm just used to no matter what happens </joey>
<joey> there's always kind of like a plan b </joey>
<joey> that you can fall back on a possible </joey>
<joey> plan b um but it was just the roads were </joey>
<garnt> closed airports were closed trains were </garnt>
<joey> closed so i was literally like stranded </joey>
<joey> you basically experienced quarantine </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah basically yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was basically stranded at the airport </garnt>
<garnt> and there was no plan b there wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> there was no services i could call to </garnt>
<garnt> get myself out of there to a place where </garnt>
<garnt> i could get some public transport to </garnt>
<connor> tokyo because did you go around uh </connor>
<connor> getting the shopping carts to get some </connor>
<connor> money together so you could buy a burger </connor>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> collecting </joey>
<garnt> plastic cans oh yeah so yeah so yeah i </garnt>
<connor> basically just lived the terminal except </connor>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> sorry unfortunately i wasn't tom hanks </joey>
<garnt> because like i think one of the craziest </garnt>
<joey> like weather phenomena i've been caught </joey>
<joey> up in was uh when i was in vegas and </joey>
<joey> they have dust storms there </joey>
<joey> dust storms yeah so basically just think </joey>
<joey> of a sandstorm but instead of the sand </joey>
<garnt> coming in from i've never even been in </garnt>
<garnt> the sandstorm right well i haven't been </garnt>
<garnt> in a sandstorm but i've been in a dust </garnt>
<joey> storm and it happens pretty frequently </joey>
<garnt> the difference between sand and dust uh </garnt>
<connor> i i don't i thought it was a sand storm </connor>
<connor> at first right but then everyone all my </connor>
<connor> friends were like oh it's a dust storm </connor>
<connor> coming and it's like a different </connor>
<connor> vernacular maybe or it's like maybe it's </connor>
<connor> not just sand maybe it's like sand and </connor>
<connor> all the crap like mixed into it but </connor>
<connor> basically </connor>
<connor> i was like i i was driving around in uh </connor>
<connor> in vegas you know just with a bunch of </connor>
<connor> friends and then like on the radio </connor>
<connor> because he had the radio on he just like </connor>
<connor> suddenly switches on and he's like oh </connor>
<connor> there's a dust storming coming um so </connor>
<connor> please you know please evacuate kind of </connor>
<connor> thing and i was [ __ ] my pants i was </connor>
<joey> like what the [ __ ] is a dust storm </joey>
<joey> and then uh but everyone else there the </joey>
<joey> locals just like oh yeah it happens </joey>
<joey> pretty frequently let's let's just go to </joey>
<joey> like a restaurant get something to eat </joey>
<joey> so uh so we we go into this restaurant </joey>
<joey> and then the dust storm hits and it's </joey>
<joey> like just yeah just think of like a </joey>
<joey> typhoon right so it's like just really </joey>
<joey> insane winds </joey>
<connor> but </connor>
<connor> you can't see outside like the whole </connor>
<connor> windows are like like nothing it's just </connor>
<joey> like all sand it's just like like it's </joey>
<joey> like a blizzard but instead of white </joey>
<connor> it's just like grayish brown it's like a </connor>
<joey> survival game yeah but what's more </joey>
<connor> terrifying in my opinion than a blizzard </connor>
<joey> is the fact that uh in a dust storm </joey>
<joey> it can cause static electricity oh so </joey>
<joey> basically you have like thunder strikes </joey>
<joey> at ground level </joey>
<joey> because of all the particles rubbing </joey>
<joey> together right so every now and then </joey>
<joey> it'll just be like blowing and then </joey>
<joey> you'll just hear this like boom sound </joey>
<joey> from outside and i'm like the [ __ ] is </joey>
<joey> happening it's like oh that's just the </joey>
<joey> electricity </joey>
<joey> it's like why are you saying it like oh </joey>
<joey> yeah that's just my friend like you know </joey>
<connor> like saying it so casually yeah um </connor>
<connor> yeah so that's really interesting yeah </connor>
<connor> so that entire time i was [ __ ] my </connor>
<connor> pants while we were in this uh </connor>
<connor> we're in this ramen shop because of </connor>
<connor> course they were like oh joe's japanese </connor>
<connor> let's just go to a japanese restaurant </connor>
<connor> i'm like yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm here all the way in vegas to go </joey>
<joey> eat some japanese sub-par japanese food </joey>
<joey> all right so we were so basically i was </joey>
<joey> stuck inside a ramen shop called naruto </joey>
<joey> are you serious i'm not even fronting </joey>
<garnt> it was called naruto they have like </garnt>
<joey> naruto like uh i mean they did that </joey>
<joey> oh yeah like the walls had like naruto </joey>
<connor> yeah and like i thought you could have </connor>
<joey> been named after the location no no no </joey>
<joey> it was uh and and the ramen it was very </joey>
<garnt> obvious they tried to replicate the </garnt>
<garnt> naruto ramen as best as they could right </garnt>
<garnt> to you know to to </garnt>
<garnt> not that great levels admittedly i think </garnt>
<connor> it was the most three out of ten ramen </connor>
<connor> i've ever had so i was like great i'm </connor>
<connor> stuck inside this [ __ ] restaurant </connor>
<connor> called naruto eating at this poor </connor>
<connor> restaurant getting destroyed i don't </connor>
<joey> think it exists anymore yeah so someone </joey>
<garnt> if it does exist sorry </garnt>
<garnt> most perfect moment of like the locals </garnt>
<garnt> going this guy's japanese he likes anime </garnt>
<connor> so i got the perfect one i saw the </connor>
<connor> episode and simpsons when they go to </connor>
<connor> america town in japan yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> basically </connor>
<joey> dude i mean the first thing the first </joey>
<connor> thing i ate when i went to america for </connor>
<connor> the first time which was the first ax i </connor>
<joey> ever went to my friends [ __ ] took me </joey>
<connor> to little tokyo and i was like bruh </connor>
<connor> everybody yeah every time you i've got </connor>
<connor> an ax everyone's got a little turkey </connor>
<joey> and then i had again some subpar ramen </joey>
<joey> and a little tokyo i was like yeah great </joey>
<joey> the fan this is the la experience i </joey>
<connor> wanted the only time i've ever seen a </connor>
<connor> natural phenomenon of what those uh i </connor>
<joey> saw sun in the uk one time </joey>
<joey> you were like oh i was like what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] i've seen fire tornadoes in </joey>
<garnt> australia what the [ __ ] is a fire truck </garnt>
<joey> we have it is in the uk </joey>
<joey> so you have tornadoes yeah and you have </joey>
<joey> bush fires yeah so what happens when a </joey>
<joey> tornado enters a bushfire </joey>
<garnt> you basically get this spiraling like </garnt>
<garnt> pillar of fire that's it </garnt>
<joey> it's [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> awesome to look at from a distance </connor>
<joey> these like u.s settlers must have been </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] confused </joey>
<connor> when all this [ __ ] was happening they </connor>
<connor> were like what the [ __ ] is happening i'm </connor>
<joey> pretty sure that's what the british saw </joey>
<connor> the first time yeah </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is that </connor>
<joey> the first time they found like the swamp </joey>
<joey> in florida they're like what yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> a bit humid in here </garnt>
<garnt> like australia is just like a real life </garnt>
<joey> island in one piece </joey>
<joey> it is an island on the ground line at </joey>
<garnt> this point you know because like the </garnt>
<garnt> survival instincts you need in this </garnt>
<garnt> island like that that's taking out most </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] pirates in one piece at this </garnt>
<connor> point imagine being the guy who has to </connor>
<connor> like write the guide that they send back </connor>
<connor> to like people are going to come again </connor>
<connor> it's like so so by the way you're not </connor>
<connor> going to believe this right you know how </connor>
<joey> it's sun sometimes right yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> that all the time all the time and </joey>
<connor> sometimes i don't know how this happened </connor>
<connor> it was just by a tornado i don't know </connor>
<joey> what a tornado is we've never seen one </joey>
<joey> of those yeah this is a tornado </joey>
<joey> it says but it's such a weird thing as </joey>
<joey> well because it's not like uh i i kind </joey>
<connor> of described it like there's a bush fire </connor>
<connor> and then a tornado comes along and like </connor>
<connor> eats up the fire it's also like the fire </connor>
<connor> is so strong that it basically creates </connor>
<connor> an up current that starts to spin and </connor>
<joey> then it just creates like this pillar of </joey>
<joey> fire </joey>
<joey> that just like crashes through this just </joey>
<garnt> sounds really cool to see it just sounds </garnt>
<joey> like a [ __ ] anime attack at this </joey>
<garnt> point </garnt>
<joey> like well like like i was like i was </joey>
<joey> like is there a pokemon battle happening </joey>
<garnt> over there like someone did firespin i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know like it's like two jitsu's </garnt>
<garnt> being combined together in naruto you </garnt>
<connor> know it's like </connor>
<connor> stomach after having that narration </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean i did i did see actually </garnt>
<joey> there recently like the uk or at least </joey>
<joey> london went through like a pretty bad </joey>
<joey> storm yeah yeah yeah um which i like i </joey>
<connor> don't know how bad it was because like </connor>

<garnt> a global scale there is videos of it </garnt>
<connor> picking up people and throwing them oh </connor>
<garnt> seriously yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah because when i saw that headline i </joey>
<joey> thought it was just like the british </joey>
<joey> over exaggerating it no dude as you guys </joey>
<joey> usually just like oh my my friend's 2p </joey>
<joey> fell off it's an absolute travesty like </joey>

<connor> around i was like oh my god </connor>
<connor> like like rip if you're trying to open </connor>
<connor> that car door man yeah trying to get </connor>
<garnt> that close </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like this okay so like this </garnt>
<garnt> just shows how unused we are to this </garnt>
<garnt> these kind of like weather systems and </garnt>
<garnt> weather phenomena right because like we </garnt>
<garnt> um we're like me and connor in like a </garnt>
<garnt> group chat of like our friends back in </garnt>
<garnt> the uk um and sometimes you know they're </garnt>
<connor> still meeting up and they're still </connor>
<garnt> planning meetups and everything like </garnt>
<garnt> that and i saw in this group chat that </garnt>
<garnt> they had planned a meet-up or to hang </garnt>
<garnt> out on this day </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember like right up to like the </garnt>
<joey> last moment people were just like oh </joey>
<joey> yeah i'll see you guys in an hour i'll </joey>
<joey> see you guys now right we're still </joey>
<joey> meeting in an hour and people like yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i'll see you in an hour and then </joey>
<joey> you just see you just see this the </joey>
<joey> replies going yeah let's maybe not meet </joey>
<joey> up today maybe that's not the best idea </joey>
<joey> but like the thing is if this was like </joey>
<joey> one of the worst storms that uk has gone </joey>
<joey> has gone through like i'm i am also </joey>
<joey> really used to the idea that no matter </joey>
<joey> what you can still go out and have a </joey>
<joey> pipe yeah you can still go out and have </joey>
<connor> a point no matter what yeah the pub has </connor>
<connor> been canceled so like that's how i knew </connor>
<connor> that this storm was like the real deal </connor>
<garnt> yeah if my mates were not going to the </garnt>
<garnt> pub to meet up because of this storm you </garnt>
<garnt> know shit's gone down if the pub isn't </garnt>
<joey> closed then that means i can still go </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> no matter what </garnt>
<garnt> it is basically that </garnt>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> oh god yeah that is uh another episode </joey>
<garnt> of uh uk people </garnt>
<garnt> severely unprepared for you know weather </garnt>
<joey> systems yeah because like i remember </joey>
<joey> you know when i first met my first like </joey>
<joey> you know british person like from the uk </joey>
<joey> yeah exist yeah they exist i was like oh </joey>
<joey> my god you guys exist but second of all </joey>
<joey> you know they're always like oh yeah we </joey>
<joey> have nothing going on in the uk like no </joey>
<joey> bad weather no like dangerous animals no </joey>
<joey> nothing i'm like really like really like </joey>
<connor> i i found that hard to believe as </connor>
<joey> someone who came from the polar opposite </joey>
<connor> of that yeah from doom just yeah i came </connor>
<joey> from doom i came from hell basically </joey>
<connor> the underwater </connor>
<joey> yeah because it's like do you guys </joey>
<joey> really not like what is the most like </joey>
<joey> dangerous thing floods okay yeah i was </joey>
<joey> about to say we got a lot of rivers so </joey>
<joey> obviously when it rains a lot it can </joey>
<joey> flood but yeah depends on what depending </joey>
<connor> on where you are in the uk there aren't </connor>
<joey> floods like what if you're like nowhere </joey>
<joey> near like the rivers yeah then you don't </joey>
<joey> get anything </joey>
<joey> occasionally you guys get a lucky yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah we've had hurricane scares before </garnt>
<garnt> at least in my lifetime but nothing that </garnt>
<connor> actually like manifested anything felt </connor>
<garnt> like a hurricane right yeah it was just </garnt>
<joey> a bit of strong wind yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah that's that's pretty much it yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean we don't have a lot to fear in the </joey>
<joey> uk which is why whenever i travel abroad </joey>
<joey> um whenever i uh sorry i lost my trail </joey>
<connor> of thought uh whenever i travel aboard </connor>
<joey> uh </joey>
<connor> all aboard </connor>
<joey> whenever i travel abroad i got it i got </joey>
<joey> it this time </joey>
<joey> sometimes it just like surprises me um </joey>
<joey> about some of the things you have to be </joey>
<joey> careful of just because in the uk we </joey>
<joey> don't have to be careful of anything </joey>
<joey> like you know with camping you have to </joey>
<joey> be careful about bears or you know </joey>
<joey> starting a forest fire which to me like </joey>
<joey> starting a forest fire was like so </joey>
<joey> outside my perception of walk of like </joey>
<garnt> disasters that could happen just like </garnt>
<garnt> one person but like </garnt>
<garnt> if you think about it yeah of course it </garnt>
<garnt> makes sense you know you see you look at </garnt>
<garnt> australia being on fire california like </garnt>
<joey> half the year being on fire yeah like </joey>
<joey> our country was on fire for nine months </joey>
<joey> straight because of one guy starting a </joey>
<garnt> fire yeah yeah yeah to me like that just </garnt>
<garnt> like that's just so outside of my </garnt>
<garnt> perception of what could [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> possibly go wrong of one like one stupid </garnt>
<garnt> person doing like a stupid thing you </garnt>
<connor> know yeah so yeah i mean all the trees </connor>
<connor> are like wet in the uk it was very hard </connor>
<connor> to </connor>
<connor> get even i remember when we were camping </connor>
<garnt> it was even hard to get like trees that </garnt>
<connor> weren't too dense </connor>
<garnt> to burn </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean you could you could come in </garnt>
<garnt> with like a [ __ ] flamethrower and </garnt>
<garnt> it'll probably be put out by the day the </garnt>
<connor> flamethrower will run out of gas </connor>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> yeah i've ever seen anywhere like in </connor>
<connor> nature on fire in the uk really </connor>
<garnt> no fire is just not like it's hard to </garnt>
<connor> get started yeah yeah it's very hard to </connor>
<garnt> get nature fires aren't like a thing </garnt>
<garnt> that we have to be careful about and </garnt>
<joey> yeah one of the biggest uk hits was </joey>
<joey> firestarter so you know that's a bit </joey>
<garnt> ironic isn't it because they they had so </garnt>
<joey> much time while they were making the </joey>
<joey> fire starter yeah um they yeah part of </joey>
<connor> yourself make a song about it </connor>
<connor> you do the fire on me </connor>
<garnt> that's why it's an achievement right </garnt>
<joey> yeah like it's easy to be a fire starter </joey>
<joey> anywhere else in the world in the uk </joey>
<garnt> it's it's a medal i'm a firestar i was </garnt>
<joey> like damn </joey>
<joey> does he manage that </joey>
<connor> i want some forest fires like natural </connor>
<joey> like this that needs to happen sometimes </joey>
<joey> to clear a lot of the like dead trees </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah so obviously a lot of </joey>
<joey> them recently are like not yeah so we </joey>
<joey> have we have uh controlled bushfires uh </joey>
<joey> in australia that happens like pretty </joey>
<joey> frequently um because we also have uh i </joey>
<joey> don't know the the details about it but </joey>
<joey> we have this specific uh like </joey>
<joey> is it breed i don't know i don't know </joey>
<connor> what the word for it is of tree or like </connor>
<connor> sapling uh where </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<connor> it's type of eucalyptus i think where </connor>
<connor> the the the seeds from the tree </connor>
<connor> need to be </connor>
<connor> put into a fire in order to open up </connor>
<connor> so to keep the forest alive they </connor>
<joey> actually have to burn these seeds and </joey>
<joey> basically start a bush fire for that </joey>
<connor> area of the bush land to grow in </connor>
<joey> which is like which is the most like </joey>
<joey> backwards thinking that nature has ever </joey>
<connor> done it's like so imagine if like the </connor>
<joey> dead trees pile up and then it's as hot </joey>
<joey> as it is in australia yeah it'll </joey>
<connor> naturally catch up oh yeah we got </connor>
<joey> natural bushfires all the [ __ ] time </joey>
<connor> just because of how hot and powerful </connor>
<connor> australia literally is like the last </connor>
<garnt> dungeon area like even nature is high </garnt>
<connor> level in australia like what they're </connor>
<connor> doing like randomly just start fighting </connor>
<joey> it's literally the desert level of time </joey>
<connor> the breath of the wild </connor>
<connor> it's literally a desert level in breath </connor>
<connor> of the wild where like if you don't have </connor>
<joey> the right equipment you are forever like </joey>
<joey> just gaining damage from this yeah i </joey>
<connor> think in israel i think it's well i </connor>
<connor> can't remember i might have been one of </connor>
<joey> those generic vox videos where you learn </joey>
<joey> about [ __ ] you didn't know you wanted to </joey>
<joey> learn about and then you learn about it </joey>
<connor> and you're like okay you're in every </connor>
<connor> youtube video no mainly vox videos </connor>
<joey> youtube shorts always like that so so i </joey>
<joey> think it was like </joey>
<joey> because the us for so long was </joey>
<joey> actively stopping all the fires </joey>
<joey> it turned out that a lot of the branches </joey>
<joey> needed to just be set ablaze so that </joey>
<joey> they could get rid of them and then it </joey>
<joey> could go back in the system you know it </joey>
<joey> turns into ash so they had like a build </joey>
<joey> up of a lot of dead uh dead trees and </joey>
<connor> stuff like that so when the fire did </connor>
<connor> start it went like crazy yeah nearly as </connor>
<connor> big as it was i mean like yeah we think </connor>
<connor> i could be wrong on that yeah i mean we </connor>
<connor> have like so many like controlled </connor>
<joey> bushfires just because we do have like </joey>
<joey> just at least in my area we have a lot </joey>
<connor> of like wildlife and like nature </connor>
<joey> reserves and stuff like that but you </joey>
<joey> know sometimes unfortunately they're not </joey>
<connor> you know some of those fires aren't </connor>
<joey> controlled 100 of the way and that's </joey>
<joey> what causes bushfire scares and straight </joey>
<joey> up bushfires sometimes so i think that's </joey>
<joey> why we have a lot of that </joey>
<joey> just because we're trying to maintain </joey>
<joey> the nature and then sometimes nature's </joey>
<joey> like you know what i'ma go ham a little </joey>
<joey> bit </joey>
<connor> and then they go ham only controlled </connor>
<garnt> fire in the uk is from trying to boil </garnt>
<joey> your water </joey>
<joey> oh god </joey>
<garnt> help as an australian what is like your </garnt>
<garnt> biggest fear over there in terms of like </garnt>
<connor> nature or </connor>
<garnt> nature-wise um like what you have to be </garnt>
<connor> careful about the motion </connor>
<joey> yeah honestly the people scare me the </joey>
<connor> most </connor>
<connor> that's such a video game movie thing </connor>
<joey> yeah it's not the animation worry about </joey>
<connor> kids it's the people it's the people </connor>
<joey> humans are the scariest of them all </joey>
<connor> the humans were the monsters </connor>
<connor> you can predict a black widow can't </connor>
<joey> predict a human </joey>
<joey> guns don't kill people </joey>
<joey> people kill people </joey>
<connor> um in terms of wildlife like i'm usually </connor>
<joey> pretty okay with like insects and like </joey>
<joey> snakes and spiders if i know it's not </joey>
<garnt> going to kill me have you ever had like </garnt>
<garnt> a big scare yourself of like you've </garnt>
<garnt> encountered something you're like oh </garnt>
<joey> this could this [ __ ] could actually oh </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah many times like i've i've </joey>
<connor> thought the health bar comes on the </connor>
<joey> whole part of the screen </joey>
<joey> yeah many times like uh i remember </joey>
<connor> i was actually this close to </connor>
<connor> basically dying at one point uh because </connor>
<connor> i was this close to being bitten by uh </connor>
<joey> bitten by one of the most venomous ants </joey>
<joey> in the world </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> so we're not only so australia so people </connor>
<connor> outside of australia think that </connor>
<connor> australia is just like yeah venomous uh </connor>
<joey> spiders and snakes </joey>
<joey> yeah we have a lot of uh venomous </joey>
<joey> insects and we have this one ant uh </joey>
<joey> species called the bulldog ant </joey>
<joey> and uh it is </joey>
<joey> supposedly the most venomous ant in the </joey>
<joey> world and i almost got bitten by one </joey>
<joey> when i was like 10 years old right i </joey>
<garnt> think </garnt>
<garnt> like dark souls is like way more </garnt>
<garnt> balanced than australia at least it has </garnt>
<joey> like a hitbox you can see so basically </joey>
<joey> yeah so basically like i was i was </joey>
<connor> camping uh you know that's where most of </connor>
<connor> the accidents happen you got the </connor>
<connor> campfire right that makes sense yeah no </connor>
<joey> i was i was camping on fire and i was </joey>
<joey> like sitting here </joey>
<joey> before i could teleport um yeah so i was </joey>
<joey> like kind of sitting around the fire </joey>
<connor> with uh you know my family my mates and </connor>
<connor> uh i was like maybe 10 11 years old and </connor>
<connor> we were in like a really really like </connor>
<connor> deep rainforest area right yeah so it </connor>
<connor> was like you know basically we just </connor>
<connor> found like a fl it wasn't even like a a </connor>
<connor> registered campsite basically it was </connor>
<connor> just like oh we found a flat piece of </connor>
<connor> ground yeah let's just you know start a </connor>
<joey> fire here you know as long as there's </joey>
<joey> control that's what it is </joey>
<connor> i like the way he just said responsible </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> he didn't say let's let's make this our </joey>
<connor> campsite yeah yeah that's not a fire </connor>
<joey> yeah i mean i've been a responsible fire </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah a small fight let's start </joey>
<connor> let's start a fight here let's let's </connor>
<connor> let's let's honk it down here for the </connor>
<joey> night all right yeah let's uh so we set </joey>
<joey> up the camp there and you know my dad </joey>
<garnt> started the fire and you know we were </garnt>
<garnt> getting all cozied up and uh i was </garnt>
<garnt> sitting on this like giant slab of rock </garnt>
<garnt> right right it was like very smooth and </garnt>
<connor> you know as like a 10 year old you just </connor>
<connor> want to like climb [ __ ] right it's like </connor>
<connor> you know i found lots of little rocks to </connor>
<connor> like and big rocks to kind of climb </connor>
<joey> around in and i was sitting and i was </joey>
<joey> kind of sitting with my mate as well and </joey>
<joey> my hand was like rested back like this </joey>
<joey> right okay kind of like legs out right </joey>
<joey> kind of thing </joey>
<connor> and i was just chilling and everything </connor>
<connor> and then i felt </connor>
<connor> something crawl onto my hand right </connor>
<connor> and i looked down and it was an ant </connor>
<connor> but i was like oh that's a that's a big </connor>
<joey> ant well how big we talking um like like </joey>
<joey> that that's quite big yeah that's pretty </joey>
<garnt> i mean that's still an ant yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's still an air </garnt>
<joey> this pitch black ant uh just kind of </joey>
<joey> like crawling onto my finger </joey>
<joey> um and then uh yeah and then i kind of </joey>
<garnt> like put my hand up and was looking at </garnt>
<garnt> it and then my friend who was next to me </garnt>
<garnt> just gasped and then [ __ ] immediately </garnt>
<garnt> swatted my hand away and swatted this </garnt>
<connor> ant off me right and i was like what the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] i was looking at this cool land </joey>
<garnt> why would you do that and he was like </garnt>
<joey> dude you could have died like you do </joey>
<connor> know what that thing is right and then </connor>
<joey> he told me and he showed me uh what it </joey>
<joey> was i was like </joey>
<joey> well thank you for slapping my hand um </joey>
<connor> glad i didn't die yeah does it </connor>
<joey> definitely kill you or is it like i mean </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like it can kill it they </joey>
<joey> say the venom is powerful enough to like </joey>
<joey> kill an adult in like 15 minutes so as a </joey>
<joey> 10 year old uh probably would have been </joey>
<connor> like instantaneous was the uh coyote </connor>
<connor> peterson video of him yeah right </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i already know he will kill me </joey>
<joey> that's the next level of bomb </joey>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like in the og youtube days it's </garnt>
<joey> like will it blend </joey>

<joey> you have to look out for obviously like </joey>
<joey> you know i've been bitten by snake once </joey>
<joey> but it wasn't venomous it just really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hurt right so that i mean that's </joey>

<garnt> you know like it's like everybody off </garnt>
<joey> the ground yeah the dark history </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't think i'd have like the </joey>
<joey> courage to do anything in australia </joey>
<joey> because like there's no [ __ ] the more </joey>
<joey> i read the more i'm just like well i </joey>
<joey> just i guess i just won't go outside </joey>
<joey> it's great the beaches sound great until </joey>
<garnt> i read about like [ __ ] stone fish </garnt>
<garnt> right and then i'm just like oh i mean </garnt>
<joey> it's a stone fish just you know just </joey>
<garnt> don't [ __ ] step on the way </garnt>
<garnt> okay so a stone fish is a fish that </garnt>
<joey> looks exactly like a stone it's very </joey>
<joey> ugly fish it's a very like a bottom </joey>
<joey> dweller yeah but it's fins have </joey>
<joey> razor-sharp needles that if you step on </joey>
<joey> it it's apparently one of the most </joey>
<garnt> painful like experiences you can have </garnt>
<connor> from an animal yeah from an animal have </connor>
<joey> any of your friends stepped on one uh </joey>
<joey> i've had a friend step on one uh </joey>
<joey> and uh he oh i mean he obviously went to </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] hospital for he didn't die </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> well that's a plus but i mean he didn't </joey>
<connor> die </connor>
<joey> painful it's just extremely painful i </joey>
<garnt> mean if you it could cause like </garnt>
<joey> anaphylactic shock and like kill you if </joey>
<joey> you're unlucky you know like like </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's the most famous fish known on </garnt>
<garnt> earth um and so even if i don't even if </garnt>
<joey> you don't die you're going to have a </joey>
<joey> very very bad time yeah you're just </joey>
<garnt> gonna experience a lot i mean if you're </garnt>
<connor> experiencing enough pain what's the pain </connor>
<connor> is it because it's sharp or is it like </connor>

<garnt> immediately have people like survived uh </garnt>
<joey> people have survived yeah but a lot but </joey>
<joey> i mean like it's it's a very uncommon </joey>
<joey> way oh sorry it's a very rare way for </joey>
<joey> anyone to like i think only like maybe </joey>
<garnt> like two or three people die a year from </garnt>
<garnt> it or something so it's like it's very </garnt>
<garnt> very rare considering the amount of </garnt>
<garnt> people who go into the ocean in </garnt>
<garnt> australia like it's you've got to be </garnt>
<garnt> really unlucky fish jellyfish just scare </garnt>
<garnt> me yeah but i mean like i've been stung </garnt>
<connor> by the other kind of jellyfish that's </connor>
<connor> way more common is they call blue bottle </connor>
<connor> jellyfish and they're not they're not </connor>
<joey> toxic or anything like they won't kill </joey>
<joey> you but it hurts a lot when you get </joey>
<connor> sunburned yeah my friend got stung by </connor>
<connor> when we were swimming in the in like </connor>
<joey> some shitty ocean yeah </joey>
<joey> okay and and the trick in australia is </joey>
<joey> if you have a mate who's been stung by a </joey>
<joey> blue bottle you you pee on pee on that i </joey>
<connor> think this is one of those rumors though </connor>
<connor> isn't it </connor>
<connor> it's just one of my jojo fans all right </connor>
<joey> i don't think it actually i think i </joey>
<joey> think the actual way to do it is like </joey>
<joey> you got to like pour vinegar or </joey>
<connor> something on it but it means </connor>
<connor> having your mate piss on you feels </connor>
<joey> relieved yeah it's not it's </joey>
<joey> when you say it out loud it does feel </joey>
<garnt> like a scene from jojo yeah </garnt>
<joey> you've been stung by a stand the only </joey>
<joey> thing </joey>
<joey> gordon experience </joey>
<joey> 36 degrees right there dog like that </joey>
<connor> that's warm as [ __ ] this is why this </connor>
<connor> isn't a problem in the uk everyone's </connor>
<connor> always got a hot furnace ready for the </connor>
<connor> tea their bodies are just like get the </connor>
<joey> tea thermos </joey>
<joey> this could make it worse actually oh </joey>
<joey> really depending on how i see what's uh </joey>
<joey> sorry for peeing on your leg that one </joey>
<joey> time </joey>
<connor> i remember we were swimming and a bunch </connor>
<garnt> of a bunch of the jellyfish is washed up </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh that's normal yeah i've i've </garnt>
<garnt> seen that in the uk as well </garnt>
<garnt> bunch of them washed up and this little </garnt>
<garnt> ten-year-old didn't know what they were </garnt>
<joey> mm-hmm </joey>
<connor> i think i was twelve dived into it yeah </connor>
<joey> just like picked one up </joey>
<joey> well you can you can pick them up by the </joey>
<joey> head yeah i know you picked it up by the </joey>
<joey> way </joey>
<joey> yeah that's probably immediately started </joey>
<joey> crying and screaming and then oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] that i remember there was </joey>
<connor> loads of them i remember i got really </connor>
<connor> freaked out because i was like what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] is that yeah this is not how they </connor>
<connor> were in finding nemo that's what i </connor>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> i think there was any journey fishing </connor>
<connor> weird fish yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah that wasn't that jellyfish but what </joey>
<joey> fish freak me out so much more than like </joey>
<connor> animals do like what is fishing on </connor>
<connor> animals </connor>
<garnt> no fish fish right animals are animals </garnt>
<garnt> yeah jellyfish isn't an animal i know </garnt>
<connor> it's an animal but [ __ ] like coffee like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is going on with fish i </connor>
<connor> mean it doesn't have a brain injury </connor>
<garnt> jellyfish is just god's spunk </garnt>
<connor> that's just what they are like fights </connor>
<joey> back </joey>
<garnt> i mean like that's the closest way </garnt>
<connor> is the ocean sperm cell </connor>
<connor> you look at you know that mr incredible </connor>
<connor> meme where he's like smiling and </connor>
<connor> gradually getting like more sound yeah </connor>
<connor> he's like you look at dogs you're like </connor>
<joey> yes and you get out of like horses </joey>
<joey> you're like yes yeah then you get </joey>
<joey> something like rats you're like okay </joey>
<joey> yeah and then you start getting these </joey>
<connor> weird fish and you're like what though </connor>
<connor> like the deep sea fish yeah then you </connor>
<connor> start getting into the real [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> weird fish the ones like all like no </connor>
<connor> eyes and just old teeth </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is happening down </connor>
<connor> there it's like something it's like </connor>
<connor> creatures it is like legit like </connor>
<joey> the fit like what's going on with fish </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like that yeah </joey>
<joey> like what who who's this is an episode </joey>
<garnt> of science who's in charge what is up </garnt>
<joey> with this who's in charge of the </joey>
<garnt> evolution down there it's like out of </garnt>
<garnt> control you guys heard about the </garnt>
<garnt> immortal jellyfish no no </garnt>
<joey> listening so there is there is a species </joey>
<joey> of jellyfish that scientists believe are </joey>
<joey> like immortal like they cannot they </joey>
<joey> cannot be </joey>
<joey> killed by like time by old age so </joey>
<joey> obviously they can still be killed by </joey>
<joey> external forces </joey>
<joey> or whatever but that's brilliant but </joey>
<joey> it's believed by scientists that they </joey>
<joey> are </joey>
<joey> in a sense immortal and that scares the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] out of me that's just because </garnt>
<garnt> nothing should be immortal nothing alive </garnt>
<garnt> should be immortal that's just the </garnt>
<joey> survivor stand from past seasons yeah </joey>
<connor> they just have like nowhere yeah that is </connor>
<joey> literally just a stand right </joey>
<connor> you can't die apparently they reckon </connor>
<connor> that aging is uh like a process like </connor>
<garnt> cells and stuff yeah it's on purpose </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm not bullshitting right actually </garnt>
<garnt> that there is something called the </garnt>
<joey> immortal jellyfish yeah apparently it </joey>
<joey> just regresses into like a pollen form </joey>
<joey> and then it comes back again oh yeah so </joey>
<joey> it's literally just like a single cell </joey>
<joey> like organism kind of deal where it's </joey>
<joey> like it's just forever just like </joey>
<joey> re-creating itself basically yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> so a car accident just turned back into </joey>
<joey> a baby and grew back again that's a </joey>
<joey> benjamin button </joey>
<joey> that's actually just a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> superpower that's pretty that's [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> cool dude yeah yeah but could you </garnt>
<garnt> imagine though if like humans were able </garnt>
<connor> to somehow like study that [ __ ] enough </connor>
<joey> right and be like we're trying i think </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and you know being like all </joey>
<joey> right this might actually be like the </joey>
<connor> key to immortality what's the point of </connor>
<connor> being immortal if you get to 60 and </connor>
<connor> you're like you're useless at 60 and </connor>
<connor> you're like what are you gonna do for </connor>
<connor> another hundred years well that's why </connor>
<garnt> they can regress in age as well because </garnt>
<connor> they're just like </connor>
<joey> they're gonna get to like a point where </joey>
<joey> they're like [ __ ] i can't like i can't </joey>
<joey> do sports anymore time to go back </joey>
<connor> let's just say we can like keep you </connor>
<connor> alive right till 200 but like after 50 </connor>
<joey> you start like you know you start </joey>
<joey> degrading and then 70 you're kind of </joey>
<connor> useless yeah yeah well you're just going </connor>
<connor> to say i'm not saying all people are </connor>
<connor> useless by the way but like like you </connor>
<joey> personally can't do what you want right </joey>
<connor> that is the point of you being like </connor>
<connor> another 130 years another 100 years like </connor>
<connor> what are you gonna do like just like </connor>
<connor> catch up with like the rest of game of </connor>
<joey> thrones yeah that's why like that's why </joey>
<connor> like i remember uh [ __ ] you know like </connor>
<connor> in futurama episodes yeah you know when </connor>
<connor> they have all those like old celebrities </connor>
<joey> from centuries ago just as heads yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i remember one of my friends </joey>
<joey> was like oh man wouldn't it be cool if </joey>
<joey> we like humanity got to that point in </joey>
<joey> technology i'm like no what are you what </joey>
<joey> do you want that would be horrible </joey>
<joey> you'd just be sitting on a shelf for the </joey>
<joey> rest of humanity like the rest of yeah </joey>
<garnt> time rest of time rest of time just just </garnt>
<joey> doing what how do you like </joey>
<joey> how do you how do you have fun </joey>
<joey> you're just a head in a [ __ ] jar </joey>
<joey> i don't know perfect beat boxing or </joey>
<joey> something like yeah that's that's all </joey>
<connor> you can do </connor>
<connor> as a head just like </connor>
<connor> that trick right with the cherry stem </connor>
<connor> where you can tie it out </connor>
<joey> what else you're going to do </joey>
<joey> well there's perfecto jojo </joey>
<garnt> learn languages i guess for the rest of </garnt>
<garnt> time in every language in the world yeah </garnt>
<joey> probably or just or just so now i think </joey>
<garnt> about there is a few things you can do </garnt>
<garnt> just watch pokemon in your mind yeah </garnt>
<joey> exactly the ultimate life hack </joey>
<joey> oh what are you doing i'm just watching </joey>
<garnt> the 6 000th of rerun of pokemon yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean like i mean like i i guess it's </garnt>
<garnt> like a really philosophical question of </garnt>
<garnt> if you could be immortal would you want </garnt>
<joey> to be immortal and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> i i wouldn't want to be a muscle maybe i </joey>
<joey> wouldn't want to die at like say 80 or </joey>
<joey> 90 or whatever but like there's a point </joey>
<garnt> where i would like my body to keep up </garnt>
<joey> with what i want to do right okay well </joey>
<joey> then different question </joey>
<joey> how old if you could choose how old </joey>
<garnt> would you want to be when you die </garnt>
<connor> what to me it depends on how functional </connor>
<garnt> i am yeah right because like i yeah i've </garnt>
<joey> i've met 90 years old 90 year olds who </joey>
<joey> are like still in like [ __ ] tip-top </joey>
<joey> shape yeah yeah yeah um and i've also </joey>
<joey> met you know like 60-year-olds who have </joey>
<connor> trouble doing things that i would want </connor>
<connor> to do as well 50s yeah yeah yeah yeah it </connor>
<garnt> depends on how unlucky you get really </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah you know some of my </garnt>
<connor> friends you know that that some of their </connor>
<connor> dads like 55 already getting like </connor>
<connor> dementia and stuff yeah [ __ ] yeah i </connor>
<joey> would hate to get that especially if </joey>
<joey> like my kids are young like i don't want </joey>
<joey> them to feel like yeah they've got to </joey>
<joey> help me out yeah i think i think the </joey>
<joey> coolest answer was uh like my grandad </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> apparently like in his twenties he was </joey>
<joey> like from from his twenties he was like </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna die at age 80. just like </joey>
<joey> just no cap i'm gonna die at age 80. </joey>
<connor> yeah and for the longest time i was like </connor>
<connor> why why would you say that from a young </connor>
<connor> age and he's like because it gives me a </connor>
<connor> time limit to do all the things i want </connor>
<connor> to do before i die right and so it's </connor>
<connor> like self-motivating and and this is how </connor>
<connor> much of a chad my granddad was he died </connor>
<connor> exactly at age 80. and he was literally </connor>
<connor> he was he was literally like i'm i'm </connor>
<connor> good man i'm good to go i'll ask how he </connor>
<connor> dies from lung cancer but </connor>
<connor> i was gonna say i'm like the dish man </connor>
<connor> how did that go down i mean the thing is </connor>
<connor> i think it sounds like he did everything </connor>
<joey> yeah he was literally like on his 80th </joey>
<joey> birthday he was like i can go now with </joey>
<connor> like no regrets just like waiting for </connor>
<connor> the clock to turn </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like it's like ready to pour </joey>
<joey> we're gonna pull the plug </joey>
<joey> but like i thought i thought that was so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] cool right because like there's </joey>
<connor> that like very common philosophy of like </connor>
<garnt> you know if you became immortal you </garnt>
<connor> would do nothing because you'd have no </connor>
<joey> like rush you'd have to drive </joey>
<joey> because you can do it whenever you want </joey>
<joey> so yeah i mean that's my reasoning for </joey>
<connor> why i wouldn't want to be a model also </connor>
<connor> like i don't know i don't want to see </connor>
<joey> everyone around me die </joey>
<connor> that should be so funny i mean like if </connor>
<garnt> you live in a society where everyone can </garnt>
<joey> choose how you know when oh so okay so </joey>
<joey> if we were living in an immortal society </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah society </garnt>
<garnt> if we lived in the society </garnt>
<joey> then i think we'd just like regress to </joey>
<garnt> the [ __ ] stone age at that point </garnt>
<garnt> because like no one would want to do </garnt>
<garnt> anything yeah yeah yeah i mean like for </garnt>
<garnt> me like </garnt>
<garnt> personally </garnt>
<garnt> i find like the most badass people are </garnt>
<joey> the people who like live till like the </joey>
<joey> late they're late ages and they like </joey>
<joey> they seem fit they seem able and then </joey>
<joey> one day they just decide to like their </joey>
<joey> body just decides all right peace out </joey>
<joey> yeah you know that's the way i would </joey>
<garnt> want to go you know i don't want like </garnt>
<connor> that i think everyone wants to go like </connor>
<connor> that yeah but like life is brutal it is </connor>
<joey> i like uh i think it's like the </joey>
<joey> tezukosama the the guy who basically </joey>
<joey> popularized manga he died while drawing </joey>
<joey> manga in the hospital then and i'm like </joey>
<joey> that's so [ __ ] badass the fact that </joey>
<joey> like this man literally till the moment </joey>
<connor> he died was doing what he wanted to do </connor>
<connor> yeah god's gonna be doing that final ten </connor>
<joey> pull </joey>
<joey> he gets 10 ssrs and he's like </joey>
<garnt> connor's going to be on like jump king </garnt>
<garnt> 20. </garnt>
<joey> on the phone the final jump </joey>
<garnt> no but yeah because like my my like uh </garnt>
<garnt> my grandma right now is uh </garnt>
<garnt> is still alive and like she's in like </garnt>
<garnt> her late 90s right now and i remember </garnt>
<connor> when i introduced her to sydney for the </connor>
<connor> first time </connor>
<connor> uh and i remember i was telling sydney </connor>
<connor> oh you know she's she's in the 90s you </connor>
<connor> know i think you've definitely told this </connor>
<connor> story have i told his story i think you </connor>
<joey> have okay </joey>
<joey> okay so yeah uh my grandma like squeezed </joey>
<joey> took sydney's hand and squeezed it she </joey>
<joey> squeezed it so hard that sydney was like </joey>
<garnt> writhing in pain for like a good hour </garnt>
<garnt> because of how hard she squeezed it um </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah that was that was a cliff notes </garnt>
<garnt> for the story because i think maybe i </garnt>
<joey> have told this on trash too so basically </joey>
<joey> your grandma's giga chat yeah yeah have </joey>
<joey> you ever heard the story i think so yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i think they seem familiar i can't </joey>
<connor> i can't see sometimes you can't tell if </connor>
<connor> you told if i've told you this at a bar </connor>
<connor> or something on the podcast </connor>
<garnt> unfortunately we talk </garnt>
<garnt> a lot unfortunately we do talk a lot i </garnt>
<joey> wrote i saw a recent comment on one of </joey>
<joey> the trash today's episodes being like </joey>
<joey> it's so impressive how the boys still </joey>
<joey> manage to find topics that they've never </joey>
<joey> taught i don't even know like yeah i </joey>
<garnt> don't even know i just talk and like </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes we get called out for it </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes we don't i don't know </garnt>
<connor> it's whatever yeah definitely spoke </connor>
<joey> about [ __ ] up fish in the ocean i know </joey>
<connor> that have we no we haven't oh we haven't </connor>
<connor> no i haven't there's so many [ __ ] up </connor>
<garnt> little fishes the animal that scares you </garnt>
<connor> the most men no chewing um </connor>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<connor> martians martians </connor>
<garnt> i think </garnt>
<joey> i think you know like those t lists of </joey>
<joey> like animals that i could take in a </joey>
<joey> fight yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't know why i just think like a a </joey>
<joey> deer would just [ __ ] me up i mean they </joey>
<connor> could yeah like more i think i'd have </connor>
<connor> more chance of like being able to outwit </connor>
<joey> a bear or something </joey>
<joey> or like being oh </joey>
<joey> has taught me anything don't [ __ ] with </joey>
<connor> bears which are the ones with like the </connor>
<joey> massive antlers is it dears are they all </joey>
<joey> dears i mean </joey>
<joey> i don't know no maybe not moose but like </joey>
<connor> there's some caribou i've i've seen some </connor>
<connor> of them that are [ __ ] insane i mean </connor>
<joey> moose are like [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> insane yeah </connor>
<joey> like people imagine moose and they're </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah that's like just a big deer </joey>
<joey> right i'm like no they're [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> they're like huge </joey>
<connor> insanely huge it's scary even though i </connor>
<connor> think i there's like a 0.1 percent </connor>
<connor> chance that i could </connor>
<connor> live it with a bear encounter yeah </connor>
<connor> i at least think that like a deer i'd </connor>
<joey> have like zero if it wanted to kill me i </joey>
<joey> feel like it would just chase what </joey>
<joey> what what logic are you facing this time </joey>
<joey> what kind of thing </joey>
<connor> are you like </connor>
<connor> the way it looks at me i don't know why </connor>
<joey> you're talking you're talking about like </joey>
<joey> the deer from princess monarch okay </joey>
<connor> they got to look in their eyes </connor>
<joey> right they got a look in their eye that </joey>
<garnt> says i'm up for blood and i'm i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> going to be talking about deer's the </garnt>
<joey> cutest [ __ ] all the time i mean have </joey>
<joey> you never been to naro </joey>
<connor> we can feed the deers they're like no </connor>
<connor> there's like wimp tears like chad chad </connor>
<connor> diaz have you seen those deers when </connor>
<joey> they're wrestling each other for like </joey>
<connor> mating purposes oh yeah yeah dude </connor>
<joey> let's just say if one of these deers </joey>
<connor> thought i was gonna steal its gf </connor>
<joey> i'm done like it's i'm dead i think you </joey>
<joey> can say that about most animals though </joey>
<joey> like if you were like if you tried to </joey>
<garnt> steal like uh yeah </garnt>
<joey> if you want to go to a frat party i'm </joey>
<joey> sure you feel the same way as well right </joey>
<garnt> oh this guy's gonna [ __ ] me up </garnt>
<joey> i remember </joey>
<garnt> there's like stories </garnt>
<connor> what logic are you playing there's </connor>
<joey> absolutely zero logic </joey>
<joey> just the way it looks so are you saying </joey>
<joey> that like you can't take on a male deer </joey>
<joey> but you could take on say like a male </joey>
<joey> elephant </joey>
<joey> uh or a male giraffe what would we say </joey>
<connor> take on an elephant are we saying like </connor>
<joey> beating it well i mean you you were </joey>
<joey> saying like t list of animals i could </joey>
<joey> beat in the fight right right right </joey>
<connor> right right right right in the fight or </connor>
<connor> like survive yeah i i reckon i could get </connor>
<garnt> away from a bear let's let's say yeah </garnt>
<garnt> let's say like you're a caveman and you </garnt>
<garnt> need to take on one of these animals to </garnt>
<connor> like survive like </connor>
<garnt> yeah okay i think i don't know why i </garnt>
<connor> just feel like a deer could chase me to </connor>
<connor> the end of the earth </connor>
<connor> i feel like a bear my gift like most </connor>
<joey> animals no no no i bear will get bored </joey>
<connor> after a while you know </connor>
<joey> they'll get bored i feel like a deer </joey>
<joey> clearly never encountered a bear in his </joey>
<connor> life let's say i climb a 20-foot tree i </connor>
<connor> know bears can climb trees but i reckon </connor>
<connor> the deer somehow would just [ __ ] jump </connor>
<connor> up [ __ ] me up naruto style something i </connor>
<connor> don't know why i'm just scared of these </connor>
<garnt> deers man these big deers that are </garnt>
<garnt> tigers lions do you have like girls </garnt>
<joey> i'll take a tiger i'll [ __ ] it did you </joey>
<joey> have like a childhood trauma around the </joey>
<garnt> deer </garnt>
<garnt> is this just the british in you talking </garnt>
<garnt> do you even have deers of course we have </garnt>
<garnt> deers in england </garnt>

<connor> no they're just they're just kind of </connor>
<garnt> like little [ __ ] rams </garnt>
<garnt> they're just kind of like drama queens </garnt>
<garnt> you can you can you can you can talk to </garnt>
<connor> them </connor>
<garnt> you can tell you can't you can't really </garnt>
<connor> talk with me </connor>
<connor> with the deer </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> this isn't what bring them like one </joey>
<joey> tablespoon it's just a deer right </joey>
<connor> those would [ __ ] you up this is the mail </connor>
<connor> impaled bro you'll be in the tree like </connor>
<garnt> i mean i'm not not gonna get off the </garnt>
<joey> tree i'm not not saying they won't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you up but i have regrets </joey>
<connor> i'd rather take on that than a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bear yeah as well because when you see </connor>
<connor> that you think it's cute right you think </connor>
<connor> oh it's cute and then it [ __ ] stabs </connor>
<connor> you right a bear you're not getting </connor>
<connor> anywhere near that you're cautious right </connor>
<joey> it's about the position no i'm not going </joey>
<joey> anywhere near a thing that has horns </joey>
<connor> like that but they taste good though so </connor>
<joey> i'd understand why </joey>
<joey> so if bears tasted good would you </joey>
<connor> maybe </connor>
<joey> this is one of those things where it's </joey>
<connor> just like it's gonna make me look stupid </connor>
<connor> this argument but it's just pure like </connor>
<connor> gut like this is no logic whatsoever </connor>
<joey> this is just my gut feeling so is is </joey>
<connor> dear like s t for you like s t is scary </connor>
<connor> s here will [ __ ] you up and you didn't </connor>
<connor> expect it </connor>
<connor> bear is 80 because i know it i know it's </connor>
<connor> gonna [ __ ] me up but also it might not </connor>
<connor> it might get bored it might just leave </connor>
<connor> me alone </connor>
<garnt> but what were you getting this idea that </garnt>
<connor> dears are so [ __ ] aggressive yeah </connor>
<connor> i've i've seen videos man </connor>
<joey> i've seen videos of bears being </joey>
<garnt> aggressive </garnt>
<garnt> because some dumbass is provoking a deer </garnt>
<connor> right like yeah of course they're gonna </connor>
<connor> get pissed off i don't know you know i </connor>
<connor> just think that uh bears are you know </connor>
<connor> friendly because my experience with most </connor>
<connor> deers like even ones like that is that </connor>
<joey> you go like [ __ ] in a few again this </joey>
<connor> is a 50 meter radius </connor>
<garnt> i am not trying to make any sense this </garnt>
<garnt> is all just got no you're not now you're </garnt>
<joey> not making sense i know i know it </joey>
<joey> doesn't i know this isn't making it why </joey>
<connor> are we trying to glean some sense out of </connor>
<connor> it but </connor>
<connor> like tigers are scary </connor>
<connor> but also you know the tiger king seemed </connor>
<connor> like he had a good hand of it so maybe </connor>
<garnt> i mean it is like it is he slapped them </garnt>
<connor> with his uh his stick and they let go of </connor>
<connor> him so if i just give him a little get </connor>
<connor> off </connor>
<joey> stop that </joey>
<joey> yeah that was the problem with like all </joey>
<joey> the prey that you see they </joey>
<connor> oh yeah there was like a story from like </connor>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> that i think brian blesses you know </joey>
<joey> brian blessed he's a very famous british </joey>
<joey> guy </joey>
<joey> he he's this really famous british guy </joey>
<joey> who has like yes the most booming voice </joey>
<connor> like this right and apparently he was in </connor>
<connor> the arctic filming something and a polar </connor>
<connor> bear came up and i think he either </connor>
<connor> punched the polar bear in the face or he </connor>
<connor> screamed at the polar bear and it ran </connor>
<connor> away scared </connor>
<connor> this story so i'd like to think that i </connor>
<connor> could if it is true that you could scare </connor>
<connor> a polar bear from shouting at it i think </connor>
<joey> i'll be all right well i mean </joey>
<joey> bucky has taught me that like the best </joey>
<joey> way to beat a bear is to punch it in the </joey>
<connor> nose yeah i heard that you could punch </connor>
<connor> it in there but probably not the grizzly </connor>
<connor> bear probably just </connor>
<joey> yeah well i mean if you're fast enough </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> i mean not fascinating </joey>
<garnt> i mean at that point you're lucky </garnt>
<garnt> at that point you're kind of playing </garnt>
<garnt> gacha with your life you know yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's the same thing with sharks right if </joey>
<joey> you if you punch a shark in the nose </joey>
<joey> then it'll just be like that is that </joey>
<joey> true i don't know </joey>
<joey> i've tried it i wouldn't try it i mean </joey>
<joey> i'm not going to try it but you know </joey>
<joey> like nature's like world's slowest punch </joey>
<joey> underwater punch nature's literally </joey>
<joey> giving them a weak point </joey>
<garnt> i punched the shark for massive touches </garnt>
<connor> where you're gonna punch a deer huh you </connor>
<connor> can't punch it anyway it's got </connor>
<garnt> big spiky things right i feel like i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like you could like you know </garnt>
<garnt> dodge at the last moment yeah you can </garnt>
<joey> like devil back yeah </joey>
<garnt> what are you talking about bears are </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] fast as [ __ ] when have you seen </garnt>
<connor> a bear huh this is the most dumb </connor>
<garnt> conversation we've ever had </garnt>
<garnt> you're so like if you see a bear like </garnt>
<joey> like a grizzly bear you are not running </joey>
<connor> away from that no you can't now run a </connor>
<garnt> bit yeah no but like the best tactic is </garnt>
<connor> that you can outrun your mates maybe i </connor>
<connor> can maybe i can shout at it ask it </connor>
<connor> kindly to stop </connor>
<connor> you know it's like </connor>
<connor> okay let's have </connor>
<connor> why don't we ask survivors of bears </connor>
<connor> right what they did to survive the bear </connor>
<joey> uh i like to ask how many bear survivors </joey>
<joey> do you know there's got to be a few out </joey>
<connor> there </connor>
<joey> i'm pretty </joey>
<garnt> there are sure yeah because no one talks </garnt>
<garnt> about it because everyone sometimes </garnt>
<connor> deals because they know if they talk </connor>
<garnt> then it's going to come back </garnt>
<joey> is going to come back for something then </joey>
<connor> comes back with his family like </connor>
<joey> you should be smitten </joey>
<joey> it's like how many horror movies are </joey>
<garnt> there with deers as like the main </garnt>
<connor> monster that's because [ __ ] [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> people are too scared to talk about </connor>
<garnt> dears </garnt>
<garnt> like the next like when's the next deer </garnt>
<garnt> coming out in the godzilla trilogy or </garnt>
<garnt> whatever man </garnt>
<joey> king kong vs king kong and godzilla </joey>
<joey> versus deer they need to tag team the </joey>
<connor> ultimate monster do you man it can it </connor>
<connor> can go run super fast launch itself in </connor>
<connor> with those hooks you know you're done gg </connor>
<joey> so would you say the deer is the most </joey>
<connor> powerful animal </connor>
<connor> it's the most powerful </connor>
<joey> spiritually if it were to animal like </joey>
<joey> battle royale would you pick deer no </joey>
<joey> no who would you pick for an animal </joey>
<joey> battle royal animal kingdom battle royal </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> i'm definitely picking polar bear for </joey>
<connor> sure i feel like you're going for low </connor>
<joey> hanging fruit i feel like there's </joey>
<connor> probably something stronger yeah because </connor>
<joey> i'm trying to win yeah </joey>
<connor> i feel like there's probably better </connor>
<connor> animals maybe if you ask tls the tiazu </connor>
<garnt> guy i'm sure boris </garnt>
<connor> walrus </connor>
<garnt> i don't think so okay okay the only </garnt>
<connor> reason i say this is because i i </connor>
<connor> literally saw a video where like a polar </connor>
<connor> bear truck was like [ __ ] starving </connor>
<connor> hadn't eaten for a while uh so he was </connor>
<connor> trying to hunt and he comes across these </connor>
<joey> like this group of walruses i don't know </joey>
<joey> what the proper word is the herd </joey>
<joey> and like he literally tried to like try </joey>
<joey> to take a bite out of any walrus yeah </joey>
<joey> right and their hides were like so thick </joey>
<joey> that he that like they couldn't he </joey>
<garnt> couldn't grab on and walls just like </garnt>
<garnt> shook him off and he tried with like </garnt>
<garnt> several walruses and like he just failed </garnt>
<garnt> so maybe maybe it's walruses that are at </garnt>
<garnt> the top of the [ __ ] food chain and we </garnt>
<connor> just never thought about it </connor>
<connor> the honey badger that one's like a scary </connor>
<connor> one right </connor>
<joey> i would like a [ __ ] i think the polar </joey>
<connor> bear would destroy the honey badger i </connor>
<connor> don't know man </connor>
<connor> i mean human versus honey badger yeah </connor>
<connor> the honey badger is probably gonna win </connor>
<connor> yeah but like you know because i don't </connor>
<connor> want to [ __ ] with a honey badger </connor>
<joey> what is a honey badger it's a badger </joey>
<joey> that eats honey no it's not no it's not </joey>
<connor> no yes it is is it primarily honey i </connor>
<connor> thought it was like this yeah because </connor>
<joey> it's not like [ __ ] crazy isn't the </joey>
<joey> whole thing of it with a honey badger is </joey>
<joey> that like its height is so thick that </joey>
<connor> like a bee sting literally can't </connor>
<connor> penetrate it i don't know why they're </connor>
<joey> like that shit's crazy i i remember i </joey>
<connor> read something about it shrimp you know </connor>
<garnt> mentorship i know [ __ ] manchester </garnt>
<joey> united </joey>
<garnt> yeah my god like that okay that that's </garnt>
<joey> when nature is [ __ ] cool yeah see </joey>
<connor> fish it's always fish like what's going </connor>
<joey> on like manchester shrimp is like the </joey>
<joey> bucky of the scene why does this fish </joey>
<connor> have like a cannon for an arm like </connor>
<connor> what's going on with that </connor>
<joey> i'm just gonna i'm just gonna throw a </joey>
<joey> fist and create a sonic boom yeah what </joey>
<connor> happened with evolution </connor>
<connor> like i'm telling you man evolution in </connor>
<connor> the sea is [ __ ] like i don't know </connor>
<joey> what's going on when is the next state </joey>
<joey> like stage above that it's like oh i </joey>
<joey> throw a punch and a nuclear fusion </joey>
<joey> happens </joey>
<garnt> black hole with my fist yeah i mean if </garnt>
<garnt> you use like sliced up a manta strip but </garnt>
<garnt> i think it could possibly like create a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] vacuum that sucks sucks the area </garnt>
<garnt> and sucks his opponents in so that's </garnt>
<joey> what bucky should have done instead of </joey>
<joey> imagining a human-sized uh praying </joey>
<joey> mantis he should have imagined a </joey>
<joey> human-sized manta strip </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be the one punch man yeah of </joey>
<joey> course why are we talking about this </joey>
<joey> again </joey>
<joey> the one punch man of the sea you know </joey>
<joey> you know what one uh thing that um i </joey>
<joey> always </joey>
<joey> there's like i think this is youtube </joey>
<connor> videos where like people like kind of uh </connor>
<connor> go to like nature and they like save the </connor>
<connor> animals that are like being hunted or </connor>
<connor> something yeah yeah by other animals </connor>
<connor> yeah okay right and then they ask like </connor>
<connor> david attenborough questions like do you </connor>
<connor> ever feel like you should uh help the </connor>
<connor> animal that's being hunted and stuff and </connor>
<connor> he's like no </connor>
<connor> it's literally nature why would i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] interfere yeah like i i don't </connor>
<connor> understand why people always make these </connor>
<connor> videos being like today we're gonna save </connor>
<connor> the fish from being eaten it's like </connor>
<connor> that's literally the point of the fish </connor>
<connor> that's </connor>
<connor> literally called a food chain yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah we just we're just sympathetic </connor>
<joey> because we're at the top </joey>
<joey> yes if we're if we're in the middle of </joey>
<joey> that if you're like </joey>
<garnt> i'm trying to save my own life </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't think cavemen uh really </garnt>
<garnt> worried about uh what nature was doing </garnt>
<garnt> because we were we were trying our best </garnt>
<joey> to survive as well that's like a seagull </joey>
<joey> being like i'm gonna save these fish </joey>
<joey> today </joey>

<connor> trust no one not even yourself </connor>
<connor> what's the what's the </connor>
<connor> strongest animal you genuinely </connor>
<connor> wholeheartedly think you could you could </connor>
<joey> be in the fight what it </joey>
<joey> define beat in a fight </joey>
<joey> like just a fist because like the </joey>
<joey> animals are going to be like oh there's </joey>
<garnt> no like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like like bring it bring into </garnt>
<garnt> submission </garnt>
<garnt> kind of thing like what are we talking </garnt>
<joey> about i don't know like or like run away </joey>
<joey> like the amount of runs away or like </joey>
<garnt> like or you're like not like it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> fight or a fight to the death yeah for </garnt>
<garnt> some reason you're in are we allow tools </garnt>
<connor> no just your bare face just your bare </connor>
<connor> fist and whatever is laying around on </connor>
<garnt> the ground all right i got it uh </garnt>
<connor> realistically realistically dog human </connor>
<connor> why are you fighting a doctor </connor>
<joey> you were human or human yeah he's like </joey>
<joey> dog </joey>
<joey> patients </joey>
<joey> not that i would </joey>
<joey> no like like a bit like a bit like if </joey>
<joey> we're not counting humans like a big dog </joey>
<joey> is probably the max i can go because </joey>
<joey> even then like you know </joey>
<connor> it's [ __ ] scary a big dog would beat </connor>
<connor> you up actually </connor>
<joey> i mean a big dog i mean like some really </joey>
<garnt> big yeah it could really [ __ ] hurt </garnt>
<connor> could you take on a wolf </connor>
<connor> i mean it'll be hard but i feel like if </connor>
<connor> you're fighting for the final year of </connor>
<connor> the movie for sure yeah yeah yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> feel like you could take on a wolf not </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> it's not a guaranteed win yeah that's </garnt>
<joey> like on the edge of what i imagine if i </joey>
<joey> was fighting for my life is it like a </joey>
<joey> hundred percent like success rate no no </joey>
<garnt> but like you know but like could i </garnt>
<joey> possibly get a wolf into a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> chokehold or something go [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ufc on his ass then maybe maybe </joey>
<joey> if i had the right techniques </joey>
<joey> all i'm saying human wolf versus wolf in </joey>
<joey> the octagon i'm just like you know </joey>
<joey> learn some bjj you have some bjj maybe </joey>
<connor> like maybe you might have a more </connor>
<joey> fighting chance you know </joey>
<connor> you're dead </connor>
<joey> because i mean how how small do you </joey>
<connor> think a wolf is pretty big do you take </connor>
<joey> on a sheep maybe you're gonna beat up a </joey>
<joey> sheep </joey>
<joey> beat up a sheep i mean not that i would </joey>
<connor> want to i don't think this sheep would </connor>
<connor> even fight no </connor>
<connor> i think you should just be like just </connor>
<connor> take me </connor>
<garnt> let's just take me away right now </garnt>
<garnt> what about you connor what about you </garnt>
<garnt> what what is the absolute max that you </garnt>
<connor> you would think like okay i could </connor>
<joey> survive this catfish </joey>
<joey> a catfish </joey>
<connor> i don't even know i don't even know i </connor>
<joey> don't really think about it well yeah i </joey>
<joey> don't think about this either </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> maybe a very you know there's some tiny </joey>
<joey> monkeys very small monkey very very </joey>
<joey> small monkey maybe yeah they'd probably </joey>
<connor> give me a good [ __ ] fight </connor>
<joey> oh yeah definitely it'd be three rounds </joey>
<joey> at least of course connor says </joey>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> course the weaker genomes of some of the </joey>
<joey> weaker ones you know species of monkeys </joey>
<joey> could you take on a chimp [ __ ] nerve </joey>
<garnt> chimps [ __ ] chip what's your murder yeah </garnt>
<joey> okay why are birds so [ __ ] sassy </joey>
<garnt> like what why why why are they so cool </garnt>
<joey> like what do you mean by sassy they just </joey>
<garnt> have attitude like like so many [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> i've seen like you fly i mean come on </joey>
<joey> i would be sassy too if i could watch an </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> it's literally looking down yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> like probably but it's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> like you like the birds of prey aren't </garnt>
<joey> the sassy ones it's like the like the </joey>
<joey> domesticated the small the smaller the </joey>
<joey> birds like the parrots right yeah the </joey>
<joey> parrots yeah powers are [ __ ] sassy as </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] my [ __ ] god also they freak me </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] out because their voices how </joey>
<garnt> like how do they do such an accurate </garnt>
<garnt> like representation of like pretty much </garnt>
<joey> every sound yeah our family used to own </joey>
<connor> a couple of like different species of </connor>
<connor> parrot um like a cockatiel and like </connor>
<joey> lorikeets and stuff like that and like </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> something camera recommended yesterday </connor>
<connor> that was parent was key witness in </connor>
<connor> murder trial </connor>
<connor> as a woman is convicted of killing </connor>
<connor> husband </connor>
<connor> 11 million views </connor>
<joey> what is the power it's just like she did </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> talkative parent finger a killer </joey>
<joey> you heard right </joey>
<joey> don't [ __ ] shoot your parents </joey>
<joey> found shot to death at his home </joey>
<joey> that's crazy </joey>
<connor> was also found </connor>
<connor> with a gunshot wound this parent was </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> oh my god they were both that's again </joey>
<joey> i mean that's pretty [ __ ] cool i mean </joey>
<joey> like yeah cause like my my parrot used </joey>
<joey> to </joey>
<joey> replicate like sounds that we would </joey>
<joey> teach him but he would also just like </joey>
<joey> pick up sounds through osmosis right </joey>
<garnt> like i've told this story how much is </garnt>
<garnt> something no you haven't you haven't </garnt>
<connor> told this oh okay okay so like we used </connor>
<connor> to own uh this like uh cockatiel which </connor>
<connor> is like do you know what a cockatiel is </connor>
<garnt> yes yeah so it's like a sassy sassy </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yeah yeah sassy </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] right but um yeah cause </garnt>
<garnt> they're parrots so like they replicate a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of things so like we taught it to uh </garnt>
<garnt> whistle the adam's family theme song </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right so like every like we'd wake </garnt>
<connor> up in the morning and it'd just be you </connor>
<connor> know whistling the animals and things </connor>
<connor> like and everyone was like oh that's so </connor>
<connor> cute but then other times the sassiness </connor>
<connor> would [ __ ] pull through on this mofo </connor>
<connor> and he would uh replicate sounds that </connor>
<connor> confuse the [ __ ] out of us so he </connor>
<connor> perfected uh the sound of the microwave </connor>
<connor> not not just like he would replicate the </connor>
<connor> buttons like presses perfectly so be </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> but then like you know when it's like </connor>
<connor> finished and it goes like </connor>
<connor> it would replicate that perfectly so </connor>
<connor> many times where like oh i'd be in the </connor>
<connor> living room and i would hear that and i </connor>
<connor> would walk into the living uh into the </connor>
<connor> kitchen thinking that like someone was </connor>
<connor> there no one's there i'm like oh my god </connor>
<connor> it's a [ __ ] ghost and then i realize </connor>
<connor> it's my it's my [ __ ] sassy bird </connor>
<connor> and also like it would replicate like </connor>
<connor> the phone ringing and [ __ ] like that </connor>
<connor> they're really smart they're really </connor>
<connor> really smart and uh it would also </connor>
<joey> replicate uh my mom saying good morning </joey>
<connor> so it'd be like it'd just be </connor>
<joey> if i ever get another lorikeet i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna teach you to go yeah </joey>
<joey> just to see how well i could replicate </joey>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> oh my god anyway i remember there's some </connor>
<connor> like youtube videos where people like </connor>
<connor> mix it badly and they put beeps in it </connor>
<connor> for some reason yeah and when i'm in the </connor>
<connor> other room and i like the videos playing </connor>
<connor> and i hear a beep i'm like what's </connor>
<connor> happening in my kitchen </connor>
<connor> i hate people who do use beeps really </connor>
<connor> loud beeps in their youtube videos yeah </connor>
<garnt> shouldn't do it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> i was gonna i was gonna i thought you </garnt>
<garnt> were gonna go a different direction with </garnt>
<joey> that conversation because i was gonna </joey>
<joey> talk about uh bass boosted monsters inc </joey>
<joey> memes because </joey>
<joey> how are you going to [ __ ] transition </joey>
<joey> i want to hear how this happens because </joey>
<joey> you're talking about people putting </joey>
<joey> sounds in like youtube videos and stuff </joey>
<joey> like that and i'm just like yeah i get </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> like on a tangent i still think the </joey>
<joey> funniest thing uh one of the funniest </joey>
<joey> videos is just people who like </joey>
<joey> take the bass boosted monster zinc theme </joey>
<joey> you [ __ ] love it and throw it into </joey>
<joey> like someone's sleeping or something </joey>
<joey> like to me that is just pete comedy </joey>
<joey> i don't know i just wanted to bring it </joey>
<joey> bring back the monsters think bass </joey>
<joey> boosted memes </joey>
<connor> literally had nothing to do with the </connor>
<connor> conversation and i was playing your mind </connor>
<connor> is just thinking about bass music </connor>
<garnt> monster thing </garnt>
<garnt> i was playing 5d chess trying to like </garnt>
<joey> relate these two things you were playing </joey>
<joey> 5d chess we were playing checkers right </joey>
<garnt> here </garnt>
<garnt> not even the same game </garnt>
<garnt> anyway enough about animals what have </garnt>
<connor> you guys been up to in the past week uh </connor>
<connor> i had i bought a pc and it didn't work </connor>
<joey> oh yeah i saw yeah twitter thread on </joey>
<joey> that that was pretty sad so what </joey>
<joey> happened with that </joey>
<joey> so i was building it live which was </joey>
<connor> more stressful than last time </connor>
<connor> i think last time because </connor>
<connor> we </connor>
<connor> we did it like three times rip gant who </connor>
<garnt> went first joey went to sleep </garnt>
<garnt> i went first yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so doing it live was really </garnt>
<garnt> annoying because i was actually reading </garnt>
<garnt> chat when i just shouldn't have read </garnt>
<connor> chat yeah because chat kept saying yes </connor>
<connor> or no yeah like i'd be like is this the </connor>
<connor> right thing to do half says yes half </connor>
<connor> says no yeah </connor>
<garnt> well it shouldn't you already know </garnt>
<joey> you've built yeah yeah it needs to be </joey>
<garnt> the pc master right yeah you've always </garnt>
<garnt> you've already built a pc live on camera </garnt>
<connor> yeah i probably could have just done it </connor>
<connor> but i just kept getting confused and i </connor>
<connor> and then when i get confused i get </connor>
<connor> nervous because i'm live and i'm like </connor>
<joey> what if i do something wrong and then </joey>
<joey> everyone sees that i did it wrong </joey>
<connor> because people are laughing </connor>
<joey> so so i wasn't about the whole point of </joey>
<connor> that but i wasn't really worried when it </connor>
<connor> was my turn doing it live because i'd </connor>
<connor> already seen two people build it so it </connor>
<connor> was really easy all right </connor>
<garnt> um yeah last time she'd been more </garnt>
<garnt> stressful because it was a speed run as </garnt>
<connor> well yeah yeah and it was okay it was </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i still [ __ ] some things up </connor>
<connor> all right the m.2 i had trouble with </connor>
<joey> again yeah </joey>
<joey> that m.2 man yeah </joey>
<joey> i i built this whole thing i spent five </joey>
<joey> hours doing it because i [ __ ] up and </joey>
<joey> was wasting a lot of time and doing a </joey>
<joey> bunch of other stuff and i was </joey>
<connor> preoccupied so i finally built it to </connor>
<joey> five hours and it didn't turn on damn </joey>
<connor> did you find out why oh yeah so it's </connor>
<joey> working now i have it so uh the next day </joey>
<joey> i i you know i gave up it was like 1am </joey>
<joey> and i tried to boot it and it wasn't </joey>
<joey> working and um </joey>
<joey> i'm so i i was like all right fine i'll </joey>
<joey> just uh i'll give it a go tomorrow i'll </joey>
<joey> have a you know i have a clear head i'll </joey>
<connor> try all the problems i basically took it </connor>
<connor> all apart and rebuilt it all again going </connor>
<connor> very carefully through it all and </connor>
<connor> the same error kept happening and i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> what </connor>
<connor> like i even took like the cpu out put it </connor>
<connor> all back in make sure i did all that </connor>
<joey> right right i just like could not figure </joey>
<joey> out what's happening cause it wouldn't </joey>
<joey> go to the boot screen it was just black </joey>
<joey> screen and everything everything was </joey>
<connor> whizzing and you know glowing and all </connor>
<connor> that oh my god damn it </connor>
<connor> so then uh i'm talking to gigabyte and </connor>
<connor> i'm like hey </connor>
<joey> what's happening why isn't it working </joey>
<connor> everything is working why what what what </connor>
<joey> is happening yeah and so essentially </joey>
<joey> because i got a new </joey>
<joey> uh new specification it was a </joey>
<joey> motherboard that is a ddr5 ram </joey>
<connor> motherboard right now to those who don't </connor>
<connor> know anything about pcs uh basically </connor>
<connor> every now and then they they upgrade it </connor>
<connor> and they're like hey why don't we just </connor>
<connor> change the connectivity to [ __ ] with </connor>
<connor> everyone and uh </connor>
<connor> it does make it faster as well but they </connor>
<connor> change the specifications you have to </connor>
<connor> buy specific things yeah now this ram </connor>
<connor> slot that was called ddr5 i was like oh </connor>
<connor> okay i'll go on amazon and buy ddr5 ram </connor>
<connor> well apparently that's not what you're </connor>
<connor> allowed to do with ddr5 because it's new </connor>
<connor> uh motherboards have a set list of </connor>
<connor> specific ddr5 right that works with it </connor>
<connor> so not all ram so previously i think </connor>
<connor> ddr4 </connor>
<connor> like all ram basically worked with all </connor>
<connor> ddr4 i think yeah right i've never </connor>
<connor> mostly nearly all of it it was like yeah </connor>
<connor> you'd have to try real hard not to do it </connor>
<connor> so yeah so then i was like oh okay is </connor>
<connor> that the issue it must be so i ordered </connor>
<connor> this new ram plugged it in worked </connor>
<connor> perfectly right so i wasted like two </connor>
<connor> days i was like a whole extra day trying </connor>
<garnt> to fix this thing for no reason </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's the thing about building pcs </garnt>
<connor> sucks </connor>
<connor> to me instead of building another one </connor>
<connor> yeah to me i feel like to me the hardest </connor>
<joey> to me the hardest part is actually </joey>
<joey> selecting the parts right because like </joey>
<joey> building a pc like we said you know it's </joey>
<garnt> it's frustrating but you can like it's </garnt>
<garnt> you can get through it it's like lego i </garnt>
<connor> used pc part picker as well did you </connor>
<garnt> actually check for compatibility issues </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's all good </connor>
<connor> so it's all good go ahead go ahead you </connor>
<garnt> got debated </garnt>
<connor> damn yeah i mean it's it's it's it's </connor>
<connor> things like that that scare me because i </connor>
<connor> remember the first pc i built um the </connor>
<connor> biggest thing that went wrong was that i </connor>
<connor> had bought a motherboard that was not </connor>
<connor> compatible with the cpu </connor>
<connor> um because i had bought a i bought like </connor>
<connor> an intel cpu so i was just like okay </connor>
<connor> this me being a pc building virgin i was </connor>
<connor> i got i bought the motherboard i saw it </connor>
<connor> was intel compatible yeah not knowing at </connor>
<garnt> the time that there are different types </garnt>
<garnt> of cpus and different types of chips oh </garnt>
<connor> that happened to me as well yeah i had </connor>
<garnt> uh the motherboard as well the cooler </garnt>
<connor> doesn't fit but i just kind of shoved it </connor>
<connor> in place and now it's working </connor>
<connor> that's scary </connor>
<connor> it's working it's working was was this </connor>
<garnt> the first pc you built in japan or just </garnt>
<garnt> the first one ever </garnt>
<connor> third </connor>
<connor> in japan oh okay yeah i've built four </connor>
<garnt> pcs in my life how did you 20 mine </garnt>
<garnt> oh fan five </garnt>
<garnt> and you still somehow found a way to </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] it up </connor>
<connor> again i went to pc part picker yeah and </connor>
<connor> it said it was okay so i had faith in pc </connor>
<connor> part picker because in the previous four </connor>
<connor> times i've never had </connor>
<connor> uh an issue </connor>
<connor> but what happened was is that the cooler </connor>
<connor> they sent me was one that was a bit </connor>
<connor> older </connor>
<connor> so it didn't include the like the </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> adapter bracket to mount the cpu but </connor>
<connor> this thing had like sliders so i kind of </connor>
<connor> slid them in the middle which they would </connor>
<connor> they'd you could tell that things didn't </connor>
<connor> want to be and then i screwed it on </connor>
<connor> right it works it all feels good it'll </connor>
<garnt> feel secure did you call chris </garnt>
<connor> i didn't i didn't i could have done it </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> everyone's like called chris i'm like </joey>
<connor> what so he can tell me how his </connor>
<connor> mcdonald's tastes </connor>
<joey> can you talk about his mac yeah it's </joey>
<connor> pretty sure he did a live stream </connor>
<connor> yesterday and he was just eating </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i saw that and i was like chris like </connor>
<connor> this is not what i normally eat for </connor>
<connor> breakfast and i was like what a lie </connor>
<connor> sorry chris yeah </connor>
<connor> speaking of breakfast um so like </connor>
<connor> as you guys as you guys know like i've </connor>
<connor> been on like a little bit of a diet </connor>
<garnt> recently you know because i gained a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of weight when i went back to england </garnt>
<joey> um i wouldn't exactly say recently </joey>
<joey> you've been on a diet for a while now </joey>
<garnt> yeah because here's what happens right i </garnt>
<joey> go on a diet for like a month have like </joey>
<joey> a week holiday either with the boys with </joey>
<joey> sydney pig out a bit gain on getting a </joey>
<garnt> bit more weight so i'm still like i go </garnt>
<garnt> back to the diet after i'm back it's </garnt>
<connor> it's like a healthy lifestyle i don't </connor>
<joey> think it's a diet i think you should eat </joey>
<garnt> any help that's not a diet i mean i mean </garnt>
<joey> i am eating healthy but i am definitely </joey>
<joey> taking in less calories than i it would </joey>
<joey> take to maintain weight so i'm not like </joey>
<joey> i'm not like this isn't a speed run but </joey>
<joey> it's like a it's it's like a slow </joey>
<joey> lose weight gain a little bit back it's </joey>
<joey> a slow run yeah yeah it's a slow run </joey>
<joey> it's a slow run um and yeah the reason </joey>
<joey> is uh when i went back to england </joey>
<joey> literally in [ __ ] september or </joey>
<joey> something </joey>
<joey> uh i gained a [ __ ] ton of weight because </joey>
<joey> i ate like [ __ ] and i drank every day </joey>
<joey> and i think like it was the first time </joey>
<joey> that i could physically feel my body had </joey>
<joey> gained weight so much that i remember </joey>
<joey> like i saw like a few comments of like </joey>
<joey> the before and after like trash taste </joey>
<joey> recordings after i came back trash </joey>
<joey> changed recording i think you can see </joey>
<joey> that i definitely i definitely did i </joey>
<joey> wouldn't say like overweight or anything </joey>
<joey> closer but you could definitely see i </joey>
<joey> did gain a little bit of weight so i've </joey>
<joey> been like working to </joey>
<joey> since that one holiday working to uh </joey>
<joey> working to lose that weight and now that </joey>
<joey> i'm taking in lower calories every day </joey>
<joey> i'm doing things that i wouldn't </joey>
<joey> normally do </joey>
<joey> like uh having breakfast </joey>
<joey> because normally i just normally what </joey>
<joey> are you a functioning member of society </joey>
<joey> i know right i know right i never eat </joey>
<joey> breakfast getting on his high horse i </joey>
<joey> eat breakfast yeah so because like you </joey>
<joey> know because i'm taking less calories </joey>
<joey> i've been getting hungry in the mornings </joey>
<joey> and so i'm like oh okay maybe maybe it's </joey>
<joey> time to start being a normal person uh </joey>
<joey> like everyone else in society and start </joey>
<joey> having breakfast like people like like </joey>
<joey> people like to talk about so have you </joey>
<joey> been enjoying it so yeah so because that </joey>
<joey> doesn't sound like you're enjoying it i </joey>
<joey> mean it's not so much i'm enjoying it so </joey>
<joey> much as i'm eating because my body </joey>
<joey> craves something inside my stomach </joey>
<connor> because uh that's usually what hungary </connor>
<joey> is yeah that is that is what hunger is i </joey>
<connor> don't get hungry at all when i wake up </connor>
<connor> no i mean either i i never used to until </connor>
<garnt> i started having like salads and low </garnt>
<garnt> calorie meals every day and then i </garnt>
<joey> started getting hungry in the morning </joey>
<joey> it's weird i only feel hungry in the </joey>
<joey> morning when i'm on a trip </joey>
<joey> yeah well when i'm at home i don't </joey>
<garnt> actually know on a trip even on a trip </garnt>
<garnt> no really except if it's mcdonald's </garnt>
<garnt> breakfast </garnt>
<garnt> that that's the only breakfast i always </garnt>
<connor> got time no one wants my vacation i'm </connor>
<connor> like four meals a day sounds about yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i should eat yeah eat exactly </joey>
<joey> i wake up at like 7am in a hotel room </joey>
<garnt> like why am i so hungry yeah that's not </garnt>
<garnt> normal yeah so like me and sydney have </garnt>
<garnt> been starting to eat like cereal and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember like as i've like added cereal </garnt>
<garnt> to my diet if you've been following my </garnt>
<garnt> twitter you'd know what i'm about to say </garnt>
<garnt> but i remember like having i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like eating the cereal one day and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh no </garnt>
<garnt> i'm about to have a food take and </garnt>
<joey> and </joey>
<garnt> brace yourselves brace yourself </garnt>
<garnt> brace yourself i think i'm about to have </garnt>
<garnt> an opinion guys </garnt>
<garnt> um and i realized i think cereal is </garnt>
<joey> better without milk oh god he said it </joey>
<connor> oh he said it and i'm i'm 50 50. </connor>
<garnt> i like it with and without and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember i remember i remember just </garnt>
<joey> eating one day and i just said it </joey>
<joey> casually to sydney uh and she looked at </joey>
<joey> me like i just murdered someone she just </joey>
<joey> dropped the spirit </joey>
<joey> she dropped the spoon in the milk </joey>
<joey> is that really that bad of a take </joey>
<garnt> i mean apparently it is um </garnt>
<connor> like you know weetabix in the uk as a </connor>
<connor> kid i usually just eat those dry </connor>
<joey> i think because i can understand that </joey>
<joey> because when you put that in milk it </joey>
<garnt> just turns into wet cardboard yeah well </garnt>
<garnt> like i think it's better without milk i </garnt>
<connor> i think that's i think that's what </connor>
<connor> anxious it's my mood you know some days </connor>
<connor> i want because you know it's a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> challenge having to eat cereal without </connor>
<joey> milk it is it's like </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's it's like you're eating you're </joey>
<connor> eating scooby snacks like your dental </connor>
<garnt> workout is insane but like i i hate it </garnt>
<garnt> when you pour the milk in okay and then </garnt>
<connor> the timer starts because </connor>
<connor> just pour less milk i just put less than </connor>
<garnt> i need how much milk are you putting in </garnt>
<garnt> i'm putting in the normal amount of milk </garnt>
<garnt> but it's clearly you're not you're not </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's getting wet oh it's getting </garnt>
<connor> soggy i hate soggy soup you should put a </connor>
<connor> little bit in and then mix it like force </connor>
<garnt> it through the milk </garnt>
<garnt> but i also think that waters it down as </garnt>
<garnt> well you're having like cinnamon crunch </garnt>
<garnt> or something and then you i want the </garnt>
<garnt> cinnamon on the crunch i want the crunch </garnt>
<garnt> and the cinnamon together but like you </garnt>
<connor> put the milk in i wouldn't put any more </connor>
<connor> milk water down wouldn't putting more </connor>
<connor> milk water in there no that's what </connor>
<garnt> that's what i'm saying i don't want any </garnt>
<joey> milk in there because i like the taste </joey>
<garnt> of cereal as it is but if you just put a </garnt>
<connor> little bit of milk just to wet it yeah </connor>
<connor> just a wedding </connor>
<joey> yeah it like brings out the flavor i </joey>
<connor> literally put like the bare minimum milk </connor>
<connor> if i do and then i just keep like </connor>
<connor> rinsing it through the milk yeah that's </connor>
<joey> exactly what i do so that by the time </joey>
<joey> you finish it you only have like a tiny </joey>
<garnt> pool of milk do you think it tastes </garnt>
<connor> better with the milk in it though yeah i </connor>
<connor> just because most of the time when it's </connor>
<connor> a no milk i'm like tired by the end of </connor>
<connor> it i'm </connor>
<joey> not that i really eat a lot of cereal </joey>
<connor> anymore but yeah every time i do feel </connor>
<joey> like a cereal like bottle i just yeah </joey>
<connor> it's it's milk </connor>
<connor> you know i just </connor>
<connor> is is cereal that good for you i just </connor>
<joey> feel like cereal is like you don't need </joey>
<joey> it that much well it depends on the </joey>
<joey> cereal yeah it depends on the cereal </joey>
<joey> like you know a bowl of fruit loops </joey>
<joey> isn't going to be like breakfast is </joey>
<joey> pretty good right i like bran flakes </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> but then i bought this bran flakes in </connor>
<joey> japan and it had like fruit in it and so </joey>
<connor> i was like oh okay that sounds nice it's </connor>
<connor> got dried fruit yeah i like that and </connor>
<joey> then i look at the back of the package </joey>
<joey> i'm like a normal serving contains 50 </joey>
<joey> grams of sugar what </joey>
<connor> what </connor>
<joey> what are they putting in this this </joey>
<connor> i think i think that's why i stopped </connor>
<connor> eating cereal not just because like i </connor>
<connor> started to not get hungry in the </connor>
<joey> mornings i was like so bad for you but </joey>
<garnt> yeah a lot of it is depending on the ceo </garnt>
<garnt> it depends on the cereal that you buy i </garnt>
<joey> mean yeah i'm sure you know if you're </joey>
<garnt> eating like a bowl of wheat wheat picks </garnt>
<garnt> right then like yeah obviously that's </garnt>
<garnt> got a lot of you know health benefits </garnt>
<garnt> but also i don't want to start my </garnt>
<joey> morning with wet cardboard in my mouth </joey>
<joey> you know i just don't want to start a </joey>
<garnt> morning like that i'm sorry maybe you </garnt>
<joey> just hate wheat to mix jokes i do </joey>
<joey> i do i [ __ ] hate it i feel like maybe </joey>
<garnt> there's just no saving like even like </garnt>
<garnt> with milk or without milk it just tastes </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] to you i'm going to be </joey>
<joey> so non-australian when i say this i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hate weepics it's it's like and </joey>
<joey> you know people are like yeah just like </joey>
<connor> but you can just like add sugar or like </connor>
<connor> yogurt or like you know other things </connor>
<joey> into it i'm like well then that kind of </joey>
<garnt> takes away from the health benefits give </garnt>
<joey> me the yogurt just yeah just yeah i'll </joey>
<garnt> just eat a top of yogurt that's fine see </garnt>
<garnt> like for me like cereal has always been </garnt>
<garnt> even even now as i see it i've always </garnt>
<garnt> felt that it feels like a snack right </garnt>
<garnt> because to me like to me people like </garnt>
<garnt> people have told me that they can't get </garnt>
<joey> full </joey>
<garnt> having cereal without milk and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like well to me it's like i'm not even </garnt>
<garnt> that hungry and breakfast you know to me </garnt>
<joey> like cereal is just like a quick snack </joey>
<joey> before we get to lunch yeah that's your </joey>
<connor> chat in my in my lifetime i think i've </connor>
<connor> eaten more cereal past 1 a.m than i </connor>
<joey> actually have in the morning like it is </joey>
<connor> it is the most perfect midnight snack i </connor>
<connor> really don't like eating cereal in the </connor>
<joey> evenings well what about like late at </joey>
<joey> night like as i mean last night because </joey>
<garnt> i've had it i always actually really </garnt>
<garnt> i wish i liked it because then i feel </garnt>
<connor> like that opens a lot of possibilities </connor>
<garnt> snacking options unfortunately i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know what you snack at midnight then </garnt>
<garnt> what's like your mid your go-to midnight </garnt>
<garnt> snack </garnt>
<garnt> i try and avoid it obviously at all </garnt>
<joey> costs but crisps crisp stuff yeah but i </joey>
<connor> mean </connor>

<garnt> kid because i can't remember because i </garnt>
<garnt> used to eat it a lot as a kid and i </garnt>
<garnt> don't remember the exact point that i </garnt>
<garnt> stopped eating cereal </garnt>
<connor> i show up to toast when i was a kid yeah </connor>
<connor> after halfway through school i must have </connor>
<connor> decided that i prefer toast so i eat </connor>
<joey> four pieces of toast i think i had a </joey>
<joey> very brief period from cereal to toast </joey>
<joey> and then it just very quickly went from </joey>
<connor> toast to nothing but i feel like toast </connor>
<connor> and cereal in like the same category of </connor>
<joey> not very good nutritional value but it's </joey>
<connor> not the worst thing in the world yeah </connor>
<joey> like it's not bad but it's also not </joey>
<joey> great actually you know the moment i </joey>
<joey> actually know the moment i switched from </joey>
<joey> toast to no breakfast was when i started </joey>
<joey> having coffees in the morning yeah no </joey>
<connor> tea for me too yeah like just having a </connor>
<connor> piece of toast with a hot drink you </connor>
<joey> can't beat it not even that for me it </joey>
<connor> was just like just replace the toast </connor>
<connor> with a cup of coffee wait what wait wait </connor>
<connor> yeah what like from like like i mean i i </connor>
<connor> do that now yeah i do that now as well </connor>
<joey> but like from like i'd say for me maybe </joey>
<joey> like 17 18. i was just like yep coffee </joey>
<connor> that's it that's all i need i would eat </connor>
<connor> toast in japan but the bread sucks and </connor>
<connor> the other place you get good bread from </connor>
<connor> is like bakeries and they're stupidly </connor>
<connor> expensive yeah yeah it's like 50 bucks </connor>
<joey> for a slice of bread what what like irks </joey>
<joey> me about a lot about like the normal </joey>
<joey> japanese bread that they sell </joey>
<joey> supermarkets is just how [ __ ] thick </joey>
<connor> it is </connor>
<joey> it's ridiculous it's like insane it's </joey>
<joey> like that i'm like it could barely fit </joey>
<connor> in my [ __ ] toes </connor>
<connor> that's true i'm not gonna lie right i </connor>
<connor> know this is gonna make me sound </connor>
<connor> privileged as [ __ ] yeah i don't wanna </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] cut the bread </connor>
<connor> i wanna just chuck that [ __ ] in the </connor>
<connor> toaster i've just woken up right i don't </connor>
<connor> want to have to get the breadboard out </connor>
<connor> the bread knife out </connor>
<connor> oh it's too thick oh i've cut it badly i </connor>
<connor> just want the perfect slice this is not </connor>
<joey> a privileged thing this is just this is </joey>
<garnt> absolutely a privileged thing what are </garnt>
<joey> you on this is this is why they say the </joey>
<garnt> best invention since sliced bread </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's literally it's literally a </connor>
<connor> human revolution right don't you just </connor>
<connor> want to just do you really do do you </connor>
<garnt> really slice bread really that </garnt>
<joey> revolutionary i want that one like </joey>
<joey> i want to know why i've never thought </joey>
<joey> about actually the history of that </joey>
<joey> saying it literally it takes 10 seconds </joey>
<connor> dude but it's not it's not the act of </connor>
<connor> cutting it it's the cleaning up i have </connor>
<connor> to clean up a [ __ ] breadboard a bread </connor>
<connor> knife now just for like one slice of </connor>
<connor> bread like if i just have if i just have </connor>
<joey> the sliced bread i chucked that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> what about if you just buy the loaf of </joey>
<joey> bread for example the uncut loaf of </joey>
<joey> bread on that day you slice it up </joey>
<joey> preemptively you put it back in the bag </joey>
<joey> and now you've got no you've got to do </joey>
<garnt> that i did that no that's [ __ ] up i </garnt>
<joey> mean i can't really really like speed </joey>
<garnt> run it going bad no </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't think i've ever bought </garnt>
<garnt> breads that's not been pre-sliced now </garnt>
<joey> that i think about it in my life see at </joey>
<joey> least wow privilege right now </joey>
<connor> you call me privilege for slashing my </connor>
<connor> bread at least i've done the leg work </connor>
<connor> i've been there i've been in the </connor>
<joey> trenches sliced my own bread </joey>
<joey> i've lived that life i've lived a lot on </joey>
<garnt> that now </garnt>
<garnt> like aside from like you know [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> baguettes or whatever yeah i've i've </garnt>
<joey> never actually sliced my own like wow </joey>
<joey> loaf of bread </joey>
<joey> yeah call me privilege call me favorites </joey>
<joey> upper classes right here this is like </joey>
<joey> the the like the opposite of like you </joey>
<joey> know people from england have never </joey>
<joey> cooked like their own rice or something </joey>
<joey> you know me an asian i've never sliced </joey>
<garnt> my own bread before </garnt>
<connor> there is a bakery near me that i really </connor>
<joey> like yeah </joey>
<joey> the loaf of bread is uh </joey>
<connor> six bucks i think how being half half a </connor>
<connor> standard size </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah okay half a standard size i'm </connor>
<connor> sure it's great i'm sure it's great i </connor>
<connor> just don't want to pay six bucks for </connor>
<joey> half half my life i've had yeah because </joey>
<joey> like mine i have to cut it </joey>
<connor> oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me yeah like for six </connor>
<joey> bucks i'm not [ __ ] cutting that yeah </joey>
<joey> that's ridiculous i mean </joey>
<joey> i thought that as well but then at my </joey>
<connor> previous place we lived right next to </connor>
<connor> like this like really high-end bakery </connor>
<connor> and like a full loaf like like this big </connor>
<joey> was like nine bucks or something which </joey>
<connor> is like [ __ ] audacious still still </connor>
<garnt> expensive but then and i thought it was </garnt>
<connor> just like a scam being like oh jack just </connor>
<joey> this is just japanese </joey>
<joey> yeah this is just japanese people not </joey>
<joey> knowing good bread but then when i </joey>
<joey> bought it and i had it and you know i </joey>
<joey> had to slice it myself god forbid i had </joey>
<joey> to slice it myself and uh yeah i made </joey>
<joey> toast with it i'm like okay </joey>
<connor> i can see why this is nine bucks no no </connor>
<connor> it was amazing it was very good but it </connor>
<joey> was not no no i wouldn't pay nine bucks </joey>
<joey> for that outside of japan is what i'm </joey>
<connor> saying </connor>
<connor> why why would you pay for inside japan </connor>
<joey> because every other [ __ ] brand of </joey>
<joey> japan sucks </joey>
<joey> and it's like look don't get me wrong </joey>
<joey> i'm not [ __ ] buying this every day </joey>
<joey> for me this is like this loaf of bread i </joey>
<joey> would this nine dollar life of bread i </joey>
<joey> would buy was like maybe like once every </joey>
<garnt> like couple of months how good was that </garnt>
<garnt> like in terms of </garnt>
<garnt> bread in general this nine this nine </garnt>
<joey> dollar bread compared to like it was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] good like it was better than </joey>
<connor> like any like supermarket bread i would </connor>
<connor> buy in like australia or like anywhere </connor>
<connor> outside of japan so it was like i've had </connor>
<connor> the same bread because i bought it it </connor>
<connor> was it was good it was really really </connor>
<connor> good like i was like okay this actually </connor>
<connor> tastes like </connor>
<garnt> how does it compare to like say the </garnt>
<connor> bread in europe you know i think the </connor>
<connor> bread that i had in france and germany </connor>
<garnt> was better well yeah oh no obviously </garnt>
<garnt> i'm asking how much better was it than </garnt>
<garnt> this top-tier bread top-tier nine-dollar </garnt>
<garnt> bread that we have brought in like </garnt>
<joey> marginally it got to that taste where it </joey>
<joey> was good like it was very good yeah </joey>
<joey> right but then that the one in germany </joey>
<joey> or france will cost like </joey>
<joey> one euro fifty yeah obviously yeah it's </joey>
<connor> not i mean you know opposite opposite </connor>
<joey> opposite with rice right if you're </joey>
<joey> having rice in europe then obviously the </joey>
<joey> one in japan is going to taste better </joey>
<connor> just because you know in the uk it was </connor>
<connor> like what were pound for warburtons is </connor>
<connor> it warburton's the toast bread i love </connor>
<garnt> that yeah it is very good bread </garnt>
<connor> although i would not and even in the uk </connor>
<garnt> right when you buy animals when you buy </garnt>
<garnt> the loaf bread at the supermarket the </garnt>
<connor> one that isn't cut yeah you can be like </connor>
<garnt> can you can you can you cut it for me </garnt>
<garnt> you can buy uncut bread at the </garnt>
<connor> supermarket yeah we have baker we have </connor>
<joey> bakeries in the you know we have </joey>
<joey> bakeries in the supermarket do you know </joey>
<joey> what a bakery is there's a bakery right </joey>
<garnt> and then when you get your your pastries </garnt>
<garnt> wherever they all sell loaves of bread </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> pastries i've never seen a loaf of bread </connor>
<connor> yeah they have it and if you want the </connor>
<connor> loaf of bread uncut you can who does </connor>
<joey> that who asks for that a lot of people </joey>
<joey> do because a lot of people like you know </joey>
<joey> if they're making their own stuff then </joey>
<joey> it's not not a big deal that they're </joey>
<joey> cutting because they want it because the </joey>
<connor> moment you cut it the time is ticking </connor>
<connor> it's already going bad right yeah that's </connor>
<connor> why you don't want to cut the whole </connor>
<connor> bread then put it back in because then </connor>
<connor> those slices that might have tasted a </connor>
<connor> bit fresher 2-3 days are gonna be </connor>
<joey> rock-solid did you never put like your </joey>
<joey> bread in the freezer </joey>
<connor> what no because that's the way to make </connor>
<joey> bread long-lasting that's what we're </joey>
<joey> used to in australia i'm sure a </joey>
<connor> yeah it's to preserve exactly it's the </connor>
<connor> british it's 20 000 degrees it's to make </connor>
<garnt> the bread last longer that's like </garnt>
<garnt> putting ice in beer you know like like </garnt>
<garnt> that's the the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] you just don't do and like you </connor>
<connor> gotta understand like the loaf of bread </connor>
<joey> in the uk and in europe it's bought on </joey>
<connor> the day intended to all be used on that </connor>
<joey> day oh okay it's not supposed to be </joey>
<joey> obviously you can have it a day yeah </joey>
<connor> that's not a big deal but but we don't </connor>
<connor> you know freeze the bed because because </connor>
<connor> they're strange because the australian </connor>
<joey> lives are bred there's like 20 [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> slices right so even a family can't go </joey>
<garnt> through it in like a day how big is this </garnt>
<connor> bread like this just buy a smaller like </connor>
<connor> plus a loaf of bread like this yeah it's </connor>
<joey> like it's like regular like this big or </joey>
<joey> like 20 slices in it so obviously </joey>
<connor> yeah does it taste as good i want an </connor>
<garnt> image of this </garnt>
<joey> exactly i need an image of australian </joey>
<connor> bread no yeah so what you i don't </connor>
<connor> believe that it's like the bigfoot of </connor>
<joey> bread this can't be real yeah so like </joey>
<joey> you know just to make the bread last a </joey>
<connor> little bit longer because you don't want </connor>
<connor> to have [ __ ] loafs of bread every day </connor>
<connor> right especially if you're living in </connor>
<garnt> like my household which was kind of half </garnt>
<joey> rice half bread </joey>
<joey> right um </joey>
<connor> like this yeah i'm not even the bread </connor>
<connor> guys like the size of the uk one but </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> but they're way thinner older </joey>
<joey> yeah but like anyway so like yeah to </joey>
<joey> make the bread last longer uh we'd put </joey>
<joey> you know we would use the slices we </joey>
<joey> needed to use on the day we buy it and </joey>
<joey> then we immediately go into the freezer </joey>
<joey> because it'll last like an extra two or </joey>
<joey> three weeks and then you just and if you </joey>
<joey> want it if you want a slice of bread you </joey>
<joey> grab it you know obviously it's frozen </joey>
<joey> because it's been in the freezer if you </joey>
<joey> throw it into the toaster </joey>
<garnt> instantly defrosted tastes like i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> even the bread guy and i would never put </garnt>
<garnt> myself down to such savagery as [ __ ] as </garnt>
<garnt> pudding as putting uh bread in the </garnt>
<joey> freezer i'm sorry you higher privileged </joey>
<joey> people could buy bread whenever you </joey>
<joey> wanted my family was saving money all </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<connor> your family had a financial advisor joey </connor>
<connor> what are you talking about </connor>
<joey> and that financial advisor was like </joey>
<joey> freeze your brand you got to change some </joey>
<joey> things around here you want it you want </joey>
<joey> that you want that new apartment you </joey>
<joey> better freeze your goddamn bread boy </joey>
<joey> it's the asian mentality yeah yeah you </joey>
<joey> put everything to put everything in the </joey>
<connor> freezer last longer save money yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly no i think this is [ __ ] this </connor>
<connor> is just your excuses for living like </connor>
<joey> savages </joey>
<joey> yeah we're australian yeah </joey>
<joey> if it was something like oh we don't </joey>
<connor> want the spiders to get it okay well </connor>
<joey> that too no no because you would get a </joey>
<garnt> bread bin yeah no because the bread bin </garnt>
<joey> would be [ __ ] annihilated by the ants </joey>
<garnt> what yeah </garnt>
<joey> because we're in australia this you </joey>
<joey> can't escape from the wildlife </joey>
<joey> you leave the door open for one second </joey>
<joey> too long your house is [ __ ] overridden </joey>
<garnt> by ants </garnt>
<garnt> the one thing that makes me not proud uh </garnt>
<connor> to be thai is one thing that they do </connor>
<connor> and i just said it they they put ice in </connor>
<connor> their beer that's disgusting and like </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> i mean i i see the logic because </connor>
<connor> obviously it's like 30 35 degree weather </connor>
<garnt> beer's gonna get warm uh beer's gonna </garnt>
<garnt> get warm a lot faster but even me even </garnt>
<garnt> me i'm just like no no ice my beer </garnt>
<garnt> please no we're not we're not we're not </garnt>
<joey> going to go is that like an option you </joey>
<joey> can get at any restaurant </joey>
<joey> um they normally was that like a </joey>
<garnt> backyard thing no no by default okay by </garnt>
<garnt> default in thailand in a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> restaurants </garnt>
<garnt> especially if it's open air right um you </garnt>
<garnt> order a beer they uh they take a cartel </garnt>
<garnt> they say they give you the beer and they </garnt>
<garnt> give you a glass and they put ice in it </garnt>
<garnt> and then they pour the beer in the glass </garnt>
<garnt> full of ice and you have to specifically </garnt>
<garnt> ask in a lot of places for them not to </garnt>
<joey> do that right </joey>
<connor> um we're just trying to hide the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> yeah is there anything worse than </joey>
<joey> watered down thai beer </joey>
<garnt> what a nightmare i mean i mean you see </garnt>
<garnt> you do that with a chang beer and it's </garnt>
<joey> just like this beer was already watered </joey>
<garnt> down and uh you're watering it down even </garnt>
<connor> more beer flavoured water </connor>
<connor> sorry sorry germans watching this yeah </connor>
<joey> the germans had a heart attack listening </joey>
<joey> to that like </joey>
<garnt> but i've never i've never put bread in </garnt>
<garnt> the freezer i'll say that i'll say that </garnt>
<garnt> we've never put bread in the freezer hey </garnt>
<connor> man </connor>
<connor> i'm not doing that i'm not saying you </connor>
<joey> should i was just saying that's what we </joey>
<joey> did and uh i know i thought it was </joey>
<garnt> normal </garnt>
<garnt> is it is it like do you have to like put </garnt>
<garnt> like eggs in the fridge </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i can't i can't i can't remember where i </garnt>
<garnt> heard it from where like if you have to </garnt>
<garnt> put like some things in the fridge or </garnt>
<connor> some things are fine </connor>
<garnt> and how it's cleaned right i believe in </garnt>
<garnt> some places in europe </garnt>
<garnt> uh they recommend you not to fridge the </garnt>
<connor> eggs can you google this </connor>
<connor> if i recall correctly i think we didn't </connor>
<connor> keep our eggs in the fridge yes growing </connor>
<garnt> up yeah don't think we did i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> we did either in japan you're supposed </garnt>
<connor> to keep the </connor>
<joey> eggs in the fridge or i don't think yeah </joey>
<joey> you have to oh yeah you have to keep it </joey>
<joey> in the fridge european countries say you </joey>
<joey> do not yeah that's right that's right </joey>
<joey> really that's right i don't we had it in </joey>
<joey> a cupboard </joey>
<joey> really yeah well that's weird and in </joey>
<connor> america i think they put it in the </connor>
<joey> fridge i don't know about japan i don't </joey>
<joey> know as someone who's was just born of </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> just kind of you know every time i went </joey>
<joey> shopping with my mom and we'd buy a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> the moment we should like open the front </joey>
<joey> door she'd be like eggs in the fridge </joey>
<joey> now quickly they're gonna go bad </joey>
<joey> apparently it's illegal to wash eggs in </joey>
<joey> europe so yeah like i've got like the </joey>
<joey> stuff illegal so you're putting the </joey>
<joey> fridge it's actually gonna grow back to </joey>
<joey> you what the egg police are gonna </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] rock up to my door be like um </joey>
<connor> i think it means for like transporting </connor>
<connor> it and stuff </connor>
<garnt> yeah we don't yeah we kill them in the </garnt>
<connor> cupboard i remember that yeah yeah like </connor>
<connor> bread you've never put in the fridge </connor>
<garnt> eggs we've never put in the fridge </garnt>
<garnt> potatoes i don't think we've got that </garnt>
<garnt> potatoes were in the pantry yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because i think if you put in the fridge </garnt>
<garnt> it grows sprouts right i don't know or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that i don't know i know </garnt>
<joey> i know potatoes you're not supposed to </joey>
<garnt> put in the fridge and onions yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> think cause i feel like rules different </garnt>
<garnt> with every different country i go to </garnt>
<garnt> because in thailand it's just like 90 </garnt>
<connor> percent of everything goes in the fridge </connor>
<connor> yeah because it's so much [ __ ] hotter </connor>
<connor> there yeah yeah it's hot it goes yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah hot and humid is like not the best </garnt>
<connor> in </connor>
<connor> best temperature and conditions for </connor>
<connor> bacteria right so yeah yeah exactly well </connor>
<joey> like other things you shouldn't like </joey>
<joey> like chocolate you're not supposed to </joey>
<garnt> put in the fridge i know i like putting </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate in the fridge wait why do you </garnt>
<joey> why i think it's because like if you put </joey>
<joey> chocolate in the fridge then it turns </joey>
<joey> white and that just means that like it's </joey>
<joey> gone bad what i've never seen i like </joey>
<connor> chocolate in the fridge this sounds like </connor>
<connor> some [ __ ] i i love my chocolate it's </connor>
<joey> hot </joey>
<connor> into it yeah white stuff is not that the </connor>
<connor> chocolate it's just some other stuff </connor>
<joey> what what is that some other stuff i'm </joey>
<connor> worried </connor>
<connor> i don't know like i i i always heard </connor>
<connor> yeah i always heard you shouldn't put </connor>
<connor> chocolate in the fridge for too long </connor>
<joey> or like you could you can't let it like </joey>
<joey> sit in the fridge i don't know maybe </joey>
<joey> that's just me </joey>
<joey> it's either sugar or fat but it's not </joey>
<garnt> the chocolate oh yeah okay yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> definitely prefer my chocolate in the </garnt>
<garnt> fridge okay there's there's two like </garnt>
<garnt> states of chocolate that are like my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite one is just like in the fridge </garnt>
<garnt> it's hard you get a nice nice crunchy </garnt>
<garnt> bite out of it and the second stage </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like like cheaper chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> it's like when it's perfectly room </garnt>
<garnt> temperature but not melted </garnt>
<joey> if if like when you put in your mouth it </joey>
<joey> easily melts yeah yeah you put it in </joey>
<garnt> your mouth and it doesn't like it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't melt but it just like dissolves </garnt>
<connor> in your mouth right that's like that's </connor>
<connor> like my second state of chocolate </connor>
<connor> because you don't like that no it's like </connor>
<connor> it gets all over your gums you're like </connor>
<garnt> you don't even need to chew at that </garnt>
<connor> point you just put it you just let it </connor>
<joey> melt and it just like disintegrates i </joey>
<connor> don't want it to do that's like a meat </connor>
<joey> when it's cold you can like chew into it </joey>
<connor> it like snaps apart and breaks into nice </connor>
<joey> chocolate bites i like that i don't like </joey>
<joey> it i don't like that too much because </joey>
<joey> i've had some instances where i'm like </joey>
<joey> what's going to break first the </joey>
<joey> chocolate or my teeth </joey>
<joey> i don't want to find yeah there are some </joey>
<garnt> chocolates are like way too hard for </garnt>
<connor> that yeah there are some like the </connor>
<garnt> caramel bars i've never put in the </garnt>
<joey> fridge oh my gosh it's hard if you put </joey>
<connor> hard caramel in the fridge like goodbye </connor>
<joey> it's just literally jawbreaking you're </joey>
<joey> just eating rocks at that point yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah what about ice cream do you like do </joey>
<joey> you like your ice cream like hard or </joey>
<garnt> like soft serve do you like biting into </garnt>
<garnt> your eyes heart yeah like lollies like </garnt>
<connor> like do you do you like ice cream though </connor>
<connor> okay yeah that's </connor>
<connor> i guess </connor>
<connor> that's an ice block your ice cream hard </connor>
<garnt> or soft </garnt>
<garnt> well you've had like feasts right where </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's like an ice cream one you </garnt>
<garnt> know if he's wears like a like a </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate in the middle and it's like an </garnt>
<connor> ice cream around it oh you mean like uh </connor>
<connor> that's more of a </connor>
<connor> that's not so much ice cream though it's </connor>
<connor> more of like a ice cream bar i'd say </connor>
<connor> like it's more of a it's got like a </connor>
<garnt> layer around it yeah because i know a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of people they cannot take like they </garnt>
<connor> kind of cannot chew on like cold things </connor>
<connor> or like really cool things yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> at all i can't yeah can you not no i </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i i love it too much where if </garnt>
<connor> like i start chewing on ice yeah i </connor>
<connor> always hear you're like you'll be </connor>
<joey> talking to someone you're here like </joey>
<joey> just looking it's gone </joey>
<connor> it's gone it's gone god's not even </connor>
<connor> looking at you just staring off to the </connor>
<joey> distance like doing it crunching </joey>
<joey> i love crunching on ice </joey>
<connor> it's the best texture i love it i don't </connor>
<joey> know why i just it's </joey>
<connor> it's not good for my teeth at all i've </connor>
<joey> been told by my dentist and pretty much </joey>
<joey> everyone around me to like not do that </joey>
<joey> but like there will be times where i'm </joey>
<garnt> like i i literally have to like </garnt>
<garnt> consciously not put ices in my drinks </garnt>
<garnt> now because i do it so much that </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's advised me to not do it is </garnt>
<joey> that the real reason why you don't put </joey>
<joey> ice in your beer </joey>
<joey> i don't wanna chill on this ice man [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> the beer have you been in a social </connor>
<connor> situation or you like drinking your </connor>
<connor> drink and then you're like all right i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> take this ice i'm gonna put it in my </connor>
<connor> mouth yeah but the cube's a little too </connor>
<connor> big </connor>
<connor> and your mouth's really cold but it's in </connor>
<connor> your mouth right and it's in there it's </connor>
<connor> in one of your cheeks if your thing is </connor>
<connor> freezing </connor>
<joey> you have that moment where you're like </joey>
<garnt> if i i'm you're talking to someone you </garnt>
<garnt> don't look like a weirdo you're like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah if i bite into this it's gonna look </garnt>
<garnt> weird but if i swallow this i might </garnt>
<garnt> choke and look weird so what do i do i </garnt>
<connor> need to reply in 10 seconds and they </connor>
<connor> stop speaking do i spit the ice back in </connor>
<connor> the drink and look like a [ __ ] weirdo </connor>
<connor> because if i if i go </connor>
<connor> so you were safe </connor>
<joey> have you been in that situation yeah </joey>
<joey> many times and i'm like i'm like my </joey>
<connor> go-to option is normally like just pray </connor>
<connor> that you can swallow this without dying </connor>
<joey> just pray really yeah my my option is to </joey>
<joey> just start crunching on that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i mean that's the least weird one yeah </joey>
<garnt> that is the least weird one i've never </garnt>
<garnt> had an issue because i'm like constantly </garnt>
<connor> crunching anyway i can't crunch it i'm </connor>
<connor> always definitely worried that they're </connor>
<joey> just going to think i'm a [ __ ] weirdo </joey>
<joey> when i spit it back in but yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because if you spit it back in they'll </joey>
<joey> be like what the [ __ ] yeah spitting it </joey>
<joey> yeah spitting it back in </joey>
<connor> is the worst but my teeth can't bite </connor>
<joey> into it but i also don't want to be that </joey>
<joey> guy who's like </joey>
<joey> yeah so i've been in a situation before </joey>
<connor> keep throwing an idea where i'm like all </connor>
<connor> right boys here we go this might be it i </connor>
<garnt> might be dead how many ice cubes have </garnt>
<garnt> you swallowed in your life like </garnt>
<garnt> uncountable uncountable over 10. </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's a lot like normally i would </connor>
<joey> just try and like </joey>
<joey> come up with a pb would kind of </joey>
<joey> kind of try and move it around to get it </joey>
<joey> to a swallowable size all right right </joey>
<connor> as fast as you can or maybe just get it </connor>
<garnt> so that it doesn't have harsh edges </garnt>
<garnt> wait you've swallowed ice cubes with </garnt>
<connor> hard edges yeah like where they're like </connor>
<garnt> full cue </garnt>
<garnt> no [ __ ] way no [ __ ] way yeah i i </garnt>
<garnt> would not i would be so terrified </garnt>
<garnt> normally the technique but the problem </garnt>
<garnt> is that this is where the technique </garnt>
<garnt> fails is that i'm normally doing this </garnt>
<garnt> after i've drank it so now i can't use </garnt>
<garnt> water to assist it flowing when i </garnt>
<garnt> swallow right so i have to swallow a dry </garnt>
<garnt> ice cube yeah i was saying that like </garnt>
<garnt> like you just like take a swig of water </garnt>
<garnt> or something that will like you know </garnt>
<connor> that would like help melt it a bit </connor>
<connor> i just swallow it and uh yeah one time i </connor>
<connor> think i had a really big scare one time </connor>
<connor> because it got stuck </connor>
<connor> but i remember i had to play it cool </connor>
<joey> yeah because i was like i don't want to </joey>
<joey> make them do a heimlich maneuver on me </joey>
<connor> so i would just kind of keep like </connor>
<connor> keep trying to swallow it before i take </connor>
<connor> a breath and then eventually it went </connor>
<joey> down and oh my god my esophagus was in </joey>
<joey> so much [ __ ] pain yeah and by the way </joey>
<joey> never risk your life for a bit of social </joey>
<garnt> uh awkwardness just i should have just </garnt>
<garnt> spat it out but yeah it was it was </garnt>
<connor> terrifying just chewing it like a like i </connor>
<connor> could feel it because it was so big i </connor>
<connor> could feel it going down </connor>
<joey> and then getting stuck a little bit </joey>
<joey> sometimes yeah and then waiting and then </joey>
<joey> obviously it was because obviously my </joey>
<connor> body's really warm yeah so it would </connor>
<garnt> slowly like dissolve you just gave your </garnt>
<garnt> esophagus like freeze burn what's </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] hurt </connor>
<garnt> so much yeah no [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> don't do that </garnt>
<garnt> uh the lengths that a british person </garnt>
<joey> will go to not be awkward in their </joey>
<joey> social circle just spit it out at that </joey>
<joey> point just </joey>
<joey> just spit it out you know what </joey>
<joey> i was playing like the most </joey>
<garnt> important you know you know i will say </garnt>
<garnt> if i didn't love chewing on ice so much </garnt>
<connor> i would probably do the same thing </connor>
<connor> i would rather </connor>
<connor> potentially risk having a choking uh </connor>
<connor> incident as opposed to having 10 seconds </connor>
<joey> of social awkward interaction yeah </joey>
<connor> that's why really yeah yeah that's the </connor>
<joey> british in me we just can't we can't do </joey>
<joey> it i don't know man like just like yeah </joey>
<connor> it's gonna be like yeah it's going to be </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] weird you know like speeding </connor>
<connor> your ice </connor>
<connor> drink or whatever but like it's like </connor>
<joey> i don't know how many situations can you </joey>
<joey> think of where you've saved in to dinner </joey>
<joey> with some other person right what's the </joey>
<connor> first date right first date with someone </connor>
<joey> yeah first day for example right if </joey>
<joey> you're on the first date with someone </joey>
<joey> right how many times have you gone to a </joey>
<joey> restaurant with say another a lady right </joey>
<joey> and she's gone </joey>
<joey> anyway yeah and then that at that point </joey>
<joey> your head's like no </joey>
<connor> wait wait i thought it would probably be </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> when is winning spitting ice back in </joey>
<connor> your glass the game changer i'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna lie it's one of probably the least </connor>
<connor> attractive things you can do it looks </connor>
<connor> very unattractive don't you think so </connor>
<connor> someone just </connor>
<joey> i think so </joey>
<connor> no no no no i think something that's </connor>
<connor> less attractive is you choking on an </connor>
<connor> iceberg </connor>
<garnt> i've actually been in the situation </garnt>
<garnt> before actually not like </garnt>
<garnt> and i haven't swallowed it i've just i </garnt>
<connor> just remembered right on a date you want </connor>
<connor> they want to know that you swallow </connor>
<connor> your will </connor>
<joey> oh my god </joey>
<garnt> they didn't even notice it they didn't </garnt>
<joey> even know that you just swallowed an ice </joey>
<joey> cream </joey>
<joey> my chest is like </joey>
<garnt> no it's it's it's the tissue technique </garnt>
<garnt> right it's the tissue technique no no </garnt>
<connor> it's not for a big ice cube they're </connor>
<connor> going to see your tissue on the table </connor>
<garnt> you don't put it back on the table you </garnt>
<garnt> go for the tissue you pretend you're </garnt>
<garnt> just wiping your mouth or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like just </garnt>
<joey> you've got to be subtle </joey>
<joey> because now they're going to think oh </joey>
<connor> this guy just choked out a massive </connor>
<connor> loogie in front of me this is this ice </connor>
<joey> cream </joey>
<garnt> this this ice cube </garnt>
<joey> when you when you like exude another </joey>
<garnt> exude when you take out an ice cube out </garnt>
<joey> of your mouth you don't go </joey>
<garnt> no no no god this was this was like a </garnt>
<garnt> maybe a what the how big of the ice cube </garnt>
<garnt> we saw this is like a four four </garnt>
<connor> centimeter cubed a four </connor>
<joey> four by four by four by four centimeters </joey>
<joey> let's say let's say that's a big [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> ice cube dude yeah that's what i'm </connor>
<joey> talking about okay okay no no if it's </joey>
<garnt> that size i never take the risk of like </garnt>
<connor> putting it in my mouth yeah i'm not </connor>
<connor> putting in my mouth i was dumb i don't </connor>
<joey> know why i did it because like at that </joey>
<joey> point right at that point um you </joey>
<connor> probably would have hardly even drank </connor>
<joey> your drink right because huh i'm the </joey>
<connor> speed let's see </connor>
<connor> it's like gone like it's let's say it's </connor>
<connor> a banging cocktail yeah like it's an </connor>
<connor> absolute winner yeah i love the cocktail </connor>
<connor> so much or maybe you know uh </connor>
<connor> i i'm like i want to order a bunch more </connor>
<connor> i want to try for more so i drink it all </connor>
<connor> and the ice cubes are still fully formed </connor>
<garnt> because like at that point like the ice </garnt>
<joey> cube just doesn't feel nice like like </joey>
<garnt> like if you can feel the edges on the </garnt>
<garnt> ice cube it doesn't it doesn't feel nice </garnt>
<joey> in your mouth i thought i thought when </joey>
<joey> you say when you swallow ice cubes i </joey>
<joey> thought you were talking about like you </joey>
<connor> know when you buy like a drink like </connor>
<connor> mcdonald's or something </connor>
<connor> are you swallowing whiskey rocks no no </connor>
<connor> it was like a i can't watch what i was </connor>
<connor> like you're literally swallowing like </connor>
<connor> whiskey like it was like a full-on </connor>
<connor> formed ice cube like it was a nice ice </connor>
<connor> cube that's why i wanted to put it in my </connor>
<connor> mouth </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> i was i i remember i was like yeah </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> i was like 19. i was you know thinking i </connor>
<connor> was fancy it probably i don't know what </connor>
<connor> i remember the exact scenario i remember </connor>
<connor> this specific scenario the reason why i </connor>
<joey> was so </joey>
<joey> committed to potentially dying to avoid </joey>
<joey> social awkwardness it was because </joey>
<joey> uh it was a first date and i was very </joey>
<joey> nervous and she was very attractive okay </joey>
<joey> i really wanted this to go well and so </joey>
<joey> you were like i'm gonna eat this ice </joey>
<joey> cube </joey>
<connor> and so for some reason </connor>
<connor> i think the 19 year old like was tapping </connor>
<connor> into like the fit 15 12 year old to me </connor>
<connor> that was like </connor>
<connor> that ice cube looks real good </connor>
<connor> because you know sometimes you see an </connor>
<connor> ice cube and you just put it in your </connor>
<connor> mouth because you're because you're dumb </connor>
<connor> and you're a kid and you you want to of </connor>
<garnt> course i now would i know i have no </garnt>
<garnt> desire it really depends okay it really </garnt>
<joey> depends as someone who has eaten a lot </joey>
<joey> of [ __ ] ice cubes in my life </joey>
<joey> as as the ice cube connoisseur here like </joey>
<joey> there's so many different factors right </joey>
<connor> because sometimes sometimes it's big but </connor>
<connor> like for some reason it's like hollow </connor>
<joey> inside right so you can take a good you </joey>
<joey> could shut it off sometimes it's just </joey>
<connor> like completely solid it's just like a </connor>
<joey> solid block of solid block of ice and </joey>
<joey> there is no </joey>
<joey> like there is no biting down on that </joey>
<garnt> unless it's at least a little bit melted </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's all and at that point it's </garnt>
<garnt> going to take at least like one or two </garnt>
<garnt> minutes irregardless of the size which </garnt>
<joey> is </joey>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<joey> all right switch to space to grinding </joey>
<connor> technique </connor>
<connor> i remember it was quite a hefty boy it </connor>
<connor> was it was a weighty boy hence why again </connor>
<connor> i wanted to put it in my mouth </connor>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> it looks like i want all the trash they </connor>
<joey> said it's taken out of context it looked </joey>
<connor> too good not to like to allow it to go </connor>
<garnt> away so i had of course yeah so for me </garnt>
<garnt> it's the opposite for me if it's like </garnt>
<garnt> perfectly the edges are like perfectly </garnt>
<garnt> rounded that's that's that's the that's </garnt>
<garnt> peak ice that's peak ice to put in your </garnt>
<garnt> mouth that is peak ice to put in your </garnt>
<connor> mouth because it all you know you're on </connor>
<connor> the throttle </connor>
<connor> like the giant balls </connor>
<garnt> no joke every time i get like </garnt>
<joey> recommended a video of like one of the </joey>
<joey> waiters like shaving ice yeah it's what </joey>
<garnt> it's like the most satisfying yeah in my </garnt>
<connor> life whole yeah i need to say i don't </connor>
<joey> want to put it in my mouth um because i </joey>
<garnt> don't want to die </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah i yeah i've learned my lesson </joey>
<garnt> with that it was also like clear ice </garnt>
<garnt> superior ice superiorized to like the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] frosted ice that you get where </garnt>
<garnt> it's like clear outside and frosted in </garnt>
<garnt> the middle that's that's trashed here </garnt>
<connor> right now </connor>
<connor> this is just like level one bartending </connor>
<garnt> right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> no i mean just like i think </garnt>
<joey> to chew on it as well </joey>
<garnt> yeah sorry i'm just this this is like my </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] five-year-old this is live now </connor>
<connor> this is like my favorite crayons taste </connor>
<connor> like level of conversation it's like i </connor>
<joey> like the the maroon one </joey>
<joey> i like cherry red because it's got the </joey>
<garnt> word cherry </garnt>
<garnt> do you prefer do you prefer </garnt>
<connor> cube dice or how do you feel about uh i </connor>
<connor> don't give a [ __ ] no no no because </connor>
<garnt> because i know a lot of people who </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] hate crushed ice oh yeah okay </connor>
<garnt> actually yeah i do hate crushes i really </garnt>
<joey> like crush i like crushed eyes yeah why </joey>
<garnt> did you it's like a slushie </garnt>
<garnt> you get like okay so you everyone knows </garnt>
<joey> my soda take right where i i like it </joey>
<joey> just the wrong one yeah i just i like it </joey>
<joey> where you know you take a little bit of </joey>
<joey> the fizz out and like to me like crushed </joey>
<garnt> ice has more of a surface area to just </garnt>
<garnt> to just like to just like make soda like </garnt>
<garnt> the perfect the perfect texture and the </garnt>
<connor> perfect flavor because if you drink it </connor>
<connor> without a straw </connor>
<garnt> right yeah well it's it's great because </garnt>
<garnt> if you drink it with without a straw </garnt>
<joey> then you get a lot of crushed ice that </joey>
<garnt> you can chew on it </garnt>
<joey> it's perfect you get the best of both </joey>
<connor> worlds this is like this is like you're </connor>
<joey> like yeah i don't mind they bring extra </joey>
<joey> extra colors in the crown package </joey>
<joey> to eat yeah yeah this is i i don't i </joey>
<connor> don't want to </connor>
<connor> taste the ice [ __ ] slush in my mouth </connor>
<joey> i want to taste the drink being cold </joey>
<joey> this is why when we go to denny's in </joey>
<garnt> japan i hate their [ __ ] ice machines </garnt>
<joey> what's the nice is always the the shitty </joey>
<connor> the shittiest like shaved ice yeah and </connor>
<connor> you drink it and you just get a mouthful </connor>
<connor> of shaved ice and you got to do that </connor>
<connor> technique where you're like </connor>
<connor> putting it in my mouth oh my god </connor>
<joey> i like it when it's like at the bottom </joey>
<joey> of the glass and then you do this and </joey>
<joey> then just oh my god </joey>
<garnt> uh i mean you gotta like drink it you </garnt>
<garnt> know you go i mean it depends because </garnt>
<connor> have you you've hung out with me so </connor>
<joey> you've seen how much you've done </joey>
<joey> i've seen how much shaved ice i put into </joey>
<joey> there minimum yeah the minimum amount of </joey>
<garnt> shaved ice i put into a cup if i have </garnt>
<garnt> the choice is half the cup yeah that's </garnt>
<connor> the minimum for me this is why when gang </connor>
<connor> goes to the movie theater he's like wow </connor>
<connor> look how much value i'm getting i get </connor>
<connor> i'm drawing four drinks today it's like </connor>
<joey> no god you've drank two this is filled </joey>
<joey> with advice this man buys chips and goes </joey>
<garnt> to me like to me the saddest sight i've </garnt>
<garnt> i've ever seen in my life right is when </garnt>
<connor> you go to like a shaved ice machine and </connor>
<connor> people put like a bit in like like like </connor>
<connor> a tiny bit like five percent of the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] cup i do like one percent </joey>
<connor> and then most of the time </connor>
<joey> and then you yeah and then you fill up </joey>
<joey> with the soda right i'd rather people </joey>
<joey> put no in because you fill up this with </joey>
<joey> a soda the saddest [ __ ] sight it's </joey>
<joey> just seeing like one or two bits of ice </joey>
<garnt> just like floating around in the soda </garnt>
<garnt> like that that's doing nothing it's </garnt>
<garnt> literally doing nothing why would you </garnt>
<garnt> put ice in if it's if that's all you're </garnt>
<joey> actually gonna put in </joey>
<joey> i'm not living in a cap i've never given </joey>
<joey> a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i've never been like seething rage me </joey>
<garnt> like god damn it because you can't even </garnt>
<garnt> chew on the ice that's that's why that's </garnt>
<joey> why it doesn't matter it's gonna </joey>
<connor> probably get a [ __ ] melt </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna predict god's next take he </connor>
<connor> thinks that soup should be exclusively </connor>
<garnt> eaten with straws </garnt>
<connor> right no i don't i don't i mean it's </connor>
<joey> just yeah it's just a drink isn't it </joey>
<connor> yeah he's like oh it's a drink it's soup </connor>
<connor> less messy </connor>
<connor> and curry is a drink i want clown taking </connor>
<joey> you to come out with next guys </joey>
<garnt> i'm i'm collecting them right now just </garnt>
<joey> just give me more food taste the </joey>
<joey> infinity stones of [ __ ] taste </joey>
<connor> christ [ __ ] taste can be whatever i want </connor>
<connor> them to be </connor>
<garnt> i think it's only a southeast asian </garnt>
<garnt> thing right where uh you can </garnt>
<garnt> you buy a soda at like a stand or </garnt>
<garnt> something right i don't know if i've </garnt>
<garnt> told this story before but you buy a </garnt>
<garnt> soda at a stand or something and then </garnt>
<garnt> they will serve it to you in a plastic </garnt>
<garnt> bag yeah is that southeastern is that </garnt>
<joey> such </joey>
<joey> yes yes </joey>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<joey> can they not afford plastic containers </joey>
<garnt> or is this like an artistic choice </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know why it is right but i </garnt>
<joey> remember the first time like that's as </joey>
<joey> weird as bag i remember the first time </joey>
<joey> because i remember i thought this was a </joey>
<joey> normal thing right because when i was a </joey>
<joey> kid i'd go to like a thailand every year </joey>
<joey> and on an especially hot day you'd you'd </joey>
<joey> go to a stand you'd order a soft drink </joey>
<joey> and what happens is uh they will have a </joey>
<garnt> glass bottle and then they will yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like like that like that like that </garnt>
<garnt> so what happens is they they will have a </garnt>
<garnt> glass bottle or whatever soda you order </garnt>
<garnt> they'll uncap it and then they'll take a </garnt>
<garnt> plastic bag out just like put in that </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] ton of ice in the bag and just pour </garnt>
<garnt> the soda into the bag and give it to you </garnt>
<joey> it doesn't sound that bad actually </joey>
<joey> that's actually kind of cool like a </joey>
<connor> comically large straw yeah they just </connor>
<joey> give you a straw </joey>
<joey> they give you like a twirly straw </joey>
<connor> so like what happens like let's say </connor>
<garnt> you're like well [ __ ] you know this is a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of soda like how much you're talking </garnt>
<connor> is it like a normal can 230 mil yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah like a normal let's say you're </garnt>
<connor> halfway through the can you're like oh </connor>
<joey> sheesh i wanna just put it down for a </joey>
<connor> second you can't put it down </connor>
<joey> hold on let me hang out my dreams </joey>
<joey> like how do i put it yeah so a lot of </joey>
<joey> restaurants will have these little </joey>
<joey> little hangers on like on like the table </joey>
<joey> or something that's actually kind of </joey>
<joey> cool </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's true i completely forgot </garnt>
<joey> about that they got they got the hooks </joey>
<joey> as well okay question then questions </joey>
<joey> because we were talking about chewing on </joey>
<connor> ice yeah how the [ __ ] do you chew the </connor>
<connor> ice from a plastic oh he shovels it with </connor>
<connor> his hands you just like grab it with </connor>
<joey> your hand </joey>
<joey> because you can't like you can't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> do this right so when you're after </joey>
<joey> you've done drinking so you take the </joey>
<connor> plastic you can actually just take one </connor>
<connor> by one and just like </connor>
<joey> and they're like yeah </joey>
<garnt> or you take you or you take the straw </garnt>
<garnt> and you just like you scoop a little bit </garnt>
<connor> up </connor>
<connor> these like brand new plastic bags or </connor>
<connor> these like reuse from the guys </connor>
<garnt> shopping you can be combined like you </garnt>
<garnt> don't know like grocery </garnt>
<joey> can be oh should you get the aldi bag </joey>
<joey> bro i'm using lidl bro </joey>
<joey> i've never really thought about that </joey>
<joey> until yeah i want to know like how clean </joey>
<connor> this is yeah yeah i'd be very concerned </connor>
<connor> if he just whips out like some crushed </connor>
<connor> one from somewhere i'm like </connor>
<garnt> a part of southeast asian culture that </garnt>
<joey> we don't normally talk about i realized </joey>
<garnt> it's a it's a good drink yeah it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's got i i like surely i i know this </garnt>
<garnt> is complete nostalgia talking but i like </garnt>
<connor> the way though oh yeah the amount of </connor>
<connor> plastic in a bag is enough to make like </connor>
<joey> one cup right </joey>
<joey> no </joey>
<joey> what do you mean like surely you can </joey>
<joey> make a cup from one bag it's like </joey>
<connor> thinner it's like thinner right yeah but </connor>
<joey> plastic bags are quite what else now </joey>
<joey> what i want to know is why do they not </joey>
<connor> just give you the bottle </connor>
<connor> yeah why not you on the ice why do they </connor>
<joey> have to grab the bottle and empty it </joey>
<garnt> into a bag why can't they just give you </garnt>
<garnt> the bottle i believe because they just </garnt>
<joey> recycle the bottles </joey>
<joey> oh okay they send them back off i </joey>
<garnt> believe that's that's what's happening </garnt>
<joey> that's you can get a lot of drinks in </joey>
<connor> south asia they're kind of like a tub so </connor>
<joey> they yeah they scoop it out but surely </joey>
<connor> like the plastic </connor>
<connor> the plastic used on all those plastic </connor>
<connor> bags you could just convert into one cup </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of plastic in one plastic </connor>
<garnt> bag yeah as the turtles well-known yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh no like like i don't think i think i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think a lot of southeast asian </garnt>
<garnt> countries at the moment uh have much </garnt>
<garnt> awareness about plastic and trying to </garnt>
<garnt> reduce the amount of plastic i i </garnt>
<garnt> remember </garnt>
<connor> uh i remember i'm just genuinely curious </connor>
<garnt> like yeah yeah why it was i decided i </garnt>
<joey> just genuinely think that that's just </joey>
<joey> like how it's been like some dude was </joey>
<joey> just one day i was just like </joey>
<garnt> what if we put it down </garnt>
<connor> i don't know where the plastic bag is </connor>
<joey> that should be hilarious </joey>
<joey> i could be showing my ignorance with </joey>
<connor> that but i'm just like surely there's a </connor>
<joey> better way </joey>
<joey> i'm sure there is </joey>
<connor> with our cups and stuff we line </connor>
<connor> starbucks cups like waxing maybe they're </connor>
<connor> just i don't know maybe they just don't </connor>
<joey> give a [ __ ] it's just like i just want i </joey>
<connor> just want my drink i don't care what </connor>
<connor> it's in i guess i mean i would be like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] well well maybe you know maybe they </joey>
<joey> they are thinking in a recycling manner </joey>
<joey> where like after they finish the drink </joey>
<joey> they'll be like all right off to the </joey>
<connor> supermarket just like what fold it </connor>
<connor> inside out yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> all right brand new there we go i put my </connor>
<connor> groceries so like all right so you have </connor>
<connor> a car right yeah the cup holders was </connor>
<garnt> useless </garnt>
<garnt> or just like we don't use okay so yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you're just hanging it up on like you </garnt>
<garnt> know the uh what's what's the thing that </garnt>
<connor> you uh bro god forbid you you get a bump </connor>
<connor> in that car you go this is coke </connor>
<connor> you just go over like a patchy </connor>
<connor> and you're going up the mountain road </connor>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> oh jesus christ well now what's the </joey>
<joey> worst is like what if you're you know </joey>
<joey> just walking along and then you happen </joey>
<joey> to like nick onto something and then the </joey>
<garnt> there's a tear in the back </garnt>
<garnt> and you're in your pockets you're </garnt>
<joey> spilling it yeah then you're just [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> you've got a shotgun that that has </connor>
<connor> happened before you just </connor>
<connor> i think we got it right a few thousand </connor>
<connor> years ago </connor>
<joey> i think we got it right yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> cops were invented for a reason i think </joey>
<joey> the </joey>
<joey> cup was pretty damn good you know i </joey>
<joey> don't want to sound like an [ __ ] i'm </joey>
<connor> not trying to like be like your culture </connor>
<connor> i'm not saying it's the next best thing </connor>
<joey> off the sliced bread or anything but </joey>
<joey> like it's you know it's pretty good </joey>
<connor> pretty sure the cup came before the </connor>
<connor> wheel like that was we had a really good </connor>
<garnt> right there </garnt>
<garnt> nice the cylindrical uh the </garnt>
<garnt> cylindrical can right that was the best </garnt>
<connor> invention right i've see i've seen that </connor>
<connor> youtube video i think everyone's saying </connor>
<garnt> yeah i've seen that </garnt>
<garnt> 30 million views </garnt>
<connor> that's a pretty neat invention actually </connor>
<connor> it's uh the pressure is designed yeah </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<garnt> we get it you watch youtube yes </garnt>
<connor> speaking of youtube um </connor>
<connor> speaking of youtube youtube i've been </connor>
<connor> watching a few more youtube shorts </connor>
<joey> recently even though like like i know </joey>
<joey> like every time i go on like a youtube </joey>
<joey> shorts binge </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like bad for my health </joey>
<joey> you know like yeah there's it's to me </joey>
<joey> watching youtube shorts or watching tick </joey>
<joey> tocks is the equivalent </joey>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> eating mcdonald's or eating fast food </joey>
<joey> right like i know i shouldn't do it but </joey>
<joey> sometimes sometimes just lying in bed </joey>
<joey> and you just scroll through and you're </joey>
<joey> like you just want that quick meal </joey>
<joey> and you're like [ __ ] 30 minutes have </joey>
<joey> passed and i've like consumed nothing uh </joey>
<joey> so like i've fallen down to like i felt </joey>
<connor> i fell down into this hole of like you </connor>
<connor> know life advice youtube or like life </connor>
<connor> hacks </connor>
<connor> right yeah and it's just like </connor>
<connor> like remember before where we went </connor>
<connor> through that life hack phase of like </connor>
<joey> buzzfeed videos where like the hack </joey>
<connor> isn't actually a hack so i thought that </connor>
<connor> died out but apparently that just went </connor>
<connor> to [ __ ] tick tock yeah right because </connor>
<connor> like i </connor>
<connor> i remember i saw i saw like a few </connor>
<joey> like career hacks of things you can do </joey>
<joey> in like to help you increase your </joey>
<joey> chances of getting a job interview right </joey>
<joey> and there's this i think i saw that </joey>
<joey> there's this tick tock of like that this </joey>
<garnt> is how this hour goes the job </garnt>
<connor> interviewer offers you a glass of water </connor>
<garnt> the same thing yesterday </garnt>
<joey> the white guy right yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so the job interviewer offers you a </joey>
<joey> glass of water and then you take the </joey>
<garnt> water and that's the hack because the </garnt>
<garnt> hack is if you take the glass of water </garnt>
<garnt> when it's offered to you they ask you a </garnt>
<garnt> difficult question and you just go </garnt>
<garnt> well you see the thing is and then and </garnt>
<garnt> the hack was because you have a glass of </garnt>
<garnt> water it gives you more time to think </garnt>
<garnt> about the answer and that was the hack </garnt>
<garnt> and i was just like losing my mind </garnt>
<joey> that you could call this career advice </joey>
<joey> or a [ __ ] thousand likes and i'm like </joey>
<connor> this feels like </connor>
<connor> like the only time i ever see people </connor>
<connor> take a sip of water right for answering </connor>
<joey> the question is it like the criminal </joey>
<joey> trial yeah like when mark zuckerberg was </joey>
<joey> being </joey>
<connor> uh questioned by the senate yeah every </connor>
<joey> single question </joey>
<joey> yeah he was using a life hack dude he </joey>
<joey> was thinking about those answers i'm </joey>
<connor> saying you don't look like a criminal </connor>
<joey> when i ask you a question you don't be </joey>
<joey> good i'm just i'm just like i i i feel </joey>
<garnt> like a more like logical thing would be </garnt>
<garnt> like uh can i just take a bit of time to </garnt>
<garnt> think about this answer yeah no no no </garnt>
<joey> because you've got to seem confident </joey>
<joey> yeah i'd be like that is a fantastic </joey>
<joey> question yeah think of the way to </joey>
<connor> appropriately answer that no you you </connor>
<connor> what if you combine it right yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah you gotta combine it with the water </joey>
<garnt> that's the fantasy </garnt>
<garnt> what if what if the water doesn't give </garnt>
<joey> you enough time </joey>
<joey> are you just like downing an entire </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] jug of war you're sitting there </garnt>
<garnt> for like 10 minutes just going they're </garnt>
<joey> like gone </joey>
<joey> like what's your fault </joey>
<connor> your favorite food is oh [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> well what if or what if you know you're </joey>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> you get off of the water right and </connor>
<connor> you're just like really thirsty and then </connor>
<joey> you get to that really difficult </joey>
<connor> question you're just like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> like what do i do now </joey>
<garnt> never told me sir you've gone through </garnt>
<garnt> three litres of water during this </garnt>
<connor> interview are you are you feeling okay i </connor>
<connor> have to say like 99 of life hacks or </connor>
<connor> some [ __ ] i just immediately forget and </connor>
<connor> never remember and we'll never ever </connor>
<garnt> practically use yeah yeah yeah i've seen </garnt>
<joey> so many others especially when it comes </joey>
<joey> to like [ __ ] survival like these </joey>
<joey> these kinds of like hacks or like advice </joey>
<joey> you see on tick tocks like i don't know </joey>
<joey> if we've ever talked about this on </joey>
<joey> podcast i think we've only talked about </joey>
<joey> it in private but like the [ __ ] shaq </joey>
<joey> financial advice which is an entire </joey>
<garnt> genre </garnt>
<garnt> which is which is an entire i think an </garnt>
<garnt> entire genre of video on tick tock and </garnt>
<garnt> youtube shorts now where it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> shaq motivational like life advice and </garnt>
<garnt> half of it is just like taking your </garnt>
<garnt> paycheck and apparently just ripping it </garnt>
<joey> in half shaq what's the difference </joey>
<joey> between being rich and being wealthy </joey>
<joey> it's like when you're rich you do this </joey>
<joey> but the wealth you do this </joey>
<garnt> is one million likes </garnt>
<connor> thank you shaq i am no longer poor now </connor>
<connor> i will </connor>
<connor> the financial advice the problem is with </connor>
<connor> a lot of these financial advices on like </connor>
<connor> tick tock and youtube and again i think </connor>
<connor> shaq is somewhat guilty of this it </connor>
<connor> assumes you're even making enough money </connor>
<connor> to save like most people don't aren't </connor>
<joey> able to save money because like we're </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] right now yeah you most people </joey>
<joey> spend all their paycheck that's that's </joey>
<connor> how it is how do you then go to them and </connor>
<connor> be like you're just not saving enough </connor>
<connor> you're just not saving enough that rent </connor>
<joey> maybe you can get rid of yeah who's </joey>
<joey> who's living on minimum wage and being </joey>
<connor> like oh i didn't i shouldn't </connor>
<connor> are there people who spend it </connor>
<connor> responsibly hell yeah there are yeah is </connor>
<joey> that the reason why everyone isn't rich </joey>
<connor> no </connor>
<garnt> and no </garnt>
<garnt> it was just so weird falling into this </garnt>
<garnt> hole of just like you know you see these </garnt>
<garnt> tik tok with like made up scenarios </garnt>
<garnt> where the the perfect life hack for that </garnt>
<connor> scenario will pop up it's always the </connor>
<connor> same it's one guy is in this part of the </connor>
<connor> frame and he's like so you want this and </connor>
<connor> then another guy on the frame probably </connor>
<connor> with glasses yeah yeah no no that's not </connor>
<connor> how you do it it's literally always like </connor>
<joey> that and with the worst acting and the </joey>
<connor> worst script and then it's like 20 </connor>
<connor> million views and i'm like i'm quitting </connor>
<garnt> much yeah i'm terrible at my job it's </garnt>
<joey> just like an entire [ __ ] genre of </joey>
<joey> that just takes place in the dharmand </joey>
<joey> universe you know it's just like the </joey>
<joey> extended darman universe where you know </joey>
<joey> everything just works out because of </joey>
<garnt> these because i drank water in my </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] job interview like </joey>
<joey> the dcu </joey>
<joey> man cinematic universe </joey>
<joey> the one that also just like that i've </joey>
<joey> been getting a lot recently off youtube </joey>
<joey> shorts is the ones where like </joey>
<joey> the ones where they take like you know </joey>
<joey> those like five minute crafts like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like life hacks and then </joey>
<joey> there's always some like dude who's like </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna find out if this is actually </joey>
<joey> legitimate or not and then they do it </joey>
<joey> and then they tried themselves and like </joey>
<joey> okay it was legitimate like for more if </joey>
<joey> that's the thing that's a thing okay </joey>
<joey> i've seen so many of those like so many </joey>
<joey> times where it's like oh if you you know </joey>
<joey> you get a black marker and you draw it </joey>
<joey> on your hand and then you take a picture </joey>
<joey> of it on flash then it apparently zaps </joey>
<joey> you some [ __ ] like that and and it's </joey>
<joey> always some guy being like </joey>
<joey> no it's not factor cap all right let's </joey>
<joey> try it let's try to figure it out </joey>
<connor> let's try and figure it out my new </connor>
<connor> favorite shorts or tic toc uh category </connor>
<connor> is uh the tick tocks that need way more </connor>
<connor> explanation as to what's going on but </connor>
<connor> they the person doing the video does not </connor>
<connor> offer any explanation as to why they're </connor>
<connor> doing the thing they're doing </connor>
<connor> like what there was one time i watched </connor>
<connor> this tick tock and it was a guy he was </connor>
<connor> like so here's how i made a case to </connor>
<connor> carry my ipad farm and then he makes the </connor>
<connor> case and i i </connor>
<connor> me and all the other comments were like </connor>
<connor> why do you have an ipad phone like i </connor>
<joey> think i've seen that one with the long </joey>
<connor> case yeah yeah yeah like and like he </connor>
<connor> made this video just explaining how he </connor>
<connor> made a case for his ipad farm and i was </connor>
<connor> like the whole time like </connor>
<garnt> why did you have an ipad phone no no he </garnt>
<garnt> makes this ipad farm </garnt>
<joey> to test out if he could make enough </joey>
<joey> passive income that's it yeah </joey>
<joey> to justify making an ipad farm and like </joey>
<joey> me like there are so many layers to this </joey>
<joey> tick tock that i just want answers to </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm like question how are you </joey>
<garnt> making this money first of all yeah like </garnt>
<joey> what passive income revenue are you </joey>
<connor> doing what is this app </connor>
<connor> have like tons and tons of phones and </connor>
<joey> you play the same song like on luke oh </joey>
<connor> wow and then like get revenue from it oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] um but obviously like you've used a </connor>
<connor> lot of electricity so yeah kind of i </connor>
<connor> some things like that but yeah i mean </connor>
<connor> it's again there's so many of these </connor>
<connor> where they're like we're gonna do this </connor>
<connor> thing or they're like or you felt like </connor>
<connor> you just came into like the 90th episode </connor>
<connor> of the show and you're like what </connor>
<connor> what is happening and the people making </connor>
<connor> the videos don't think that like anyone </connor>
<garnt> might need context or something yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just one line because like like i </garnt>
<garnt> know exactly what you mean though </garnt>
<garnt> because they'll always start off the </garnt>
<garnt> video with just like last time i made </garnt>
<garnt> like a dildo that could fly or something </garnt>
<garnt> like that and you guys have been asking </garnt>
<garnt> me to make this so i'm going to make it </garnt>
<joey> i'm just like what what what </joey>
<joey> so many comments saying that you should </joey>
<garnt> make it harder </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like what have i missed in the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] lore of this you know like how </garnt>
<joey> how far back do i go and the thing is </joey>
<joey> like it's impossible to like try to like </joey>
<joey> triangulate this when you click on their </joey>
<joey> channel or something right because it's </joey>
<joey> just like it's not always in </joey>
<joey> chronological order either i don't know </joey>
<joey> yeah youtube shorts is like </joey>
<garnt> there's so many different like holes you </garnt>
<garnt> can slip down into youtube shorts and </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] tick tock and it's like insane </joey>
<joey> as well because like </joey>
<joey> especially with the youtube shorts </joey>
<joey> because i don't really use tick tock but </joey>
<joey> like with youtube shorts it knows </joey>
<garnt> exactly what to recommend you next </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like oh you spent one extra </garnt>
<garnt> second on this one [ __ ] shaq </garnt>
<joey> motivational tick tock that must mean </joey>
<garnt> you want 20 more yeah that's why like </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes i'm like if i watch a video </garnt>
<connor> that [ __ ] for too long i'm like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] now the algorithm thing now the </connor>
<garnt> algorithm thinks i like this video and </garnt>
<garnt> like the next 10 videos will be </garnt>
<connor> something to do with that i'm like i </connor>
<connor> wish there was some way to just tell </connor>
<connor> youtube i didn't like the video that </connor>
<joey> they sent me but unfortunately they </joey>
<joey> removed the dislike yeah i know </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of tick tocks or youtube </joey>
<joey> shorts that i watch and i'm like i hated </joey>
<connor> this video i want to let them know i </connor>
<connor> hated it without being an [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> but i can't know so i just have to and </connor>
<connor> i've already given them my watch time so </connor>
<connor> i've for all youtube knows that was the </connor>
<joey> best experience of my life the one that </joey>
<joey> uh made me fall down the rabbit hole for </joey>
<joey> youtube shorts for me is uh i saw this </joey>
<joey> one youtube short of uh </joey>
<joey> the the founder of 2chan uh because he </joey>
<joey> has like a live streaming thing yeah and </joey>
<joey> he like uh he's called hiroyuki but like </joey>
<joey> he he's very uh you know because he's </joey>
<joey> the creator of 2chan yeah he's a bit </joey>
<joey> based in his opinions okay um gamer like </joey>
<connor> very controversial opinions right based </connor>
<joey> in the negative yeah based in a negative </joey>
<joey> term and uh i just watched one because i </joey>
<joey> couldn't [ __ ] believe the answer and </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> my youtube shorts are just this japanese </joey>
<joey> dude saying a lot of racist and </joey>
<joey> controversial [ __ ] and i was like i </joey>
<joey> don't i didn't i didn't watch this </joey>
<joey> because i liked it i watched it because </joey>
<joey> i was trying to process what the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> this guy was talking about that's been a </connor>
<joey> lot of criticism of youtube facebook and </joey>
