<connor> - Can you be cancelled for your dreams? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Would you rather utter
a racist word asleep, </garnt>
<garnt> or shit yourself?
- I'd rather shit myself. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd rather shit myself. </garnt>
<connor> I will poop myself on stream for $100,000. </connor>
<garnt> - A new Trash Taste
shitting special, let's go. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> (relaxed music) </joey>
<joey> - What's up Tomato Town,
welcome back to another episode </joey>
<joey> of "Trash Taste Podcast" . </joey>
<connor> - We're referring to, there's
no one in Tomato Town, Joe. </connor>
<garnt> - Ah, shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're wiped out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're talking to nobody,
Joe. You're talking to nobody. </garnt>
<connor> - It's gonna be real awkward
if this meme is dead. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> By the time this comes out. </connor>
<garnt> - No, we'll bring it back. </garnt>
<garnt> - Knowing how fast memes fucking recycle, </garnt>
<joey> it's pretty obvious. </joey>
<garnt> - I will be singing Chug Jug
until the end of the year. </garnt>
<connor> I swear to god. </connor>
<garnt> - I doubt that. I put money on it. </garnt>
<joey> - By this time next month, everyone </joey>
<garnt> will be like 'what is a chug jug?' </garnt>
<garnt> Anyway, I'm your host for this week, Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> with the boys Connor and Garnt. </garnt>
<joey> And we will not be talking
about Fortnite memes today. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, you know me.
I'm a pro Fortnite gamer. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, this is like,
literally the meme of </connor>
<connor> like, you know the three children sitting </connor>
<garnt> on the couch, like. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> 'What's your favourite Fortnite meme?' </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What's the title of that
video again? It's like. </joey>
<joey> - You are nearly 40 years old, </joey>
<joey> what is your favourite Fortnite meme? </joey>
<joey> - What's the title of that video again? </joey>
<joey> What is it? </joey>
<garnt> - I've forgotten what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its like, its something
about Fortnite right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Of course. </joey>
<joey> - I don't remember. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you know when you see, like, </joey>
<garnt> a meme picture and you just have no idea </garnt>
<garnt> what the original context
of that picture is? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, there's so many
pictures that I recognise </garnt>
<garnt> that I have no idea. </garnt>
<joey> - One that I wanna know is like, </joey>
<joey> what's the context of that picture </joey>
<joey> of like, you know the
dude sitting next to like, </joey>
<joey> the three pictures of like,
the people having a podcast? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna know the
context of that, because </garnt>
<connor> we see that all the time on our subreddit. </connor>
<connor> But, anyway. </connor>
<connor> - We're not gonna be
talking about that. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we're not gonna
be talking about that. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Not gonna
be talking about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're gonna be talking, today, </garnt>
<garnt> about YouTube stuff? I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - Twitter stuff? I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - Twitter stuff? Just internet stuff. </joey>
<connor> - Well I think there's been a few recent </connor>
<joey> interesting things that
have happened, but. </joey>
<joey> - As recording. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we're recording not any more, </garnt>
<joey> because we're having a
bit of a two week break </joey>
<joey> of recording, so it's gonna be, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, six weeks from
when we talk about it. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - This'll be all news by the
time you guys are seeing it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But, yeah, so, as of us recording this, </garnt>
<garnt> I think, was it two days ago? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - YouTube, the official
Twitter account on YouTube </joey>
<joey> announced an interesting update? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] They are testing
to see whether they should </garnt>
<garnt> get, just, get rid of, well testing? </garnt>
<connor> Which, when YouTube
starts to test something, </connor>
<connor> 90% of the time it goes through. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, they are testing to see </connor>
<garnt> if it's worth getting
rid of dislike button. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, not getting rid of
it, but getting rid of, </garnt>
<joey> - Getting rid of how many dislikes </joey>
<joey> are publicly seen on video. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Essentially. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I hope they, its
gonna be real awkward </joey>
<connor> if they revert it by
the time this comes out. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I just hope. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, even if they revert it, </joey>
<joey> I do want them to. </joey>
<garnt> I will say on the record now that I think </garnt>
<garnt> its a fucking stupid idea. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, just in recent memory, what's, </connor>
<connor> the only things that I can recall </connor>
<joey> that YouTube backpedaled on, </joey>
<joey> was the verification thing, where, </joey>
<joey> - Verification thing? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like, a year and a half ago, </joey>
<joey> or two years ago, they were like, </joey>
<joey> 'Umm, no one's verified anymore.' </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that's right! </joey>
<joey> - 'and only select
channels can be verified.' </joey>
<joey> - Oh I think it's only
music channels, right? </joey>
<joey> - People with like, 10 million subscribers </joey>
<joey> weren't like, eligible or something. </joey>
<connor> And it was like, what, who the fuck </connor>
<connor> can be verified then? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> There was that, and then there was </connor>
<connor> the YouTube Heroes, </connor>
<connor> which was the end of end as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my fucking god,
I've completely forgotten </garnt>
<connor> about YouTube Heroes. </connor>
<garnt> - That wasn't like, last year? Was it? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, that was like, four years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was YouTube Heroes, again? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was basically where
they were gonna, like, </garnt>
<joey> let people be, like, moderators, in a way? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. That was it. </joey>
<joey> - I think it was their answer to like, </joey>
<joey> Twitch Mods. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Also just calling it 'Heroes' is like, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> there are heroes. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, as the heroes of anime. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but. There's just
been, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I feel, especially, with like, these. </joey>
<joey> We were talking about it
before this podcast started. </joey>
<joey> But, I feel that, when
YouTube suggests a change, </joey>
<joey> or an implementation to the system, </joey>
<joey> its not so much a suggestion. </joey>
<joey> Its more like, 'hey so,
no one asked for this, </joey>
<joey> and we're gonna tell you right
before it starts happening, </joey>
<joey> but this is what's happening. </joey>
<joey> If you disagree with it, LOL sorry.' </joey>
<connor> - Yeah they also tested,
one time, as well, like, </connor>
<connor> just getting rid of people's thumbnails, </connor>
<connor> like that was a thing, remember that? </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No? </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, no, it was like, the
animated thumbnails, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - It was like, where the previews, </joey>
<joey> I mean, nowadays on
YouTube I think its like, </joey>
<connor> if you hover over a video thumbnail, </connor>
<connor> then it plays, like, a preview? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Of the video? </connor>
<connor> But before, yeah, I remember this. </connor>
<connor> They were gonna get rid
of the idea of thumbnails, </connor>
<connor> and just replace it with
the previews of thumbnails. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know if that was the intention, </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I could be wrong, but I just remember </joey>
<garnt> there was a period where I would just, </garnt>
<garnt> log on YouTube, and, </garnt>
<garnt> - Everything was moving? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, everything was moving, </garnt>
<garnt> or there was just no
thumbnails for anything. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> and then I found out later it was because </connor>
<connor> of this YouTube test they were doing, </connor>
<connor> on like 0.1%. </connor>
<joey> - It just looked like, its just like a, </joey>
<garnt> you know those newspapers
from Harry Potter. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where like, everything is just moving. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its just annoying because
every, it seems like, to me, </garnt>
<garnt> as a content creator, </garnt>
<garnt> every time YouTube takes one step forward, </garnt>
<garnt> they just take two steps back. </garnt>
<garnt> Like what was really sus about
that Twitter post for me, </garnt>
<garnt> was they were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'guys, we hear you. We
hear the creator feedback. </garnt>
<connor> We know you asked for this.' </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah!] </connor>
<connor> - We are removing the dislike button. </connor>
<garnt> And then every creator
comes up and was like, </garnt>
<connor> 'Yo. Did you guys ask for this? </connor>
<connor> Because I didn't ask for this.' </connor>
<connor> - Whose feedback is this? </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Because anyone who's making
any content that is like, </connor>
<garnt> reasonable, anyone who's like, </garnt>
<garnt> literally trying to make good stuff, </garnt>
<connor> probably isn't afraid
of the dislike button. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Because, you know, personally, you know, </connor>
<connor> I mean, might change by this point, </connor>
<connor> I've never had a video
that has ever been, like, </connor>
<connor> you know, less than 90%.
Yeah, less than 90% likes. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I feel like, </garnt>
<connor> if it is less than 90% likes, </connor>
<connor> - You fucked up. </connor>
<connor> - Like, either you fucked up, </connor>
<garnt> or it got recommended to
an audience way outside </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> of your usual audience. Which
is, which is what I noticed. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I feel like the
dislike button and like, </garnt>
<garnt> the dislike bar, at least, </garnt>
<garnt> I think its a really useful resource. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and I saw, 'cause I retweeted it </joey>
<garnt> with the Fallout 'Everyone
disliked this' picture. </garnt>
<garnt> But I was reading through
the replies for that tweet, </garnt>
<garnt> and there were a lot of really, like, </garnt>
<garnt> interesting points being
made, being like, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> One of the biggest points I saw </garnt>
<garnt> from a lot of big creators was that </garnt>
<joey> 'well, if we get rid of the dislike bar, </joey>
<garnt> then how are people going to judge whether </garnt>
<joey> the video is like, a scam, or, you know, </joey>
<joey> something is like, just, you know. </joey>
<joey> You don't wanna waste your
time on a 10 minute video. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. I think, </joey>
<joey> - If it's a scam. </joey>
<joey> - I think the first thing
that came to mind was, </joey>
<connor> for me, was tutorial videos. </connor>
<connor> - I was just about to say that. </connor>
<garnt> - The first thing,
because there are so many </garnt>
<garnt> useless fucking tutorial videos. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know immediately
when you click on something </garnt>
<garnt> and the dislike bar is, its a 50-50 ratio, </garnt>
<joey> you're just like, all right. </joey>
<garnt> - Immediately close down. </garnt>
<connor> - Immediately close down
and go to the next one. </connor>
<connor> - Like back in he day, you know maybe, </connor>
<connor> you know, maybe you wanted
a certain, you know, </connor>
<connor> you wanted some software, </connor>
<connor> that you probably should
have been paying for, </connor>
<garnt> you know. I remember that, you know, </garnt>
<connor> the way that you would judge
if it was a safe way to get it </connor>
<joey> was like, all right, this
video has lots of comments, </joey>
<joey> lots of likes. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think this is safe.
You click on another video, </garnt>
<garnt> its like, 'get this software for free', </garnt>
<garnt> and its like, 80% dislikes, you're like, </garnt>
<connor> 'probably not gonna download that.' </connor>
<joey> - Get it from 'this will definitely </joey>
<joey> not hack your computer .com!' </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me, its, you know,
sometimes fucking Windows </garnt>
<garnt> or some software gets this random error, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just, you start Googling it, </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason,
for me, I've found that </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube tutorial videos has
been more useful than just </garnt>
<garnt> Googling it and going into
specific Microsoft forums. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is just, like, </garnt>
<garnt> - From like six years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - And you look at it and its like, </garnt>
<joey> posted in 2012, no replies. </joey>
<joey> Its like, cool, thanks! </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Its no replies, or you get about, like, </joey>
<garnt> 'try these ten million fixes, </garnt>
<garnt> and one of these will possibly work! </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But then like, I'm
just going on a tangent, </garnt>
<garnt> its fucking bullshit as well, </garnt>
<connor> because sometimes they'll
have like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you have like, a problem </connor>
<connor> that's like, very minor,
and they'll be like, </connor>
<garnt> 'try uninstalling your RAM
and GPU, putting it back in.' </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I'm not gonna fucking do that. </garnt>
<garnt> Like at that point, I'm giving up. </garnt>
<connor> I'm throwing it in the trash. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like I feel that, the
way YouTube tutorials work, </garnt>
<garnt> is that, you know, you
search up this error code, </garnt>
<garnt> and put it in YouTube, and like, </garnt>
<joey> there's gonna be one video
that's got a positive </joey>
<joey> like to dislike ration, </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And 90% of the time, that's
the fix I'm looking for. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because every other video
is just like, 50-50%s, right? </joey>
<joey> And I feel like, to me, </joey>
<joey> that's like, </joey>
<connor> legitimately the first
thing that came to mind, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - About removing dislikes. </garnt>
<connor> - Its frustrating as well because I think </connor>
<connor> there have been changes that
YouTube has made that, like. </connor>
<joey> Because I think whenever
YouTube makes any change, </joey>
<joey> they get shit, like even
if its a good change? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, and I think
they have made some changes </joey>
<joey> where everyone was shitting
on it when it started, </joey>
<joey> and literally a week
later, no one gives a fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Like, people, like, okay. </joey>
<joey> I understand why they did this, </joey>
<connor> and it was quite
frustrating to get used to, </connor>
<connor> but when they moved the comments, to like, </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> the comments used to be, </connor>
<connor> when you would be on a YouTube video, </connor>
<connor> like this one right now,
you could just scroll </connor>
<connor> and the comments would be
right there at the bottom! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - Uh, but then they moved it, </connor>
<garnt> so that you had to just drop
down at it was right there. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> Which, at first, I absolutely hated. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought, why would you do this?' </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And then now, I'm like,
this makes way more sense. </connor>
<connor> - Mmm. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Now that I've gotten used to it, </connor>
<joey> its streamlined everything.
If I wanna read the comments, </joey>
<joey> I'll open it, if I wanna just, you know. </joey>
<connor> I don't wanna have to scroll through </connor>
<connor> all these fucking videos, you know. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if we're going
you know, all the way back </joey>
<joey> to the like, OG times right, like, </joey>
<joey> I remember, there was
a massive uproar when </joey>
<joey> YouTube changed, you know,
from the five star rating. </joey>
<connor> - That was dog shit anyway. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I understand. </garnt>
<connor> - With Netflix, as well </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I understand it,
and I prefer this new YouTube. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course, but like, </joey>
<joey> I remember back in the
day, people were like, </joey>
<garnt> 'no I'm so used to rating five stars,' </garnt>
<garnt> now YouTubers were like </garnt>
<garnt> 'well how am I gonna end off the video? </garnt>
<garnt> I used to be able to say rate five stars, </garnt>
<garnt> but now I got to like,
ask people to like?' </garnt>
<garnt> - Smash the like button? </garnt>
<garnt> - Eurgh, smash the like button? </garnt>
<connor> (fake vomiting) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so. </joey>
<connor> - I do think that when they
do these changes, as well, </connor>
<joey> like, they must have
some data on their end. </joey>
<joey> That says this is a good idea. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah. Its not
completely, baseless, I'm sure. </joey>
<connor> - Right. Which is why, like, </connor>
<joey> I wish that they would be like 'listen,' </joey>
<garnt> - Open about it? </garnt>
<connor> - 'This is our idea,
right? We're thinking,' </connor>
<garnt> - Not be like, 'listen. We hear you.' </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Not, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I fucking hate that. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't fucking pretend like
you're doing me a solid. </connor>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<garnt> - Don't pretend like you give a shit </garnt>
<joey> about the people who use your website. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Thanks, thanks
corporation, my best friend! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Wow. </connor>
<joey> - You wanna do me a solid </joey>
<joey> and reply to me when I
have a fucking problem. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> Don't fucking tell me that
you're removing dislikes, </connor>
<connor> like they give a. </connor>
<connor> And the only reason they're
fucking doing it anyway, </connor>
<connor> and I'm pretty sure everyone knows </connor>
<connor> they're doing it because
of this is like, you know, </connor>
<joey> a bunch of really big names
got into controversies, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And dislikes play a really pivotal part. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And like, 'cause, you
know, I think, in YouTube, </joey>
<joey> we have this way where we have like, </joey>
<connor> kind of decided, that a
YouTube apology, if you will, </connor>
<connor> its success is based on like to dislike. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - So I think that YouTube
is trying to get rid of that </connor>
<connor> where we judge a video's quality on that. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I kind of like that
because, I mean obviously, </joey>
<joey> you know, I wouldn't be saying this </joey>
<joey> if I was on the receiving end of it. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But as someone who's seen, </connor>
<connor> you know, an apology video or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - I think its awesome as a viewer. </connor>
<connor> - Its also cool, as well,
because I, a lot of the times, </connor>
<connor> use that as a gauge to figure out, like, </connor>
<joey> the general idea of what the community </joey>
<joey> thinks about this particular field. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because sometimes, you know, </joey>
<connor> when these apology videos
come out, and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> 'eh, that's a good apology', </joey>
<joey> I look at the video and there's like, </joey>
<joey> you know, 20,000 likes
to 100,000 dislikes, </joey>
<connor> I'm like, whoa, why's everyone, like. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What did I do? </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - Am I missing something here? </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, exactly. Like, it kind of re, </connor>
<connor> I guess it like, rejustifies like, oh, </connor>
<connor> do I really, fully understand </connor>
<joey> the whole context of this video? </joey>
<joey> Because, I might think this
is a good apology video, </joey>
<joey> but 100,000 other people disagree. </joey>
<joey> So its kinda like, oh
okay well then, maybe </joey>
<joey> I should look into it more, but. </joey>
<garnt> - Also there's just something cathartic </garnt>
<garnt> about having the dislike button there. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> you know, it is, it
just doesn't feel right </garnt>
<garnt> if you're just smashing a button, </garnt>
<garnt> and it just doesn't really mean anything. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<joey> Its like, its like, going onto a video, </joey>
<joey> right? And just seeing
the comments turned off. </joey>
<joey> Nothing makes me more like, angry, than </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> going on a video, and wanting, no. </joey>
<joey> Not even wanting to comment on it, </joey>
<joey> just wanting to see what
other people think of it. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </connor>
<garnt> And just being removed
removed that privilege. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And I just feel like, as well, </connor>
<connor> this is just gonna lead
to more shitty comments. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> Because if you take away one avenue, </connor>
<connor> as, you know, you know, we all saw with, </connor>
<connor> what is it? Like, Twitter, right? </connor>
<connor> Its just ratio-ing them.
That's like, the new thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Did Twitter ever have a dislike button? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think it did. </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - No, they never had a dislike button. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, but, they changed, oh they took, oh. </connor>
<joey> I feel like ratio-ing is
a recent thing, though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, ratio-ing is a
recent thing, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Why did ratio-ing start happening? </joey>
<joey> - I think its because, </joey>
<connor> - Do we wanna explain what ratio-ing is? </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Because I've talked to several people, </garnt>
<garnt> and they've not known what ratio is. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, ratio-ing, oh, I
mean do you wanna explain? </joey>
<joey> - On Twitter? </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah its basically like,
where, if a tweet is so bad, </connor>
<garnt> right? You'll know its an awful tweet </garnt>
<garnt> when there'll be like,
more replies than likes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's called ratio-ing because like, </garnt>
<connor> the ratio is so much higher
to comments than likes. </connor>
<joey> - Or if the reply to the original tweet </joey>
<connor> has more likes than the original tweet. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Its like both, either ways, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I feel like, you know,
if there's likes on the video, </garnt>
<joey> people are just gonna start
ratio-ing in the comments. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Literally they're just gonna
like up the one talking shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But on YouTube you can like,
delete the comments as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. It just
seems like a stupid idea, </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] But that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Its like, that's the thing, right? </connor>
<joey> And I think that's why its
such a big problem for people, </joey>
<joey> because I think a lot of
YouTubers realise that, </joey>
<garnt> because creators can, and have
the space to delete comments, </garnt>
<garnt> if they want to, and delete like, </garnt>
<garnt> hateful, hurtful, negative comments. </garnt>
<connor> - Which you should be able to. </connor>
<connor> - Which you should be able
to, don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But, you know, you can't
get rid of a dislike. Right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And for a lot of people, if
they go onto a YouTube video, </connor>
<joey> and they realise 'oh, this
person who uploaded this video </joey>
<joey> is getting rid of negative comments'. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yep. </joey>
<joey> Well then, the only other way </joey>
<joey> I can express how I feel about this video, </joey>
<joey> is to hit the dislike button. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. And another thing is like, </garnt>
<garnt> the way they framed it, </garnt>
<garnt> like they were doing a
solid for the creator, </garnt>
<connor> where the creator, they literally said </connor>
<connor> the creator can still see how
many dislikes this video has. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<joey> - So, it doesn't help the creator at all, </joey>
<garnt> because they're the only
ones who can still see it! </garnt>
<garnt> - Right! </garnt>
<joey> I felt the exact same way when Instagram </joey>
<joey> got rid of publicly showing
how many likes a post has, </joey>
<garnt> and yet the creator </garnt>
<garnt> can still see how many likes the post has. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, what's the difference? </garnt>
<garnt> At that point. Like, you're still putting, </garnt>
<joey> this like, pressure on the
person putting it up, right? </joey>
<joey> - With Instagram, I'd actually argue </joey>
<garnt> I think it was a good thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was a good thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - You think so? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I think so. Because I
think Instagram was like, </connor>
<connor> highly competitively toxic. </connor>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> With likes. </joey>
<joey> - I guess maybe I didn't think that way </joey>
<connor> because I'm not part of that. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not into that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not a like, if you
follow me on Instagram, </garnt>
<joey> I'm sorry, that there is just like, </joey>
<garnt> zero content and zero updates at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Its a dead account. </garnt>
<joey> - Really says a lot when
out of the three of us, </joey>
<joey> I'm the most active on Instagram. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> And yet, I post like, once a month. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I just like, don't like
the platform that much. </connor>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<garnt> and I think it used be like,
the likes was definitely </garnt>
<garnt> a thing that I didn't really like at all. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<connor> Because to me, that was like, </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause it really felt like
people were just like-farming. </garnt>
<garnt> And just like, fucking,
it really bred this </garnt>
<garnt> toxic kind of environment
where people were, </garnt>
<garnt> it was literally like, a
clout-chasing kind of platform. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, then, question,
then. Would you guys, </joey>
<garnt> if Twitter, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> implemented the same things Instagram do, </garnt>
<garnt> would you be okay with it? </garnt>
<connor> - I would, actually. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Ah, I dunno. I feel
like Twitter's different. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> - I wouldn't want it on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> Wait. Before we get into that, </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have this like, I
don't know this is like, </garnt>
<garnt> a tin foil hat, a part of me just thinks </garnt>
<garnt> is YouTube just trying
to shift all the drama </garnt>
<garnt> onto like, Twitter? You can't. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you now right, let's
say you, you know, you can't, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't dislike something publicly, </garnt>
<garnt> let's say the comments are filtered. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I wonder if YouTube is just being like </connor>
<garnt> 'go to Twitter, go and argue
on Twitter. Don't fuck around,' </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't think about that, but that's, </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, with the dislikes gone, </garnt>
<garnt> what is there to do? </garnt>
<connor> Other than comment, and you know, </connor>
<connor> a lot of the time, with these videos, </connor>
<connor> people are just gonna
turn off comments, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking great, just even more toxicity </garnt>
<connor> heading towards twitter. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I do wonder that, because you know, </garnt>
<garnt> even if you're a YouTube creative, </garnt>
<garnt> if all the shit's going down on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder if YouTube can be like, </garnt>
<connor> - I mean like, I feel like
that's not going to happen </connor>
<garnt> because there's been
such an increase on like, </garnt>
<connor> commentary and drama channels now, </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<garnt> that the conversation is still
going to stay on YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> its just a lot of people, maybe, </garnt>
<garnt> can only publicly comment
about it on Twitter. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah also, also if anything,
it does really seem like, </joey>
<joey> at first glance, it does seem like, </joey>
<joey> everyone who is following
something on YouTube </joey>
<joey> also uses Twitter. But that
is really not the case. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I very quickly found out that yes, </garnt>
<garnt> even though I might have a
massive following on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> compared to, like, the
people who use YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> its really not a lot. Its not
even the majority of people? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I remember like,
there was this one time </garnt>
<garnt> where like, I posted
something on my Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I talked about it on my YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> and I got a lot of people being like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'well, I don't use Twitter.' </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But in the back of my head I was like, </garnt>
<joey> oh, yeah! There are some
people who don't use Twitter. </joey>
<garnt> - No I mean, I think its
gotten to the point now </garnt>
<garnt> where I've kind of had
this realisation where, </garnt>
<connor> every platform is kind
of like, in its own, </connor>
<connor> its, most of the time,
its in its own bubble. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - You can be really
popular on one platform, </connor>
<garnt> and then open an account
on another platform, </garnt>
<garnt> and just have like, zero followers. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, there's so many like, </joey>
<garnt> you know, YouTubers who
have a million plus subs </garnt>
<garnt> on their YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But then when you go onto their Twitter, </connor>
<connor> they have, you know, less
than 50,000 followers. </connor>
<connor> - Its the content right,
like, that's kind of how it. </connor>
<garnt> - But like, also like, I can't imagine </garnt>
<joey> how many fucking TikTokers
I just don't know about, </joey>
<joey> just because I'm not on the platform. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the thing is, like, they
can open a Twitter account, </joey>
<joey> because to me, like, the
way I see Twitter now </joey>
<joey> is just like, fucking influencer Facebook. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It literally is, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's basically what
its like for me now, </garnt>
<garnt> and like, sometimes I hear
about a TikToker who has like, </garnt>
<joey> fucking millions and millions
of followers on TikTok, </joey>
<joey> opens a Twitter, and its like. </joey>
<joey> You know, less followers than us. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Even though they have like, </joey>
<connor> more followers on their own platform. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - In YouTube terms, if they
had that many subscribers, </connor>
<garnt> on like, YouTube, then they
would be massive creators. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Not all followers, slash
subscribers are created equal, </connor>
<garnt> though, right? So. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah that's, that's true.
Like, it also really depends on </garnt>
<garnt> how much you focus and
post on that platform. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - And how much you're
known by your audience </joey>
<connor> to use that platform. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Man. I wondered,
because I'm thinking like, </connor>
<connor> you know, as content creators, </connor>
<connor> you know, if you're somebody who, say, </connor>
<connor> does not give a fuck about
anything and you're like, </connor>
<connor> 'I don't care about what
people say about me,' </connor>
<connor> I feel like the only,
really, tool that like, </connor>
<joey> an audience or a platform has to kind of, </joey>
<joey> what's the word? Police
you, or give feedback, </joey>
<connor> is like, public shaming, almost. </connor>
<connor> I feel like getting rid of
the dislike is a part of like, </connor>
<connor> you know, taking away from that. </connor>
<connor> Because I feel like, as content creations, </connor>
<joey> content creations,
creators, sorry, oh my gosh. </joey>
<joey> You know, the only real
tool other than like, </joey>
<joey> YouTube deleting your channel is like, </joey>
<joey> you know, I know it sounds bad, because </joey>
<joey> it sounds really fucking
terrifying, this public shaming. </joey>
<joey> But that's like, the only real tool, </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> that is there to like, stop
you from doing shitty stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Most of the time. For a lot of people. </joey>
<connor> Who are, questionable. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think, removing
the dislike button </garnt>
<garnt> is not gonna get rid of toxicity. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No. </garnt>
<joey> - Its not. Like, its just
gonna get other people </joey>
<joey> to figure out other creative ways </joey>
<joey> to produce that toxicity, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly, right? All
that's gonna happen is </garnt>
<joey> gonna shift into another form, </joey>
<garnt> and I feel like, to me,
removing the dislike button is </garnt>
<garnt> just so weird, to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its just censorship. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think its censorship. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like its a form of it, right? </joey>
<joey> Because again, like, you
know, if there's, again, </joey>
<joey> like, a video where its an
apology video or something </joey>
<garnt> controversial, and you
turn off the comments </garnt>
<garnt> and the dislikes aren't showing, </garnt>
<garnt> then how else are you </garnt>
<joey> supposed to say anything? </joey>
<joey> - I feel like the term censorship </joey>
<joey> gets thrown around a lot nowadays, </joey>
<joey> I feel like this is pushing the definition </joey>
<joey> of what censorship is. </joey>
<joey> Well what it is, is
that its removing a way </joey>
<garnt> for us to express ourselves. </garnt>
<connor> - I wonder if its a similar case to when </connor>
<connor> you know, when the whole
'Kids on YouTube' thing, </connor>
<connor> - Yep. </connor>
<connor> - Where they were all doing,
like gymnastics or something, </connor>
<garnt> people were commenting gross things. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> And then YouTube's response was </garnt>
<garnt> 'well, </garnt>
<joey> we'll just turn off all the
comments for kids' videos.' </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then YouTube's like, well
there's no more paedophiles </joey>
<joey> on YouTube now. They're all gone. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. If you can't see paedophiles, </joey>
<joey> then they're not there, right? </joey>
<joey> - 'What do you mean, where are they? </joey>
<joey> There's no realization on
YouTube, there's no dislikes, </joey>
<connor> what do you mean?' </connor>
<connor> It almost feels like
that. That YouTube's like, </connor>
<connor> if you just remove the option
to show it publicly to anyone, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't exist. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Its just the whole like, see
no evil, hear no evil, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. There's fucking tons
of videos of kids doing, </joey>
<joey> probably inappropriate
things on YouTube still, </joey>
<garnt> and that fucking creeps are
still watching them, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But now its harder to
fucking find these videos </connor>
<connor> and report them! Because, you know, </connor>
<connor> how the fuck are you
supposed to when you know, </connor>
<connor> there's not like, a bunch of
creepy dudes in the comments. </connor>
<joey> - Unless you like, actively go out </joey>
<joey> and search for those videos, </joey>
<connor> but who the fuck is wasting
their time doing that, right? </connor>
<joey> - Pedophiles. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I mean like, normal people </connor>
<joey> who are trying to get rid of those, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, there's so many circles </garnt>
<garnt> and so many like, rabbit holes that </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure people can fall down in YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> that we are just not aware of. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, because that just
shows how big YouTube is </garnt>
<connor> as a platform how like, I feel for YouTube </connor>
<connor> because when you have a platform this big, </connor>
<connor> no matter what you do, </connor>
<connor> there's going to be something
wrong with your platform. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. 100%. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel like, what they're doing </connor>
<connor> with the dislike button is its
going in the wrong direction. </connor>
<connor> Just because, just
because a problem exists, </connor>
<connor> like, removing your ability to express it, </connor>
<garnt> or removing your ability
to see that problem </garnt>
<joey> doesn't get rid of the problem. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - It just shifts it to somewhere else. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And, yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I really don't know
what they were thinking. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like its not even about like, </joey>
<joey> shifting it, as well.
Its not only shifting it, </joey>
<joey> but I feel, more times than not, </joey>
<joey> it also propels it? Into something like, </joey>
<joey> a lot more toxic and a lot
more just, out of control. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it, I think it
would breed more toxicity </garnt>
<garnt> because that just means people
have to find another way. </garnt>
<joey> - It just means that,
like, the people who are </joey>
<connor> shouting the toxicity now just
have to shout it even louder. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - For them to be like, oh, </garnt>
<joey> I need people to see what
I have a problem with. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because if, like,
part of the catharsism, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know if that's a
word, of seeing a shitty video </joey>
<joey> is just knowing that you're
not the only one who agrees </joey>
<joey> that this is a shitty video. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, right. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Right? And there's,
you know, it is good, </joey>
<joey> when you see this bad
video or this bad apology, </joey>
<joey> and you know, you can see that one, </joey>
<joey> the first thing that you
see is the dislike button, </joey>
<garnt> and the dislike bar. Like, my god. </garnt>
<garnt> It was great seeing like, YouTube Rewinds </garnt>
<garnt> and just seeing that
everyone collectively agreed </garnt>
<garnt> that it was just, a train wreck, right? </garnt>
<joey> Sorry YouTube, but it was. </joey>
<joey> - I love how a lot of the
comments, as well, were like, </joey>
<joey> ah man, YouTube was just
salty that they got ratio'd. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think that was
the reason, on record, </garnt>
<connor> but it was funny. </connor>
<connor> - It was a good meme, it was a good meme. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think that was
the reason, on record. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> like this is the official
reason you're salty. </connor>
<joey> - Corporates at YouTube are like, fuck, </joey>
<joey> I can't believe people hate
our products like this. </joey>
<garnt> - Susan's just like, 'I'm
never gonna forgive them, </garnt>
<garnt> I cannot believe it'. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> 'After all these years,' </garnt>
<connor> she's just been planning this for years </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> waiting for like, the right
person to be cancelled </connor>
<connor> to be like, okay, now's the time. </connor>
<garnt> - Now we have an excuse! </garnt>
<garnt> Now we have an excuse to implement this. </garnt>
<joey> - I wonder if they were like, </joey>
<joey> there was this YouTube meeting, </joey>
<garnt> and they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'guys, everyone's hating on
cancel culture right now? </garnt>
<garnt> Let's be the ones to end cancel culture. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's remove the dislike
button.' And they're like </garnt>
<garnt> 'oh my god you're a genius! They're gonna, </garnt>
<connor> oh YouTube is gonna love this!' </connor>
<connor> - Who would have thought it was that easy? </connor>
<connor> - They can't be cancelled
anymore, there's no dislikes! </connor>
<connor> Why is everyone hating
this?! What is happening? </connor>
<connor> Oh, I thought we were doing a good thing! </connor>
<joey> - I thought you guys hated cancel culture! </joey>
<joey> - We're removing negativity! What? </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it feels like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it really is, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just 'cause like, before
this, I would say that, </garnt>
<garnt> actually, I think YouTube was
in a pretty healthy stage. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Twitter was fucked,
but YouTube was good. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, YouTube was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Twitter was like, toxic </garnt>
<garnt> and obviously felt a bit vile sometimes, </garnt>
<joey> but YouTube just felt like,
just a dislike and that was it. </joey>
<garnt> - It was just, it was a nice balance. </garnt>
<connor> - A nice little finger, like fuck you. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Or like, fuck you, okay,
I'll get on with my day now. </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like, I think they have done </connor>
<connor> a lot of positive changes, </connor>
<connor> I do like the changes they
did to the copyright system. </connor>
<connor> Its not perfect, but its
better than it was before. </connor>
<connor> I like the fact that you have to like, </connor>
<connor> specifically put a timestamp </connor>
<connor> of what part of your
video's been copyrighted </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And as a creator, you can
still remove that, you know, </connor>
<connor> part that's been copyright striked, </connor>
<garnt> and have no effect on your
channel. I think that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> the best balance that
we could have hoped for. </garnt>
<joey> - And when you appeal
for it, it like, goes, </joey>
<joey> the money you make from that video </joey>
<joey> now goes into this limbo state where </joey>
<joey> it doesn't go to the creator, </joey>
<joey> and it doesn't go to the
supposed copyright holder. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that was a good change! </garnt>
<joey> - Which was fucking fanta, its like, </joey>
<joey> we've been wanting that for years now, </joey>
<connor> and YouTube was like,
we've heard your feedback. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, that probably
should have happened </joey>
<garnt> in the beginning. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It should have, like. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean it should have
happened in the beginning, </garnt>
<joey> but what I'm saying is, </joey>
<joey> - They eventually did it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they eventually did it, </joey>
<joey> and it felt like this change, </joey>
<joey> the changes they're making
now, is just unnecessary, </joey>
<joey> because nobody asked for
this, and I think, right now, </joey>
<joey> before this, as a content
creator, I was pretty happy </joey>
<garnt> with YouTube as a platform, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You knew what, you knew
what you could get away with, </garnt>
<garnt> you knew what you couldn't get away with. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, if, I feel like
right now, if a video, </garnt>
<garnt> if one of your videos gets
demonetised, aside from </garnt>
<garnt> Trash Taste videos, because, </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know why
half of the videos that got </joey>
<joey> demonetised got demonetised, because </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Well like, most of the time, </joey>
<garnt> if I upload something and
its a 10 to 15 minute, </garnt>
<connor> I know which videos are more
high-risk to get demonetised. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I know, most of the
time, its kind of on me </garnt>
<garnt> for making that video subject. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> and then, you have Trash
Taste, where, for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> some of our podcast episodes
just get demonetised, </garnt>
<garnt> and we hit, and its just like, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> we hit the appeal button, and
I guarantee, the person who's </garnt>
<garnt> like, reviewing the content </garnt>
<garnt> did not watch the entire 2 hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like 'ah fuck, its 2 hours long, </garnt>
<garnt> Jim, you gonna watch the whole thing? No? </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck it, we'll just
leave you yellow then.' </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> What's weird about the Trash
Taste episodes is that, </garnt>
<garnt> I think, on record, we have about like, </garnt>
<garnt> five or six of the episodes
now that are still demonetised, </garnt>
<garnt> but its five or six of the episodes </garnt>
<garnt> that shouldn't have been demonetised. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - We look at it, we look
back at them and we're like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what part of
this video flagged what, </connor>
<joey> but, we have like, a bunch
of other videos and episodes, </joey>
<garnt> where its like, these are the ones, </garnt>
<garnt> if anything, that should
have been demonetised. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, true yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But they're not for some reason? </joey>
<garnt> - Like the convenience
episode, that got demonetised, </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the combini
episode got demonetised, </joey>
<joey> and yet the hentai episode
is still monetised. </joey>
<garnt> - Hey, dude, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt shushing) </garnt>
<joey> - Don't tell them that. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Ah sorry, the fancy font episode. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> One is still monetised, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - The Greek, the Greek letter, </garnt>
<joey> (all fake laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Anyway, </garnt>
<joey> (all sighing) </joey>
<joey> I don't know, the one time, like, one day </joey>
<joey> I think to myself 'okay, I've figured out, </joey>
<joey> what exactly YouTube does not like, </joey>
<joey> about whatever video it is that </joey>
<joey> flags the demonetisation
system,' and then the next day, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, 'nevermind, I
don't know what you want.' </joey>
<garnt> - Because another thing I've
noticed about YouTube recently, </garnt>
<garnt> is, in a positive light, </garnt>
<connor> when did YouTube comments get really good? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Is that just me? </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean, good? </connor>
<connor> - The comments sections right now, like, </connor>
<connor> you click on a random meme video, </connor>
<connor> and the comments are always golden, and, </connor>
<joey> it didn't used to be that way because </joey>
<joey> it used to be this one overused joke </joey>
<joey> in every comment section, but, </joey>
<joey> - 'No one, comma.' </joey>
<joey> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Like the no one joke. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're all fucking copypastas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. But nah, but nah,
I don't know if its just me, </garnt>
<joey> but I think, </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah they're pretty funny now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like half my enjoyment when
clicking on a random video </garnt>
<garnt> is just going to the comment section. </garnt>
<joey> - Its weird because I
feel like the whole like, </joey>
<joey> you know, commenting in a
meme format, in a meme video, </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Its just like, I don't
know, people are just, </joey>
<joey> thinking to themselves, okay,
in order for me to stand out </joey>
<garnt> in this absolute cesspool of
comments on this one video, </garnt>
<garnt> I actually need to be,
surprise, creative about it! </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise I'm just gonna get
swept in with all these other, </garnt>
<garnt> like, meh comments, so now people, </garnt>
<joey> now there's like this
weird pressure to be like, </joey>
<joey> 'if I'm gonna comment on this meme video, </joey>
<joey> I gotta make it a fucking banger joke, </joey>
<joey> otherwise, no one's gonna like it </joey>
<joey> and its just gonna get buried.' </joey>
<connor> - And then you haven't
commented in the first hour </connor>
<connor> so you're not gonna be in
the top comments, anyway. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> (screen warping) </connor>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </joey>
<connor> - I know that none of
you watch porn, right? </connor>
<joey> - No, of course not. Ew! </joey>
<connor> - But just in case, you
have any friends that do, </connor>
<connor> you'll want to pay attention to this. </connor>
<connor> With everything going on in the world, </connor>
<connor> governments have increased
their surveillance, </connor>
<garnt> they're using your device
to track your location, </garnt>
<garnt> movement and in many countries, </garnt>
<garnt> your internet activity. </garnt>
<garnt> - Disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't want to be literally </garnt>
<connor> caught with your pants down, do you, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> and one of the best ways to
keep your online browsing </connor>
<connor> that you do private,
is by using ExpressVPN! </connor>
<joey> - When you use ExpressVPN
your internet connection </joey>
<joey> is rerouted through a
secure, encrypted server </joey>
<joey> so you can surf the web anonymously, </joey>
<joey> without anyone looking over your shoulder. </joey>
<garnt> - I know you're probably thinking that </garnt>
<garnt> all you have to do is use incognito mode </garnt>
<joey> and no one can see that you've watched </joey>
<joey> every last hentai video on PornHub. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, that's, that's not how it works? </joey>
<joey> - You're wrong. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey gasps) </garnt>
<connor> Again, Joey, </connor>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<connor> - Even when you're using incognito mode, </connor>
<connor> your internet provider
like Comcast or AT&T </connor>
<connor> can see every single website you visit. </connor>
<connor> And if you live on
campus, or you share WiFi, </connor>
<connor> your network admin can, too. </connor>
<connor> Its kinda scary. </connor>
<garnt> - That's why I use ExpressVPN
whenever I go online, </garnt>
<garnt> and I recommend all of you do the same. </garnt>
<garnt> Without ExpressVPN, you're
giving people a free license </garnt>
<garnt> to peek over your shoulder and frankly, </garnt>
<garnt> see all the freaky shit you're looking at. </garnt>
<joey> - I will not stand for that, </joey>
<joey> and that's why I will get ExpressVPN. </joey>
<joey> So, protect your privacy today </joey>
<joey> and get 3 months of ExpressVPN for free. </joey>

<garnt> Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I'm curious. As content
creators and YouTubers, </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Who have not given their feedback, </joey>
<joey> - As influencers. </joey>
<connor> (Connor scoffing) </connor>
<connor> - As influencers. </connor>
<connor> - God, I hate that word. </connor>
<connor> - Who have not actually given
their feedback to YouTube, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Uh-huh. </connor>
<connor> - Is there anything you
would like to say to YouTube </connor>
<connor> to improve the platform? </connor>
<garnt> Is there any actual feedback </garnt>
<garnt> you would like to give to YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Uhhhhhhhh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Apart from, and hopefully,
they'll actually hear us. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Uhhhhhhhh. That's a good question. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like, for
me, like, I don't know, </garnt>
<joey> there's another system that's
just been recently implemented </joey>
<joey> and its the checking system. </joey>
<joey> - Ah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I uploaded a
video recently and, so, </joey>
<joey> so, for those of you who don't know, </joey>
<joey> when you upload a video,
YouTube used to like, </joey>
<garnt> some pre checks to make sure it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> content friendly, and content monetisable. </garnt>
<garnt> Now, those checks for
absolutely no reason, </garnt>
<joey> just take, an hour plus. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's quite a while. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know if its because its like, </joey>
<joey> this new system is in
beta, or whatever, but, </joey>
<garnt> - But I heard nothing about this, </garnt>
<garnt> they weren't transparent
about that at all. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember like, </joey>
<joey> the first time it happened on
one of my videos I was like, </joey>
<garnt> oh no, am I in trouble? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - What's going on? Why, </connor>
<connor> - Like, diagnosing you. </connor>
<connor> - Why are there like,
fucking, enhance, enhance </connor>
<connor> this video to be like, </connor>
<connor> 'we gotta find at least one frame </connor>
<joey> where we can fucking sic this guy. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. I don't know who the fuck </connor>
<connor> is in charge of PR, but
why does it always feel </connor>
<connor> that when they like, tell us something, </connor>
<connor> finally, they tell us
something, and its like, </connor>
<garnt> the dumbest shit. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, we didn't need to know </garnt>
<garnt> that dislikes are being removed, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey And Grant] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I, how about you just reply
to my emails when I'm like, </connor>
<connor> having a problem, like, </connor>
<garnt> I think that's the one thing
is consistently been an issue </garnt>
<garnt> I think everyone talks
about, which is like, </garnt>
<joey> communication and the fact
that when you have an issue, </joey>
<joey> that could be very simple,
becomes ten times more difficult </joey>
<joey> because YouTube's just like fuck you, </joey>
<garnt> I'm not gonna talk to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And its like, well, you
know, and its not like you're, </garnt>
<connor> not making decent money
for YouTube, you know, </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - Even if its your living, it
feels like, well, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Well that's the thing, right?
Like, and that's the part </connor>
<connor> where I can't exactly
be like, wow YouTube, </connor>
<joey> I can't believe you ignore
us like that because I mean, </joey>
<joey> fuck, like, how many
channels are there now </joey>
<connor> that have over a million subs?
Like already that's like, </connor>
<connor> thousands and thousands and there is just, </connor>
<connor> probably all of those YouTubers </connor>
<joey> probably have at least
one period in their life, </joey>
<connor> where they're like, </connor>
<joey> I need you to reply to
me, so its like, I feel, </joey>
<connor> - How often do you need
to email YouTube for help? </connor>
<connor> Like, once a year at most. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, maybe like, once or twice. </joey>
<connor> - So then like, at that level, right. </connor>
<connor> Let's say if there is like
some kind of mythical barrier, </connor>
<connor> its like, a million subs,
you get to have someone. </connor>
<connor> That doesn't seem too unreasonable to me. </connor>
<connor> But also I feel like, its
something that YouTube </connor>
<joey> just doesn't wanna do either. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - Like, they don't wanna fuck with that. </connor>
<joey> - And again like, you
know, that would be fine </joey>
<garnt> if it was only those million plus subs </garnt>
<garnt> who even have access to
the YouTube email, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you could have a channel </garnt>
<garnt> with fucking 10 subs be like, </garnt>
<joey> 'umm, YouTube why did you
delete my video, please help.' </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So its like, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah because most, you know,
if you are a YouTuber, right? </connor>
<connor> You're probably following an
account called Team YouTube </connor>
<connor> on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - Which is like, YouTube customer support, </connor>
<joey> but not on their own fucking platform. </joey>
<joey> - But its a bot. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> and you know, you might tweet
them something that gets like, </joey>
<garnt> tons of attention, tons
of stuff, and then, </garnt>
<garnt> they won't reply to it, </garnt>
<garnt> but they'll be replying
to someone who's like, </garnt>
<garnt> like, a bunch of other people who are like </garnt>
<garnt> 'hey I got locked out of my account,' </garnt>
<joey> and they're like, 'oh well,
here's how you can do it!' </joey>
<connor> - Its a bit fucked that
in order to get YouTube's </connor>
<joey> attention, you literally
have to ratio them. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah you do, I mean, </connor>
<connor> you have to spam them, its unfortunate. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you do, its like,
you just got ratio'd! </joey>
<garnt> YouTube's like fuck, you got me. </garnt>
<garnt> All right, we'll help you out, bro. </garnt>
<joey> - Its like, how well can you ratio? </joey>
<joey> That's how quickly we'll
reply to your email. </joey>
<garnt> - But also you know, you know, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've heard people who've
got immense amount of help </garnt>
<garnt> just because they, you know, </garnt>
<joey> went to like, one YouTube event, </joey>
<joey> met a YouTube employee </joey>
<joey> and then they'll pull strings for you. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And that feels like, </joey>
<joey> its like, being in like, fucking prison, </joey>
<connor> its like, well your mate
knows the prison guard, </connor>
<connor> so you're not gonna get shanked. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Its like, what, how is that fair? Like, </connor>
<connor> I'm stuck in this system
and I have to work with you, </connor>
<connor> and I can't fucking do anything. </connor>
<joey> Its like, maybe I don't wanna
go to your fucking workshop, </joey>
<connor> YouTube? Have you thought about that? </connor>
<joey> Maybe I just want some help,
because my video got wronged. </joey>
<connor> - Because the only time I
ever got help from YouTube </connor>
<connor> was because I got very lucky </connor>
<connor> and I had a really good partner manager, </connor>
<connor> who's super super like, I think, </connor>
<connor> I think at the time
they were new to YouTube </connor>
<connor> and they were super down and like, </connor>
<connor> really be in depth and
talk with me and be like, </connor>
<connor> 'hey, what do you need,
what do you need help with,' </connor>
<connor> and they were very nice and
helped me out a lot, you know. </connor>
<garnt> And I was just sitting
there the whole time while </garnt>
<garnt> I was getting all this help,
I was like oh my god, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I sent how many fucking emails,
did so many other things. </garnt>
<garnt> We sent to so many people, </garnt>
<garnt> all it took was just one YouTube employee </garnt>
<connor> who was nice to me, who
recommended me to like, </connor>
<connor> the engineering team or whatever, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And all my problems
got fixed, and its like, </connor>
<joey> this is so dumb that
this is what it takes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - To be like, I have to
have a man on the inside. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> to help me out. </joey>
<joey> - You need a double agent. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, its like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> and they don't work there anymore, </garnt>
<garnt> so I don't even have the helping one, </garnt>
<garnt> so now I'm fucked with my issues. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now you're back to square one, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've just gotta like, cry on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> and I hate doing that. I
don't wanna be a child. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you know one feature on YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> that I do genuinely want removed? </garnt>
<garnt> - What. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I dunno if I would
be the only one here, </garnt>
<connor> the 'your video is this ranked out of ten </connor>
<connor> of your previous ten videos.' </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Ahh. Nah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I understand it does serve a use, </connor>
<garnt> but I don't, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm like, indifferent
to it, because its like, </joey>
<joey> it depends on how well
the video did really? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Where its like, </joey>
<joey> - That's the point! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, where its like, where its like, </joey>
<connor> if I see a video and then its like, </connor>
<connor> 'your video got less views
from your frequent viewers, </connor>
<connor> nine out of ten.' When its just like, </connor>
<connor> fuck the system. But then when its like, </connor>
<joey> 'one out of ten,' then
you see those fireworks, </joey>
<joey> you're like, 'damn, I'm good!' </joey>
<connor> - I think we explain the
system about performance </connor>
<joey> to recap real quickly,
YouTube ranks your videos </joey>
<connor> and how they're doing
against your other videos, </connor>
<connor> the past ten videos, it
ranks them one out of ten. </connor>
<connor> One being the best, ten being the worst. </connor>
<connor> I actually quite like it. </connor>
<connor> - You like it? </connor>
<connor> - As much as I hate it, I like it. </connor>
<connor> I think its good, you know? </connor>
<connor> I, before, I remember,
did you used to have like, </connor>
<connor> an estimate in your head
of what was good views? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. For me, it was like, </connor>
<joey> if I get so-and-so views
in the first 24 hours, </joey>
<joey> good view. If its over that, great video. </joey>
<joey> Below that? Bad video. </joey>
<connor> - The problem with that is that, you know, </connor>
<connor> your average of what I
expect a video to get </connor>
<garnt> is never static, and that
number is always changing, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think its good, </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't know what
I should be aiming for. </garnt>
<garnt> And at least this has
kind of helped me like, </garnt>
<garnt> set expectations and
figure out, okay, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> Its been a really good way
of figuring out personally, </garnt>
<garnt> all right, if something's number ten, </garnt>
<garnt> all right, let me go and reevaluate that. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah it fucking sucks,
I'm not happy about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And sometimes I genuinely do think </garnt>
<garnt> it was that a really fucking good video </garnt>
<garnt> that got fucked by one reason or another. </garnt>
<garnt> But most of the time, </garnt>
<garnt> I do feel like its been really helpful. </garnt>
<joey> As much as it makes me wanna just like, </joey>
<joey> quite YouTube. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I feel though, like, its
kind of a double-edged sword </joey>
<connor> in that case, though, because, </connor>
<joey> I remember where you know,
when you have like, say, </joey>
<joey> a really fucking good streak, right? </joey>
<joey> Of like, one to two months worth of videos </joey>
<joey> that are just banger
after banger after banger, </joey>
<joey> its like, all over performing. </joey>
<connor> - Its like the stock market, your bubble. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right! </joey>
<joey> - Your bubble's gonna pop. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, you know the fall's coming. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and then you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm expecting the fall, where's the fall </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> and then, you wake up the next morning </connor>
<connor> and your video's like nine out of ten, </connor>
<connor> or even like, a ten out of ten, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you're like, well shit.
This is the end of my career. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] So this is what you do. </connor>
<connor> - And then, when you
look at that video, like, </connor>
<connor> in retrospect, </connor>
<connor> if you just say screw it
to the other nine videos, </connor>
<joey> let me just look at this video on its own. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And its actually doing okay, </joey>
<joey> it just feels like the video is doing crap </joey>
<joey> because your other nine videos </joey>
<joey> were just over performing, right? </joey>
<connor> - You wanna hear a big brain strap? </connor>
<joey> Just make a shit video. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> Just make a shit video. </connor>
<joey> - You gotta, you purposely
make a ten out of ten? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Here's what I do,
right? Every now and then, </connor>
<connor> you know, as much as I
think all my ideas are, </connor>
<connor> you know, mostly good, </connor>
<garnt> sometimes I'll make a video,
and it comes out shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I'm like, you know what? Fine. </garnt>
<garnt> Have a ten out of ten. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Put my expectations down. </garnt>
<garnt> - Reset the expectations. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, yeah, let's just fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> let's humble myself for a moment here. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's just upload a shit video. </garnt>
<joey> I upload videos where I thought like, </joey>
<joey> oh my god, what am I doing, </joey>
<joey> and then like, I've also
had the opposite happen, </joey>
<joey> where I'm like, this is
a ten out of ten video, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, this is garbage. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - This is unwatchable, and it
literally got one out of ten, </joey>
<connor> and I'm like, I fucking hate
it here. This video sucked. </connor>
<garnt> - I've had that before, as well. </garnt>
<joey> - The worst ones are like, damn, </joey>
<joey> this is gonna be a banger video. </joey>
<garnt> Nine out of ten. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah, nothing feels worse than that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nothing feels worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nothing feels worse. </garnt>
<garnt> Like my entire like, I
check that in the morning </garnt>
<joey> once a video goes up, I see
that, and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> entire day ruined. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Just like that. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess one other
thing is that maybe like, </garnt>
<garnt> I do see the usefulness in it, </garnt>
<garnt> so I don't think it should be removed, but </garnt>
<joey> I think it should be harder to find, </joey>
<joey> because its like, front and center. </joey>
<joey> - It is literally the first thing you see. </joey>
<joey> - Literally the first thing
you see when you log in, right? </joey>
<garnt> To your account. And YouTube's
either giving you a clap, </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt clapping) </connor>
<garnt> or being like, son, I
expected better from you. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is wrong. </connor>
<connor> - Man, I don't know, I
think it's all right. </connor>
<connor> I think where it is is fine, honestly. </connor>
<connor> - I think its just how you like, </connor>
<connor> personally perceive it, all right? </connor>
<connor> (Connor sighing) </connor>
<connor> - I think it very much takes a, </connor>
<garnt> you have to kind of take
your emotions out of it </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit to really appreciate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which sounds so robotic, if you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think you just have to
appreciate the data for what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> Like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> - All it is, is neatly packaging </garnt>
<connor> the truth you're hiding from yourself. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> in a way that is digestible
within 10 seconds. </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well no, I think you know, that's the </garnt>
<connor> healthy advice to be like, 'yo, </connor>
<connor> - You should just get over it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You should just not be sad. </connor>
<garnt> - Stop being sad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just don't be emotional,
just why you feeling emotions, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause like. </joey>
<joey> - You know, its just your
livelihood. Fuck off. </joey>
<joey> - I mean we've talked about
it before, like, how you know, </joey>
<joey> a lot of YouTubers before said </joey>
<joey> they don't care about
the views. But you know, </joey>
<garnt> you do have, like, as
much as you want to think </garnt>
<garnt> that you're not emotionally
attached to your content </garnt>
<garnt> and the numbers around
your content, you do care. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its your job. </garnt>
<joey> - At some level. You do care. </joey>
<joey> And its not like, I think you just have, </joey>
<joey> you would have to be a heartless robot </joey>
<garnt> to make something you're proud of, </garnt>
<garnt> and not care about how
many people view it. </garnt>
<connor> - The way I see it, </connor>
<garnt> its that I don't care if I spill my drink, </garnt>
<garnt> but I do care if I spill my drink </garnt>
<garnt> and it wrecks my PC and
fucks everything up, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I feel there's an
acceptable amount of fucking up </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm like, 'ah, I'll
deal with that.' Right? </garnt>
<connor> If I get one ten out of
ten, ah, well, all right </connor>
<joey> you know, it happens. Something's
gotta be ten out of ten. </joey>
<joey> Two ten out of tens in a
row, I'm like, all right. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know, it happens sometimes, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> Three ten out of tens, I
will care, what is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's when I start, that's
when it starts to affect me. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But the first one, I don't
really let it affect me. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you know what, just
statistics are just saying </connor>
<connor> that this is gonna
happen eventually, like. </connor>
<joey> - Right, no, I completely
get that, right, like, </joey>
<joey> of course, eventually
you're gonna have to get </joey>
<joey> a ten out of ten. </joey>
<connor> - I love math, and you
know, I appreciate it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. No I do too, don't get me wrong! </joey>
<connor> But like, you know. </connor>
<joey> I know, I know that
eventually this streak, </joey>
<joey> whatever it is I'm on, is gonna
eventually run out, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and you know, even
then, if you think about it, </connor>
<garnt> right, the more you're
getting five out of tens, </garnt>
<garnt> six out of tens. </garnt>
<garnt> All you're doing is making
it closer and closer. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. Right. </connor>
<connor> - So if you're getting one out of tens </connor>
<connor> or tens out of tens every time, </connor>
<connor> you're making a like,
famine or feast situation. </connor>
<connor> Which is fine, but, what I'm at right now, </connor>
<connor> at least with my past few videos, </connor>
<connor> all been around like, give or take, like, </connor>
<connor> minimal percentage away from each other. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Like the difference between
third and eighth for me </connor>
<garnt> is nothing. So like at
that point I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even feel bad about any of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I'm like, ninth or third, </garnt>
<garnt> its barely any difference to me </garnt>
<connor> So why is YouTube trying to make me </connor>
<garnt> fucking feel bad about
it. Stop that YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - No but, because there's another factor </garnt>
<garnt> that I feel like, this doesn't take like, </garnt>
<garnt> account for, and that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> a long term performance of a video. </garnt>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - Because like, some of my
videos, some of my videos </connor>
<connor> that have been a nine, ten out of ten, </connor>
<connor> have gone on to grow into be like, </connor>
<connor> some of my most popular videos. </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like it,
what this system like, </connor>
<connor> really emphasizes, is how
well a video does short term. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> Whereas YouTube, as
like, a content creator </connor>
<connor> that has been on the platform
for a very long time, </connor>
<garnt> I know that short term
performance doesn't mean a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> but like, no matter what,
no matter if I make a video </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm proud of and I
think is gonna perform well </garnt>
<garnt> long term, I still feel shit about it </garnt>
<garnt> if it just is that nine or ten out of ten. </garnt>
<connor> - No need, you need one out
of your whole channel uploads. </connor>
<joey> Like one out of like, </joey>
<joey> one thousand or however
many uploads you have. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I think that's
just going onto videos </joey>
<connor> and looking up most popular. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but then you'll always feel good, </connor>
<joey> because you'll never have,
like, a lowest one ever again, </joey>
<joey> because you'll never have less
views. You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> like, YouTube come on. </connor>
<connor> - Its like, whenever you're
feeling bad, just like, </connor>
<joey> lemme just go check out my
most viewed videos of all time. </joey>
<joey> You know what? I still got it. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Its like, okay, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if us talking about this, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how the viewers
feel about this being like, </garnt>
<garnt> wow this is such a first
world problems nowadays, like, </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus Christ, they're
complaining about this, but, </garnt>
<garnt> the reason like, I think
about it a lot is because. </garnt>
<garnt> Before this, I really did
not give a shit about, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't, not that I didn't give a shit, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't really put as much
focus on my mental health </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> until I started working
in a creative industry, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I realised, oh
shit my mental health </garnt>
<garnt> actually matters when it comes to my work. </garnt>
<garnt> Where before I would just
like, grind out my job, </garnt>
<garnt> feel like shit, but it
would be easy, right? </garnt>
<joey> - And then drink the sadness
away at home, am I right? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And then drink the
sadness away, or just like, </joey>
<garnt> fucking wait for the weekend,
you live for the weekend, </garnt>
<garnt> you reset. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But now, its like a constant, okay, </joey>
<joey> I actually have to care about this thing, </joey>
<joey> otherwise it will literally affect </joey>
<joey> how well I'm performing at my job. </joey>
<joey> - I have no more weekends
and I'm constantly home. </joey>
<joey> - But like, not saying if
you have bad mental health </joey>
<joey> that you'll have an easy
time doing a job, but. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, in a creative job, </joey>
<joey> you really see the effects
of having bad mental health. </joey>
<garnt> Which is why to me, like,
this, a system like this </garnt>
<garnt> to me, is like, you get more
Ls than Ws in my opinion. </garnt>
<joey> - No, of course, absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> - And its, its a system where
its like, you get that one W, </garnt>
<joey> three times out of ten. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, its also because you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you're fighting in a system </garnt>
<joey> that you have absolutely
no control over, right? </joey>
<connor> Its like, you can't
control whether a video </connor>
<connor> gets a ten or a one, like, </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> - Its just, how it is, so
when you do get that one, </connor>
<joey> or you do get that dub, its
like, fucking three hundred </joey>
<joey> winning against the Persian Empire right? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> its like, oh shit, I mean
I wasn't expecting it, </connor>
<joey> but fuck me I'll take it. You know? </joey>
<joey> - Little man's pulling through. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, literally. </joey>
<joey> - You know what? There is
another feature on the whole </joey>
<joey> rating your videos and
how they perform thing, </joey>
<joey> which I don't actually quite like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I think its just, </joey>
<joey> the language they use
is just like, fuck off </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its where its like, </garnt>
<connor> this video is performing worse than usual. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah! </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I hate that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its like my mum talking to me, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I wish I could just put it
in like, another language, </garnt>
<connor> like fuck off, I don't
wanna read this shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Its like that
passive aggressive note </garnt>
<garnt> that's left on the fridge when
you're living in university. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, its like, motherfucker,
I know how to read a graph. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need you to tell me. Its like, </garnt>
<garnt> the like, there is one curve
that is lower than the other. </garnt>
<garnt> This curve is lower than the other, </garnt>
<connor> that means its doing worse. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, no shit its doing, </connor>
<connor> that's typically how graphs work. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> It tells you information. </connor>
<joey> - What I hate is that it starts
off with the layman's terms </joey>
<joey> of like, this is performing
worse than usual. </joey>
<joey> And then it goes on to be like,
its performing 40%, 7% less. </joey>
<joey> You didn't, you could have just
got rid of that first part, </joey>
<joey> you coulda just said
its performing 47% less. </joey>
<connor> And I would've. </connor>
<connor> - Its the pandering language that </connor>
<connor> YouTube tries to use of like,
'yeah, we care about you,' </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'We hear you.' </garnt>
<connor> - 'We hear you.' </connor>
<connor> - 'We hear you.' </connor>
<connor> - Its like, this isn't an
intervention, but it could be. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So sort your shit out. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Its frustrating. </connor>
<connor> - How do you guys feel
about the algorithm itself? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't give a fuck anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even know what
it is at this point. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, again, its like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, when you grow,
right, you give a fuck, </joey>
<joey> you're like, write that down, </joey>
<joey> like, any time MatPat would say anything, </joey>
<connor> you're like, fuck, write that down. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Whenever you're
growing you're like, </joey>
<joey> well shit, I need to be listening to this. </joey>
<garnt> Other wise I'm gonna be stuck
in my sub count forever. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But when you get to a
certain point and you can </garnt>
<connor> just kinda make whatever
the hell you want. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Its just like, I feel
like I've figured it out, </connor>
<joey> and then some days its just like, </joey>
<joey> 'nope that's not how that works.' </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I feel like every creator, </connor>
<connor> at least that's been around for a while. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like this is probably like, </connor>
<connor> a reason you do stay around a while, </connor>
<connor> is that you just stop valuing
getting crazy sub growth. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And just being like, </connor>
<connor> I just wanna make good shit
that just maintains what I have. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, I don't think
that you need to keep growing, </connor>
<connor> we will keep growing, </connor>
<connor> but its not something I really care about. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's my mentality of its like, </joey>
<joey> at the end of the day, if I see </joey>
<garnt> that I have more subs
at the end of the day </garnt>
<garnt> than I did at the beginning of the day, </garnt>
<garnt> whether that's one sub
or ten thousand subs, </garnt>
<joey> its like well, I'm still here, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like, I feel like, as a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> the hard part is getting to around like, </garnt>
<garnt> 100k to 500k subscribers, </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> because luck plays such a big part. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - In that, and getting your
videos on the algorithm itself. </garnt>
<garnt> But I feel like, once you
get to around that size, </garnt>
<joey> it like, becomes more predictable </joey>
<joey> than people give it credit for. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, because at that point, </joey>
<joey> it becomes more like a game, right? </joey>
<joey> Where you know what's gonna perform well, </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> you kinda know what's gonna perform well. </joey>
<joey> And sometimes you get this
lucky hit where you just </joey>
<joey> like, I don't know why
this video's doing so well, </joey>
<joey> but most of the time, if
you get to a past 100k, </joey>
<joey> you can kind of predict how,
what you need to do to grow. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you understand what
the system, at least. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<connor> - If you understand the platform. </connor>

<connor> - Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like its always about, you know, </connor>
<connor> to get to the million, you know, </connor>
<connor> you have to go through the proving ground </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> like, to get to that size </connor>
<connor> you have to consistently </connor>
<connor> prove to YouTube that you can make content </connor>
<connor> that is engaging to people. </connor>
<joey> Then I feel like you
can just kinda be like, </joey>
<joey> all right, well, you know, I feel like, </joey>
<joey> it feels like less effort
'cause you just know </joey>
<joey> what you're doing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> You feel like, I put
less thought into things, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, oh, you know,
I know that won't work, </garnt>
<garnt> inherently like, just by looking at stuff, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, that's a bad thumbnail, </connor>
<connor> that's a bad title, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then you can just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> not take it easy, but you
can focus more on just, </connor>
<connor> having a healthy work schedule, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we've said this
before a hundred times </joey>
<joey> and I'm sure everyone can
figure it out, you know, </joey>
<joey> when you first start out its
brutal, the hours you put in. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - For nothing. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<connor> - But I also like, you know, </connor>
<connor> - For like $2 ff you're lucky. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I also like, I remember, you know, </connor>
<connor> back in the day when I was still growing, </connor>
<joey> I never once thought to
myself, 'that's a good title', </joey>
<connor> or 'that's a bad title', 'that's a good', </connor>
<connor> 'that's a bad thumbnail', right? </connor>
<joey> - I just tried to explain the video, </joey>
<connor> and then I was like, wait,
that's not how it works. </connor>
<connor> - I was just like, </connor>
<joey> here is an image of game
with number in the corner. </joey>
<connor> - Episode 7. Done. </connor>
<joey> - I'd be like, </joey>
<connor> 'The Sebastian Call Where
the Girl Gets Excited' </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And it was like, well that's
not. That's not a good title. </connor>
<connor> And I started changing it up. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but past you was like, </joey>
<joey> 'I mean, now people know
what this video is,' right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like the
platform has changed a lot </garnt>
<connor> since we started growing. </connor>
<connor> - You could get away with
doing the parts before, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You can't do parts. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. Not anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't do video parts now. </garnt>
<joey> - Unless you have, like, </joey>
<joey> a massive series that people
are really waiting for. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - Like, we say parts, but
fucking Trash Taste is parts. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> we've literally put
numbers on each of them. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I mean that's just for ease, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> To keep track of it. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean its kinda like, I mean </garnt>
<garnt> its parts but you can enjoy each part. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I don't even call it a part. </garnt>
<garnt> Its an episode number, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> - And you can enjoy
each episode, by itself, </garnt>
<garnt> and then there are also
people who are just like, </garnt>
<garnt> are like, totally ingrained in like, </garnt>
<garnt> the Trash Taste lore,
whatever the fuck that is. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I go onto our subreddit
sometimes and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> man, the amount of layers that new like, </garnt>
<garnt> viewers would have to understand </garnt>
<garnt> just to get this one meme
is fucking ridiculous. </garnt>
<joey> - We literally have a chronological order, </joey>
<joey> and a fucking, like, a lore order. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Where its like, no its watching order </joey>
<garnt> and chronological order. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like, the
Trash Taste lore, like, </garnt>
<joey> watching our subreddit goes
beyond just our channel now. </joey>
<garnt> It just like, everyone
we've ever interacted with </garnt>
<garnt> is now part of the Trash Taste lore. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - True. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Its hilarious. </connor>
<connor> - I find it like, I find it impressive </connor>
<connor> how people have just like,
been able to create this like, </connor>
<garnt> because its not even like, its
not even logically laid out. </garnt>
<garnt> People just have this
unwritten understanding that </garnt>
<garnt> 'Okay, yeah, this is part
the Trash Taste lore, </garnt>
<garnt> and part of the Trash Taste group.' </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, the only other like, </garnt>
<joey> group I've seen this dedicated is like, </joey>
<joey> people who are into the
Nasuverse, where its like. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Its just like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. Call just me out, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - What's the Nasuverse. </joey>
<joey> - Its a fake lore. </joey>
<garnt> - Its the fake. </garnt>
<joey> - Its like, they're fucking
pulling it from like, </joey>
<joey> literally nowhere that has
anything to do with anything, </joey>
<garnt> being like, 'well, I mean
Garnt did say this thing </garnt>
<garnt> on this like, tiny like,
YouTuber's podcast, </garnt>
<garnt> like, six years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure this has
a connection somewhere </garnt>
<joey> to one of these episodes.' Where its like. </joey>
<connor> - Its weird man, it
feels like the first time </connor>
<connor> on YouTube where people actively
care about what I'm doing. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, doesn't that sound strange? </connor>
<connor> Like, before I just felt
like no one gave a shit </connor>
<connor> what I was up to. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Just do my own thing. </joey>
<joey> Now I feel like, people actually like, </joey>
<connor> watch when I do something, </connor>
<connor> and like, whoa, this is weird. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's the thing, its like, </joey>
<joey> I've noticed that whenever I
go onto the subreddits like, </joey>
<connor> half of these posts
have nothing to do with </connor>
<connor> the actual Trash Taste episodes. </connor>
<connor> Its like, its either drawn
from like, someone's Twitter </connor>
<connor> or someone's Twitch, </connor>
<joey> or a guest's Twitter or a guest's Twitch. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Its like, or like, a friend
of one of the host's like, </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> What? </garnt>
<joey> - Its kind of cool, though. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I'm not saying
this is a bad thing, </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, its dope as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just, like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just find it really interesting </garnt>
<joey> that it became like that. </joey>
<garnt> - No, what I find really interesting, </garnt>
<garnt> that people are able to
follow along, with this, </garnt>
<garnt> even though there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no fucking coherent watch order? </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] No. </connor>
<connor> - You know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Now we've gone to the point
you can watch every episode </connor>
<connor> of Trash Taste and still
not understand everything </connor>
<connor> going on in the subreddit, right. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] No, of course. </connor>
<connor> Because then you have
to follow our content, </connor>
<connor> you have to follow other people's content, </connor>
<connor> other people's Twitter, and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> god fucking damn, man, respect to you. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Honestly. Its cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just so confused. </garnt>
<connor> I'm on this podcast and
I don't know the lore. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I can't keep up with the
shit that's been going on. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know what's canon
and what's not canon anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - Like what is canon, what is not canon. </garnt>
<garnt> Its just, I just view it as
one of the people in like, </garnt>
<garnt> the fucking lore, and
I'm just like, damn man. </garnt>
<garnt> What is going on right now. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess I did say or
do that, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Everyone's just calling
me a VTuber simp now, </connor>
<connor> that's all they call me now.
That's what they're saying. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah that's been the hot meme. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, we just did this episode again </connor>
<joey> by just saying that right
now, the big hot meme </joey>
<joey> on the Trash Taste subreddit
is Connor making every VTuber </joey>
<joey> he interacts with into a Connor simp. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> Essentially. </joey>
<joey> Which is hilarious, because you were the, </joey>
<joey> I've seen this fucking
screenshot everywhere. </joey>
<joey> Whenever someone mentions that like, </joey>
<joey> you're the Vtuber simp, now, being like, </joey>
<joey> this one screenshot that just says </joey>
<joey> 'I don't understand VTubers.' </joey>
<connor> - I still kinda don't, like. </connor>
<joey> - Meanwhile every VTuber's like, </joey>
<joey> well, I understand you. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I really enjoy collaborating with VTubers </connor>
<connor> and talking to them. </connor>
<garnt> I think, mainly from the aspect of like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I don't particularly care about </garnt>
<garnt> the character themselves,
or who they're playing. </garnt>
<garnt> I think just as a content creator myself, </garnt>
<garnt> I find it really interesting </garnt>
<connor> what it takes to play a
character like that permanently. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And its normally, you know,
when you talk to the VTubers, </connor>
<connor> if I talk to them offline, where you know, </connor>
<garnt> you normally get some really
interesting bits of information </garnt>
<garnt> just about how, you
know, they like, prepare, </garnt>
<garnt> or how they think about it, </garnt>
<connor> and I just find that really fascinating. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> And I think, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you're collaborating with
a VTuber, I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> I think there's a really
interesting dynamic </connor>
<connor> that you can work off really well, </connor>
<connor> if its one Vtuber and
one like, IRL person. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where, although I think a lot of, </connor>
<connor> maybe diehard VTuber fans
will think 'no! Never!' </connor>
<connor> You know. </connor>
<connor> - 3D and 2D do not mix. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> - I think there is some really
interesting room for like, </connor>
<connor> really fun and interesting collaborations </connor>
<connor> that come across because of the 2D-3D mix. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Well, I mean. </connor>
<connor> - I completely agree, because, like, </connor>
<garnt> I kind of remember when
Ladybeard was on like, </garnt>
<garnt> now a few weeks ago I guess. </garnt>
<connor> But I remember like, </connor>
<garnt> hearing his story and
hearing how he goes about, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, his character
and his stage presence, </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that. I was just like, </garnt>
<connor> yeah I kinda think VTubers, </connor>
<garnt> I said VTubers were wrestling with waifus, </garnt>
<garnt> and after talking to
Ladybeard I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I kinda, I kind of
agree with myself more now. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - God. Cognitive dissonance. </garnt>
<connor> I found something that proves my point. </connor>
<garnt> Thus, it is correct. No,
I do agree, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I spoke to some of your
VTubers, and, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you hear so many different
reasons why they became VTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> like, 'oh, I just wanted easy money', </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> or 'oh, I really, really
liked this character', </connor>
<garnt> or, I've always, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> or 'I can't do anything with
my face, I'm too anxious,' </garnt>
<garnt> or, yeah. Everyone has their own reason </garnt>
<connor> and its really fucking
cool to hear about that. </connor>
<connor> And, get to know the people
behind it, sometimes. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel the like, especially
recently, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> maybe still in Japan, there
might still be a thing of </joey>
<joey> 'oh, you know, 2D and 3D
shouldn't mix,' you know, like. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> 'IRL and VTubers should
never do stuff together </joey>
<joey> 'cause it breaks the
immersion' blah blah blah. </joey>
<joey> But I feel in the West,
especially recently, </joey>
<connor> I feel that idea is
slowly starting to fade, </connor>
<connor> because, especially, you
know, if we're look at like, </connor>
<connor> VShojo, right. Like, they're
doing a lot more like, </connor>
<connor> collaboration with IRL streamers. </connor>
<joey> Like, Nyanners did that whole thing </joey>
<joey> where they did a tour of Japan, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh. </connor>
<connor> - And that was IRL, and
I think just yesterday, </connor>
<connor> as of this episode, </connor>
<joey> Anthony Padilla did like, a
'I spent a day with VTubers.' </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<garnt> - They actually had a clip of Trash Taste, </garnt>
<joey> of the Cali episode. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - On that. </joey>
<joey> Hell yeah. Yeah and I just feel
like, at least in the West, </joey>
<joey> sure there still might be a
lot of diehard VTuber fans </joey>
<garnt> who don't want that illusion
to be broken, or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> But, I feel the majority
of them are kinda just like </garnt>
<joey> 'well, I mean, let's not
kid ourselves.' Right? </joey>
<joey> Like, these are also
people, and, you know, </joey>
<joey> I think its cool to see
this, like, really weird, </joey>
<joey> two different worlds completely
clashing with one another. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - In a really cool way. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, I will say like, </joey>
<garnt> I have been watching less VTubers
as 2021 has rolled around. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - Part of the reason of that is that </connor>
<connor> anime has gotten really,
really good again. </connor>
<connor> So I've just had. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, I've skipped the waifus, back to, </connor>
<connor> - Back to the scripted ones. </connor>
<connor> - Back to the scripted ones. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But also its less that
I've just been watching </connor>
<connor> less VTubers, but I've just
been watching more streamers </connor>
<connor> in general, now. </connor>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> Not even watching streams,
but watching like, </joey>
<joey> the stream highlights
and the stream content </joey>
<joey> that has been posted on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Because I feel like, there
is a definite difference </joey>
<joey> between hololive and VShojo,
right? Because I feel like, </joey>
<connor> VShojo are VTubers who are streamers, </connor>
<connor> and I feel like hololive
is definitely more like, </connor>
<connor> treated as idols. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And what I found is that I kind of </connor>
<connor> more gravitated towards seeing
VTubers as content creators, </connor>
<connor> like, I just respect
them as content creators. </connor>
<connor> More than anything, and like, I, you know, </connor>
<garnt> I've never understood idol anime, </garnt>
<joey> or like, the idol kind
of industry itself, so. </joey>
<garnt> That's why I've gravitated more
towards VTubers who I think </garnt>
<joey> are just like, beyond anything, </joey>
<joey> are just talented content creators. </joey>
<garnt> And just, doing good content. </garnt>
<joey> - And I think that might be
one of the bigger reasons, </joey>
<garnt> why nowadays, </garnt>
<joey> I'm watching a lot of the
streamers from NijiSanji. </joey>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> Because again, like, its not so much, </garnt>
<joey> they kind of treat their
VTubers, again, like streamers. </joey>
<connor> Like, actual content
creators, because they don't, </connor>
<connor> they're not really seen. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there are people
who view Nijisanji YouTubers </connor>
<connor> as idols, quote unquote, but. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel, just been in,
like, a lot of live streams </connor>
<connor> of all sorts of Nijisanji creators, </connor>
<connor> there are definitely
a lot more, just like, </connor>
<connor> just people, or like,
streamers, or content creators, </connor>
<connor> who are just here to have, </connor>
<garnt> shoot the shit and just have a fun time. </garnt>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> yeah, again, like, </connor>
<connor> I feel there's like, a
different of enjoyment to that, </connor>
<garnt> as well as you know, how hololive is </garnt>
<garnt> kind of seen in that sense, and like. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not saying one is better
than the other, personally, </garnt>
<garnt> but I just think its a
really interesting dynamic, </garnt>
<garnt> because people just think,
'oh if you're a VTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> you're immediately like, hololive', </garnt>
<garnt> or 'you're immediately like,
VShojo', you're just kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> thrown into this like, single basket of </garnt>
<garnt> 'you are this type of content creator </garnt>
<garnt> with this type of fan base.' </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - When, in reality, its
very very different, </garnt>
<joey> depending on how, I guess,
you treat your character? </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. Its kind of weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even in hololive, even in
the hololive agency itself, </garnt>
<garnt> there are like, a lot
of streamers in hololive </garnt>
<garnt> are doing like, very,
very different content. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> But I think the difference
is, now, that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> 2020 was the year of the VTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yep. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or hololive's year, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's just like, there'll
be the year of the Zodiac. </garnt>
<joey> - The year of the Vtuber. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it kind of was. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm year of the VTuber. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, 2020 was,
the year of the VTuber. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The difference between
like, the hype is, </connor>
<connor> I mean obviously there's,
the viewership's still there, </connor>
<garnt> the craze that was there. </garnt>
<connor> - The growth has like,
slowed out a little bit. </connor>
<connor> - Its definitely gonna be harder, </connor>
<connor> to grow as a VTuber. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Even in an agency like hololive now </connor>
<garnt> because there's so much
competition out there. </garnt>
<connor> - Its like the gold rush is already like, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah the golden age is
kind of over, right? Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I think this year has really, for me, </garnt>
<garnt> separated like, VTubers, not just VTubers, </garnt>
<connor> but streamers who are doing like, </connor>
<garnt> really really interesting
content and just, </garnt>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> interesting ideas vs you
know, a Vtuber who, you know, </connor>
<connor> doesn't put as much thought
into their content, maybe? </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> And just, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I was trying to find
a nice way to word that. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - The good ones from the bad
is what you're trying to say? </connor>
<garnt> - Not the good ones from the bad, </garnt>
<garnt> but just, </garnt>
<garnt> - The stronger ones? </garnt>
<garnt> - The ones who really view this as like, </garnt>
<garnt> as content, and just like,
as an entertainment platform. </garnt>
<garnt> Rather than. </garnt>
<joey> - And not just as like, a gimmick, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.
Because I feel like, </joey>
<garnt> the gimmick part is over
now, the gimmick era is over, </garnt>
<garnt> and if you want to grow as a VTuber now, </garnt>
<garnt> you need to have solid content. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. And I think its because, like, </joey>
<joey> you know, the idea of
VTubing as a gimmick now, </joey>
<connor> is just so, just common knowledge, now, </connor>
<connor> that whenever a new VTuber comes out, </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> not as many people are like
'oh my god, did you see this? </connor>
<joey> Its like, a virtual person on
my stream right now,' like, </joey>
<joey> everyone knows what a VTuber is now. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, so curious about
where this is gonna go. </connor>
<connor> You know, we're in a good spot right now, </connor>
<connor> where I feel like, its in like, </connor>
<connor> the middle period, if you will. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, everything's pretty
chill, things all good, </connor>
<connor> - Yep. </connor>
<connor> - I'm really interested to see
how the community in general </connor>
<garnt> will handle things like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> what if a VTuber wants to quit. </garnt>
<garnt> What if a VTuber wants to show their face, </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<joey> and just start streaming like that? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know. When the stuff,
'cause this hasn't happened yet, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I've clearly, </garnt>
<connor> do you know of any VTubers
who have been like, </connor>
<connor> yeah fuck VTube, like, big VTubers, </connor>
<connor> and they've been like, fuck this </connor>
<garnt> I'm gonna show my face
and do normal streaming. </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably the one that comes to mind </garnt>
<garnt> is Kizuna AI. The original one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But that's different,
though, I feel like, </connor>
<joey> - I mean, she wasn't
considered like, a streamer. </joey>
<connor> Like, she wasn't a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<joey> You're talking about like, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, the VTubers right now. Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean there's been a
lot of Nijisanji VTubers </joey>
<joey> who have quit, for no reason. </joey>
<connor> - Like, some, I wonder if
its no reason or you know, </connor>
<connor> NDAs have been signed, you can't say. </connor>
<joey> - Well no, actually there was
one where she openly was like, </joey>
<garnt> I'm quitting just because I've
found something else to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, its nothing like,
I've no bad blood or anything, </garnt>
<joey> and I can say that contractually, </joey>
<connor> I just wanna quit because
I have something new to do. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> and everybody in that fan base
took it really, really well. </connor>
<joey> They were like, 'well, its
gonna suck that you're gonna </joey>
<joey> go, but, at least all your
old content is still here.' </joey>
<joey> Right? Like, 'good luck bro' kinda thing. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well that's good,
yeah, I mean, obviously, </connor>
<connor> at some point I can imagine there, </connor>
<connor> 'cause there's agencies and agencies </connor>
<connor> aren't always the best, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's probably
gonna be a messy breakup, </connor>
<joey> if you will, at some point, right? </joey>
<joey> - Oh I mean like, that
has been in the past, </joey>
<connor> but honestly I don't wanna
get into that shit right now. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<garnt> - I don't even know about that, </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't of messy breakups
that have happened, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Because of agency stuff,
but, a lot of that is like, </garnt>
<garnt> its kinda just like, well I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> its an agency we're
dealing with and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> they're trying their best to
sweep everything under the rug. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't even wanna
deal with that shit </garnt>
<joey> to be honest with you. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's not dig that stuff up. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, let's not dig
that stuff up, right, </joey>
<garnt> its their problem, fuck this. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I won't ask. </joey>
<connor> - Because like, I'm just
interested to see how the </connor>
<connor> I mean, how the industry grows. </connor>
<garnt> - Its so new, right? </garnt>
<connor> Is it gonna be VTuber
apology videos, you know? </connor>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> if so, will there be a deep sigh, </connor>
<connor> will they look into the camera? </connor>
<connor> These are the things I wanna know. Like, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like, re-watching
YouTube evolve but like, </connor>
<joey> on like, ten times speed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Its like, its so new and
like, nothing's been defined, </joey>
<garnt> the rules aren't set in stone. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's kinda doing their own thing. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> and its kind of Wild West right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And its, I just love watching it, </garnt>
<garnt> and just hearing about it. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> Its so fascinating for
that reason, and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like I said, I don't really watch VTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> I watch my friends,
because I'm like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> gotta, gotta support your friends. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And, because like, one thing
that I always think about, </garnt>
<connor> and one reason why I could like, </connor>
<garnt> never like, be a VTuber
myself is I think about it, </garnt>
<garnt> and like, part of like, what
I love about being a YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> and making content where
people know who I am </garnt>
<garnt> is being able to meet fans and </garnt>
<garnt> being able to meet people at conventions, </garnt>
<joey> stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> and I just think, you know, </joey>
<joey> especially with conventions and AX stuff, </joey>
<garnt> and you know, every public
meeting cancelled last year, </garnt>
<garnt> and possibly this year as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sad because like,
I don't get to get the, </garnt>
<connor> what's the word I'm looking for, </connor>
<connor> - Interaction? </connor>
<connor> - I don't get to get the interaction. </connor>
<connor> - Oh I'd never thought about that. </connor>
<connor> - Because at the end of the day, like, </connor>
<connor> there's, looking at numbers
means nothing to me, right? </connor>
<connor> - Meeting the people and meeting the fans. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of times, it resets, like, </connor>
<connor> it reminds me the reason why I do this. </connor>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> why I love doing this, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, months of stress
can be wiped out by </garnt>
<garnt> one weekend of just, meeting fans, like. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like, I don't know man, </garnt>
<garnt> its just, like, its, </garnt>
<garnt> - Its so wholesome. </garnt>
<connor> - Its like, a rewarding
experience that you'll never, </connor>
<connor> its so unique. </connor>
<garnt> - It gives you something tangible, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like, for all the work that you've done. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I just think, man. I
can't imagine being a YouTuber, </connor>
<garnt> a VTuber and just never
being able to meet fans. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, in person, right? And just, </garnt>
<garnt> - Knowing there's a, so
many people who like, </garnt>
<garnt> love you and what you do, and
like, everything about you, </garnt>
<connor> you can never say like, </connor>
<garnt> - There is like, weirdly no
better feeling than just, like, </garnt>
<garnt> minding your own business going out, </garnt>
<connor> and then someone stopping
you on the street being like, </connor>
<connor> 'I fucking love you.' </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like, because I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> that sounds a bit weird out of context. </garnt>
<joey> - Its just like, very bizarre. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It sounds weird out of context </joey>
<joey> but I have had fan
relationships like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, yeah, but like, as a VTuber, </garnt>
<joey> no one knows what you look like, right? </joey>
<joey> - Even in some universe
where you could meet fans, </joey>
<connor> like, they would expect
you to be this character. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Do they actually like you </joey>
<joey> or do they like this
character they're playing? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Or like the character, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Its this, its a weird dynamic </joey>
<connor> that I can't imagine myself having. </connor>
<connor> - Well its like, </connor>
<garnt> - I guess we appreciate that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I, you know, there's some YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> some VTubers out there that probably like, </garnt>
<joey> the last thing they ever
wanna do is meet anyone. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. And I feel, </joey>
<connor> - Which I get, you know? </connor>
<connor> - And I feel we can say that you know, </connor>
<garnt> we might not be able to experience that, </garnt>
<garnt> and aw its sad that they
can't experience that </garnt>
<garnt> because, you know, we've
experienced, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> fans coming up to us and
liking us and praising us, </garnt>
<garnt> for who we are, and how
we should ourselves. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> But you know, I mean, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> there might be some VTubers out there </garnt>
<garnt> who have probably never
experienced that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So they probably don't even know the joy. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of that. They just think, </garnt>
<garnt> well of course the only fan
interactions I'm gonna have </garnt>
<garnt> is people who like my character. </garnt>
<garnt> - Um OnlyFans. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Fucking ten years old. </joey>
<garnt> - What are you, twelve? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry! </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You're the most mature one here, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry I just completely ruined your. </garnt>
<joey> - You're the same person who
plays Pokemon and is like, </joey>
<joey> 'ha ha, they said pee pee.' </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - 'PP up.' </joey>
<joey> - 'PP up' ah hah. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No but like, you know, because I feel </joey>
<joey> if a VTuber went from
traditional YouTubing </joey>
<connor> where they get that
kind of fan experience, </connor>
<connor> to then go onto VTubing, </connor>
<connor> and get a completely different
type of fan experience. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Then sure, you know,
there might be like, </connor>
<connor> 'ah fuck, I mean, this
fan interaction is cool, </connor>
<garnt> but its not the same kind of you know, </garnt>
<garnt> gratification I got when it was just me </garnt>
<garnt> in front of a camera,' right?' </garnt>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> But to a love of these VTubers, </connor>
<connor> they don't know any better,
so they're probably just like, </connor>
<connor> 'well, yeah, of course, people
like me for my character,' </connor>
<connor> and they probably don't
give a shit, you know, </connor>
<connor> for me its, I feel its
the same as you know, </connor>
<connor> people going up to voice
actors and actresses, </connor>
<connor> and being like, 'I love
you because you played </connor>
<connor> this character.' </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel its the exact same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its like, to them, that's, </garnt>
<joey> they're probably expecting that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Its weird because
I obviously look at this </garnt>
<garnt> from a content creator's
perspective, and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> if I did ever get the chance </garnt>
<garnt> to meet any VTubers I really liked, </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> I would like, 'just wanted to say, </garnt>
<joey> love the fucking content you're doing,' </joey>
<joey> I also find it really fascinating, </joey>
<joey> the kind of like, mindset you have to be </joey>
<joey> to be this kind of content creator. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because its such a different field </joey>
<joey> from what we're doing, and I don't know, </joey>
<joey> its just really interesting to me. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Is this what it feels like, when like, </garnt>
<joey> a parents is like, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> is like, 'I don't get this
whole YouTubing thing, </joey>
<joey> but it must be very difficult.' </joey>
<joey> I can't, I could never
see myself doing it. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, that's what I really, </garnt>
<garnt> I really respect streamers, </garnt>
<garnt> because they do something
that I find fucking difficult </garnt>
<garnt> to do, like, I don't know how. </garnt>
<joey> - And I'm sure its vice versa
for the streamer, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't know how you
go home and stream sometimes, </garnt>
<joey> Connor, I'm just like,
I go home, I'm done. </joey>
<joey> - I sleep. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't know how
you go home and sleep, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> look at you, you disgust me. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I just
like, I like it. Its fun. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I like talking. </connor>
<garnt> - It seems fun, it seems like, </garnt>
<garnt> the streaming sphere
right now, it seems like, </garnt>
<garnt> its just fun, it just seems like, its. </garnt>
<garnt> You get more chance to
just, really collaborate </garnt>
<garnt> and make friends as
well, which is one thing </garnt>
<garnt> I'm really jealous about. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know if its because </connor>
<connor> I'm paying more attention to
streaming, it just seems like, </connor>
<connor> its in a really good place right now. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it is. Its funny
because I think streaming </garnt>
<garnt> is in a really good place,
I think Twitch is like. </garnt>
<joey> We've complained about YouTube, </joey>
<joey> - No, Twitch is terrible. </joey>
<garnt> - But my god, Twitch as
a platform, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Yeah, it is, almost,
just, from how I see it, </joey>
<joey> it seems like, its
almost fucking impossible </joey>
<joey> to grow on Twitch as like, </joey>
<joey> someone who's coming from nothing. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, do you guys know why
are all the VTubers on YouTube? </connor>
<connor> Why is most, at least,
at least Japanese ones. </connor>
<connor> Why are they all on YouTube? </connor>
<joey> - Because YouTube, I feel, or
I mean this is just my guess, </joey>
<connor> but I feel its because YouTube,
to a Japanese audience, </connor>
<connor> is a lot more well-known than Twitch is. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Ah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel Twitch, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> not to say that there aren't
massive Japanese streamers </garnt>
<garnt> on Twitch, there are. </garnt>
<garnt> And some of them pull
insane fucking numbers, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I feel its just two
completely different worlds like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't. This is just my guess </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel for a regular Japanese
viewer of content online, </garnt>
<connor> you stick only to one
website, and that's it. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas like, you know, I feel its like, </connor>
<connor> if you're a YouTube watcher, </connor>
<connor> you are exclusively a YouTube watcher. </connor>
<connor> If you're a Twitch watcher,
you're a Twitch watcher. </connor>
<connor> If you're a Niconico watcher,
you're only on Niconico. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> Whereas, I feel that same
mentality doesn't work </connor>
<connor> for a Western viewer, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, A Western viewer will be like, </connor>
<connor> 'well yeah, I'm gonna watch
some content on YouTube,' </connor>
<connor> - I go where the content is. </connor>
<connor> - Well yeah, but like, I
can also go onto Twitch </connor>
<connor> if I want to, right? </connor>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess so. </joey>
<joey> = I don't know, maybe. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, for me, I
hardly watch any Twitch at all, </garnt>
<joey> on the Twitch platform, </joey>
<joey> but I think what's becoming
more common now is like, </joey>
<joey> Twitch and YouTube are becoming
more and more intertwined, </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> where like, a lot of, some
of the most popular content, </joey>
<joey> and some of the most original
content as well, right now, </joey>
<joey> has been Twitch highlights. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that's why I've grown way more of </joey>
<joey> an appreciation for Twitch, like, </joey>
<joey> I still spend very little
time on the platform, </joey>
<joey> as a consumer, but, I end up consuming </joey>
<garnt> a lot of Twitch content on YouTube, </garnt>
<connor> which is why I think like, </connor>
<connor> one of my favourite
content creators right now </connor>
<connor> is probably Ludwig? </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> Where he's just doing like, </connor>
<garnt> the subathon that he's
doing right now is insane. </garnt>
<connor> - Insane. </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - Definitely over by now. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Definitely.
Hopefully is over by now. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> My god. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, are you gonna
like, die on camera, like? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is that when the subathon ends? </joey>
<connor> - Sleeping on camera is like, </connor>
<connor> one of the most bizarre
things for me to like, </connor>
<connor> think about doing. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you wanna explain
what, who Ludwig is? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so Ludwig used to be very big </connor>
<garnt> in the Smash community. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> and then moved to
streaming and became like, </garnt>
<garnt> An instant hit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Streaming. </garnt>
<connor> He's very funny, very
naturally charismatic. </connor>
<garnt> - He's just a natural born entertainer. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. And he did a
thing where every sub, </connor>
<joey> it adds 10 seconds I believe? </joey>
<joey> - Something like that. </joey>
<joey> - So every time someone
subscribes to his Twitch channel, </joey>
<joey> 10 seconds gets added,
and it went up to like, </joey>
<connor> you know, 70 hours at one point. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So, the big
difference is that, he made. </garnt>
<garnt> Normally in a subathon,
you cap the number of hours </garnt>
<garnt> that you can possibly stream for a time. </garnt>
<garnt> He made the stream stream
uncapped and I think, </garnt>
<connor> right now, he's been
streaming for over a week? </connor>
<connor> Continuously? </connor>
<connor> - Ah, its like, two weeks, I think. </connor>
<garnt> - Something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it two weeks? </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> - And he just sleeps on stream. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's something to me, that I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> dude, what the fuck, just like, </connor>
<connor> I like, say things in my sleep. Like, </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know what you say in your sleep. </joey>
<connor> - Dude, listen, listen. </connor>
<connor> I don't say anything bad. </connor>
<connor> But what if its the one day
where I say something bad. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - One, day where you
have that one nightmare. </joey>
<connor> - Does it count if you're
racist in your sleep? </connor>
<connor> Does that count? </connor>
<joey> - When you have that one
racist nightmare, right? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Like, what if right,
you're listening to like, </connor>
<connor> that, you know, that GTA,
or the modser clip where, </connor>
<connor> you know, they say the thing, you know? </connor>
<connor> - What if you go to bed and
then you just say it out loud </connor>
<garnt> when you're sleeping. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you be cancelled for
being racist in your sleep? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - If that actually happened, </connor>
<connor> would you be cancelled if
someone said, you know, </connor>
<garnt> the thing in their sleep? </garnt>
<connor> - Depends if you're a VTuber or not. </connor>
<garnt> VTubers are just like,
that word is just like, </garnt>
<joey> free game. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> every VTuber has that
past for some reason. </joey>
<garnt> Especially if they're Japanese, but uh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but what if you're
a white guy, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Ludwig's sleeping and then he sleeps, </garnt>
<joey> he's talking and then
he says that, you know? </joey>
<connor> Do you get cancelled? </connor>
<connor> - God. There's a part of me that says </connor>
<connor> 'that's ridiculous, of course not,' </connor>
<joey> but then another part of me is like, </joey>
<joey> 'nah, he would definitely get cancelled.' </joey>
<connor> - Can you be cancelled for your dreams? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's like, some George Orwell shit. </connor>
<connor> - Well like, do you have control of your, </connor>
<joey> what does it say about you if, </joey>
<joey> - Call up the dream police! </joey>
<joey> - If you say a racist thing
in your dream are you racist? </joey>
<garnt> - (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm about make a dream TwitLonger. </garnt>
<connor> - Deadass, right? </connor>
<connor> - The site for dream police. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Wait until it happens. </joey>
<garnt> Its gonna happen, </garnt>
<garnt> and no one's gonna fucking
know how to deal with it. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just imagining like,
the plot of Inception, </connor>
<connor> instead of like, putting in an idea, </connor>
<garnt> just go in the dream just
to cancel them in the dream. </garnt>
<connor> - There'll be two camps, there'll be like, </connor>
<connor> the camp that believes
like, you know, okay, </connor>
<garnt> well he just said it in his dream. </garnt>
<connor> There'll be another team like, </connor>
<connor> 'I bet he's secretly awake and said it,' </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'because he's racist.' </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Nobody says that in their sleep, </joey>
<garnt> unless he's awake. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he's awake, and racist! </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> This is a really weird tangent,
I just thought, you know. </connor>
<joey> - I think its a very valid
thought experiment, though! </joey>
<garnt> - Its a very valid thought. </garnt>
<garnt> - I you know, I never do I ever, </garnt>
<connor> ever wanna say bad words like that. </connor>
<garnt> - I just wanted to, like, to all respect, </garnt>
<garnt> how the fuck was that the
first thing you thought of? </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen. Because no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - When you saw someone sleeping on stream. </garnt>
<connor> - My, what I see when I
see sleeping through stream </connor>
<joey> as a content creator, I just think like, </joey>
<joey> everything that could go wrong. </joey>
<joey> Like, what if I shit myself in my sleep? </joey>
<joey> - Everything can be taken outta context. </joey>
<joey> - What if I do a rip, an
absolute massive fart. </joey>
<joey> Like, the wettest thing. </joey>
<joey> Just like, any of the stuff that could </joey>
<garnt> reasonably happen in your
sleep that is totally normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not being racist in your sleep, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if that's
normal. Probably isn't. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - Not that I would know. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, and like,
he takes his shirt off </garnt>
<joey> when he was sleeping and you
know, what if you just like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you know, sometimes, you
fucking throw the sheets off </joey>
<garnt> when you're sleeping, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh you sleep naked as well, don't you? </garnt>
<connor> - Well I don't sleep, well, it depends. </connor>
<joey> - What if I just pop a
nut on screen, right? </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Or if you get, you
know, you're lying down, </connor>
<joey> you got a morning wood.
Big, big boner, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like, right on stream, 4K. </joey>
<joey> You're like, what, you
get banned for that? Like, </joey>
<joey> I'm just literally thinking, </joey>
<joey> the stuff that you would never ever think </joey>
<joey> would ever happen normally
when you're sleeping. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But just suddenly become like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is my number one rule
now when I'm sleeping. </garnt>
<connor> - No it is valid, it is valid. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's a lot of
things you don't think about. </connor>
<connor> - Because you can't control it, you know! </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> There's a lot of things,
because with YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> we could easily edit stuff
out if we'd said something, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Just wanna, just wanna
say if I shat myself, </connor>
<garnt> I would own it by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - On stream? </garnt>
<connor> - I would, yeah, I would shit. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like, I feel like
the possibly worst thing </garnt>
<garnt> that could happen on
stream when you're asleep </garnt>
<garnt> is that you just utter
a racist word, you know? </garnt>
<connor> I'm just thinking, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Would you rather utter
a racist word asleep </connor>
<garnt> or shit yourself? </garnt>
<garnt> - Id rather shit myself. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd rather shit myself. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? Shit yourself on
stream? That's great content! </garnt>
<garnt> - You're not gonna get
cancelled for that, if anything, </garnt>
<joey> you'll be immortalised on the internet </joey>
<garnt> as the one dude who shit farted himself. </garnt>
<joey> - Think about the amount of subs </joey>
<connor> you'd get for shitting
yourselves on stream. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I could just see it, you
know, you say something racist, </joey>
<connor> you end up on FOX being
like, 'liberals are trying to </connor>
<garnt> cancel this man, for being
racist in his sleep!' </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just imagining what if, like, </garnt>
<garnt> a VTuber shit themselves on stream. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you imagine the super Chat for that? </garnt>
<connor> - No, it would be like,
'I'm weirdly turned on. </connor>
<connor> Here's 500 bucks.' </connor>
<joey> - Thanks for that. I needed that. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my god. How do we, </garnt>
<connor> we've gone on a really weird tangent. </connor>
<connor> - It was the subathon. </connor>
<connor> - Ah, the subathon,
yeah I mean, I've like, </connor>
<garnt> - Twitch content's gone crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Talking about like, watching him sleep, </garnt>
<garnt> and just like, the Chat going
crazy and stuff like that, </garnt>
<joey> I watch it and I'm
like, weirdly engrossed. </joey>
<joey> Not because he's sleeping, </joey>
<joey> just because of like, the reaction itself. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Of like, how active this Chat is, right? </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, man, </joey>
<garnt> this is literally just The Truman Show, </garnt>
<garnt> we are watching The
Truman Show happen to us. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But he can't leave his room. </connor>
<garnt> At least in The Truman
Show you can walk around. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But I mean, </connor>
<garnt> this is kinda like the closest
we've had to The Truman Show. </garnt>
<joey> And its, fascinating. </joey>
<joey> - It would drive me insane </joey>
<joey> - Its a fucking Black
Mirror episode. It is. </joey>
<garnt> - And its fucked. Its fascinating. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. But its also like, I
just, find it really weird that </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what the mentality
of people is, where like, </garnt>
<garnt> you watch this dude sleeping on stream, </garnt>
<garnt> and you think to yourself
'I'ma drop a hundred subs.' </garnt>
<garnt> While he's asleep. Because
like, normally, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd like to think if I
dropped a hundred subs, </garnt>
<garnt> I would want him to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'yo, thanks for the hundred subs!' </garnt>
<garnt> Like, at least a tiny bit of recognition </garnt>
<garnt> from the person who I'm
subbing it to, right? </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But its just like, he's
not gonna see this at all. </connor>
<connor> I'ma just drop 500 bucks just like that. </connor>
<joey> Just because I can.
Its like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the mentality
of it is, because like, </joey>
<garnt> I've given subs. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think anyone does at this point. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. Because like, I've
gifted subs before on stream, </joey>
<connor> right, on like, other people's
Chats or whatever but like, </connor>
<connor> dropping a hundred subs on
a dude who's fucking asleep. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Its like, </joey>
<joey> what goes through your head to be like, </joey>
<joey> 'yeah, I'ma do that.' </joey>
<garnt> - I mean I think its
just being part of like, </garnt>
<joey> this experience, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because I feel like,
this is, you feel like, </connor>
<connor> the thing about Twitch that, you know, </connor>
<garnt> I kind of understand is like, </garnt>
<garnt> you do feel like, you're
being a part of something </garnt>
<garnt> bigger than yourself, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like, especially like, </connor>
<connor> obviously he didn't think
it would be this successful </connor>
<garnt> that it was a fucking a genius move. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - It was like, one day
in he made like, $150,000 </connor>
<garnt> or something. So even just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I know he he doesn't
seem like the kinda guy </garnt>
<garnt> who gives a fuck about the money. </garnt>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I mean, but he's gonna. He's. </joey>
<joey> - But there's also a part
of me where its like, </joey>
<joey> I just threw away my
humanity for $150,000. Right? </joey>
<connor> - Its like, sign me the fuck up! </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you kidding me? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Film every part of my life for $150,000? </garnt>
<connor> - Bro I will shit myself for $150,000. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I will poop myself
on stream for $100,000. </joey>
<connor> - Any billionaires wanna? </connor>
<connor> - Trash Taste shitting special, let's go. </connor>
<connor> - Any billionaires wanna fund this? </connor>
<connor> - The next Trash Taste livestream, </connor>
<joey> look out for one of us shit
farting live on Twitch. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<joey> - I just thought of like, </joey>
<joey> the most cursed content I can think of. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] What? </joey>
<joey> - You just lock people in a room and just, </joey>
<connor> see who shits themselves first. </connor>
<connor> They can't go to the toilet. </connor>
<connor> - That's Mr Beast's next video. </connor>
<garnt> - That's Mr Beast's video, right? </garnt>
<joey> Last person to shit themselves
wins a million dollars. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Its like, survivor, just with shit. </connor>
<connor> - Jimmy I just gave you
a fantastic idea, bro. </connor>
<connor> You don't have to give me credit for that. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. Oh my god. Where do we go from here? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know mate. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I just find it fascinating
bro, its like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> you see a content creator
like Ludwig on Twitch </joey>
<joey> where he's just fucking doing something </joey>
<connor> that is not exactly the most unique thing, </connor>
<connor> but its also that one
thing where its like, </connor>
<connor> well I wouldn't fucking do it so obviously </connor>
<connor> no one's gonna do it. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right. But I'm just like, when it gets </connor>
<connor> to this point of like,
yeah I've been streaming </connor>
<joey> for two weeks straight like,
can it go up from there? </joey>
<joey> Like, what is gonna be the next thing? </joey>
<connor> - Everyone's gonna be waiting
for the next subathon. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, god no. </garnt>
<garnt> - And its just gonna
be even longer, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - No, please no. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like, that's like, I don't think </joey>
<joey> there'll be a subathon
that'll be as popular as this </joey>
<joey> because he was the first one who did it. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> - Unless he does it again. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, even if he does
it again I feel like, </joey>
<garnt> the hype wouldn't be as big
because, unless, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unless it prematurely fizzles out, </garnt>
<garnt> where its like, oh what. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even know when
this one's gonna end yet. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So who the fuck knows?
I mean its kinda like, </joey>
<garnt> do you remember Twitch Plays Pokemon? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah. I was
actually about to say right, </garnt>
<garnt> the last time I saw this phenomenon </garnt>
<joey> was during Twitch Plays Pokemon. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah that's the kind of shit </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna be telling my kids about. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, honestly, I enjoyed the </garnt>
<garnt> Twitch Plays Pokemon
experience so fucking much. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Hey son, remember that time
when Twitch Played Pokemon? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> 'No, Dad.' </joey>
<joey> - But its like, the Ludwig
thing is like, its like, </joey>
<joey> Twitch Plays Pokemon, but
instead of an algorithm </joey>
<joey> that's just reading the Chat, </joey>
<joey> its literally just a dude
reading everything in the Chat </joey>
<joey> being like, 'okay left, down, up, A' </joey>
<joey> - So, to explain Twitch
Plays Pokemon, like, </joey>
<joey> this was how many years ago now? </joey>
<joey> - Five. </joey>
<joey> - Oh god, like, five or six years ago? </joey>
<joey> - Five or six years ago, where
someone made, like, someone, </joey>
<joey> - It was an Australian dude, </joey>
<joey> - Was it an Australian dude? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, basically someone made a program </joey>
<joey> that would allow the Twitch Chat to play </joey>
<joey> a full game of Pokemon, right? </joey>
<joey> So I think it was Pokemon Red? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it was the first gen Pokemon, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That was played. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] And basically, the
Chat could put in their inputs, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] For fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, and
whatever inputs were put in </garnt>
<garnt> would be inputted into this emulator </garnt>
<garnt> that would be played
live in front of like... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah so if you typed in 'left' in Chat, </garnt>
<garnt> and entered it, then the program
would, in order, go left, </garnt>
<connor> but the trick is, there
was literally what, like, </connor>
<garnt> 50,000, 100,000 plus people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, watching this stream. </garnt>
<joey> - Watching and Chatting. </joey>
<garnt> - And Chatting, like, at the same time. </garnt>
<joey> - Its like giving the Game
Boy to 100,000 people at once. </joey>
<joey> And being like, finish this game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. And its one of the few times </joey>
<garnt> where the word 'social experiment' </garnt>
<garnt> actually meant 'social experiment', right? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Dude, it reminds me of, </connor>
<connor> I saw a clip the other day and it was like </connor>
<connor> 'if the moon landing
happened with Twitch Chat' </connor>
<joey> and then they were like literally
just put like, an overlay, </joey>
<joey> and it was like, 'Pog! Pog, its landing!' </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Its such a good video. </joey>
<joey> I imagine how much more hype
would the moon landing be </joey>
<joey> with a bunch of pogs and shit. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. Dude. I absolutely
would be pogging the Chat. </joey>
<joey> (Screen warping) </joey>
<connor> - This video is sponsored by Liquid I.V. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] When you push your body hard, </joey>
<joey> or just feel run down, </joey>
<joey> its extremely important to stay hydrated. </joey>
<joey> Making hydration a priority
helps us feel healthier </joey>
<joey> on a day-to-day basis. </joey>
<joey> With one stick of Liquid
I.V. in 16oz of water, </joey>
<joey> you get two to three times
the amount of hydration </joey>
<joey> as plain water. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly? Every time I'm hungover now, </garnt>
<garnt> I take one of these bad boys. </garnt>
<garnt> I honestly feel a lot better. </garnt>
<joey> - Well yeah, its like, doing
like, water times three. Right? </joey>
<joey> - Its just like. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It does help, actually. Memes aside. </garnt>
<connor> Wait. What flavours do we have, Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, today with us
we have lemon and lime, </garnt>
<garnt> and strawberry. </garnt>
<garnt> Which, this one, on
hangovers, they taste amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> they get you hydrated,
this is what you need. </garnt>
<connor> - Liquid I.V. is so effective because </connor>
<connor> of their cellular transport technology. </connor>
<connor> I am not qualified to
know what that means, </connor>
<connor> but I feel very refreshed and
hydrated after I have a stick. </connor>

<garnt> - Remember bros, keep yourself hydrated. </garnt>
<garnt> Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> (screen warping) </garnt>
<garnt> I would love to see sporting
events with Twitch Chat, </garnt>
<garnt> like, can you imagine how fun
the Olympics would have been? </garnt>
<garnt> If it was streamed on Twitch? </garnt>
<joey> - Well its funny you say that because </joey>
<joey> I recently, someone in my
Twitch Chat notified me </joey>
<joey> of this Twitch channel that
streams the sumo on Twitch. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Dead ass there are people,
every time one of them wins, </joey>
<joey> there is dead ass just a stream of 'pog'. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like, this is weird, </garnt>
<joey> that people are pogging a sumo wrestler. </joey>
<joey> - There'll be like, </joey>
<connor> fucking professional
back seaters coming out, </connor>
<joey> like, you know, I'm sumo wrestled a... </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You know, this technique's
pretty fucking lacklustre. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Here's how I would have
optimised that match. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Honestly this is just sloppy behaviour. </joey>
<connor> Dude, I saw a clip that popped
up on my YouTube as well, </connor>
<garnt> and it was like, Twitch Chat
goes crazy about car stopping. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] What? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - And it was just, like, </joey>
<joey> a camera that's watching
a street with a stop sign? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And. </joey>
<joey> - Like, a security camera footage? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And
they're just streaming it. </joey>
<joey> And you can see Twitch Chat in the corner </joey>
<joey> and no one stops at the stop sign, </joey>
<connor> but then one car stops at the stop sign, </connor>
<connor> and Twitch Chat goes fucking crazy. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, 'who's watching this?' </connor>
<connor> Why is there hundreds
of people watching this? </connor>
<garnt> Going crazy? </garnt>
<connor> - That's really funny. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like, its the equivalent of, </garnt>
<connor> do you remember the DVD logo, on like, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> the DVD screensaver, and it
like, hitting the corner. </joey>
<joey> Actually is there a stream of that? </joey>
<joey> - There probably will be. </joey>
<joey> - I bet there would be a stream. </joey>
<joey> - I guaran-fucking-tee
there is a stream for that. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Because I can imagine when
the DVD thing hits the corner. </joey>
<garnt> Twitch Chat, </garnt>
<garnt> - Pog! </garnt>
<garnt> - The amount of pogs in chat, man, </garnt>
<joey> the amount of pogs in chat. </joey>
<joey> - Every time its so close
its like, ah MonkaS. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But no like, yeah, going
back to Twitch Plays Pokemon, </garnt>
<garnt> like, part of the amazing
experience of that was </garnt>
<connor> being like, being part
of something bigger, </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> and I just loved the lore that came out of </connor>
<connor> Twitch Plays Pokemon, right? </connor>
<connor> - What law? </connor>
<garnt> - You weren't on the subreddit
and everything like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I wasn't on the subreddit. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, so. </connor>
<connor> - Its like, factions forming
against each other, you know, </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - And stuff like that, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. So you know,
what happened is, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it was a random game
played by Twitch Chat, </garnt>
<garnt> or not random, but it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like, a game
played by a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of random things happened, </garnt>
<joey> and out of this randomness, like, </joey>
<joey> the community just created
a kind of storyline, </joey>
<joey> they created a narrative </joey>
<joey> out of the chaos that
was happening, right? </joey>
<joey> - Of course they did. </joey>
<joey> - And so, we're going full circle now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because an entire lore was created </joey>
<joey> out of the chaos and the randomness </joey>
<joey> that was happening on
Twitch Plays Pokemon, </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. And so like, people
got invested in this narrative, </garnt>
<garnt> people got super, super
fucking invested in this lore. </garnt>
<connor> - My god! </connor>
<connor> - The helix fossil. </connor>
<joey> - And the helix fossil, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I mean yeah, I
know that's where like, </garnt>
<connor> the whole like, Lord Helix meme came from. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<joey> but like, that's the extent I know of. </joey>
<joey> - And then there's like, you know, </joey>
<joey> just, they wanted more. </joey>
<garnt> Some people, like, a half
the people wanted more order, </garnt>
<garnt> and half the people wanted the chaos. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And there was just
like, arguing and stuff, </joey>
<joey> and it was quite interesting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the only thing I remember
from Twitch Plays Pokemon </joey>
<joey> is, or, they eventually finished it, </joey>
<joey> I think they released
their starter within like, </joey>
<joey> the first like, hour or something? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think people were
trying to sabotage... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. People were trying to sabotage... </joey>
<joey> - Because obviously they were, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And obviously then the
whole Lord Helix thing. </joey>
<joey> But other than that like, I don't know, </joey>
<garnt> you know, at first when I heard about it, </garnt>
<garnt> oh I have to fucking go onto this, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And participate and somewhere I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I gotta be part of this history. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The moment I went in </garnt>
<garnt> and the chat is moving so fucking fast, </garnt>
<connor> where it just like, looks like a blur. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, I
remember I typed into... </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, nevermind, I'm good! </joey>
<connor> - I typed in a command and I was like, </connor>
<connor> well, I didn't see it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly! I was trying
to catch it being like, </joey>
<joey> well I didn't see it. Fuck it, whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - No because like, I mean
there was like, so many </garnt>
<garnt> epic moments created out of
the most mundane situations. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I remember there was
this one ledge that took like, </connor>
<connor> fucking, eight hours to cross. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] No, I remember this, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] And it was like, the
most epic ledge of all time. </connor>
<connor> I think I watched that collectively, like, </connor>
<garnt> three hours at least, of my own time. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, we talk about </garnt>
<connor> 'what is the mentality of people
watching someone sleeping' </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, wait a minute, </garnt>
<garnt> I just watched three hours
of this video game character </garnt>
<garnt> trying to cross a fucking ledge. </garnt>
<garnt> I have, I can't act like
I'm better than anyone else, </garnt>
<garnt> because I fucking did that as well. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - We need like, a category
of competitive gaming </connor>
<joey> where its like, a team does
like, everyone gets one button, </joey>
<joey> on the game. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my god. </joey>
<connor> - Like, Dark Souls but
everyone gets one button each. </connor>
<joey> - Well actually one of
my friends, they're like, </joey>
<connor> a couple streamer and they
do split control Sekiro? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> - So like, one of them is on the mouse </garnt>
<connor> and the other is on the keyboard </connor>
<connor> and they beat the whole
game on split controls, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, this is
the type of shit that's like, </connor>
<garnt> why. Why would you subject
yourself to this pain. </garnt>
<garnt> I can barely play Sekiro
with both of my own hands. </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let alone having the fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> and also like, they manage
to beat the whole game </garnt>
<garnt> without getting mad at
one another? I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> that's not how it works. </joey>
<joey> - Scripted! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, scripted! Fake. </joey>
<joey> - What's wrong with you two?! </joey>
<joey> - What's wrong with you two? </joey>
<garnt> - Have you seen that one
Twitch streamer who like, </garnt>
<garnt> plays League of Legends
with the most random inputs? </garnt>
<connor> - Is it RossBoomsocks? </connor>
<connor> - I don't, I don't remember but. </connor>
<connor> - It might be like, bananas? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like, he played... </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - He played League of
Legends using bananas. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> As inputs. </garnt>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Because I think
its not that difficult, </connor>
<connor> because you just need something that, </connor>
<connor> because there's only really
like, four major buttons. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So you just need to have
something that takes four inputs, </garnt>
<garnt> and you can literally
do that with anything. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. Right. Right. </connor>
<garnt> - No I mean, that's why I think </garnt>
<garnt> I've been watching more
stream content right now, </garnt>
<garnt> because I think to me as a
YouTube creator, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> we watch a lot of YouTube and I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> we can definitely see the formula
of good content on YouTube </garnt>
<connor> and its rare nowadays that,
I look at a YouTube video </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, 'wow, that is, </connor>
<connor> you're doing something
really original right now,' </connor>
<connor> because I mean, you know,
we had a few years go </connor>
<connor> where Mr Beast completely
revolutionized the platform, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - and now it just feels like, </connor>
<connor> he's the one coming up with
the original ideas, you know, </connor>
<connor> Mr Beast, like, head and
shoulders about the rest. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And I feel like, he's someone who is, </garnt>
<garnt> one, is someone who
understood the platform. </garnt>
<garnt> And two, now has the resources
to do the craziest ideas </garnt>
<garnt> that literally no one else
can even think of doing. </garnt>
<joey> - No one else can do. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, who the fuck just
makes a fucking burger chain? </garnt>
<garnt> For content? Right? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, who else can do that? </garnt>
<joey> - Well. </joey>
<garnt> - Who else can do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Dead ass, when I saw
that video in my sub feed, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, 'its a wrap, guys,' like, </garnt>
<garnt> he just won the game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its kinda crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Like, you know, there's, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> not to say there's people not
doing good content on YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> but the amount of original
ideas you can put on YouTube, </garnt>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<garnt> I feel like, there's
a lot less now because </garnt>
<connor> one, someone with bigger
resources and is like, </connor>
<connor> probably smarter than
you is probably doing it? </connor>
<connor> And two, I feel like, </connor>
<connor> a lot of the original content
I see is now on Twitch. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I don't know if that's just because </connor>
<garnt> I'm not being recommended
the right videos on YouTube? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. No I definitely do just think that </joey>
<connor> right now we're kinda being like, </connor>
<connor> a golden age of like, Twitch creativity. </connor>
<connor> Like, there is just so many
ideas that people thought </connor>
<connor> would be like, either too much
effort or wouldn't, you know, </connor>
<connor> reap the benefits of doing it live. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because there was just,
so much room for error. </connor>
<connor> But now, people have gone to the point, </connor>
<connor> and there's enough people,
I feel, now, on Twitch, </connor>
<connor> there's at least one
person who's gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> 'this might be risky, for
a lot of different reasons, </connor>
<connor> but I'ma just try it,
and see if it lands.' </connor>
<connor> And a lot of the times, </connor>
<joey> it does land in ways that
no one was really expecting. </joey>
<joey> I mean like, 'oh, you
can do that on Twitch?' </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it be really fucking
successful, well then, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna try and do it too. </connor>
<connor> And its just like, </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I feel its just, like, </connor>
<joey> feeding the creativity to
more and more streamers </joey>
<connor> being like, oh, </connor>
<joey> I feel like, we're past the point of just, </joey>
<joey> get in front of a camera and
just start playing a game. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - We're way past that. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know if you were ever like, </connor>
<garnt> watching Twitch, and this
is the thing though, like, </garnt>
<garnt> marbles was like, a
huge thing at one point? </garnt>
<joey> - Marbles? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] What? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Like, watching a bunch
of marbles go down a course, </connor>
<connor> and like, seeing which one won. </connor>
<joey> - Like, Rude Goldberg machines, or like? </joey>
<connor> - No, just like, it was
like, there was like, </connor>
<connor> simulations of of like, marbles. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And people would like, bet on the marbles. </joey>
<joey> Like, I think Ludwig did this as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh I think Tectone did it as well. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, its just you
can assign things like, </connor>
<joey> the balls and just like,
let all these balls go down. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Whichever one wins you like, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, kinda like, Salty Bets? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what that is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Salty Bets is, I'm not
100% sure about this, but </garnt>
<garnt> I believe someone made a
like, a program, right? </garnt>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<garnt> where its, they pitted two
characters against each other, </garnt>
<connor> in a fighting game. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not sure what the fighting game was, </garnt>
<garnt> - I know what you're talking about </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - They had like, fucking
Sonic going against like, </garnt>
<garnt> Chun-Li or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I know what you're on about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No. Its not. </connor>
<connor> - And people would be
betting on the winner, </connor>
<garnt> even though it was completely,
you know, AI battle. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - No, its just like, the streamer, </connor>
<joey> I can't remember exactly
because I never watched it fully </joey>
<joey> because its really confusing. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I think its like... </joey>
<joey> - They were like, reacting to like, </joey>
<joey> these marbles, these virtual
like, games going down? </joey>
<joey> It was really bizarre. </joey>
<joey> - Its like, horse race
betting, but like, weirder. </joey>
<joey> - I find that like, stuff
like that does well on Twitch </joey>
<connor> when you're overreacting to dumb shit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well that's the whole
reason why at one point, </connor>
<connor> or I mean, I would
argue, still to this day, </connor>
<joey> people love watching people
do Gacha on stream, right? </joey>
<joey> Because its like, people losing their shit </joey>
<joey> to PNGs. Its like, well of
course I'm gonna watch this. </joey>
<joey> This is ridiculous. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'ma watch it and play
a part of it as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can say that because
I've done Gacha on stream. </garnt>
<joey> And I have overreacted, and
its been fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god! I got something out of there. </joey>
<joey> - I got a waifu! You know, its like, </joey>
<garnt> its the same philosophy, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, like, its just a
PNG, bro, its just a PNG. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its a PNG man, but then, </garnt>
<joey> the amount of pogs I'm
seeing in the chat is like, </joey>
<garnt> saying otherwise! </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No because yeah, I guess to me, </joey>
<joey> the one thing you can get
away, you can do on Twitch </joey>
<joey> or live streaming that you
can't do with YouTube content </joey>
<joey> is you just really have this
community aspect, right? </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> And its something that, I
feel is getting more and more </joey>
<joey> like, before it was seen as like, </joey>
<joey> YouTube comments are just
the thing that comes after </joey>
<connor> the content, its the
reaction to the content. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But now like, the comments itself </connor>
<connor> and the reaction to the
content that's being made </connor>
<connor> is also part of the content itself. </connor>
<connor> (affirmative murmuring) </connor>
<connor> And that's what I see
being like, kind of like, </connor>
<connor> the future of online content </connor>
<connor> and how its kind of evolving right now. </connor>
<connor> At least that is, that's how I see it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. Right. </connor>
<connor> - Because there's like, even with like, </connor>
<connor> Twitch streams that have
been put on YouTube, </connor>
<joey> you know, I feel like,
half the fun is lost </joey>
<joey> if they don't have the Twitch
Chat on the content itself. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because you miss a lot
of the context itself, </joey>
<joey> and if its just like, a stream highlights, </joey>
<garnt> without the Twitch Chat
itself, I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're missing half of the content itself. </garnt>
<joey> - No I absolutely agree like, </joey>
<joey> I feel a lot of it gets
taken out of context, </joey>
<connor> where like, if you don't see the reaction, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't seem as
epic? As it actually is. </connor>
<connor> Like, its still epic, </connor>
<connor> but when you see a
Twitch Chat on the screen </connor>
<joey> going fucking crazy you're
like, oh this is really epic! </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, this is an epic
gamer moment right now. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know if its
just placebo or whatever, </joey>
<joey> but its like, the moment
you see a hype Twitch Chat, </joey>
<joey> suddenly you're like, well I
have to get hype too, fuck! </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Because when
you're watching on mobile, </connor>
<joey> who the fuck has the
chat open on the side, </joey>
<joey> because it like, squishes down the Twitch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Its like, I'm not gonna
fucking watch this shit </connor>
<connor> with the chat box here. </connor>
<joey> - Its like, put it, just,
put it on the stream, </joey>
<connor> and then that way its the
best viewing experience </connor>
<joey> as well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean like, I don't
watch Twitch on the phone </garnt>
<garnt> most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you know, </garnt>
<connor> sometimes I wanna watch
Twitch and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> - Ill watch it every now and then </connor>
<joey> like, oh if I'm on the
train somewhere, you know, </joey>
<joey> like, oh someone's streaming or whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, I guess, do you
guys watch a lot of like, </garnt>
<garnt> Twitch and live streaming itself </garnt>
<garnt> or do you watch the highlights? </garnt>
<joey> - I mostly just like, jump
into one of my friends streams, </joey>
<joey> if they're streaming, just say hi. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, normally I watch
my mates streaming, </joey>
<joey> ah so what are you up to, huh? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Its just kinda like... </connor>
<connor> - I literally use it as an excuse </connor>
<connor> to just catch up with my friends. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> Its like, I could like, </joey>
<joey> message you on Twitter
DMs or whatever, but like, </joey>
<joey> you're here right now,
you're gonna respond to me. </joey>
<connor> - I do watch highlights too, </connor>
<garnt> just not as often? I prefer, </garnt>
<joey> I still prefer a normal
YouTube videos on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - Right. Right. Right. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't, there's
so much shit I gotta watch, </connor>
<connor> like, anime, and I love watching anime. </connor>
<garnt> - Anime? What is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I know right? I don't know her. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, yeah I wanna keep
doing all the things I like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So its difficult to keep up everything. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, its kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's just so much content
that I wanna watch now </garnt>
<joey> and there's not enough time anymore. Like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, tell me about it. </joey>
<garnt> - Literally can't get more
first world problem than that. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - There's just too much to do! </joey>
<joey> - There's just too much content. </joey>
<joey> - What am I supposed to do? </joey>
<joey> - There's too much
content, man. Life sucks. </joey>
<connor> In a good way. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - In a good way, yeah. Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I mean like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Here's a question for you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you like, when you
watch YouTube and Twitch </garnt>
<garnt> do you feel like its part
of your job to watch it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah. </garnt>
<connor> - Or do you, </connor>
<connor> - No. No. I don't. I still
feel like I'm, you know, </connor>
<connor> back in 2013 watching my
favorite content creators. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> The only change is now is that, </connor>
<connor> you know, oh shit they follow
me, maybe, on Twitter. Maybe. </connor>
<joey> They probably don't. But maybe. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, like, in a
way, to me, it kind of is. </garnt>
<joey> Its like half half for
me, because its like, </joey>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> you know, there are some
videos that just pop up </garnt>
<garnt> on my recommended where I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is so little to do
with what I do for a job </garnt>
<garnt> that it just becomes entertainment. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then there are parts
of me which are like, </garnt>
<garnt> I could like, say, watch
a video idea, or a video </garnt>
<connor> that has this particular idea
that I had no idea existed. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And there's, I'd be lying if I said </connor>
<connor> there wasn't a part of me that thinks </connor>
<connor> 'oh I wonder if I can use
this idea this video's using, </connor>
<connor> and kinda spin it in a way
for my own content.' Right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Its like, its not so much like, </connor>
<connor> I'm going out onto YouTube </connor>
<connor> just trying to find the
next idea or whatever, </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But sometimes, there are some videos, </connor>
<connor> where its just like, 'I could do that?' </connor>
<joey> But in like, a kind of fun and
unique way for myself, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I do that as
well where I watch YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> I watch Twitch, </garnt>
<connor> I'm constantly looking for
ways to improve my own content. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And seeing some things
that I can maybe like, </connor>
<connor> not one on one ripping
someone off, but like, </connor>
<garnt> taking an aspect and being like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'I can put my own spin on that,' right? </garnt>
<joey> - Right, like, you know,
there have been moments </joey>
<joey> where I have made entire videos
based off ideas from like, </joey>
<connor> three or four completely unrelated videos. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And just kinda being
like, Ill take you know, </connor>
<connor> this idea from this video, </connor>
<connor> and this idea from this
completely separate video. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And what do you know? </connor>
<joey> I've come up with something
kinda cool and unique </joey>
<joey> that I can work off of as well. </joey>
<joey> Which is, kinda unique and
interesting to my audience. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah because like, I think there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> its really looked down upon? </garnt>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if its just
the creator community, </garnt>
<garnt> or even like, whenever
with an audience as well, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever you see something </garnt>
<garnt> that kinda resembles someone else, </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like, 'ah,
you're just ripping off X'. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or 'you're just ripping
off Y,' whereas like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, to me, like,
artists, like, musicians, </garnt>
<garnt> and like, you know, movie makers, </garnt>
<garnt> they're like, really open
about their influences. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Like, like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some of them wear their
influences on their sleeves. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And people are just like, 'cool!' </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah and I don't know
why its looked down upon </garnt>
<garnt> in the YouTube space because
everyone's exactly the same. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's been influenced by someone else </garnt>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> on the platform, and its really like, </joey>
<joey> the rarer thing is finding someone </joey>
<joey> who's completely fucking original. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like, even to me, </joey>
<joey> some of the biggest content
creators where, in my minds, </joey>
<joey> they were just like, </joey>
<joey> they did something completely
original content like, </joey>
<joey> for example, NakeyJakey, </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> where I feel like he's doing
something very, very different </joey>
<joey> from what other people are doing, </joey>
<garnt> even he says 'oh yeah,
I'm kinda just like, </garnt>
<garnt> JonTron up on a green screen,' and... </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I think, yeah, I
think he's just saying </joey>
<connor> 'I'm just a shittier JonTron
on an exercise bike.' </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's what he said in
a video, and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I mean, you know, you obviously like, </connor>
<connor> its so obvious you were
influenced by JonTron, </connor>
<connor> but it doesn't matter because </connor>
<joey> you're putting your own
spin on it, in a unique way. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You're putting your own
personality on it, where now, </joey>
<joey> this supposed thing you ripped
off has just become you. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] All right? </connor>
<connor> - I mean you know, I
don't really give a shit </connor>
<garnt> if someone does one of my video ideas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, you can 100% just take it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, if you're gonna 100% take the idea, </connor>
<joey> it would be nice to be like, </joey>
<joey> 'ah I got this idea from this person.' </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because if I blatantly copy a video, </joey>
<garnt> I'll just be like, oh yeah... </garnt>
<connor> - I mean like, who was that person </connor>
<connor> who just blatantly copied Mr
Beast for the longest time? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey and Connor] Morgz? </connor>
<connor> - That was it. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like, on that
level, its so obvious </garnt>
<garnt> that its just kinda like,
kinda like a one to one copy. </garnt>
<connor> - Copying thumbnail,
title is a little much, </connor>
<joey> because you might be
fucking with things there. </joey>
<joey> But like, taking the video
idea is like, whatever, I mean. </joey>
<joey> - Right, I mean, I've seen, you know, </joey>
<joey> a bunch of YouTubers who have
done videos that you know, </joey>
<joey> I have come up with, or I was known for. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> And I've been okay with it because they've </joey>
<joey> put their own spin on it, </joey>
<joey> where its just kind of become like, </joey>
<joey> well I know where you
got influence from, but. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This has just become your video now, </joey>
<joey> so I'm fucking okay with it. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If it was like, one for one like, </joey>
<joey> ripping like, using the
same type of thumbnail, </joey>
<connor> using the same type of title, </connor>
<connor> and then the content
is almost one for one, </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then you don't mention
the person you got it from, </connor>
<garnt> then yeah, I'll be like, </garnt>
<joey> well that's a little bit
shitty isn't it? Like. </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<garnt> - Because like, one of like, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the biggest questions
I get asked is like, </garnt>
<garnt> how do I go about like, a
new content creator is like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'how do I go about making content? </garnt>
<garnt> How do I go about making original ideas </garnt>
<connor> and finding my own style?'
And like, I always say </connor>
<connor> 'you know what, I don't see any problem </connor>
<connor> with just starting by copying </connor>
<connor> some of your favorite creators,' right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because you will find your own style, </connor>
<joey> the more you do your own content, right? </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> but its not something
that you immediately like, </joey>
<joey> its not something that you
immediately figure out. </joey>
<joey> And even like, some people do, </joey>
<joey> but those are the rare, rare people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, those are like,
the true geniuses, right? </joey>
<joey> Its like, not everyone
on YouTube is a genius. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I think it should be fine </joey>
<joey> for creators in our field just to like, </joey>
<joey> wear their influences on their sleeves </joey>
<joey> and just be open about it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, not completely copying, but like, </joey>
<connor> every like, every, you know. </connor>
<connor> Everyone has their influences </connor>
<connor> and everyone continues to
evolve from different people </connor>
<connor> they see on the platform. </connor>
<connor> At least that's how it is with me. </connor>
<connor> I think it should be fine, you know? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I think everyone's being
influenced by each other. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because everyone, you know, </connor>
<connor> I don't know a single YouTuber
who doesn't watch YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Like, I mean, that's
the reason why we're here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, you know, like, </connor>
<connor> I always get reminded of that
Picasso quote which is like, </connor>
<connor> "good artists copy, great
artists steal." All right? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like, a lot of people, like, </connor>
<connor> kind of take that quote
completely out of context. </connor>
<connor> Thinking like, well then I'll
just fucking steal things. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I actually read up on why he said that, </connor>
<connor> and what he meant by that, </connor>
<connor> which is a great artist
steals in the sense that </connor>
<connor> they take an influence and </connor>
<connor> they turn it into something of their own. </connor>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel that's very
valid to any creative field, </garnt>
<garnt> whether that be an artist, </garnt>
<garnt> or a movie producer or a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> where its like, you can get
influenced by other people, </garnt>
<joey> but its, you have to do
it to the point where, </joey>
<joey> you put your own thing on it </joey>
<joey> where it becomes your own thing. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - All right? And that's really hard to do, </joey>
<joey> and you know, great artists
steal, good artists copy, </joey>
<joey> you know. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - YouTubers who just copy an idea, </joey>
<joey> but don't do anything creative with it </joey>
<joey> are the ones that are just like, </joey>
<joey> well you're a fucking copycat aren't you. </joey>
<garnt> (affirmative murmuring) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that oh, did
you wanna say something? </garnt>
<connor> - I never really thought about
it much, I was just like. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I just watched YouTube and make my videos. </connor>
<joey> - We're getting awfully
philosophical about it. </joey>
<joey> - Here we are, I'm just sitting in my, </joey>
<joey> I make fucking stupid videos. </joey>
<joey> That's kinda how I view it.
I'm just like, all right, </joey>
<joey> ill keep uploading the same shit. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, I'm like
that too, but you know, </joey>
<joey> I'd be lying if I said there
wasn't a part of me that, </joey>
<joey> did think about that. Like, oh god. </joey>
<joey> I mean, this is a cool idea,
and I want to, you know, </joey>
<joey> incorporate it and do it
because it just seems like </joey>
<connor> something fun to do, but. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You know. I sometimes
get worried being like, </joey>
<joey> are people gonna come out and be like, </joey>
<joey> 'how dare you steal this
X and X's idea,' right? </joey>
<connor> - I think about stuff like that </connor>
<joey> and then I just also remember like, </joey>
<connor> some of the most popular videos are like, </connor>
<connor> pee pee poo poo stinky, and like, </connor>
<connor> that sharting sound effect so like. </connor>
<garnt> The moment I try and
get all deep about it, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, 'I don't think its that deep,' </garnt>
<garnt> I think its just people, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> uploading stuff that makes them hehe XD. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't fucking know. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean I do think you register it. </garnt>
<connor> - Subconsciously, yeah. I definitely do. </connor>
<connor> - Because I feel like,
you know, when people ask </connor>
<connor> 'how do you like, what does it take </connor>
<connor> to become a successful
YouTuber,' a lot of things that, </connor>
<joey> the one thing that a lot of
people don't mention is that </joey>
<joey> step one, I feel like, is
to watch a lot of YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Well, yeah. Of course, like. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. Because I mean, you say of course, </garnt>
<garnt> but I know people who don't
watch too much YouTubers, </garnt>
<connor> or if I'm just like, name
ten to twenty YouTubers. </connor>
<connor> - Oh like, they see YouTube on the news, </connor>
<connor> and they're like, 'I wanna be a YouTuber.' </connor>
<connor> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like, not a
lot of people talk about, </connor>
<connor> a lot of YouTubers I know, </connor>
<connor> they watch a fuck ton of YouTube, right? </connor>
<garnt> And it feels like, </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many subtle things </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't really explain to someone </garnt>
<garnt> unless they just understand the platform </garnt>
<garnt> because they watch a fuck-ton of YouTube. </garnt>
<joey> - And its not just watching
a fuck-ton of YouTube, </joey>
<garnt> its watching a fuck-ton
of different YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its like, I could be
like, name ten, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers and if all of them
are the same type of content, </garnt>
<connor> then its like, well, you
understand that type of content, </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But everything else is </connor>
<connor> just a complete blank to you, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're probably not gonna go very far </connor>
<connor> because you're just, gonna be recycling </connor>
<joey> the same content from
those ten YouTubers, but. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or its just like, watching
YouTubers who were popular </garnt>
<garnt> like, five years ago. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - I still watch Ray
William Johnson every day. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I strive to be my own
equals three one day. </joey>
<connor> - My day doesn't begin
without the Ray William. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - And yeah, I just think you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the idea of like, yes I would
like to become a YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> because they are successful
now, and you know. </garnt>
<joey> - And they make lots of
money for an easy job, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> step one for even consider
becoming a YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> or a streamer, is just to
watch a fuck ton of things </garnt>
<garnt> on that platform. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no. Step one is
delete your Twitter history. </connor>
<garnt> You've probably got some bad shit. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't wanna get cancelled for that. </joey>
<joey> - Should probably, should
probably get rid of that. </joey>
<connor> - Then step two is watching. </connor>
<joey> - Privatise your Facebook,
delete your Twitter history. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I mean
that's how I feel about like, </garnt>
<garnt> Instagram and TikTok, because
I don't use those platforms, </garnt>
<joey> and I'm not gonna try to grow
on those platforms because. </joey>
<joey> - Because you don't use it, right? </joey>
<joey> - Because the first step
is I don't understand it. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So its kinda like, to me, its just like, </joey>
<joey> the 'hello fellow
Instagrammers' kinda thing. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - If I try to like. </garnt>
<joey> - You just turn into one of
those corporate brands, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Its like, 'yes, we understand you.' </joey>
<joey> - Here's more picture of my food, </joey>
<joey> that's what you all like, right? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Why aren't you liking it? </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah, I mean is there anything else </garnt>
<garnt> you guys wanna talk about? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know man, YouTube can be deep </joey>
<garnt> but it can also be poo poo pee pee stinky. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's what I've
gotten out of today's episode. </garnt>
<connor> - What I've gotten out of
today's episode is that </connor>
<connor> I don't understand
streaming content sometimes, </connor>
<garnt> and that's why I watch it. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, I feel
a lot of the reasons why </joey>
<joey> people watch a lot of
YouTube and you know, </joey>
<connor> Twitch streaming and stuff
like that for you know, </connor>
<connor> people who want to get into it is </connor>
<connor> because they want to understand it, right? </connor>
<connor> They want to grow a greater
appreciation towards it. </connor>
<joey> I mean, that's why I watch it. </joey>
<garnt> - Just fucking fascinates me, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh dude. </joey>
<joey> - Twitch, Twitch is fascinating to me now. </joey>
<joey> And that's why its probably </joey>
<joey> the content that I'm
watching the most right now. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, until
I understand it fully, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna keep watching it, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get addicted, Garnt,
to everything that you do. </garnt>
<connor> - I, that's. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you do tend to be like, </connor>
<connor> I like this one thing now, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna like it 'til the end of time! </joey>
<joey> - Garnt will just come back and be like, </joey>
<joey> guys you won't believe it. </joey>
<garnt> I've just discovered this
thing called mahjong. </garnt>
<garnt> And me and the boys at r slash mahjong </garnt>
<garnt> have been talking about
all the different strats, </garnt>
<joey> and been watching... </joey>
<joey> - I'm in this photo and I don't like it. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I've watched the movies with the boys, </joey>
<garnt> and its like, all right, calm down. </garnt>
<garnt> And Garnt forgets about
mahjong the week next. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he's like... </joey>
<joey> - That's pretty much me. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm the kinda guy
who finds it really easy </joey>
<joey> just to fall into this
one random rabbit hole, </joey>
<joey> (affirmative murmuring) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then I reach the
bottom of that rabbit hole </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, okay.
Time to find something new. </connor>
<connor> - Time to claw out of this one. </connor>
<garnt> - Literally the Toy Story meme of like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'I'm done with you.' </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't wanna play with you anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, yeah.
That's me in a nutshell, </garnt>
<garnt> and the thing is, I'm
so easily influenced. </garnt>
<garnt> All it takes is just one
random YouTube recommendation, </garnt>
<garnt> or one thing popping up
on my Twitter to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I find this thing, this
piques my curiosity. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me look into this, and like, </garnt>
<garnt> a week later, I'm just like, guys, </garnt>
<garnt> I have just consumed a
week's worth of content </garnt>
<garnt> on horseriding. Like. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Your thing right now
is fucking Chug Jug. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's what that shit
is. And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> - Dude, dude. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just thinking to myself like, </joey>
<joey> I'll just let him talk </joey>
<joey> because by next week he'll be
talking about something else. </joey>
<joey> He'll be done with this
rather shallow rabbit hole. </joey>
<garnt> - He'll get over it. </garnt>
<garnt> - He'll get over it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just see me in a week guys, </garnt>
<joey> I've become a Fortnite gamer. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> I'm going to be a pro Fortnite gamer. </connor>
<garnt> - We can be pro Fortnite... </garnt>
<joey> - You know what I won't
get over? Our patrons. </joey>
<connor> - That's true, they're wonderful. </connor>
<joey> Like this guy right here. </joey>
<connor> - I absolutely love this guy. </connor>
<joey> This is a rabbit hole I
will never get out of. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Please, feel free to fall down </garnt>
<garnt> the Trash Taste rabbit hole. </garnt>
<garnt> There is definitely a
Trash Taste rabbit hole. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, absolutely, and if
you wanna support the show, </joey>
<joey> make sure to go over to
Patreon.com/TrashTaste. </joey>
<garnt> Also follow us on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> Fall down the Trash Taste
rabbit hole on our subreddit, </garnt>
<garnt> and if you hate our faces
listen to us on Spotify. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. Lets see how deep we
can make this rabbit hole go. </garnt>
<joey> - I just want this, the lore
on the Trash's subreddit </joey>
<joey> to just get absolutely
fucking out of control. </joey>
<connor> Where its like, </connor>
<connor> they're just throwing
in big YouTubers like, </connor>
<connor> doing shit now, its like, </connor>
<joey> 'horse riding, the, Felix
said the word trash. </joey>
<joey> We have to add that to the lore.' </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Its got nothing to do with anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its true, it should be on the lore. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - We always want to, we just want to like, </connor>
<connor> expand this universe as far as it will go. </connor>
<garnt> I just want to get a the point
where the Trash Taste lore </garnt>
<garnt> competes with fake lore. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - The Trash Taste cinematic universe. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - TTCU. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. </joey>
<connor> - Well, thank you. Thank you
for joining me today, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna go sleep. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you for joining me, Connor. </joey>
<joey> - I've had like, three
hours of sleep today, </joey>
<joey> I'm ready to die. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like you're like that every week. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No this week is an exception. </joey>
<connor> I was great and then the
last half hour I was like, </connor>
<joey> whoa, I'm tired. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I noticed, I
looked over and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> you gonna add to this
conversation, Connor? </joey>
<joey> You're just like. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> see if Connor wants to add
something, and he's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'I am having trouble forming words right. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it was the first hour
and a half today I'm like, </connor>
<joey> oh I feel Gucci then the last half hour, </joey>
<joey> it hit me like a ton of bricks. </joey>
<connor> - The last half hour you were just like, </connor>
<connor> AOL loading sign. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Anyways guys, hopefully you enjoyed, </joey>
<joey> and we'll see you guys next week. </joey>
<joey> - [All] Bye! </joey>
<joey> (relaxing music playing) </joey>
