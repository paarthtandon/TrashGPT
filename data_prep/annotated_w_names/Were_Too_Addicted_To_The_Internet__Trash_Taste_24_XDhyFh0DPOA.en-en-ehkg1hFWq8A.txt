<garnt> - Here's some sipping ASMR. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt sips) </joey>
<joey> - Well, I'm hard. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - Just another Tuesday. </connor>
<joey> (bright music) </joey>
<connor> When we're recording this, the Mori episode is out </connor>
<garnt> which was weird to just mention, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I love- - Just like breaking NDA. </connor>
<joey> - I love how they legitimately figured it out like day one. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not surprised you made it really obvious. </joey>
<connor> - Like, on the day. </connor>
<connor> They were like, "You should, could it be?" </connor>
<connor> - No, it wasn't that, it was the threat </connor>
<connor> that was like "Here's the evidence, </connor>
<garnt> of like the past few weeks that I've collected." </garnt>
<connor> - We haven't tried to hide it, like we made it obvious. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I saw three videos, </garnt>
<garnt> of people- - You saw three videos? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I saw three videos of people being like, </joey>
<joey> "Here's what's up in Hollow Live News. </joey>
<joey> The Trash Taste Boys tweeted out a tweet. </joey>
<joey> That is exactly the same as Mori Calli..." </joey>
<joey> He sounded exactly like that too. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause, you know, they all sound like that. </joey>
<connor> - Well, welcome to this episode of Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> I'm your host CDawg Monkey Brain. </connor>
<joey> - You really clearly slayed your way in there. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and I'm here today with Joey and Garnt </connor>
<connor> and I'm tired as fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - We're just back, we've just the boys now. </garnt>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Why are you so tired Connor? </joey>
<connor> - I was up all night and then I didn't sleep very well. </connor>
<joey> And I was considering canceling my Japanese lesson </joey>
<joey> because I can cancel it online. </joey>
<joey> But if I do it, like after 6:00 PM the day before </joey>
<connor> I don't get my money back. </connor>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<connor> - So its like- </connor>
<joey> - Wait, do you pay every lesson? </joey>
<joey> It's not like a monthly thing? </joey>
<connor> - You pay for like tokens, and then- </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - Like the token you can like redeem- </joey>
<joey> - What, is this like the gacha currency? </joey>
<garnt> (both chuckling) - No, its like- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I was thinking, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Not everything is fucking gacha with you guys, </connor>
<connor> (chuckling) like- </connor>
<garnt> - So, how do you earn tokens? </garnt>
<connor> Could you earn tokens by just going to the store? </connor>
<connor> - Pay to win currency guys, called the money. </connor>
<garnt> Don't know if you've heard of it? </garnt>
<joey> - Can you claim them like in game as well or? </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, you guys have been playing gacha too much. </connor>
<joey> - Like, do you have like dailies for like... </joey>
<connor> Every lesson you go to there is like dailies, </connor>
<joey> you got like five tokens a day? </joey>
<connor> - I'm just gonna ignore that. </connor>
<joey> - Then finally, I can do my 10 pool. </joey>
<joey> - You can explain now Connor. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, finally are the jokes done? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) - You just pay </joey>
<joey> and then you get like X amount of lessons with it. </joey>
<joey> But like private lessons cost more </joey>
<joey> like class lessons, cost X. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I'm sure people can figure </joey>
<joey> out which school I'm going to now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> (both chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - I mean, someone already fucking did. </joey>
<joey> Someone like approached me and was like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Really. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they were like, I was talking with my teacher, </joey>
<joey> it was like a common area </joey>
<joey> and 'cause you got like a 10 minute break </joey>
<joey> and we were talking and then some guy was like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, are you like the guy on YouTube?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> "Which guy?" </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The guy. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I guess I am, like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, the white British guy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I probably already told the story </joey>
<joey> on the podcast there, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, so yeah, that's it, and I'm tired as fuck </joey>
<joey> 'cause I went to it and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I probably should've canceled and just slept in." </joey>
<joey> But again- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's- </connor>
<connor> - You knew fully well, we're gonna do </connor>
<joey> a podcast episode today? </joey>
<joey> - I did, but I've been doing it every week, </joey>
<connor> but for a lesson before. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like impressed that we've been able to manage </garnt>
<garnt> like this weekly schedule without taking a single week off </garnt>
<garnt> since we started, I think, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I think so, I mean we've maybe one off, </joey>
<joey> but other than that we've been pretty consistent. </joey>
<garnt> - We've had one off simply because one of the cameras broke </garnt>
<joey> for this one week. </joey>
<garnt> - That's right, one of the cameras did break. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But to compensate, we did two episodes one week. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I'm sure it's obvious to the viewers at home </connor>
<connor> but this set up, is all been set up by like, </connor>
<joey> I guess us, mainly me, but- </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) - Mainly you, yeah. </joey>
<joey> We just chilling. </joey>
<joey> - So, when like the camera died </joey>
<joey> and I didn't know what I was doing, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, fuck, okay. </joey>
<joey> I guess we're not filming today." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - To know one of the cameras was broken </joey>
<joey> we had to get it fixed which- </joey>
<joey> - For no reason at all, we never figured that out, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Have you guys been up to anything exciting recently? </connor>
<joey> - Well, I've got some news. </joey>
<connor> - Oh. - oh, shit, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've got some news. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanna say that this might be </garnt>
<connor> the last podcast episode that I do. </connor>
<connor> - [Both ] What? </connor>
<connor> - Because if you guys saw on Twitter, </connor>
<joey> I've recently been emailed by- </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Connor chuckling) </joey>
<joey> By, you know, you might know them, </joey>
<joey> they are called Big Hit Labels. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> They are the management of a BTS. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah I know, I actually auditioned myself remember? </connor>
<joey> Like- - Yeah, I remember. </joey>
<connor> - Someone signed me up as well. </connor>
<joey> - But, they emailed me and it was all Caps. </joey>
<joey> The title of the email was all Caps, IDLE CASTING. </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, Oh, shit and then I saw, Big Hit </joey>
<joey> and I'll read the email to you right now. </joey>
<joey> - Go on. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the first time I saw this, I was like, </joey>
<joey> Oh my God, is this actually Big Hit? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that'd be crazy." </joey>
<joey> But then, because, it... </joey>
<joey> And like, I'll read it but like the first half </joey>
<joey> sounds legitimate. </joey>
<joey> It says like, "Hello The Anime Man, </joey>
<joey> we are Big Hit Labels, BTS's management from South Korea. </joey>
<joey> We are very interested in casting you to be a member </joey>
<joey> of the new boy group in the Japanese branch of our company." </joey>
<joey> And this was the moment, the next word I read, </joey>
<joey> I realized, oh, this is all a lie. </joey>
<joey> "Japanese branch of our company, STD!" </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - "We think you'd make a fine- </joey>
<garnt> - That's kinda catchy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, STD. </garnt>
<garnt> "We think you'd make a fine visual </garnt>
<joey> with your astonishing idol-looks or maybe a good leader </joey>
<joey> with your wisdom and old age." </joey>
<joey> What the fuck does that mean? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Old age? </joey>
<joey> - Old age. </joey>
<joey> "If you have anyone else in mind </joey>
<joey> who you think would fit, please let us know." </joey>
<joey> And they gave me a list of requirements </joey>
<joey> that I needed, all right? - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> - To be the leader of STD. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] What was it? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, "must speak Japanese." </joey>
<joey> - All right, check. - Got that covered. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - "Must be six feet or over." Check. </joey>
<joey> - "Must be hot, "not sure about that. </joey>
<joey> Must be hot." - Well (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - He's a lovely oxymoron, </joey>
<joey> "Must be somewhat feminine, must be male." </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, you can rock it. </joey>
<joey> - "Must look good in tight leather pants." </joey>
<garnt> - Hell yeah, hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then this last one fucking kill me. </garnt>
<joey> "Singing and dancing would also be good." </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Would be good. </joey>
<joey> - Would be good, "Kindly consider our offer </joey>
<joey> and get back to us when possible, Big Hit Label." </joey>
<connor> - Okay, but what if it was a legit Big Hit </connor>
<joey> and they reached out to you, what would you do? </joey>
<joey> - No, because like- </joey>
<garnt> - What if it was them? - No, what if it was? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, what if it was- - Hypothetically. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Big Hit is like, "Joey, we want you in the band." </garnt>
<joey> What would you say? </joey>
<joey> - Dude, I would 100% say yes. </joey>
<joey> Are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> Do you know how much of fun... </joey>
<joey> I could- </joey>
<garnt> - Think of the content. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, think of the content. </joey>
<joey> - Think of the stories we can tell on Trash Tastes, Connor. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I became a K-pop idol for X amount of time. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - How confident are you in the singing and dancing aspect? </connor>
<connor> - In dancing, I'm basically a middle-aged white man </connor>
<joey> so, I can't dance to save my life. </joey>
<joey> I think I'm okay at singing (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> but yeah, dude, now could you imagine STD? </joey>
<connor> - I would like radiate the same energy </connor>
<connor> as going to your accountant and being like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, do that like tax fraud thing for me. </connor>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Save me all the money, do what Trump did, dude." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, pretty cool- </joey>
<joey> - "Fix me up like that." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> You know someone actually like submitted like an audition </joey>
<joey> with my business email, like legit to them </joey>
<joey> and they replied being like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No. </joey>
<joey> - I think it was no or like to do the next step </joey>
<joey> or something, like it was some like verification thing </joey>
<joey> and I was like, oh, thanks. </joey>
<joey> But I've had so many, I've had like </joey>
<joey> every single dating site you can imagine. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I've had like SingleMuslim.com, </joey>
<joey> be signed up for christianmingle.com. </joey>
<joey> - Classy, did you get Farmers Only? </joey>
<connor> - No, I haven't had that, was there a website? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Farmers Only is like only you have to own </joey>
<garnt> like a certain amount of land to be eligible. </garnt>
<garnt> So like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Seriously? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to own like certain amounts of acres? </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to own a certain amount of acres of farm land </garnt>
<connor> to be eligible for it. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, I see these and I don't think anything about it </connor>
<joey> but I remember that I have like an agency </joey>
<joey> looking at our emails and that's when I started to get like </joey>
<joey> kind of worried about it. </joey>
<joey> And Mayline the other day, he goes to me. </joey>
<connor> "Oh, there was a weird email in your email. </connor>
<connor> That apparently you had matched positive </connor>
<connor> for STDs with someone. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<connor> Like someone you had slept with had STDs." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, Mayline, it's obviously fake. </joey>
<joey> One, if I thought I had an STD, </joey>
<connor> I would go to the fucking doctor not a website, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Let's just use my work email, </garnt>
<joey> which I know my agency checks to be like, </joey>
<connor> by the way let's get an STD check right now. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like how many terrible decisions in a row </garnt>
<garnt> would I have to make to have that? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I would one, have to sleep with someone </garnt>
<garnt> who I would have to be like, wow, you knows, no condom. </garnt>
<garnt> Then go in, think I have an STD immediately after, </garnt>
<garnt> not go to the doctor, sign up to this website, </garnt>
<joey> hm, final step use work email. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like do you ever meet people who are like, </joey>
<joey> "Man, I just can't seem to get a W." </joey>
<joey> And then they just don't think. </joey>
<joey> But they always should do things that never set it up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's the kind of behavior that they do, </joey>
<joey> that they're just like, "Man, I'm just so unlucky in life." </joey>
<garnt> And it's like, you did drive with no wheels. </garnt>
<garnt> Like what did you expect to happen, like this is all you. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] I think we all know like one person </connor>
<connor> that is like that. </connor>
<connor> - He's like the nicest person ever </connor>
<garnt> but they keep doing dumb stuff </garnt>
<joey> and you're like, "Come on, man." </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, you have to be like... </joey>
<joey> No one person can take that many ELLs </joey>
<joey> without actually trying to do so, right? </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - I've got like three friends, you just like, </connor>
<joey> "Come on, man, I wanna see you get a W, </joey>
<joey> you just keep doing it, man, stop man." </joey>
<joey> - Dude, like that BTS one though, </joey>
<joey> the Big Hit Labels one, like I posted it </joey>
<joey> 'cause I thought it was hilarious, right? </joey>
<joey> And it is, but you know I quickly learned my lesson </joey>
<joey> to not fuck with K-pop fan. </joey>
<garnt> - You felt the wrath of K-pop Twitter? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which- - Just the Twitter rule. </joey>
<joey> - I woke up in the morning </joey>
<joey> and I saw that the thing had 800 quote retweets. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like- - Oh no. </garnt>
<joey> - "That's never a good sign." </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, no, (chuckling) boy's about to get rationed. </garnt>
<joey> - And I checked it and like a lot of them are just, </joey>
<joey> you know people just saying, </joey>
<joey> obviously getting that it's a joke but you know, </joey>
<joey> there's those handful of K-pop stands </joey>
<joey> who would just like, </joey>
<joey> "Wow, how dare you like stereotype all K-pop stars?" </joey>
<joey> - I don't worry about it, its what they do- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no I thought it was fucking hilarious, </joey>
<joey> but there are some people who are like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, he probably photo-shopped it </joey>
<joey> just to get attention." I'm like, </joey>
<joey> What? I'm not that desperate for likes on Twitter. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] That's got like more creativity </connor>
<joey> than half my videos- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's also the Photoshop- </connor>
<connor> - The only reason I posted it because I thought </connor>
<connor> it was fucking hilarious, </connor>
<joey> like I wouldn't have (chuckling) otherwise. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird that people assume that like </connor>
<joey> that's the kind of content we think we need. </joey>
<joey> - [Both] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's like, that's the amount </joey>
<joey> of steps that would jump in through- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's how desperate I am for Twitter clout. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that I have to fake an email. </joey>
<garnt> - The amount of loops you would have to jump through </garnt>
<garnt> to get to that point, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - You could just say, I like hentai </connor>
<connor> and you get more likes. </connor>
<joey> (chuckling) - So true. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, I tweeted penis and I got like more likes. </joey>
<connor> So it's just like whatever, yeah, but I'm- </connor>
<connor> - K-pop since you don't mess with them, Joey </connor>
<connor> that's a universal truth. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I knew that from the get go </connor>
<joey> but I didn't think that would have caused a riot, right? </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Can these people not take a joke?" </joey>
<joey> Clearly not anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, moving on. </joey>
<joey> So I see you started Genshin, and I'm like, what? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - After holding off this entire fucking time- </joey>
<joey> - Holding to the curve. </joey>
<joey> - And holding off from like me and Joey talking about it </joey>
<garnt> like every week. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't wanna spon... </connor>
<connor> Our fucking podcast to become a sponsor episode for free. </connor>
<joey> If we're gonna talk about Genshin, </joey>
<joey> I wanna get fucking paid. </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Do you like it though? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's fine, it feels like Breath of Wild light, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like- - [Both] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like- </joey>
<joey> - It's die hard, Breath of the Wild. </joey>
<joey> - You know how like in Breath of the Wild </joey>
<joey> when you would like, think, </joey>
<joey> "Oh what if I do this weird thing? </joey>
<joey> And then you'd always get rewarded for it?" </joey>
<joey> In Genshin I would be like, "Oh, there's nothing there." </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - It's another common chess, that won't bore you. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand what I'm picking up but I- </connor>
<garnt> - Because the reason I like Genshin, </garnt>
<garnt> and I've... </garnt>
<connor> The reason I like it is that </connor>
<connor> it is very, very Breath of the Wild. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah that's the best part of the game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> but it's Breath of the Wild mixed with basically </connor>
<garnt> JRPG elements and I'm just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's fucking awful. </garnt>
<joey> (both chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - See that, I was watching this guy's stream. </joey>
<connor> Every time Python came on screen, he was like, "Shut up!" </connor>
<connor> - There was like those one point where it was a cut scene. </connor>
<connor> I think like, I just like had my mouse to my head </connor>
<joey> and I was just tapping it, just like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I was so bored, The story is so shit. </joey>
<joey> Not that I would have paid attention to anyway </joey>
<joey> but it's like doubly shit. </joey>
<joey> And then some people in my chat were like, </joey>
<joey> "Why are you skipping the cut scenes?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "It's shit, right?" </joey>
<joey> And everyone's like, "Yeah, it's kind of shit." </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> And I was like, okay, good, then I'm skipping them all. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, that's like, it's boring. </joey>
<joey> I don't find any of these characters interesting </joey>
<connor> 'cause they're all gacha characters </connor>
<connor> and most of them are just, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like the thing with gacha game stories </garnt>
<garnt> is that they rarely start off goods, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> If a gacha story gets good, it's normally like </garnt>
<joey> way into development where like five chapters in </joey>
<joey> or like when they released like their fifth story. </joey>
<joey> - Like chapter six Arknights. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, which I've heard about chapter six Arknights </joey>
<joey> so it was just meant to be amazing and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> well, I've kind of skipped the entire story </garnt>
<garnt> up to this point, so- </garnt>
<garnt> - I just don't trust anyone with- </garnt>
<joey> - I've read chapter one and that's it. </joey>
<joey> Like after that, I was like, oh, okay, I don't need </joey>
<connor> to know this story to play the game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I just don't understand people </connor>
<connor> who like love stories in gacha games. </connor>
<garnt> I just, I mean, we've covered this before but- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Have we? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we've covered story in video games, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But I mean, there are specially shitty in gacha. </joey>
<garnt> Like Breath of the Wild didn't have much story </garnt>
<joey> and I was like the best part of the game. </joey>
<joey> So like, just do what you want. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but like the reason why people skipped over </joey>
<connor> fucking Breath of the Wild story is because like, </connor>
<joey> what person doesn't know the story of Legend of Zelda. </joey>
<garnt> - What is the story of Breath of the Wild? </garnt>
<connor> - Began it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you just began it, right? </garnt>
<joey> - That's nice though, I liked that. </joey>
<joey> They kept it simple, like, let me do it. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I like the fact that you can change characters </joey>
<garnt> and it's elemental and the combat's kind of fun. </garnt>
<garnt> It's it's okay, it feels pretty limited, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean that's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, the reason I thought it was great </garnt>
<garnt> was because it feels like Genshin is like, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of feels like a first of its kind, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because when you think of gacha games </garnt>
<garnt> and when you think of the whole gacha genre, </garnt>
<garnt> you have this image of just like, you know </garnt>
<garnt> cheap mobile games that only hardcore weaves are into. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's been really weird seeing just </garnt>
<garnt> how much Genshin has blown up. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like I went into Genshin thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, it's just gonna be kind of like Honkai </garnt>
<garnt> but a little bit more polished." </garnt>
<garnt> And I got completely blown away when I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> No, this just feels like a AAA gacha game. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels like the very, very first AAA gacha game </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like way more polished than pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> any of its competition. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, I didn't understand why people liked Faygo, </connor>
<connor> like I saw Faygo, it looks- </connor>
<connor> - It's because of fate. </connor>
<connor> - It really looked like a mini clip game. </connor>
<connor> The art looked shit and then also </connor>
<connor> the story sounded like a convoluted mess. </connor>
<connor> And then also the gacha rates were abysmal, so- </connor>
<joey> - Because you don't mess. </joey>
<joey> it's like, tide moon fans like K-pop fans, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like the moment there's anything tide moon </joey>
<joey> they are just like, "Give it to me." </joey>
<garnt> - So, there's this thing called like </garnt>
<garnt> the waifu economy, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (gasping) </garnt>
<garnt> (chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Where it's the value of the waifus </garnt>
<garnt> and because those tide moon have such like... </garnt>
<garnt> Because tide moon have such a strong brand </garnt>
<garnt> with fate and all the waifus in it </garnt>
<garnt> that just makes the waifus and fate worth that much more. </garnt>
<garnt> And people look... </garnt>
<garnt> You look like you're about to die inside right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt's a waifu economist. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It's like absurd. </garnt>
<joey> - But like the story in Faygo does actually get good </joey>
<joey> like fucking five chapters in. </joey>
<garnt> I can't remember which chapter Camelot is </garnt>
<garnt> but that's when it gets good. </garnt>
<connor> - So when you're playing the gacha games </connor>
<connor> do you want the characters because you liked them </connor>
<connor> or because they'll make you OP? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I'm sure it goes both ways. </joey>
<joey> - That's the eternal struggle, right? </joey>
<garnt> Do you go with Metta or do you go with waifu? </garnt>
<garnt> - I just want the OP ones, </garnt>
<connor> I don't care about the characters looks. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I'm completely the opposite. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause like every time I stream Genshin, </connor>
<joey> there are so many back seater for Genshin, Holy shit. </joey>
<garnt> - There are two types of people in this world. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, there are so many backseaters for Genshin, </joey>
<joey> where like, I think once I had like both Qiqi and Klee </joey>
<joey> in like my party and people were like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck, that's like the worst combination." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I didn't give a shit , I like these characters. </joey>
<joey> I just wanna play as the characters I like, </joey>
<joey> I like these waifus. </joey>
<garnt> - I honestly think like going </garnt>
<garnt> with the just the good waifus is the way to go. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I feel like going into a gacha game </garnt>
<joey> wanting to be OP means that you kind of </joey>
<joey> go into the mentality where you wanna like </joey>
<garnt> kind of complete the game, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> You wanna optimize it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like going into a casino </garnt>
<joey> expecting to be a millionaire, you know? </joey>
<connor> - No, you wanna complete the game, </connor>
<joey> wait, were we not completing the game? </joey>
<joey> Is that not what we are all doing? </joey>
<joey> Am I confused? Like- </joey>
<joey> - No, I mean, if you wanna comp- </joey>
<garnt> - If you don't wanna complete the game. </garnt>
<joey> - No, its not about- </joey>
<connor> - How can you complete a gacha game? </connor>
<garnt> - Do the story. </garnt>
<joey> - But the story is and everything in a gacha game. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so you do the story in Genshin, and then what? </connor>
<connor> Then what did you do? </connor>
<joey> - You go around exploring the world </joey>
<joey> or you collect all the characters or- </joey>
<connor> - Collect all the characters? </connor>
<connor> You mean gamble all your fucking money away, like- </connor>
<joey> - Yes, welcome to gacha's Connor. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<joey> That's the whole fucking point. </joey>
<joey> - No, once you have done all the content in the game, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What do you do then? </joey>
<joey> - Its like wait for the next update. </joey>
<joey> - But like, okay, that's where like, </joey>
<joey> when Arknights came out, right? </joey>
<joey> The white between those things </joey>
<joey> was just like a ticking time bomb of like, </joey>
<joey> "Am I gonna drop this game?" </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Because that wait period is like, </joey>
<joey> "How long can I reasonably keep logging into this?" </joey>
<joey> Like to the point where I'm like, "What am I doing?" </joey>
<joey> And obviously like, after X amount of time </joey>
<joey> when you've beaten the game that's when it's like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, I'm done, like, I've played this game, </connor>
<joey> I've got my fill, </joey>
<joey> I don't need to spend any more money on this, </joey>
<connor> I'll play something else." </connor>
<connor> - I find it really funny though </connor>
<connor> that you're the one who's like, </connor>
<connor> "No, I wanna finish the story." </connor>
<connor> As someone who does, no idea what fuck the story is about. </connor>
<joey> - No, I wanna do all, like the content, all the bosses </joey>
<joey> like all the fun aspects, and normally, unfortunately </joey>
<garnt> it's tied to the story. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember- </garnt>
<connor> - Fortunately all the boss fights are tied to a story. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like seeing you enter like discover Arknights </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time and seeing you like your first entrance </garnt>
<garnt> into the world of gacha. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "I see him." </garnt>
<garnt> I just saw you spiraling down into hell. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I saw you were like, "Oh man I wanna collect this. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna level up this character. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna level up that character, I wanna optimize this." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh no, you're gonna be spending a lot of money." </garnt>
<connor> - Well, that's 'cause I wanted to, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately with Arknights </connor>
<joey> there will always be that one stage, Arknights is like </joey>
<joey> a tower defense kind of game. </joey>
<joey> - Please, sponsor us. </joey>
<joey> - And basically, there was... </joey>
<joey> No matter how many OP characters you had </joey>
<joey> their always come a stage, when you will need like </joey>
<joey> one specific character that had this one niche </joey>
<joey> that you didn't have. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was super annoying when it happened. </joey>
<joey> So I just wanted to spec everything </joey>
<garnt> And everything we've had on every stage </garnt>
<garnt> and then yeah, I just gave up and I thought- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, which is what I was saying. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, if you want to complete a gacha game, </garnt>
<garnt> you are gonna have a bad time because- </garnt>
<connor> - I felt like I completed Arknights, like I did everything. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there's always new content coming out. </garnt>
<garnt> You never reach- </garnt>
<connor> - That was now- </connor>
<connor> - The only time you can complete a gacha game </connor>
<garnt> is when the developers just stop. </garnt>
<connor> - Giving a shit, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But this is the thing, right? </garnt>
<joey> If, when you have done everything in a game, right? </joey>
<joey> And then say the next patch coming out in a month. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, are you then happy to stop playing that game </joey>
<connor> before the new chapters come out next month? </connor>
<garnt> Are you done? </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why, I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> this is a super interesting conversation because I feel like </garnt>
<joey> a lot of people wins the Genshin and they like </joey>
<joey> I don't think even Genshin, is kind of expected </joey>
<joey> the kind of response that it would have gotten </joey>
<joey> and how popular it would have gotten, </joey>
<joey> because this is like a lot of people's first introduction </joey>
<joey> into gacha games, right? </joey>
<garnt> And there's been like a big controversy </garnt>
<garnt> with Gentian stamina system when you reach end game, right? </garnt>
<garnt> When you kind of complete the story, explore everything. </garnt>
<connor> - So, is the stamina is for running around, swimming, </connor>
<connor> and climbing, right? </connor>
<garnt> - No, so you haven't used stamina in Genshin yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I haven't, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, so you understand... </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, so every gacha game has kind of like a stamina system </garnt>
<garnt> where normally you spend a resource to play </garnt>
<garnt> some certain aspects of the game, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Genshin to me, I feel like it's super weird, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you can go, you could play it for like 30 plus hours </garnt>
<garnt> and never have to use stamina system at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas with like Arknights has sanity. </garnt>
<garnt> You kind of like, reach the stamina cap </garnt>
<garnt> within like a week of playing it all out, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say right? </garnt>
<garnt> Same thing like Faygo. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember what the stamina system in Faygo is called, </garnt>
<garnt> but in Genshin the stamina system is called resin. </garnt>
<garnt> And you use resin whenever you like go complete a dungeon </garnt>
<garnt> or don't go like flights and bosses. </garnt>
<garnt> Now when you're in the early game </garnt>
<garnt> and when you're just exploring the world </garnt>
<garnt> you can just not use the stamina system at all </garnt>
<garnt> because their is so much to do and the world is like... </garnt>
<garnt> The world is fucking massive, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The world is absolutely massive </garnt>
<garnt> that you could spend 30 plus hours exploring the world </garnt>
<garnt> doing everything in the world, doing story quest </garnt>
<garnt> and not have to like focus on grinding </garnt>
<garnt> and leveling up your characters and doing bosses </garnt>
<garnt> and everything, but once you reach the end game, </garnt>
<garnt> once you've explored everything, then their is nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> but grind out and you know, and try to... </garnt>
<garnt> And just use resin. </garnt>
<garnt> And the argument is, from what I understand, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I haven't actually reach end game myself </garnt>
<garnt> there is just no enough resin, to give yo meaningful content </garnt>
<garnt> once you've reached the end of the content. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't understand people who like just grind. </connor>
<joey> Like we'll play a game for hours and end on grind </joey>
<joey> when there's no guarantee that anything's coming. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like that's like psychotic to me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because I've heard that the best way </joey>
<garnt> to like enjoy Genshin, from what I've heard from people </garnt>
<garnt> who have reached end game already is that, </garnt>
<garnt> you shouldn't rush through the game. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you shouldn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because getting to end game is actually </garnt>
<garnt> much quicker than a lot of people expect. </garnt>
<garnt> And then once you hit that point, </garnt>
<garnt> and once you have to start using the stamina system </garnt>
<joey> then it's like you are really limited to what you can do. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you are really limited to content. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I think Genshin is like </garnt>
<garnt> the super unique example, because most gacha games, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like a mobile game where you just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you can play it for like five to 10 minutes, </garnt>
<joey> when it pop sometimes, you know </joey>
<joey> you rarely play for long period of time. </joey>
<joey> Whereas with Genshin because it feels more like a AAA game. </joey>
<joey> People wanna play this for hours on end. </joey>
<joey> And people are coming in expecting this to be like an MMORPG </joey>
<joey> where you're just like constantly grinding </joey>
<joey> and constantly doing something. </joey>
<garnt> And this is like infinite content, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just find that MMORPG is so boring. </garnt>
<joey> after like X level, when you start grinding, I just- </joey>
<joey> - [Both] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, like I think some people can do grinding, </joey>
<connor> no problem, but for me it's like just- </connor>
<joey> - I'm on new JRPG, so. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I just like, I think it's like, </connor>
<connor> why would you just stop me from having fun? </connor>
<joey> Like, (Garnt chuckling) I don't understand. </joey>
<joey> - Some people find grinding really fun. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's like relaxing for some people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I find it relaxing. </joey>
<joey> - For me, it's just like, I feel like you're just like </joey>
<joey> taking the out of me. </joey>
<joey> Like you're just kind of making a mockery of my time here. </joey>
<joey> Like, you are making me do all this thing- </joey>
<joey> - You are only making me use 1% of my brain. </joey>
<joey> - Almost, it's like, you know, some, </joey>
<joey> when I used to play RuneScape, like I didn't mind it, </joey>
<joey> but I was also fucking 12 and I was just dumb little shit. </joey>
<joey> And I wouldn't mind taking on. </joey>
<joey> I literally spent like hours a day clicking trees. </joey>
<connor> I can't even believe I did that. </connor>
<joey> - But like MMOs by yourself </joey>
<connor> or were you playing it with friends? </connor>
<connor> - I had friends as well, but still it... </connor>
<connor> But like- </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I mean, I couldn't be able to grind </joey>
<joey> in MMO by myself. </joey>
<joey> - Like raids look fun in World of Warcraft. </joey>
<joey> When they are eight people communicating, </joey>
<joey> like that looks fun, but I also don't want to get there, </joey>
<joey> because the points of getting there are insane, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Both] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But my little brother was addicted to World of Warcraft </joey>
<connor> and he fucking, you couldn't get him off it. </connor>
<joey> - I never got into all Wold of Warcraft. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been into. </joey>
<garnt> I don't think I've played like a single MMORPG because- </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, not even RuneScape? </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't even play RuneScape, no. </connor>
<garnt> - I fucking loved RuneScape, </garnt>
<joey> I spent so many hours on the game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just like beg my parents when I was like 14 like, </joey>
<joey> "Please, mother, please pay for membership. </joey>
<joey> It's only five pounds a month." </joey>
<connor> - Seriously, I couldn't. </connor>
<joey> I didn't have the balls to ask my parents to do that, </joey>
<connor> so that's why I was like, no. </connor>
<joey> - I think it was like for my birthday, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Can I have RuneScape for a year?" </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "Yeah." </joey>
<joey> And obviously when you were like 14 </joey>
<joey> time doesn't go nearly as fast as it does now, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I remember like the first month </joey>
<joey> I played like eight hours a day of RuneScape every day. </joey>
<joey> I was so addicted. </joey>
<joey> - True gaming goal right here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and when I got like 17, I stopped playing, </joey>
<joey> I gave my account to my little brother, </joey>
<joey> 'cause he wanted to play on it for a little bit. </joey>
<joey> Then fucking lost all my shit. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> I remember there was like this thing called like... </connor>
<joey> There was this thing you had to grind </joey>
<joey> for like the specific armor and it took like months </joey>
<joey> and he'd lost it. </joey>
<joey> - Like missile armor or some shit. </joey>
<joey> - It was like called Fist of Gothics or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it was called. </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) - Fist of Gothics. </joey>
<joey> - It was like this hummer where you had to play </joey>
<joey> it's like an egg game, it was really dumb. </joey>
<joey> I would spent like two weeks straight </joey>
<joey> getting this hummer, doing these mini games </joey>
<joey> and then he lost it and then I got up again. </joey>
<joey> I came out of retirement from RuneScape, just to get this- </joey>
<garnt> (chuckling) - You came out of retirement. </garnt>
<garnt> - I came out of RuneScape retirement, </garnt>
<garnt> just to get this hummer again and he fucking lost it again. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, "That's it I'm done with RuneScape." </joey>
<connor> - You pulled like a high misogyny, right? </connor>
<joey> I'm coming out to RuneScape to save this company. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I couldn't believe it. </connor>
<joey> But going in to gacha, like I'm so quick to drop games </joey>
<joey> because at the moment the game is boring, even remotely. </joey>
<joey> Like if I have one gaming session where I'm playing the game </joey>
<joey> and I just didn't have any fun, I'm like, "All right, well </joey>
<joey> I'm done with that game." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Somehow League of Legends hasn't done that. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I think it's like hacked my brain. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, I hate it. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like it has hacked your brain in such sense. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Do you enjoy league or do you feel like- </connor>
<connor> - League of Legends by the way, I'm sure- </connor>
<connor> - Did you actually enjoy league or do you just </connor>
<joey> sometimes play it because it's just like- </joey>
<joey> - To copy me. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a familiar kind of like system </joey>
<garnt> that you just understand and- </garnt>
<connor> - I think, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Joey probably hasn't had this, but I think </connor>
<connor> when you've played a game like that for so long, </connor>
<joey> there is just kind of like almost autopilot nature to it </joey>
<joey> where like I'll see, I have like an hour free. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'll just click it open even though every time I know </joey>
<joey> when I click it open, it's a bad idea because </joey>
<joey> not only will I probably not have a good game. </joey>
<garnt> If I have a good game, I don't feel good about it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm like, "Well that was a stomp, that was no fun." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - But if I lose or have someone entering </garnt>
<garnt> or on the Japanese server I've been playing, </garnt>
<garnt> people just fucking trolls so much more, it's so bad. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'll be like, "Wow, I just wasted 30 minutes </garnt>
<joey> and now I'm fucking angry." </joey>
<joey> And then I know every time I click it open </joey>
<joey> It's never gonna be worth it </joey>
<joey> but sometimes I still do it. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's like just habit building. </joey>
<garnt> - I have played League of Legends. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's been like, I'd say my main game for... </garnt>
<garnt> God, when did Dilution come out? Like 2004? </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, it's been like six, seven years. </garnt>
<joey> I've just like, its for the game </joey>
<joey> that I always just go back to, and it used to be really fun, </joey>
<connor> but now it's just like depressing. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, that's why I like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so funny, you're speaking to people </garnt>
<connor> who've played league for years. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause everyone talks about it like they are fucking </joey>
<joey> drug addicts, like- </joey>
<joey> - it's certainly sounds like it. </joey>
<joey> - Like you know, "I wanna quit, but I just can't man. </joey>
<joey> I just can't, I need..." </joey>
<joey> - The side effects. - "There's something about me, </joey>
<joey> I just need to play one more game, just one more game. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> But I just can't quit. I can't quit, damn it." </connor>
<connor> - It used to be like, back when I lived in... </connor>
<connor> When I was in university, it was really easy </connor>
<joey> to just play with people and it was pretty fun. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was used to play for the university team as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was pretty fun actually, I really enjoyed that. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then when I left university, I went to London. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't really playing as much with friends. </joey>
<joey> And then I set the bridge to Japan it's totally </joey>
<joey> like a solo queue thing, which it's just isn't fun. </joey>
<joey> Which solo queue is just playing on your own </joey>
<joey> with four other random people. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know why in the Japanese civil, </joey>
<connor> it's so bad dude. </connor>
<connor> It's full of like Chinese Smurfs and Korean Smurfs </connor>
<connor> who wanna just fuck around, all the deans are horrible. </connor>
<joey> - So then have you considered- </joey>
<joey> - Quitting? - Stopping? </joey>
<garnt> - It's hard, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's because I know why. </garnt>
<garnt> Its because there's nothing to replace it, right? </garnt>
<connor> - What do you do, right? </connor>
<connor> What do you do when you have like just one hour free? </connor>
<connor> Just only one hour free? </connor>
<connor> - Jack off. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - For one hour? </connor>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I'll get the job done within that hour, right? </joey>
<garnt> And then- </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor's like, that's an unoptimized jack off. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't have that. </garnt>
<joey> - Well you know? </joey>
<connor> - No jack off should take more than five minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Then, yeah, I have 55 minutes </connor>
<joey> to do whatever I want, right? </joey>
<connor> - But like, okay, now but seriously, what do you do? </connor>
<joey> Like read a book, watch something? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, read a book usually. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't open a book for an hour, I'd stuck </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause you are a fucking monkey brains. </joey>
<joey> - Its like an eight hour thing for me if I open a book. </joey>
<joey> - Eight hours? </joey>
<connor> - I have to make it a whole day thing if I read. </connor>
<joey> - I'm talking about like, like manga or like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, manga. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm actually with Connor. </garnt>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Like if I'm reading manga, it has to be a whole day thing. </joey>
<connor> I can't put it down. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, I can easily just pick up a volume, </connor>
<connor> read it and then that's it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think the problem is that league is so easy </connor>
<connor> to just do for 30 minutes without engaging. </connor>
<garnt> - It just engages that monkey brain, </garnt>
<garnt> that fucking lizard brain where you just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, I'm just clicking buttons now." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and I recognize that it invalidates </connor>
<connor> a lot of my points, like when we talk </connor>
<joey> about fighting games. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That clip of us talking about it and me being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, fuck it." You know? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I got so much shit for that. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause one first of all, they were like </joey>
<joey> "Well Connor's a league player, So it makes so much sense." </joey>
<joey> And then the other top comments are like, </joey>
<joey> "Connor's is just a sore loser, </joey>
<joey> that's why he doesn't like fighting games." </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "You don't know a true fucking loss </connor>
<connor> until you've played a 40 minute game of league </connor>
<connor> and your team fucking threw it all. </connor>

<garnt> That's JOINHONEY.COM/TRASHTASTE. </garnt>
<connor> - Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, there's a lot of people who are saying, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I'm just bad at fighting games and I'm a sole loser, </connor>
<connor> that's why I don't like to do it. </connor>
<connor> And it's so bullshit. </connor>
<connor> If you had played league, you know what true fucking pain </connor>
<connor> is like, I would rather lose a two minute fighting game </connor>
<connor> any day of the week than lose one league game. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it is brutal. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, just from the sounds of it, </joey>
<joey> it just sounds like a shit experience. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, it is, it's terrible. It's fucking awful. </connor>
<joey> - Then stop. </joey>
<joey> - Who knows man, just say that to a crack addict, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - I will. - Just tell him to search- </joey>
<joey> - Well, you can quit crack, just do League. </joey>
<garnt> - It is like crack because I will say like </garnt>
<garnt> the honeymoon period of league, </garnt>
<garnt> like when you first start learning the game </garnt>
<joey> and when you start clicking, it's probably like </joey>
<joey> some of my fondest gaming experiences in my life </joey>
<joey> when I'm just like, "This is a really, really fun game." </joey>
<garnt> And it's just like, it is- </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't even get to that point. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I played one game and then five minutes in </joey>
<joey> all the comments and called me new fan and it kept me, so- </joey>
<connor> - So tell me like, what did you hate </connor>
<connor> about League of Legends? </connor>
<joey> Like walk me throw it? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, well, first of all, </joey>
<joey> I don't like MOBAs to begin with. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean like they are assertive context. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so yeah, so that was that. </connor>
<connor> And then just again, like, just from what I've seen </connor>
<joey> and from what I've heard from a distance </joey>
<joey> the league community just looks like </joey>
<joey> a bunch of fucking cocks. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean by a bunch of cocks? </joey>
<joey> - It's like they just, you know, I've always hated </joey>
<joey> using the word gate keeping but, oh my God! </joey>
<joey> League players are like the crowns of gate keeping. </joey>
<joey> Like you say anything bad about the game. </joey>
<joey> You try and get into it, like with no experience </joey>
<joey> or no knowledge of the game whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> Most communities will, you know at least a few of them </joey>
<joey> will be like, "Hey you're trying to get into our game, </joey>
<connor> welcome, we'll invite you with open arms. </connor>
<connor> But if you suck at the game </connor>
<connor> then that's your responsibility, right?" </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, all right, fair enough. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But meanwhile league is like you're not a fucking God </joey>
<joey> at this game from five minutes in </joey>
<joey> then you're a new fan get out. </joey>
<joey> - It's- </joey>
<joey> - That was my experience with league. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, league definitely has one of the most </garnt>
<connor> toxic communities. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I actively tell people like just don't get into league, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not like it's not rewarding. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and I'm like, I already can't deal </joey>
<joey> with fucking toxic communities to begin with. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I guess I don't really mind that much. </joey>
<connor> Like I kind of liked that aspect of games. </connor>
<connor> - I've been on the internet for too long. </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna deal with that anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - Connor is like a toxic gamer. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have to deal with the anime community, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like let alone the league community. </connor>
<joey> - I know, what do you think about the argument </joey>
<joey> that like a lot of people get really upset </joey>
<connor> with the idea of like trash talking video games online. </connor>
<connor> Like, what do you think about that? </connor>
<joey> - I think if it's done tastefully, I don't really- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like whenever I see you trash talking </garnt>
<garnt> like the fighting game community, I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> "Ah, that's just fun." you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, </connor>
<connor> it's kinda sad 'cause I feel like in League of Legends, </connor>
<joey> not... I mean, it's obviously there are some people </joey>
<joey> who say some fucking APAR and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like, I think just, you know </joey>
<joey> like fucking telling the other team that Baton stuff </joey>
<joey> is funny as hell, like I'm not doing that. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, if it's done tasteful, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And which is, there's many ways to do that. </connor>
<connor> - Just as long as you're not like </connor>
<joey> attacking someone personally. </joey>
<joey> - [Both] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's like, I'm all game for it. </joey>
<joey> Like if someone, if I do a terrible job </joey>
<joey> in League of Legends game, maybe fuck something up </joey>
<joey> I fucking hope they type and they all chat to me </joey>
<joey> saying like, "LOL" or something, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because that's funny to me, like I want that. </connor>
<connor> - Because you do the same, right? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, a hundred percent. </connor>
<connor> - But if it gets to like, you know some </connor>
<connor> racial xenophobic shit, then I'm just like, "All right-" </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's fucked up, yeah. - Please stop. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, obviously I think there was a draw on the line, </connor>
<connor> but obviously kind of feels like, especially in league </connor>
<connor> that they've like kind of like cracked down </connor>
<connor> on anything like that. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel like they had to, because it was so far </connor>
<connor> removed from what was acceptable, that you're like, </connor>
<garnt> you go into like a normal game and people are still </garnt>
<garnt> toxic as fuck, even though it's a normal game. </garnt>
<connor> - The problem was that he never enforced any of the rules </connor>
<joey> for so long, so it just kept escalating. </joey>
<joey> And I reckon if they enforced like the actual rules </joey>
<connor> from the beginning, it wouldn't have been so bad. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] You are right. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But I feel like this is like the same cycle </garnt>
<connor> for every competitive game, you what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Without exception, I mean, you can seem like- </connor>
<connor> - I played Overwatch as well- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you look at Overwatch, and it's like </joey>
<joey> the first few months, great. </joey>
<joey> Everyone had fucking fun. </joey>
<joey> Everyone was just learning the game. </joey>
<joey> And then like, it's the problem of when you've played </joey>
<joey> the game enough, you don't play because it's fun. </joey>
<garnt> You play because like you said, it's just something to do. </garnt>
<joey> - And then out from the shadows rose the try-hard. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - Dude, I had some of the worst experiences </connor>
<garnt> of my life on Overwatch. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you actually? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because League of Legends, right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's bad, right, it's bad. </garnt>
<joey> It's, you see them violet shit, but at least </joey>
<joey> there's no voice chat. </joey>
<joey> In Overwatch, you're automatically put in like voice chat </joey>
<joey> with your team. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds horrible. </joey>
<joey> - Well, okay. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you'd have like the funniest moments ever </joey>
<joey> like you would meet the coolest people. </joey>
<joey> And it was like, you'd always have to remember that </joey>
<joey> whenever you got like the 10 games in a row </joey>
<joey> of like fucking kids and shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Both] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Because like as well the worst part is an Overwatch </joey>
<joey> when I used to play it they implemented a system now </joey>
<joey> where you can queue up for a role, </joey>
<joey> but it used to be six of you got put in </joey>
<joey> you all might be six tank mains. </joey>
<joey> You all might be six, like DPS mains. </joey>
<garnt> So you'd stop fucking bickering immediately </garnt>
<garnt> over who gets what? </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I always just play, fill in games. </garnt>
<joey> Like, I'll just do whatever, 'cause I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't fucking care, like don't shout at me, </joey>
<garnt> let's just do it man." </garnt>
<joey> - [Both] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But man, people would like say horrible shit </joey>
<garnt> on that, like always 12 year olds as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, because once you play it enough hours </garnt>
<connor> then you've reached this point where you're like, </connor>
<garnt> "Okay I got to play ranks, </garnt>
<garnt> because otherwise playing this game is kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> meaningless in a sense, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I hate playing normal games of like competitive games. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but then when, once you start getting </garnt>
<garnt> on the ranks ladder is when I find it, it stops getting fun </garnt>
<garnt> because then you reach and everyone reaches a wall. </garnt>
<garnt> Doesn't matter who you are </garnt>
<garnt> everyone will reach a wall eventually. </garnt>
<garnt> And once you reached that wall </garnt>
<joey> you just feel like you stop progressing. </joey>
<joey> Unless you put like so many hours into learning this game </joey>
<joey> and trying to better yourself and at that point </joey>
<joey> I understand why people get toxic and angry. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because then the weight they like to invest into </joey>
<joey> like making that... </joey>
<joey> Like climbing up the ranks ladder and everything. </joey>
<joey> So they feel like they need this to feel like </joey>
<garnt> they haven't wasted there time. </garnt>
<garnt> Which let's be honest, unless you're a programmer </garnt>
<garnt> you probably are wasting your time with it. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what it might be? </joey>
<joey> I think it's just the simple thing that </joey>
<joey> I can just not into PVP with random people. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I think that's all it is. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm thinking about it now. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I've never enjoyed just PVP games to begin with. </joey>
<joey> Maybe for the exception of like some fighting games </joey>
<joey> but only if I'm like playing it with friends I know. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So like, I'll play like a game of Smash </joey>
<joey> or like straight fight or old tech in or whatever </joey>
<joey> if I'm sitting in the same room with you </joey>
<joey> and we just like having a fun fucking time, right? </joey>
<joey> But I think just the whole idea of PVP </joey>
<joey> against randos on the internet, </joey>
<joey> who I don't know or care about, </joey>
<garnt> I think that's just the one thing </garnt>
<joey> I fucking hate in gaming. </joey>
<joey> - Why is Garnt laughing? </joey>
<garnt> - I just have this like image of Joey being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I have fun with friends." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I think like the angriest I've ever seen Joey </garnt>
<joey> is when you're playing against Connor </joey>
<joey> and he was like, spamming King K. Rool at your house </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - No, but that's the thing, right. </joey>
<connor> I'm okay with getting angry in situations like that </connor>
<connor> because I know Connor and he's there in front of me, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like, so like, that's just fun times, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like, yeah, I was off that you were spamming fucking counsel </connor>
<joey> with King K. Rool, every fucking match. </joey>
<connor> - Joey gets very, very angry when he loses in the Smash. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's what I'm saying though. </joey>
<connor> It's like, I don't like PVP games as it is. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm not a huge fan of PVP as it is </connor>
<connor> because I get angry easily. </connor>
<connor> But especially when it's against people, I can't see, </connor>
<connor> or I've never heard of, never talked to, just don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That anger, I think... </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that just like the enjoyment is just completely gone. </joey>
<connor> - I remember you were like, "Yeah, man, I'm the best. </connor>
<connor> No, one's beat me at Mario Kart ever." </connor>
<joey> Like Joey is like- </joey>
<joey> - I did not say that, you are a lair. </joey>
<joey> - You were like I never lose him Mario Kart- </joey>
<joey> - You are the absolute slander. </joey>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> I did not say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like some fake news- </garnt>
<garnt> - It was something along those lines. </garnt>
<garnt> You were like, "I never losing Mario Kart." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was like, "Bet." </garnt>
<garnt> And then like, Joey would bit all his friends </garnt>
<garnt> and I would just crush Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, crush is a strong word. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - But in recent times, you've been playing </garnt>
<garnt> and it's been pretty 50, 50, but yeah, </garnt>
<joey> when it was like, which one was it? </joey>
<joey> - It's probably when Deluxe came out, </joey>
<joey> the new Mario Kart eight, I was fucking killing Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think so. </joey>
<joey> - And had him made like, he can't game play. </joey>
<joey> Ethan, like a fucking breakdown. </joey>
<connor> Do you remember that? </connor>
<connor> We did like a stream where we kept playing Mario Kart. </connor>
<joey> - I only played baby park for like five hours. </joey>
<connor> - Until Ethan could beat me </connor>
<connor> and we must've played it yeah for like five hours </connor>
<connor> until he managed to bit me. </connor>
<connor> - We did like 150 fucking time. </connor>
<joey> We did a baby park 150 times on stream, we were like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, let's like after like race 20 rool." </joey>
<joey> We were like, "All right, if Ethan beats Connor in one race, </joey>
<connor> then we'll run the stream. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and then that was also earlier on </connor>
<connor> that they thought I was cheating or something. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, your doom was like, "He's got a modern suite </joey>
<joey> or something like, he's winning too many times." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so they made us all change to the same character </joey>
<joey> in the same car and everything like, </joey>
<joey> so there was no cheating at all, </joey>
<joey> like it was all the same thing. </joey>
<connor> And he was like, "How are you still beating me </connor>
<connor> every time?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> It was so funny. </connor>
<joey> - See, that's like, those kinds of like competitive games </joey>
<joey> I fucking love, right. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't wanna say the word party games. </joey>
<joey> But like, I mean, they are party games. </joey>
<joey> Like that's why I fucking love about party games, </joey>
<joey> is that yeah, you'll get people who are fucking salty </joey>
<joey> and it is PVP technically. </joey>
<joey> But at the end of the day, it's fucking whatever. </joey>
<joey> It's a fucking Mario Kart game, right? </joey>
<connor> - What do you think of people throwing </connor>
<connor> their controllers, Joey? </connor>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<joey> - What do you think about people throwing controllers? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I've done it before as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Actually. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I've done it in Smash, remember? </joey>
<joey> - Did you really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think it's so cringe, (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> no matter how angry I get, I'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "But not you." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - Put that there. </joey>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair, I only did it once. </joey>
<connor> - But you see that's an expensive fucking Joey, </connor>
<connor> Connor is like, "I aint throwing these things. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, I threw it like the really cheap shit, </joey>
<connor> like GameCube controller. </connor>
<connor> - Oh those budget ones, oh. </connor>
<garnt> - Were just like 15 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like the budget one, it's like even if I break this, </garnt>
<connor> I can buy another one, it's fine, but the- </connor>
<connor> - The YouTuber money is- </connor>
<joey> - Pad control, I would never. </joey>
<joey> and that's too much of an expensive... </joey>
<joey> Like, Oh my God, seeing like Smash compilations </joey>
<joey> of like people just absolutely </joey>
<joey> just shocking their controllers. </joey>
<connor> - I do love watching Smash tournament rage moments. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's so funny. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, dude, it's a party game like just chill. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like I was about to ask </garnt>
<garnt> what'd you think about party games? </garnt>
<joey> I mean, do you see Smash as a party game? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean- </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, you got a (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - Dude, Sakurai himself said it was a party game. </joey>
<joey> So it's a fucking party game, all right? </joey>
<connor> - It's a party game that can be played competitively. </connor>
<joey> - It's a party game that is, can also be competitive. </joey>
<connor> - Imagine like musical chairs. </connor>
<joey> If there was a pro league- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> I can't wait for the salt in the comments man. </joey>
<garnt> I cannot Wait for the salt in the comments. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, look, it's like, I'm not saying that, </joey>
<joey> you know, Smash is not a competitive game. </joey>
<joey> Like it absolutely is. </joey>
<joey> I fucking love watching the competitive scene of Smash pros. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, but it's a competitive game that can also </joey>
<joey> be a party, you know? </joey>
<joey> Like again, like if you said for example, right. </joey>
<joey> If fucking Mario Kart had like a pro league, </joey>
<joey> then yeah, it could probably be a competitive game </joey>
<joey> but it doesn't. </joey>
<garnt> - Why doesn't it though? Why? </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, here's why I've never understand, </garnt>
<garnt> how did Smash get so competitive </garnt>
<garnt> as opposed to basically like every other Nintendo game? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, because a lot of them are like too random. </garnt>
<garnt> Like Mario Kart has way too many random aspects. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. - Where I think like- </joey>
<joey> - That's why I like Smash, like Smash competitive </joey>
<joey> is like no items final destination only- </joey>
<connor> - That's right, they literally knew called the randomization </connor>
<joey> from it, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - So even the stages they can't move, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so the only, like... </connor>
<joey> I think the only way that something </joey>
<garnt> like Mario Kart could ever be competitive is if- </garnt>
<garnt> - No items? </garnt>
<garnt> - it's the same course, no items, </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) and everyone is- </joey>
<joey> - Baby park. </joey>
<garnt> - Same course, no items, everyone's in the same character </garnt>
<connor> with the same car. </connor>
<connor> - That'd be so fucking boring. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and that's the only reason why, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess so. </connor>
<connor> - But again, like, you know </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's lots of party games out there </connor>
<joey> that could very easily be considered competitive games. </joey>
<joey> - Like what? </joey>
<garnt> - Guitar hero. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that's just the way, that should go </garnt>
<joey> into rhythm games right? </joey>
<joey> - That was actually competitive. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I thought about that. </joey>
<garnt> - Rhythm games can very easily be competitive games, </garnt>
<garnt> but they are not, </garnt>
<garnt> because there's like no real league for it. </garnt>
<joey> But I reckon the only reason why Smash became </joey>
<joey> a competitive game is because of all the fucking </joey>
<joey> street fighter games. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like also it's just a nice </garnt>
<garnt> spectator sports as well. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel like with competitive games, </garnt>
<joey> if there's gonna be a league for it, </joey>
<joey> it's got to be interesting to watch, I'd say. </joey>
<joey> I feel like that's why league is the biggest e-sport </joey>
<joey> because while I'd hardly ever play league anymore </joey>
<joey> I still fucking watch it every year, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it is a really fun game to watch </joey>
<joey> as opposed to- </joey>
<joey> - Because there's so much going on. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> And it feels like it was, it feels like it's a game </joey>
<garnt> that's designed to also be viewed as well </garnt>
<garnt> from a third person perspective. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I used to, when the Overwatch </connor>
<connor> was doing the pro league my friends used to watch it </connor>
<connor> but I used to watch it and I'm like, what the is this? </connor>
<connor> I played this game and there's way too much going on. </connor>
<joey> The quality was can't possibly describe what's going, </joey>
<joey> because all the action happens so fast </joey>
<joey> and it's six different people doing six different things. </joey>
<joey> Whereas the league it's normally, if it's a team fight </joey>
<garnt> it's still like, you can still tell people what's going on. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, its because of the top-down view </connor>
<connor> as opposed to Overwatch where just like </connor>
<connor> first person is here. </connor>
<connor> - It gets nociating. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking be following tracer, Tracer zooms back, </garnt>
<connor> and then I switch into the next guy and switch in again. </connor>
<garnt> It's like, "Oh, just fuck me." </garnt>
<joey> Like, and also I feel that because of the length of league </joey>
<joey> you can sit down and enjoy. </joey>
<joey> And like I think the one reason I've really gotten </joey>
<joey> to fighting games is that normally when I'm watching </joey>
<joey> I mean, e-sports that's what I'm saying, </joey>
<joey> when I'm watching the e-sports, </joey>
<joey> I normally only watch like the finals </joey>
<joey> 'cause I can kind of follow what's going on. </joey>
<joey> It's like the Semi's and the finals </joey>
<joey> and it's really easy to follow along. </joey>
<joey> But when the group stages are going on </joey>
<joey> it's like, all right, "Who's this guy?" </joey>
<joey> And by the time I'm finished Googling him </joey>
<joey> the next guy's on fighting. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "All right, well, okay, who's this guy?" </joey>
<joey> And then the fight maybe I wanted to watch </joey>
<joey> he's over in three minutes and it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, well I guess, yeah, I guess that's it. </joey>
<joey> I guess all the fights are over, okay, shit." </joey>
<joey> League is quite a long thing </joey>
<joey> and they've got a really good system with the league </joey>
<garnt> where it plays like two... </garnt>
<garnt> There's like every league plays everyday now. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like alternates on season. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's crazy, they got set up literally like a football. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's way more like just a football, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like a traditional sports now where you can kind of like </garnt>
<joey> jump in and jump out and see familiar faces </joey>
<joey> and kind of like familiar brands every time. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like that's kind of helped... </joey>
<joey> It's like the e-sports scene in league, </joey>
<joey> it just seems to keep growing every year, </joey>
<joey> which is fucking insane to me that it's like </joey>
<connor> fucking 10, 11 years old now. </connor>
<connor> How old is league? </connor>
<connor> - 10. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and it's still like growing each year </connor>
<connor> internationally, which- </connor>
<connor> - Shows the e-sports- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the e-sport which shows the power. </connor>
<joey> But like totally, I enjoy watching fighting games as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Me too. </joey>
<joey> - Like, the only time I ever get into </joey>
<garnt> is during like Evo or like the big kind of </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, true, Whatever else, like, </garnt>
<connor> Oh, why is there a million views on Twitch? </connor>
<joey> Oh, its Evo, okay, cool. </joey>
<joey> - Like I don't go around like fucking looking for like </joey>
<garnt> you know, local cons doing, you know, Smash tournaments. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm not gonna watch those live </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, but yeah, like Evo and fucking you know, </garnt>
<joey> those big Smashtournament are fucking fun to watch. </joey>
<garnt> - The sponsor of today's video is EJ Anime store. </garnt>
<joey> - EJ Anime store, is an online mode store </joey>
<garnt> that is run directly by Kodakawa. </garnt>

<connor> - Was this your first rodeo or something? </connor>
<joey> Like come on, bro. </joey>
<connor> - I just didn't have what EJ stood for. </connor>
<connor> I just kind of didn't know what to- </connor>
<joey> - I'll tell you, look into my eyes. </joey>
<joey> Entertainment, Japan. </joey>

<joey> - That's pretty freaking Epic. </joey>
<connor> (Connor chuckling) </connor>
<connor> But I'll tell you one thing </connor>
<connor> that I'm genuinely excited about, </connor>
<joey> It's the Slayer's sign, I fucking love slayers dude. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't believe we are celebrating the 30th anniversary </garnt>
<garnt> of the Slayers light novel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, to be actually honest with you. </garnt>
<joey> I can't fucking believe it's 30 years already. </joey>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I grew up reading Slayers and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Man, this is such a new show." </garnt>
<garnt> I realized it started before I was born. </garnt>
<garnt> But we have the Lina Inverse kimono version, </garnt>

<connor> - As the host of this episode. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you laughing? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm the host Joey, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> - What does it feel like? </garnt>
<joey> - Power, it's the power, I guess are we anime podcast? </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Wow, what a question? </joey>
<joey> - I was wondering this yesterday. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I see people on Twitter or Reddit. </joey>
<joey> They talk about like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh man, I like it when they talk about anime, </joey>
<connor> I don't like it when they talk about anime." </connor>
<connor> I guess it's weird, 'cause I guess when we started, </connor>
<connor> it was like I guess we said we were the animated podcast- </connor>
<joey> - Well, our channel bio </joey>
<connor> I think is a terrible anime podcast. </connor>
<joey> If you go on our about section that's what it says. </joey>
<connor> - I always never gave a fuck that much about anime. </connor>
<joey> - Wow, just come out and say it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, I always had a genuine question for you </garnt>
<garnt> which is, do you see yourself as an anime YouTuber? </garnt>
<connor> - The thing is I think because I see myself </connor>
<joey> in the same like realm. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - With like those people. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause you hang out with us, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I hanging out with you guys, I watch a lot of anime. </garnt>
<joey> I make it, I think because I make so many anime references </joey>
<joey> and there's so much like anime and like this Otaku culture </joey>
<joey> in my videos, I guess I do. </joey>
<joey> But not in the traditional sense. </joey>
<connor> Like, 'cause like I don't make videos about anime- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like nowadays you make any content, that's like, </joey>
<joey> even if you make content that's just like general </joey>
<joey> or Otaku shit like you or hockey. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just because like I think Otaku just equals anime now. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I think that the people who watch my stuff </connor>
<garnt> are people who consume anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. - [Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<connor> - But I'm not necessarily talking about anime. </connor>
<garnt> - I know it's weird, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I've been like as the OG anime YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so weird seeing anime content on YouTube nowadays. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is just me thinking out loud, but do people even </garnt>
<garnt> want to see as much like anime content as much anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> And 'cause I feel like it's been really weird seeing content </garnt>
<garnt> on anime content on YouTube in 2020, where it feels like </garnt>
<garnt> anime content doesn't even perform that amazingly anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> Compared to doing like anime themed content, </garnt>
<joey> as opposed to, </joey>
<garnt> "I am going to make content on a certain show." </garnt>
<joey> - It's Otaku content now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, when we started the podcasts, </connor>
<joey> I was kind of worried, I was like, Fuck it. </joey>
<joey> They're going to like wanna talk about anime every week </joey>
<connor> 'cause I call it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, is that is technically speaking. </joey>
<joey> That is what we sought out to do. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I remember when we were discussing it, </connor>
<connor> I remember in my head, I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "I'm just gonna like bring up all this stuff. </joey>
<joey> We'll just see how it does, right?" </joey>
<joey> Like it could have backfired so much. </joey>
<garnt> - It's funny because the only time I talked about anime most </garnt>
<connor> is on the podcast with you guys, right? </connor>
<connor> Rarely do we actually talk about anime off screen? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like there's more people like, </connor>
<connor> I guess if you want to get into it like </connor>
<joey> more people are way qualified than us, to talk about it. </joey>
<joey> Like just consuming anime, all they do is talk about anime. </joey>
<joey> But I also, in my opinion like when I do wanna consume stuff </joey>
<joey> about anime, I often don't want that kind of person, </joey>
<joey> who's just like, all they do is anime, </joey>
<joey> I kind of want like a monkey brain person kind of opinion. </joey>
<joey> - Like a personality who also love anime, right? </joey>
<connor> - I just want someone... </connor>
<connor> Which is why like I think the only anime reviews </connor>
<joey> I still watch which weird to say is, </joey>
<joey> I watch Critical reviews </joey>
<connor> because I know that when I'm getting that, </connor>
<garnt> I'm getting a review from someone- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that's also like someone like Critical </garnt>
<garnt> can pretty much just do content on anything. </garnt>
<connor> - But I think because I've been on YouTube for so long </connor>
<joey> and I've been throughout all of my anime watching lifespan, </joey>
<joey> if you will. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Whenever I wanted to see if I wanted to watch a show </joey>
<joey> I would just go and watch a review from someone </joey>
<joey> who all they do is talk about anime. </joey>
<joey> All they do is consume anime, Otaku culture. </joey>
<joey> And it's just really refreshing to now go </joey>
<joey> and watch someone who doesn't really care </joey>
<joey> that much about anime but they do like it a lot. </joey>
<joey> - Like it's not their entire life. </joey>
<joey> - Right, like it's just like, I'm a normal guy. </joey>
<connor> I do things, but I also watch a lot of anime. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like that attitude really reflects </garnt>
<garnt> on how you know, </garnt>
<garnt> how anime content performs on YouTube as well, </garnt>
<garnt> it's because I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> if you only do anime content and you like only... </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like because anime has gotten </garnt>
<garnt> so much more mainstream in the past few years </garnt>
<garnt> it's not so much about being an anime fan. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> Like there are definitely channels that's, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm probably like one of the biggest </connor>
<connor> where you focus solely on anime. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like there you hit a ceiling, right? </connor>
<connor> You hit the ceiling of, </connor>
<connor> okay, if you only target yourself towards anime fans </connor>
<connor> that community now is only so big, </connor>
<connor> but anime as a medium is actually bigger than just </connor>
<joey> the anime community. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like you can be like a true anime fan </joey>
<joey> follow seasonal anime and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> But then there's like a way bigger community </joey>
<garnt> that knows about anime and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> watches the old anime show. </garnt>
<garnt> But they also don't have as much of a vested interest. </garnt>
<connor> - Are you eight from that nomie guy? </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Maybe I'm talking about nomies. </joey>
<joey> Like they don't have a vested interest </joey>
<garnt> or they're not as invested. </garnt>
<connor> - I basically gonna sum it up, </connor>
<connor> I like watching nomies reviews. </connor>
<connor> I should have said that. </connor>
<joey> - It's the difference between anime fans </joey>
<joey> and people who are fans of anime. </joey>
<joey> I feel there's like a big difference, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like an anime fan is like someone where it's like </joey>
<joey> anime is their life. </joey>
<joey> Like they love everything about it. </joey>
<joey> They'll watch anything, they'll dedicate their life to it. </joey>
<joey> And then there are fans of anime where it's like- </joey>
<joey> - I got the perfect word for this. </joey>
<garnt> There are anime fans and then there are weebs. </garnt>
<garnt> (all chuckling) </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you are right. </connor>
<joey> - You are just so fucking proud of that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, I figured it out. </joey>
<joey> I figured out the system. </joey>
<garnt> - All right, you got it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So just disregard everything I just said. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because, somebody is like, </garnt>
<connor> as you were saying out- </connor>
<connor> - That's why I said that like we like what you say, </connor>
<garnt> we are weebs- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we are weebs, 'cause like I was thinking to myself </garnt>
<connor> like what differentiates someone like Critical </connor>
<connor> from someone like in the anime community </connor>
<joey> because, it made me think, remember the good old days </joey>
<joey> of gate keeping and be- </joey>
<joey> - You mean 2020? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, (chuckling) and like the old days where like </joey>
<joey> you're not a true anime fan unless you've watched XXX show. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, oh, you're an anime fan, </joey>
<connor> name me 20 different shows that are now return- </connor>
<joey> - You are an anime fan link me on my anime. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Then every anime on what Joey has done. </joey>
<joey> - I've done that. </joey>
<joey> - But I'm like, it's good that nowadays </joey>
<joey> I feel like gate keeping especially in the anime community, </joey>
<joey> it's like, it's not died but it's definitely way less </joey>
<joey> than it used to be. </joey>
<connor> But I feel like someone like Critical </connor>
<connor> I feel like he has watched a lot of anime, right? </connor>
<connor> And he does definitely- </connor>
<connor> - I think he actually watches more anime than me. </connor>
<connor> - I think he does as well. </connor>
<garnt> But I don't know like you look at Critical and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You're not a weeb, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> You're just a normal anime fan." </garnt>
<joey> - Felix was like that too. </joey>
<joey> Like at one point he was doing a bunch of like anime reviews </joey>
<joey> and he was doing a lot of videos on anime </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "Okay, I can tell you like anime, </joey>
<joey> but obviously your entire life is not anime." </joey>
<connor> - Right, and I think that's why people </connor>
<joey> really liked his review, 'cause it felt like a very honest- </joey>
<connor> - It was like a new perspective of opinions </connor>
<joey> on certain shows. </joey>
<connor> - Because I feel like when maybe you're an anime YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> when you're reviewing an anime, it's like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm reviewing it because it's anime." </connor>
<joey> Whereas I feel like, if Critical, </joey>
<joey> or any other person makes review, </joey>
<joey> who doesn't talk about anime content. </joey>
<joey> It feels like they have something to say </joey>
<joey> because they've gone out of their way to make a video </joey>
<joey> about something normally wouldn't make a video about, </joey>
<joey> to talk about it. </joey>
<joey> Whereas, you know, </joey>
<joey> Garnt talking about Attack on Titan season four, </joey>
<joey> of course, Garnt is gonna talk about the att... </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like it's expected and it's like- </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause he wants those views. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but obviously I mean, </joey>
<joey> but if someone else does it, right, it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, they must really like, be passionate </joey>
<joey> about what they're trying to convey here." </joey>
<joey> And I think that's really refreshing. </joey>
<joey> And it's something that, I mean, maybe this is, </joey>
<joey> again this could be from being an issue in myself. </joey>
<joey> And I can understand the thought process </joey>
<joey> of why they're talking about it, but I don't know, </joey>
<joey> I guess and that's why I think I've distanced myself </joey>
<connor> from anime in some aspects, like- </connor>
<joey> - And it's like not to undermine the passion </joey>
<joey> of actual anime fans, right? </joey>
<connor> Like, you know, I'm sure there's- </connor>
<joey> - I still fucking love the cultured anime. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure there's a massive amount </connor>
<joey> of like hardcore anime fans </joey>
<connor> who will make Attack on Titan videos </connor>
<connor> because they genuinely love the show. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, of course, yeah, sorry. </joey>
<joey> I'm not trying to say that everyone- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course, but like... </joey>
<joey> No, I get what you're saying, it's like, </joey>
<connor> when you do see that anime review from someone who </connor>
<connor> you don't expects an anime review from, it's just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, okay." </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, looking on the internet now, </joey>
<garnt> there's like so many low key anime fans that, you know- </garnt>
<joey> - They just like suddenly coming out of the woodwork. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I've always been an anime fan. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like sometimes you see these little hints </garnt>
<garnt> every now and again, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like this completely normal YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't expect to watch anime and like make </garnt>
<garnt> a very subtle anime reference. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're just like, wait, are you a weeb? </garnt>
<garnt> Did you have something to say? </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I always get like scared and surprised </joey>
<joey> when a YouTuber who I thought had nothing to do with anime </joey>
<joey> like follows me on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Something's up, do perhaps like anime?" </joey>
<joey> - Or maybe they've just seen like, </joey>
<garnt> "Wow, this guy likes a lot of porn that I like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I should follow him back." </garnt>
<connor> (both chuckling) - Damn. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember I was watching like one of the latest </connor>
<garnt> Internet Historian videos like a few weeks ago </garnt>
<garnt> and then like, you know, it was a very normal </garnt>
<garnt> Internet historian video then right at the end, </garnt>
<connor> he was like giving some shout outs to like </connor>
<connor> his other social medias. </connor>
<connor> And then he mentioned like streaming and everything. </connor>
<connor> And then he showed her a clip of Corona and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Where did this come from?" - Are you serious? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he did, (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> its like right at the end as well. </connor>
<joey> So it's at the point where most people click off. </joey>
<joey> - Good tastes, good tastes. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "Are you a cultured individual too?" </joey>
<joey> - Would you like to come on to the podcast </joey>
<joey> and talk about the goddess that is Corona? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, my God, (chuckling) Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I'd be down. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's just fascinating to watch, especially </connor>
<joey> I'd say in like the last two, three years </joey>
<joey> of just all these people just suddenly coming out, </joey>
<joey> you know saying- </joey>
<garnt> - How'd you feel about anime being like way more normalized? </garnt>
<joey> - How do I feel about going mainstream? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, normalized, I was trying to think of the right word. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it isn't mainstream yet? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, that's the eternal debate. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, is it truly mainstream yet? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> - It depends on your definition of mainstream, right? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it's not like everyone's talking about 24/7 </connor>
<connor> but is everyone, you know? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, people argued that like, you know, </joey>
<joey> "All "Demon Slayer" was trending on Twitter, right? </joey>
<joey> It must've gone mainstream." </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm like, I don't think it's mainstream yet. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's like about three, four years away </garnt>
<garnt> from like properly being mainstream, I'd say. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, I feel like every time there's a big show </connor>
<joey> it helps a lot. </joey>
<joey> - Its certainly on it's way. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, Attack on Titan season four </connor>
<joey> will hopefully help a lot in terms of like, </joey>
<connor> "Hey, here's a completed masterpiece," hopefully. </connor>
<joey> - I mean the amount of money that the fucking </joey>
<joey> "Demon Slayer" movie made in like the first, </joey>
<connor> like two weeks of it coming out. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's still like dwarf numbers compared to like- </joey>
<joey> - Proper- </joey>
<joey> - The giant "Blockbuster" four to $5 million </joey>
<joey> in the first week, which is amazing, but- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean like, fuck it, "Avengers" got like a billion </joey>
<joey> in like the first week of us, </joey>
<connor> which is obviously like perish- </connor>
<connor> - But then again if I had Robert Downey Jr's voice </connor>
<joey> in "Demon Slayer" it would probably get more. </joey>
<joey> - And again, it is Japan </joey>
<garnt> so it's kind of a very isolated market. </garnt>
<connor> So it's kind of hard to say like how well it would do. </connor>
<garnt> - That's why I'd say that it's still like a few years </garnt>
<garnt> from being like properly mainstream. </garnt>
<garnt> But at this point it's not like anime itself </garnt>
<garnt> isn't mainstream, but at least pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> everyone knows what anime is now. </garnt>
<joey> - It's accepted world wide. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's never this debate of, you mentioned an anime </garnt>
<connor> and people were like, "What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> What language are you speaking?" </connor>
<connor> - What is an anime? </connor>
<connor> - What is an anime? </connor>
<garnt> - It's weird because I think that you know, </garnt>
<joey> there's 40, 50 year olds online who talked to </joey>
<joey> who get all the anime references and keep up with it. </joey>
<joey> But then I've got 25 year old friends in the UK </joey>
<joey> who are like, "What's that?" </joey>
<joey> Like what's a dark note? </joey>
<joey> What's that like? (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - What's a dark note. </joey>
<joey> - No, legit, like so it's, I think we almost get </joey>
<joey> all like perceptions, especially us, </joey>
<joey> it's because we are surrounded by like-minded individuals </joey>
<joey> to an extend, we're surrounded by people online. </joey>
<joey> We never interact with people really outside </joey>
<joey> of the online bubble, even when we leave our house, </joey>
<joey> we are normally going to an event with other online people, </joey>
<joey> people who work in the same industry, right? </joey>
<joey> But when I go back to the UK or I go back to Wales </joey>
<joey> and I talked to my friends, they literally have like, </joey>
<connor> no fucking clue about any anime. </connor>
<connor> Maybe there'll be like, "What's that one punch man?" </connor>
<connor> Or something, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - But the fact that they've heard about that, </garnt>
<connor> is fucking massive. </connor>
<garnt> - They might but they are my age, </garnt>
<joey> I would expect them to be like, "Come on, you are 24, </joey>
<connor> you should know what date note is, come on. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean like with titles like that, </joey>
<joey> as long as you're on the internet, </joey>
<joey> it's pretty hard to avoid, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like it's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like when you go into those kinds of social circles </garnt>
<joey> and you realize, </joey>
<garnt> "Oh," you don't spend all your time on Twitter </garnt>
<joey> and seeing all that fucking drama </joey>
<joey> and everything happening on online, </joey>
<joey> you're just watching fucking "Love Island" or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And just- </joey>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> - I fucking hate reality TV. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like a whole new world. </garnt>
<garnt> But even some people that I know who, </garnt>
<garnt> don't spend any time on the internet </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that, </garnt>
<garnt> still I've heard of some of these like bigger shows </garnt>
<garnt> and to me that is still a massive step </garnt>
<garnt> than what it was even like five years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> And like going back 10 year- </garnt>
<joey> - Because you had to like seek out that shit. </joey>
<connor> - The reason I started YouTube is to make friends </connor>
<joey> who I could speak to about it. </joey>
<connor> And now I don't really want to speak about it. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I mean I do, I just- </joey>
<joey> - Fuck these friends. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, again, going back to the podcast, it's like </joey>
<joey> I did wanna speak about it but I didn't wanna </joey>
<connor> make a whole podcast talking about it. </connor>
<connor> I wanna make a podcast and talk shit about it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I think the only reason why we labeled ourselves </joey>
<joey> in anime podcast is because all three of us individually </joey>
<connor> are already established in that field. </connor>
<joey> - I guess it was like a comfort thing. </joey>
<joey> But then when we got in the flow of it </joey>
<connor> I think we realized that like, I think us just chatting </connor>
<joey> is like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I remember like when we first were </joey>
<joey> conceptualizing this podcast we were like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, let's just like, maybe like the first like </joey>
<joey> 10 or 20 episodes, we should like solely focus </joey>
<connor> on the stuff that people know us for. </connor>
<connor> And then maybe every now and then, you know- </connor>
<connor> - The whole time I'm like, I might not want to do this. </connor>
<connor> - So we'll slide IN some other stuff. </connor>
<connor> And then, you know episode one rolls around, </connor>
<joey> we don't mention anime a single time. </joey>
<joey> I think we only talked about attack one time </joey>
<joey> for like 20 minutes on the first episode. </joey>
<joey> - I've watched a lot of animated podcasts. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> I've watched- </joey>
<joey> - What do you think about them? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, well this is the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> There's only so much you can say about anime. </joey>
<joey> And like, I feel like a lot of the times it's like three </joey>
<joey> or four people who regurgitate the same point </joey>
<joey> with slightly different wording back to each other. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Hmm, yes. I agree." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like, "Okay, cool." </joey>
<joey> I mean, some people, some people are looking for that. </joey>
<connor> But to me it's like not exciting anymore, I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - Because there's so much of it out there. </joey>
<connor> - There's too much anime, and by the time... </connor>
<connor> I've gotten to the point now where </connor>
<connor> I don't really have as much time as I'd like </connor>
<connor> to do everything that I wanna do. </connor>
<connor> So now I just wait until the season's over. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, right, so it was the best show guys. </connor>
<connor> What was the show that was- </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like out of the three of us, </garnt>
<connor> I've probably watch the most anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah you do, I'm the most normal hee everyone knows that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and we've got like a spectrum here </connor>
<connor> where Joey's like, "I don't even watch anime anymore. </connor>
<connor> I just read manga." </connor>
<connor> (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> You know they call The Anime Man. </connor>
<connor> - He's The Anime Man who reads more manga like anyone. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like 2020 has been the year </connor>
<connor> where I have watched the least amounts of anime, </connor>
<joey> like in probably like last five years </joey>
<joey> and that's partly due to the fact that I feel </joey>
<joey> like 2020 has just been a really weak year for anime. </joey>
<joey> - It has yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like some variants know the faults of like </joey>
<joey> the anime itself, it's just the weld situation right now </joey>
<joey> where it's just less shows being made. </joey>
<joey> So it's just, it's been really weird </joey>
<joey> because I've been watching this anime </joey>
<joey> I've had to find my enjoyment for like other things, </joey>
<joey> like Vtubers and gacha games. </joey>
<joey> And it's really like broadened my horizons </joey>
<joey> to like other kind of anime subcultures and everything </joey>
<garnt> and like the weeb subculture and everything like that. </garnt>
<joey> - The Otaku just overall or Otaku cultures </joey>
<joey> like really just expanding, </joey>
<joey> I think just in general with the success of, you know, </joey>
<joey> the as you mentioned like the Vtubers </joey>
<joey> and gacha games and all that shit. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> it's really interesting to watch especially as someone </joey>
<joey> who's been in that realm for most of my life. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do you find consuming media in 2020 to be a bit </connor>
<connor> worse in general? </connor>
<connor> Just due to the climate of everything going on right now? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I find that consuming media periods </garnt>
<garnt> has become worse in general, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you kind of- </garnt>
<connor> - Because of 2020, or just in general? </connor>
<garnt> - Just in general. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like there's just too much media now. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it has to do mostly with the environment </joey>
<garnt> that we're like placed in. </garnt>
<joey> It's like for a lot of people consuming media </joey>
<joey> is really the only thing we can do to like- </joey>
<connor> - I think that's almost like a little bit about it as well </connor>
<connor> is that 2020s has just been so... </connor>
<joey> I mean, everyone can relate to this, right? </joey>
<joey> It's been, shit, right? </joey>
<joey> - Unless you are from the future and you're watching this, </joey>
<joey> 2020 was a shit year. </joey>
<joey> - It's been kind of shit. </joey>
<joey> Every time like I have free time to do it. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, this is free time, </joey>
<joey> I could've been doing something fun </joey>
<joey> and doing something with my life, </joey>
<joey> but I'm stuck here watching this anime. </joey>
<joey> I've got nothing better to do." </joey>
<joey> And it's kind of sad, it doesn't feel like </joey>
<joey> I'm really choosing to do it, it feels like </joey>
<joey> I'm doing it out of like, just like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I got nothing better to do. </joey>
<joey> And I, you know, what worries me, </joey>
<joey> I can't enjoy anime, right? </joey>
<joey> Who fucking cares, but at the end of the day, </joey>
<connor> I'm just trying to explain why I guess my enjoyment </connor>
<connor> right now of like anime, especially </connor>
<connor> it's probably been the thing that's dropped off most. </connor>
<joey> - I've definitely like, I hate to admit it to myself </joey>
<joey> but I've definitely had a massive fucking burn out </joey>
<joey> with anime, like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just not only because like this year's anime </joey>
<joey> has been kind of mid but also just the fact that, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I don't know, I've just been doing this shit </joey>
<joey> for so long now where it's like- </joey>
<connor> - You know, I made a video like, like six months </connor>
<joey> into my YouTube career, like five years ago now. </joey>
<connor> Like why I don't watch much anime anymore. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I made a video, I think it's actually still up </joey>
<joey> and in that video, I'm just kind of like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, like, I don't know, it's weird. </joey>
<joey> I just started making YouTube videos </joey>
<joey> and I just don't watch much anime anymore." </joey>
<joey> I kind of watch like two or three a season at most. </joey>
<garnt> And then I realized, </garnt>
<garnt> like I thought that would go back to normal, </garnt>
<garnt> never did go back to normal. </garnt>
<connor> I've just been at that same stage the whole time. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like that's just the normal cycle </garnt>
<garnt> of a fucking anime fun. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, what I realized is like </connor>
<connor> when you first get into anime or you have that period </connor>
<joey> when you start watching a fuck ton of anime </joey>
<joey> I thought it would be like, okay well- </joey>
<garnt> - You thought that will last forever? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I thought that, okay, when that honeymoon period </garnt>
<joey> if you will end it, I thought, </joey>
<joey> "Well, you know maybe next summer </joey>
<joey> when I have a lot of free time </joey>
<joey> it'll come back round." </joey>
<joey> I told myself that like every year it just never has. </joey>
<connor> And I realized, oh, this is just like the new normal. </connor>
<joey> - And then when you wake up first day of the summer break </joey>
<garnt> and you are like, I have nothing to do. </garnt>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I feel like it was a real tough for me. </joey>
<garnt> This year especially when I always felt like </garnt>
<joey> I was behind on anime. </joey>
<joey> Well, like I don't have enough time to keep up </joey>
<joey> with everything I wanted. </joey>
<garnt> And then in the one year where you have the most </garnt>
<garnt> free time to do whatever you want it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> watching anime just felt like a chore at points </garnt>
<garnt> because you're just like I'm not taking a break </garnt>
<garnt> from something else. </garnt>
<joey> I just feel like I'm doing this </joey>
<joey> 'cause I have nothing else to do. </joey>
<joey> - If you start making excuses, like, you know </joey>
<garnt> when you were back at school and you had to study, right. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, "oh, I have to like clean my room." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I have to go shopping. </joey>
<joey> - This is hosting existential episode of the podcast. </joey>
<connor> What are we here for anyway? </connor>
<garnt> What are we doing? </garnt>
<joey> - Are we truly an anime podcast? </joey>
<garnt> - Why do we watch anime? </garnt>
<joey> - For fun? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I don't know, like- </joey>
<connor> - Okay, by the time when we were... </connor>
<joey> This will be out, the drifting episode will be out. </joey>
<joey> And then, you know, the, the Calli episode to be out </joey>
<joey> and then we're filming another thing, </joey>
<joey> that's coming out soon. </joey>
<garnt> - Second special of the year. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know we spent listen to YouTube burnout, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like a lot of my energy that was once anime </garnt>
<connor> and consuming content has just been pushed </connor>
<connor> in different avenues, and I feel like that's- </connor>
<garnt> - All my energy has been pushed into Trash Tastes. </garnt>
<connor> - And the game we spoke about that </connor>
<joey> I don't like talking about topics I spoke about, </joey>
<joey> but it's like, </joey>
<joey> I guess I wanted to talk about this topic in general, </joey>
<garnt> just because I know that we get a lot of comments </garnt>
<garnt> being like, "Why don't we talk about anime any more?" </garnt>
<garnt> But then there's those people on the other side of- </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's 50, 50. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's some people who are like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I fucking hate it when they talk about anime." </garnt>
<joey> Like I wonder to the viewers, do you prefer </joey>
<joey> when we speak about anime or not? </joey>
<connor> I mean, we're gonna speak about it regardless </connor>
<connor> when we want to, but it's nice to hear your opinion. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we wanna hear your opinions, </connor>
<joey> but at the end of the day we're gonna talk about </joey>
<joey> whatever the fucking we wanna talk about. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> But like, you know, but that to me is just like </joey>
<joey> reassuring that we have an audience that... </joey>
<connor> Because I always thought, "Oh yeah like 99.9% of the people </connor>
<connor> who are subscribed to and watch Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> are only there because they like anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I thought when we started the podcast, </connor>
<joey> I knew it was gonna be a risk, being like, </joey>
<joey> let's just talk about ourselves. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Let's just fucking talk about life, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Because there's someone who's pigeon holed themselves </joey>
<connor> into that side of things- </connor>
<joey> - You never really spoke about yourself publicly. </joey>
<joey> And I just wanted to 'cause I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Man, I flipped people-" </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I love myself. </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - I just feel like I'm a gift. </joey>
<joey> (all chuckling) </joey>
<joey> I mean, 'cause on your chat </joey>
<joey> I really thought that as a YouTuber </joey>
<joey> that it was like this image that people had of me. </joey>
<joey> And I really just wanted to like talk about myself </joey>
<joey> and help or not help. </joey>
<joey> Just like, I dunno have this image of the people... </joey>
<joey> The image people had of me breath more truth, </joey>
<joey> so when they watch my videos, you know </joey>
<connor> they might see me behaving a certain way </connor>
<joey> but when they're go and watch Trash Taste, </joey>
<joey> they know what I'm really like when I'm on the show. </joey>
<connor> Right? They know that it's- </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's why I like to preface it by saying like </joey>
<garnt> on Trash Taste, we're not The Anime Man, Guk and CDwag. </garnt>
<garnt> We are Joey, Garnt and Connor. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I like to think that how you guys see us </joey>
<garnt> on this show is the closest to reality </garnt>
<garnt> of how we actually are. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas like, you know, on our main channels, </garnt>
<joey> of course like any good main channel, </joey>
<joey> there's a performative side to it, right? </joey>
<joey> Where it's like, we're acting as like that character. </joey>
<garnt> - In my content on my main channel is like </garnt>
<joey> way different from anything we do on Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> And that's why like working on </joey>
<joey> some of the more ambitious projects on Trash Taste </joey>
<garnt> has been like a breath of fresh air to me. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it's just something different. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Like the drifting video </garnt>
<connor> was just a challenge all around. </connor>
<connor> I mean, that was like- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that was a challenge on every fucking end. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we briefly talked about like how much effort </garnt>
<garnt> we put in that video but Holy hell, </garnt>
<garnt> I learned so much from just doing the episode </garnt>
<garnt> and just seeing all the little things </garnt>
<garnt> you don't think about until the day of the shoot, right? </garnt>
<joey> - By the way, go check it out if you haven't, </joey>
<joey> link in the description. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I already want to make more, </joey>
<connor> but also want some more help. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, I feel like being in charge of all the tech </connor>
<joey> is so boring it's like, what is Joey's might work, </joey>
<joey> and this is kinda work- </joey>
<joey> - We need to start hiring like staff. </joey>
<joey> - We need a P.A. </joey>
<joey> People living in Japan. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - We're hiring. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - But what are we saying, fuck it! </connor>
<joey> - About like the, is Trash Tastes an anime podcast or not? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> - So, we're just talking about the evolution </garnt>
<garnt> of the anime community in the past years </garnt>
<garnt> and how how like Poplar has gotten, like, </garnt>
<garnt> here's the question, where do you see the anime community </garnt>
<garnt> and the anime fandom in like the next few years? </garnt>
<joey> - It's really hard to say because I mean- </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, same. </joey>
<garnt> I think it'll be the same age. </garnt>
<garnt> - You think it will be the same? </garnt>
<connor> - Roughly. </connor>
<connor> - I think it would be the same </connor>
<joey> but definitely we're gonna start to see more </joey>
<joey> as you put it, weebs than actual like anime fans, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I feel that the whole genre of anime fans </joey>
<joey> is kind of like, I don't wanna say it's dying, </joey>
<joey> but it's slowly becoming not as like </joey>
<garnt> in the spotlight as was before- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like saying you are an anime fan is sounding more and more </garnt>
<connor> like you're just saying you're a gamer. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckling) </connor>
<connor> It just means nothing, 'cause everyone's gam... </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I remember when I used to play online games </garnt>
<joey> like League of Legends </joey>
<joey> and I would make like a weeb joke or whatever, </joey>
<joey> and then like people would be like, </joey>
<connor> "you're a fucking weed, you disgust us." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<connor> But now it would be like one person in the lobby </connor>
<garnt> who doesn't know the reference. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I genuinely don't think that much would change. </connor>
<joey> - Soon we're gonna be starting... </joey>
<joey> We're gonna be calling ourselves Otaku goals </joey>
<joey> instead of gamer goals, right? </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I'm an Otaku. </joey>
<connor> - I wonder, do you ever think that maybe </connor>
<connor> like the degenerate side of anime might hold it back </connor>
<connor> from going more mainstream? </connor>
<connor> - No, I feel like that subculture </connor>
<joey> is always gonna be there because- </joey>
<joey> - If anything it's grown. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause right now it's like people were scared </joey>
<joey> that anime becoming mainstream would make </joey>
<garnt> this degenerate side of anime, </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of calmed down a bit. </garnt>
<garnt> But if anything, just because there's so much more anime </garnt>
<garnt> being made nowadays, you don't really have to pick- </garnt>
<connor> - Who the fuck thinks that it would calm down </connor>
<connor> the degenerative side? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I've seen comments online too- </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the general stigma is that. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - As someone who is in this degenerate side. </joey>
<joey> - You've seen how much Pokemon porn </joey>
<joey> there is that shit? </joey>
<connor> That stuff doesn't chill out with more people. </connor>
<connor> - As someone on the degenerative side, </connor>
<connor> like seeing all these new faces coming into these, </connor>
<joey> just so wholesome, like just pure hearted people </joey>
<joey> coming into it, being like, "What is hint eye?" </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "Let me show you." </joey>
<garnt> - Let me open your world. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm like the joker and the guys are like, </joey>
<garnt> I love seeing people suffer through this, </garnt>
<joey> and just realizing that the world that they're living in </joey>
<joey> is actually burning from the inside. </joey>
<joey> It's like- </joey>
<garnt> - Joey just wants to see the world burn. </garnt>
<joey> - I love seeing the world burn. </joey>
<joey> - Alrighty then. </joey>
<joey> - Just be like let me teach you a little thing </joey>
<joey> about Dogan codes, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I feel like it, </garnt>
<garnt> because the the big change I've seen </garnt>
<garnt> is not in the content of anime that's being made </garnt>
<garnt> but just the sheer amounts of anime that's being made. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like this season we have like 38 shows </garnt>
<garnt> there in the season. </garnt>
<connor> - I just couldn't give a fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is like, if you try to keep up with everything </garnt>
<garnt> that's watching three seasons of anime </garnt>
<garnt> in one fucking week who the is doing this? </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean. </joey>
<joey> - Because 20 years ago, </joey>
<joey> I think I remember this from a video I made </joey>
<joey> I think 20 years ago </joey>
<garnt> in like early 2000's each season, we had seven shows. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is much more manageable. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, there was a period like 10 to 20 years ago </garnt>
<garnt> where you could you could legitimately follow everything </garnt>
<garnt> that was going on in the season and be up, </garnt>
<garnt> be kept up with like the conversation </garnt>
<garnt> with what was coming out </garnt>
<garnt> because there wasn't that much to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> And now it's just, okay, what kind of anime fan are you? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you like the mainstream shown and stuff? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you like, you know, degenerate stuff, idol stuff? </garnt>
<garnt> Whatever or like a mixture of everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> You could pick and choose whatever mood </garnt>
<garnt> you're in the mood to watch. </garnt>
<joey> - There's an enemy for every niche and every fetish now. </joey>
<garnt> - And the thing is like, I feel like the quality of anime </garnt>
<garnt> in general has gotten a little better </garnt>
<joey> because everything like... </joey>
<garnt> I feel like everything's just good. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've got to stand out now. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - And it's like TV, like TV is so good now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Their is so many good TV shows </garnt>
<garnt> that like every week you're getting recommended </garnt>
<garnt> like a 9.5 out of 10. </garnt>
<joey> You're like, "Oh fuck yeah, I mean, I barely finished </joey>
<connor> "House of Cards" and then look what happened to- </connor>
<garnt> - But like the problem with that is it's like </garnt>
<joey> the biggest first world problem in the world, </joey>
<joey> when everything's good- </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) - Everything's too good. </joey>
<joey> - When everything's good nothing stands out anymore. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes I watch a seasonal anime now </joey>
<joey> and it's like, this is the biggest seven to eight </joey>
<joey> out of 10 in a season anime and I just forget it. </joey>
<joey> And I compare these like what I would call now, </joey>
<joey> average shows, and I compare it to some of like </joey>
<joey> the kind of like the mid shows that I would watch </joey>
<joey> back when I was getting into anime. </joey>
<joey> And they are like way better, but for some reason I like... </joey>
<joey> I remember watching like a show like, </joey>
<joey> I'm going off the top of my head. </joey>
<joey> Maybe something like "Darker than Black" </joey>
<joey> which is also I fucking enjoyed that show, </joey>
<joey> but it's like I think back and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> if that show had aired in our days </joey>
<joey> it would just wouldn't stand out at all. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I kinda love that show. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the thing though right? </joey>
<joey> It's like normally in an out of 10 rating, </joey>
<connor> five is the average and it really says something </connor>
<joey> when nowadays seven or eight is the average. </joey>

<joey> - Thank you Skill Share for sponsoring. </joey>
<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> - Just going off from what I was saying before, </garnt>
<garnt> where I feel like it's just harder to consume media now </garnt>
<garnt> because just less things stand out. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's so much choice that sometimes... </garnt>
<garnt> You ever got to have a point where you sit down, </garnt>
<garnt> you have like your lunch or something. </garnt>
<connor> And you're like, "Oh, let's put something on a lunch." </connor>
<garnt> And then you spend like 15 minutes scrolling down </garnt>
<garnt> your anime list of you have Netflix or something. </garnt>
<connor> And then you are not finishing your lunch </connor>
<connor> by the time you like finished scrolling down </connor>
<connor> and looking at everything? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, (chuckling) yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just clicked the first thing into my YouTube recommended </joey>
<joey> that's half decent. </joey>
<joey> - Really. - Yeah, 'cause I'm like, </joey>
<connor> if I know I'm gonna be eating </connor>
<connor> I can put Netflix on, 'cause I know I'm gonna eat the food </connor>
<connor> with before the credits even fucking finish. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I always have to put on YouTube, </joey>
<joey> but for me, it's the opposite, </joey>
<joey> I put on a video that where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> Okay, yeah I can rewatch that. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - It's usually a video that I know I enjoyed. </joey>
<joey> And I know I liked, but has the re-playability </joey>
<joey> that I can watch it again during lunch. </joey>
<joey> So weirdly enough, I don't actually go out </joey>
<joey> and like look for new videos </joey>
<joey> during like a lunch break or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I need to be like in that mood </joey>
<joey> of like discovery, right? </joey>
<connor> Just what it sounds- </connor>
<joey> - Before I go to bed, the amount of times I've open Netflix </joey>
<joey> and had luck and just be like </joey>
<joey> "All of these seem like I'd probably have fun, </joey>
<joey> but fuck, I mean, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I guess I'll put report of the week on, </connor>
<connor> and watch it on a fucking- </connor>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<connor> I dunno, like- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Here is a question for you though Conner, </joey>
<joey> you said you watch way less anime now than you used to. </joey>
<joey> Would you say that maybe you might be growing out of it </joey>
<joey> in any sense of the world. </joey>
<joey> (Joey gasping) </joey>
<joey> Like it just doesn't fit your lifestyle anymore? </joey>
<garnt> - You maturing out of anime? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, no, I mean, I still love anime. </connor>
<garnt> And like a bang of shows, but I think I've just </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, stop fucking lying to myself. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Like I think because of the position I was in. </joey>
<joey> I felt indebted to animate like I had to watch it, </joey>
<joey> you know, back when I first started I was like, </joey>
<joey> "It's an anime, you should have to watch it, </joey>
<joey> to keep up with it, you know?" </joey>
<joey> So I can be like, I can keep up with the hot takes. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think, you know, maybe like two, three years ago </joey>
<joey> I just kind of realized like, I don't like doing this. </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna watch the biggest shows that come out </joey>
<joey> and enjoy them and have a great time. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </joey>
<connor> - I love anime, like the way I can show- </connor>
<connor> - But you don't care to like go out </connor>
<joey> and like discover the show is good or not? </joey>
<joey> - No, I have no ambition to do that. </joey>
<joey> I'll just wait until everyone agrees a show is good, </joey>
<joey> I'll watch it, 'cause I'd know the show is gonna be good. </joey>
<joey> I've had so many experiences </joey>
<connor> where I've just watched an animated that's so fucking boring </connor>
<connor> that I'm like, "Okay, I mean, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I guess "Decadence" was fine, you know. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you watch "Decadence"? </garnt>
<joey> - I watched like three episodes of "Decadence" </joey>
<joey> 'cause everyone was hyping it up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, everyone was hyping it up is good. </joey>
<joey> (Connor sighing) (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> - I totally agree with him, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - There is so many shows nowadays, </joey>
<joey> which is seasonal anime and I feel like </joey>
<joey> people only hype it up because it's a seasonal anime </joey>
<joey> and nothing else to talk about. </joey>
<garnt> So someone's got to hype up something. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's really telling because 90% of those shows </joey>
<joey> like get hyped up while its airing, </joey>
<joey> you don't hear about after it's finished. </joey>
<connor> - I also just watch a lot more YouTube, </connor>
<joey> like I think on average </joey>
<joey> I watch like 40 hours a week on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I agree, I've watched a lot more YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - But it's a lot of YouTube. </joey>
<joey> The thing is right, okay, YouTube tells me, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you can actually look on the app </joey>
<joey> and it can actually tell you how much </joey>
<joey> you should watch week. </joey>
<joey> And it'll tell you how much you watch on average day. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't like four hours a day I watch or something </joey>
<joey> on average least. </joey>
<joey> But like, I mean, like I said, 47- </joey>
<joey> - I'm probably the same. </joey>
<joey> I just haven't checked. </joey>
<joey> - The problem is right? It's not- </joey>
<garnt> - It's only the YouTube app? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, its only YouTube app. - Ill check right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its like deep in the settings. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I mean, I'll look while I'm explaining it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember that their was a... </garnt>
<joey> Because essentially right when I go to the gym </joey>
<joey> for two hours, cause I have YouTube premium, </joey>
<joey> so you can, you can lock your phone and listen to audio. </joey>
<joey> I'll watch YouTube videos or just audio only. </joey>
<joey> So that's like two hours. </joey>
<joey> While I take a shit, </joey>
<joey> you bet I'm putting the YouTube video on for two minutes. </joey>
<joey> When I'm brushing my teeth, </joey>
<connor> YouTube video, while I'm in the bath, YouTube video, </connor>
<connor> when I'm working and it's not important, </connor>
<connor> I don't need to listen, YouTube video. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I have four and a half hours daily. </joey>
<connor> - See, did you think you can watch four hours YouTube? </connor>
<joey> - No, I've apparently already just today </joey>
<joey> watched three hours. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I know that I watch hell of a lot of YouTube- </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt doesn't wanna know. </connor>
<garnt> - If I don't look, I don't have to know. </garnt>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, on Sunday, I watched eight hours of YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even remember doing that. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because here's the thing why like- </garnt>
<connor> - I've watched a 50 hours in the last week. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because here's the thing about YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> is that it's just content on YouTube </garnt>
<joey> is just that much easier to consume, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you know, when you have... </joey>
<joey> Do you have kind of like a subconscious value system </joey>
<joey> when it comes to like content. </joey>
<joey> So when you watch like a Netflix show or something, </joey>
<joey> it's like you're sitting down </joey>
<joey> and you're paying the fuck attention, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But when it's a YouTube video you could be doing whatever </joey>
<joey> and you just can have it on the in the background </joey>
<garnt> and just not really give a shit about it, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I also like keeping up with YouTube a lot. </connor>
<joey> Like I think I'm way more invested in like YouTube, </joey>
<joey> like as a- </joey>
<joey> - As a subculture? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, than anime, honestly, </joey>
<joey> like I've been following YouTube like religiously </joey>
<joey> for like seven years. </joey>
<joey> So I know all like the drama, </joey>
<joey> everything that's ever happened on YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> I'm sure, like if we did a quiz, I'm sure A stack wise- </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you are YouTube fan? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm a big YouTube fan. </connor>
<garnt> - I know exactly what you mean. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's exactly the same in like every subculture </garnt>
<joey> of YouTube as well, 'cause like I know a lot Anitubers </joey>
<joey> who I swear spend most of their time watching </joey>
<joey> other Anitubers as opposed to watching anime. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like every Anituber </joey>
<joey> has been through that stage where you find yourself </joey>
<garnt> watching more Anitubes than you do watching anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like, I could watch this anime </garnt>
<joey> or I could watch this Anitubers talking about that anime. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, and now it's just growing </joey>
<joey> from I watch other Anitubers </joey>
<joey> I just watch other YouTuber channels. </joey>
<joey> - In general, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Rather than like my anime consumption </joey>
<joey> has remained the same this entire time. </joey>
<joey> But my consumption of like watching other anime YouTubers </joey>
<joey> and watching other YouTubers has just grown immensely. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And that's why I feel like it's so weird </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I see the comments </garnt>
<garnt> and you know the comment I'm talking about where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I'm having trouble keeping up with anime </garnt>
<garnt> but a two hour Trash Tastes episode. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Give me that shit any day of the weekend, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess because it's easy to digest, right? </connor>
<garnt> I think with anime, </garnt>
<joey> I mean Joey can relate to that you know, </joey>
<joey> the subtitles I can't fucking focus you know, </joey>
<connor> it's like, all right, okay fine, I guess I'll pay attention. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I have to focus on listening, right? </joey>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - But I still, yeah...I mean- </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I just it's sad. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I just don't wanna admit </connor>
<connor> that I've fallen out of anime really, </connor>
<connor> I think that's the saddest part. </connor>
<joey> - Right, especially because you've like followed it </joey>
<joey> for all this time, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess it's kind of sad being... </connor>
<connor> I guess I'm just not into anime as much as I used to be. </connor>
<joey> Like, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Do you think that's because- </connor>
<garnt> - Part of growing up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think as well that it might have to do </garnt>
<garnt> with the fact that you have grown up </garnt>
<joey> or is it the fact of like just the quality </joey>
<joey> of the shows or like the type of show coming out? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, we got better anime now, let's be honest. </joey>
<connor> The anime is better now than it was. </connor>
<garnt> - But did you feel like maybe it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> you enjoy different kinds of media now. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause, let's remove anime from the equation </garnt>
<garnt> but what's like the last TV show you properly enjoyed, </garnt>
<garnt> anime or not? </garnt>
<joey> - Uh, "Great Pretender" I guess </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - And that was like, that's an anime, </joey>
<joey> and I was like two, three months ago. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck I've I been watching? </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - YouTube apparently. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause, here's what I've realized, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> when I find a show that I really enjoy, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so rare nowadays because we consume so much media, </garnt>
<garnt> but so much of it is just fucking forgettable. </garnt>
<joey> And that's why you like, </joey>
<joey> you do watch a lot of YouTube, right? </joey>
<joey> But is that the same kind of enjoyment that you get </joey>
<joey> from watching some of your favorite shows </joey>
<joey> that you remember from, you know, as a kid </joey>
<joey> or when you're marathoning has shown </joey>
<joey> you just really, really into it. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like just because we can see more media </joey>
<joey> doesn't necessarily mean that we value media the same </joey>
<joey> you know, it's just, I feel like </joey>
<joey> we've just programmed our brain to never have dead space </joey>
<garnt> so we're always consuming something. </garnt>
<connor> - And I guess 'cause of the age of the internet </connor>
<joey> and you know, being more knowledgeable about anime </joey>
<joey> especially in opposition, right? </joey>
<joey> It's almost commodified, so- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I guess it's kind of weird, 'cause it's... </joey>
<joey> I think my motivation for wanting to watch anime now </joey>
<joey> to just feel in the loop. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Not because I actually want to watch that show. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is why I've just fully admitted to myself. </joey>
<connor> I'm just only going to watch the big shows </connor>
<joey> that everyone agrees with. </joey>
<connor> - But that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, it definitely doesn't help </connor>
<joey> when everyone else around you is like, </joey>
<garnt> "Hey, have you watched this show? </garnt>
<garnt> Have you watched this show? </garnt>
<garnt> Have you watched this? </garnt>
<joey> Or what are your thoughts on this show?" </joey>
<joey> - Because to us it's different now </joey>
<garnt> because it was just like anime has become a job </garnt>
<garnt> and someone who watches as much anime as me, </garnt>
<garnt> like I can see a show and I can be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I can see that this is a good show." </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like I can break it down to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I know why I know why this is a good show. </joey>
<joey> I know why people are hyping this up." </joey>
<joey> But when you reached a point where you kind of </joey>
<joey> become part of the seasonal cycle, </joey>
<joey> you kind of see the patterns. </joey>
<garnt> There's always these, the same- </garnt>
<joey> - You are turning it into a fucking conveyor belt. </joey>
<connor> - I had that exact experience when I went to go watch </connor>
<garnt> "The Damon Slayer" movie, I was like </garnt>
<garnt> I took one look at the poster and I was like </garnt>
<garnt> I know exactly what's gonna happen in this movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like just from like, "Oh yeah, this character </garnt>
<garnt> is gonna do this and this character is gonna do this." </garnt>
<joey> And sure enough, I was like 90% correct on what happened. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like, is that a good thing? </joey>
<joey> Or is it, I mean, I still enjoyed it, but it's, you know </joey>
<joey> The whole like wow factor was completely gone, right? </joey>
<joey> And I think that's the entire reason why </joey>
<joey> I've kind of been burned out on anime </joey>
<joey> and I've been much more into manga </joey>
<joey> because like nowadays, especially nowadays </joey>
<joey> everybody is talking about every anime that matters. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's almost like an escape pool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But the manga side of things because like 90% of manga </joey>
<joey> don't have translations, it's still a mystery. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's what the anime community was </garnt>
<garnt> 10 years ago. - Like 10 years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> I totally agree and that's why like, </garnt>
<garnt> I love going into the world of manga, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause in anime you don't get that feeling </joey>
<joey> of discovering that hidden gem any more. </joey>
<joey> There's no feeling of discovery because everyone knows </joey>
<garnt> where everything good is. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what's gonna come out three seasons. </joey>
<joey> - There's no surprise anymore. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like even when there's a good show </joey>
<joey> that I can recommend someone watching the season </joey>
<joey> to me I'm just like, I can tell this is a good show </joey>
<joey> and I can tell people would enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I don't enjoy it in the same kind of like, wow </joey>
<garnt> this is something new to me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Okay, this is just a very solid show this season </garnt>
<garnt> and I recommend people watch it if they wanna experience </garnt>
<garnt> X kind of thing." </garnt>
<garnt> But when I go into manga, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't know, what's gonna be good. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd know what's gonna be bad." </garnt>
<joey> - The amount of times I've like finished reading </joey>
<joey> a manga series and I've said to myself, </joey>
<joey> "How was no one talking about this?" </joey>
<joey> Is way more than any amount of anime that I've ever covered. </joey>
<joey> Because again, like that whole mystery of- </joey>
<connor> - It's an event as well, </connor>
<joey> like, you know, it's coming out the season. </joey>
<joey> It's one of the things you're watching weekly, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, manga is so ongoing that it's hard to, </joey>
<connor> I think, have that kind of hype for it. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like there's way more choice with manga as well. </joey>
<joey> And it's such a vast world that- </joey>
<joey> - That fucking love it. </joey>
<joey> - I don't feel like anyone's gonna be able </joey>
<garnt> to read everything, so- </garnt>
<connor> - Challenge accepted. </connor>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you said, first-world problem is the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> My toilet seat temperature is one Celsius, off my luck, </garnt>
<garnt> what can I say? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm dead, I'm dead. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean, it's totally is, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like a problem that has come </garnt>
<joey> with this new generation where there's just </joey>
<joey> so much to do so much to watch, it's impossible- </joey>
<joey> - There's too much to do. </joey>
<garnt> - There's too much to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like that whole fucking meme of like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> white people rewatch in the office </garnt>
<garnt> for like the 10th time, it is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's funny, I'll laugh- </garnt>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - I've rewatched " Always Sunny in Philadelphia" </garnt>
<joey> more times than I can fucking count. </joey>
<joey> - Its funny basically, like- </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Actually though. </joey>
<joey> - I liked that. </joey>
<garnt> - All right now. (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But I feel like, because there's so much </garnt>
<garnt> we've desensitized ourselves to so much as well. </garnt>
<joey> And like, you know, I look at someone like you </joey>
<joey> who probably watches more content, more media </joey>
<joey> than you ever have in your life. </joey>
<joey> But thinking back about what's actually memorable </joey>
<connor> its like hard, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I like... </garnt>
<garnt> You, I think you were like, "What the fuck?" </garnt>
<connor> Like when I play League of Legends or play games </connor>
<connor> I watch YouTube videos on the other like screen. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I can't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I can't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the same as people who can, you know </garnt>
<joey> watch a TV show while reading a book, </joey>
<joey> it's like, how do you do that? </joey>
<garnt> - That's fucked up. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right. It's like, how do you do that? </joey>
<garnt> Or like listening to music while reading a book. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't even do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can do that. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't do it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, here's the question. </joey>
<garnt> Do you remember the first time you watched a YouTube video </garnt>
<joey> at 1.5 or two times speed? </joey>
<joey> - No, I've never done it. </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever done that? </joey>
<joey> - Of course, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've never done that. </joey>
<joey> - And I realized, I... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I realized why would I ever want this? </joey>
<joey> That just means I'm not enjoying the content </joey>
<joey> how it's supposed to be like enjoyed. </joey>
<joey> And then I realized, </joey>
<joey> "Wait, I could just consume this content </joey>
<joey> in a faster, in like a shorter time period." </joey>
<connor> And then- </connor>
<connor> - There are people who legitly watch every video. </connor>
<connor> - And then I realized it was like a habit </connor>
<connor> like that was subconsciously forming and then realize, </connor>
<connor> "Wait, I'm not even fucking enjoying this content anymore. </connor>
<joey> Literally, I'm just watching it just to keep up." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "That's pretty fast." </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause that's kind of like hacking my mind </garnt>
<garnt> into what entertainment is at the end of the day. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - I do think time- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's slowly turning into like an info Wars. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> What is entertainment? </joey>
<connor> Are we consuming too much media? </connor>
<connor> - I do think times too should be reserved for </connor>
<garnt> shitty tutorials that take too fucking long. </garnt>
<garnt> (all chuckling) too long to explain. </garnt>
<garnt> - I totally agree with you. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't trust anyone who opens up a tutorial </joey>
<joey> and doesn't immediately skip to two minutes in. </joey>
<joey> Like there's so many fucking channels that are like... </joey>
<joey> Tutorial is like, "Yoh, what's up guys?" </joey>
<joey> and like, you should not... </joey>
<joey> Tutorials should not be allowed to do intros. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You should basically just tell me what- </joey>
<joey> - Just give me the information. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just fucking, get right into it, dude. </joey>
<joey> Like "hey, what's up guys I'm uploading daily content. </joey>
<connor> Okay, next week I'm live streaming. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be talking about." </connor>
<joey> - I remember the other day 'cause I was trying to like </joey>
<connor> fix something with my cam link, right? </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Okay, I need to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> some issues with my cam link." </garnt>
<garnt> And there was this video, which was like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> five issues with cam link and how to fix it. </joey>
<joey> It was like a 10 minute video. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, All right, </joey>
<garnt> like maybe it's like two minutes each, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't need to be 10 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm like, dude, this dude like legit </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God for the first six minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> He was just plugging all the shit, </garnt>
<joey> and like trying to add like jokes and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, let's get into the meat of the video." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "There's only four minutes left." </joey>
<joey> How are you gonna talk about five problems </joey>
<joey> and how to solve them in four minutes? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, it's a big issue, when even like... </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you can Google this stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and Google will show you the video results. </garnt>
<joey> And it'll literally skip to the point </joey>
<joey> where it thinks tutorial actually starts. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Which is like, if Google is automating this </garnt>
<garnt> why do people think that anyone else </garnt>
<garnt> is gonna fucking watch it? </garnt>
<connor> - I remember like 2010 when it was like video game, </connor>
<joey> like, "Oh, where's this thing or how to do this thing." </joey>
<joey> Always watch a video, the video will show you exactly </joey>
<joey> how to do it and we'll jump right into it. </joey>
<joey> But now it's kind of like- </joey>
<joey> - No commentary. </joey>
<joey> - Now it's going backwards where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I guess I'll click the forum first </joey>
<joey> and see if I can get the information in 10 seconds." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm gonna click on this 20 minute video and fuck, </joey>
<connor> I see the same operating system. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like, </connor>
<joey> "I don't care about your cam link jokes, all right, </joey>
<joey> just tell me how to fix my fucking cam link, please." </joey>
<connor> - I can give all the times that I've had like a tech issue </connor>
<connor> and it's some guy with like the thickest accent </connor>
<connor> like trying to explain them like, </connor>
<connor> okay, fuck, what is he saying? </connor>
<joey> Times two?" </joey>
<connor> - And he's like literally swallowing the microphone as well. </connor>
<connor> So like, even at times two-speed it's like, "I can't." </connor>
<joey> And you have to go down to the comments to see </joey>
<joey> if someone's like paraphrase it in some way. </joey>
<connor> - You know what I hate? </connor>
<connor> YouTube has started doing a thing where you can... </connor>
<connor> I mean, they've done it for a while </connor>
<connor> but if you're a foreign channel, </connor>
<connor> so I could put like French titles. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> So that was just one more, it was a guide </joey>
<joey> and I clicked on it and I'm pretty sure </joey>
<joey> it was like an Indian guide fully in like Indian. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> Why is the title in English?" </joey>
<joey> It's like how to fix your Android five problem. </joey>
<joey> I was like sick, "That's exactly what I want." </joey>
<joey> I click on it and he starts talking Indian, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> And like, there was no subtitles or anything. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - So I was like, "Who, Why, why would you do this? </connor>
<connor> - Because it like auto translates the titles, right? </connor>
<connor> - But you have to approve that I think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - No, but like, I've done that before </connor>
<connor> with like, 'cause I watch like a lot of Japanese videos </connor>
<connor> as well with like Japanese titles </connor>
<joey> and for some reason every now and then </joey>
<joey> there's a video where if I search for it, </joey>
<joey> it's displayed in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> But the moment I click on it, the title turns to English. </joey>
<connor> - Is it the dude who makes the knives out of shit? </connor>
<joey> - That one too, but also there's like a bunch of just like, </joey>
<joey> like a lot of like Vtube clips, for example </joey>
<garnt> are written in Japanese, in the search bar. </garnt>
<joey> But then the moment I click it, it turns to English. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've noticed that as well. </garnt>
<joey> And I feel like- </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Which is why I feel like YouTube getting rid </joey>
<garnt> of close captions is like my biggest fucking mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why they're doing it. </garnt>
<connor> - There were like 0.5% who use them. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "That's still 0.5% of how many million, </joey>
<joey> who won't? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> that's insane guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - The entire YouTube community's crying right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - How about we make it, hm, worse? </connor>
<joey> - Are you saying we have to hard Saab- </joey>
<joey> - Our videos? </joey>
<connor> Hard saabs, eww. </connor>
<joey> - You know, that feature that allows me </joey>
<joey> to conveniently change subtitles </joey>
<joey> depending on which language- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh wow, that would be stupid, man. </joey>
<joey> Let's get rid of that. </joey>
<connor> (chuckling) - Uh, fuck you? </connor>
<connor> - I can use serve dumb something. </connor>
<connor> Jesus fucking Christ, I can't believe it. </connor>
<joey> - Stop changing YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - Stop changing for the worst. </garnt>
<garnt> - Stop changing. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like, "How about we do the 50th logo redesigned </garnt>
<garnt> to more minimalism. </garnt>
<garnt> The color red is now our logo, </garnt>
<garnt> but let's take out all the good features." </garnt>
<joey> and it's like, "Oh, okay. I guess, yeah." </joey>
<joey> Jesus, they take so many ELLs. </joey>
<joey> Remember they did the, like, what was that? </joey>
<joey> What was the funniest one? </joey>
<joey> The YouTube heroes do remember that one? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my, what was that again? </joey>
<joey> - Like they were gonna like make mods basically </joey>
<garnt> out of like YouTube users where they could like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh I remember that. - I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was a fucking mess, it was so funny. </garnt>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - Thank God. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, here's the question to you guys then? </garnt>
<joey> Because I don't know if I'm like, just getting old </joey>
<joey> or is if this is just like, boom at all. </joey>
<joey> But do you feel like, </joey>
<garnt> the golden age of the internet has passed? </garnt>
<garnt> Or has there even been a golden age of the internet? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I think the wild wild West has gone. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, definitely. Like- - Right. </joey>
<joey> - If I were to say, I don't know, </joey>
<connor> because like golden of something </connor>
<connor> is such a fucking subjectifying- </connor>
<connor> - What do you defines as golden age? </connor>
<garnt> - Its so subjective- - In the best period. </garnt>
<joey> - But like this period based on what? </joey>
<garnt> Like- - I mean, it's subjective. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right, based on like </garnt>
<garnt> your personal experience with it, </garnt>
<garnt> or like best like objectively, </garnt>
<garnt> or like based on something or other. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, because I can argue that like, okay </garnt>
<garnt> like my personal golden age of the internet </garnt>
<garnt> would be now because it's- </garnt>
<joey> - Its just easy to use now. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just easy to use. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, you can get any information </garnt>
<garnt> with anything and everything is so conveniently laid out. </garnt>
<garnt> But best experience in terms of like, my overall enjoyment </garnt>
<garnt> of it would be like the mid 2000's, </garnt>
<garnt> because that was like the golden age of like </garnt>
<garnt> new grounds and like flash games. </garnt>
<joey> And like, that shit was so fucking fun </joey>
<joey> and none of that exists anymore. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, now when I download something I'm like </connor>
<garnt> 99% sure it's not a virus. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas back then it was the opposite ratio </garnt>
<garnt> Where I was like, "This is virus, </garnt>
<garnt> but I really want that cool mouse though. </garnt>
<garnt> That mouse popped up really cool with the sprinkles. </garnt>
<joey> I really want that." </joey>
<joey> - "I wanna turn my cursor into like a little cat." </joey>
<connor> - "I think I want nine toolbars," you know? </connor>
<joey> I remember the horror where my mom showed me her laptop </joey>
<garnt> and I thought I fuck one of her pieces. </garnt>
<garnt> But she had like four internet Explorer tab. </garnt>
<connor> Like fucking toolbars, and I'm like, "Oh God." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt chuckling) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you know, like at the time, like I hated it. </joey>
<joey> But you know, the, the reminiscent </joey>
<joey> like times of like going onto my mom's PC </joey>
<joey> having to swim through all the pop-ups just to get </joey>
<joey> to where I needed to go to, was like, </joey>
<joey> I hated it at the time. </joey>
<garnt> But now I look back and it's like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh yes, internet do used to be like that." </joey>
<garnt> - Because I feel like everything now is, you know, </garnt>
<joey> it's everything is more formulaic, more clean. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'd say everything has been like optimized. </joey>
<joey> As we were saying, it's like the internet </joey>
<joey> has definitely been optimized, </joey>
<joey> and you know, that's why I bring up the argument </joey>
<joey> of like was it better when it was like, </joey>
<joey> had this charms, when you feel like </joey>
<garnt> you are discovering something new </garnt>
<garnt> and it felt fresh, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Or now that everything's formulaic, </garnt>
<garnt> everything's laid out, everything's clean. </garnt>
<garnt> That it's just less fun. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, the whole, like... </joey>
<joey> As I was saying earlier, like the whole like mystery </joey>
<joey> of like discovering a new anime, right? </joey>
<joey> Like back then in like the mid 2000's </joey>
<joey> it was like fucking great because it was like </joey>
<joey> going into a goldmine that hadn't been discovered yet. </joey>
<connor> - And like, you know, it was the whole thing </connor>
<connor> but at the same time it was a double-edged sword, right? </connor>
<connor> It was like, do I dare click on this anime </connor>
<connor> to try and discover it with the risk of possibly getting </connor>
<connor> I don't know, like seven Trojan horses </connor>
<connor> coming into my house, you know? </connor>
<joey> It's like, do I take the risk? </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh, wild, wild West, here we go. </joey>
<joey> But nowadays it's like, if I click on the link </joey>
<garnt> like I'm fairly certain, I'm gonna get something </garnt>
<garnt> and it's probably going to be something </garnt>
<garnt> I've already heard off, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The entire mystery of it is gone. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, Oh my God, the fucking... </garnt>
<garnt> The amount of time I spent on like newgrounds, for example </garnt>
<joey> just going through just the most shittiest of cartoons </joey>
<joey> and flash games to find that one game </joey>
<joey> or cartoon where it's just like, </joey>
<joey> "I'll never fuck-" </joey>
<garnt> - Do you remember the first time you discovered </garnt>
<garnt> like the fucking stick figure fights on newgrounds? </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just like the best ever. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, I don't need top 10 anime fights, </garnt>
<garnt> I have like jaljao, whatever the fuck he's called. </garnt>
<garnt> (both chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, the moment I discovered </garnt>
<garnt> "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny." </garnt>
<garnt> (screams) - Oh my God! </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that shit, when I found that I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "This is peak internet, nothing will top this </connor>
<joey> no movie or experience will ever top this? </joey>
<connor> - That was the song, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> ♪ This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny ♪ </connor>
<joey> - This thing I've had the Harry Potter puppets- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, same guy. </connor>
<garnt> When I first discovered that I was like, dude, </garnt>
<joey> this is my entertainment for the next 20 years. </joey>
<joey> Like, I will never get bored of this. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - I don't know if it's because I'm just tired as fuck, </connor>
<connor> in like a shitty mood in general. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's just, it's sad, the internet now. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I just feel like I'm fucking fatly injected </connor>
<connor> like a stream of content constantly, </connor>
<connor> especially on like Facebook and Twitter. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, I just scroll, and I'm like (sighing) </connor>
<garnt> - Ever thought about detoxing? </garnt>
<connor> It feels like you need a detox, </connor>
<joey> because when you start multitasking with your entertainment </joey>
<joey> that's when I'm just like, "Okay, maybe this is too much. </joey>
<garnt> I'm not even enjoying this anymore." </garnt>
<garnt> When I'm having a league game, and a YouTube video, </garnt>
<garnt> and music on the same time, you're just like </garnt>
<garnt> you're not enjoying any of these singular things. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know if it's out there, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's just because </connor>
<connor> the way that the like Facebook and Instagram and Reddit, </connor>
<joey> they're all set up where it's just </joey>
<joey> like permanently feeding you something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Where like, even if I detox </joey>
<joey> from at the moment I get right back into it, like </joey>
<joey> it's just gonna be the same shit again </joey>
<connor> where I feel like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm constantly being like manipulated now. </connor>
<joey> - It's like legitimate needs, </joey>
<connor> like serial experiments systems. </connor>
<joey> - No, it is, I mean like- </joey>
<connor> - These systems know exactly what we wanna fucking say, </connor>
<joey> and they know what's gonna make us luck and it works. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like back then it was exciting, </joey>
<joey> and it was really like rough around the edges, </joey>
<joey> and I didn't mind talking to strangers. </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Remember that room when you didn't mind </joey>
<connor> talking to a stranger and be like, "Hey-" </connor>
<joey> - I missed the times of like booting up MSN messenger </joey>
<connor> and seeing like 70 like friend requests from people </connor>
<joey> I had no idea, I'm like, "I'm sure these are nice people." </joey>
<joey> - I too made some friends who like, </joey>
<joey> I still too keep in touch with one or two of them </joey>
<joey> who are like complete random people, I- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I like made really good friends with. </joey>
<joey> I met them in person as well, like that was really genuine. </joey>
<joey> And it also felt because it was rough around the edges </joey>
<joey> and it was normally a very small team making </joey>
<joey> these huge websites, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, it didn't feel like anyone was trying </joey>
<joey> to take advantage of anyone, it was just a community. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Now, it feels like, yes, there is a community </joey>
<joey> but I'm also just a fucking like, </joey>
<garnt> just one of those fucking chickens in the pen </garnt>
<garnt> just like, "Oh, please give me a drop of water, please. </garnt>
<garnt> So I can get real fat for you, </garnt>
<garnt> and you can sell my advertising money." </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? I just feel like- </garnt>
<garnt> - The social, close cooperate scums. </garnt>
<connor> - I would feel like a chicken in there. </connor>
<joey> - I honestly feel that attention fatigue nowadays </joey>
<joey> is a real thing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - where like you talk about you. </joey>
<joey> I just wanna get up a game of league and just do it, </joey>
<joey> the beeping and it boops, right? </joey>
<joey> (all chuckling) </joey>
<joey> And that's because you just want something that's familiar, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't take a lot of effort, you know how it works. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause that's like, just because the internet nowadays </garnt>
<garnt> has become so good at getting your attention. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, I got I some serotonin for you. </garnt>
<garnt> I got some serotonin for you right here, right here. </garnt>
<garnt> Just take a sling- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, like it'll be like, Twitter will be like, </connor>
<joey> "Hey a tweet you missed." </joey>
<joey> And it'll pop up as a notification, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, Don't do that, stop, stop that, stop. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause remember when going onto the internet </joey>
<garnt> was like a fucking event? </garnt>
<joey> I was like, "All right, Mom's out of the house </joey>
<garnt> which means she's not using the phone. </garnt>
<joey> Which means the dial up is gonna be just </joey>
<joey> a little bit faster, let's go. </joey>
<connor> - I had a real like fucking moment the other day. </connor>
<joey> Audio listeners wouldn't be able to see that. </joey>
<joey> I like fell back a little bit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember that like, you know, </joey>
<joey> let's say you posted something that blew up, right? </joey>
<joey> Now, you'll know immediately. </joey>
<joey> Do you have to log out of a website, log back in, </joey>
<joey> check that inbox, You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like weird, I just remembered that we did that. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I just like recently upgraded my computer </joey>
<connor> as we established last episode. </connor>
<garnt> And like I had to log back into everything </garnt>
<garnt> and it really like said something when I was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't logged out yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shit, what's my password again? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> Because everything just stays logged in, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, I swear, like out of the 10 something websites </garnt>
<joey> that I had to log into like eight of them, </joey>
<joey> I was like forgot password. </joey>
<joey> (Both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know which YouTuber it was, </connor>
<connor> they messaged me and I didn't reply for a whole day. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I just stopped replying to like messages </garnt>
<garnt> on like a Saturday or a Sunday, whichever day I'm feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't mean just trying to take one day off. </garnt>
<joey> I ignore like, I guess not important. </joey>
<joey> Like if it's business-related or like even like </joey>
<joey> YouTuber friend's, I'll just ignore it for a day. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like, I just want to chill, play games, </joey>
<joey> not have to worry about work or anything like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just kinda, yeah, that's what... </joey>
<joey> I thought Mayline was laughing but she was coughing. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Pathetic, </joey>
<joey> everyday is business. - Stop fucking dying Mayline. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I don't know like, and I remember they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, that's weird." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Is it weird that I don't wanna be like </joey>
<joey> communicated to every fucking day? </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I mean it gets tiring. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I don't know, I feel weird. </joey>
<joey> I'm I fucking boomer? </joey>
<joey> I'm a boomer now? </joey>
<joey> Shit, maybe I'm a boomer dude. </joey>
<joey> - Don't say boomer, </joey>
<joey> when you're the youngest person in this room. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like a boomer when I'm looking at my fucking phone </connor>
<connor> is like, "Hey, here's a post you missed on Reddit." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "I don't care." </joey>
<joey> I've never cared about any of those posts </joey>
<joey> that's recommended, ever. </joey>
<connor> Like stop recommending me, I can probably- </connor>
<joey> - I genuinely wonder, if some people get those notifications </joey>
<joey> like, "Oh, I'm glad they fucking notified me." </joey>
<connor> (both chuckling) </connor>
<joey> - It must work because they keep doing it. </joey>
<joey> Like it must have a rate of success that's worth doing it. </joey>
<joey> And it's fucking annoying. </joey>
<joey> - I guess so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can probably turn off somewhere, I should- </joey>
<joey> - I turn it off. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't know, I probably- </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's too much effort to find out </garnt>
<garnt> how to turn it off, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like I could unsubscribe from about </garnt>
<joey> 50% of emails I get, but it's like, Oh, for fuck sa... </joey>
<joey> I just delete it. </joey>
<joey> Like, it's like a natural joke reaction </joey>
<garnt> but I should probably just unsubscribe it, </garnt>
<garnt> get rid of it, but I don't- </garnt>
<garnt> - It sounds like you do actually just need a detox from- </garnt>
<connor> - How do I do it? </connor>
<joey> What if Mr. Beast is giving out a million dollars </joey>
<joey> every day on Twitter, when I'm not there? </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - I need to ratio him, to get that $10,000- </joey>
<garnt> - What if its just Connor will be the one day </garnt>
<garnt> where something big happens? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know you just don't care for a while. </garnt>
<garnt> You just try not looking at your phone </garnt>
<garnt> for an entire fucking day. </garnt>
<connor> - I need an incentive, I can't just do that. </connor>
<garnt> That's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just get good. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you give me a challenge, I'll be- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean like, this is like properly talking </garnt>
<garnt> to like fucking addicts talk, right? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, do you feel like you have a problem </connor>
<connor> because if you don't think you have a problem, then- </connor>
<connor> - Everyone I know has a problem, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> I don't know anyone who is in the same situation </connor>
<connor> where they're like, I love my social media feed. </connor>
<garnt> I love logging into Instagram daily and checking the story- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't wait to check my stories. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you ever heard someone say that? </garnt>
<garnt> - But you've got to understand </garnt>
<garnt> that we are in a very unique position where this is our job, </garnt>
<garnt> so we never have a break from it ever. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the equivalent to an office lady being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I can't wait to check my emails today." </joey>
<connor> - I just think everyone's in the same position. </connor>
<connor> I just think people just don't wanna fucking check that. </connor>
<garnt> - Everyone everyone's in the same position </garnt>
<joey> but there's different severalties of it. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like, we have... </joey>
<joey> Okay, the difference between us and like most other people </joey>
<joey> is that we have a vested interest to keep up </joey>
<joey> with everything because it's our job. </joey>
<joey> Like if someone misses a fucking YouTube video </joey>
<joey> or fucking like YouTube drama, it doesn't matter for them. </joey>
<joey> For us it's just like, it's the equivalent for us </joey>
<joey> of you know, being that stockbroker. </joey>
<joey> Reading the stocks every day, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Shit, it went down my point 1%. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking. </joey>
<joey> That's like the equivalent of like </joey>
<joey> the situation for us, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you've got to realize that, </joey>
<joey> yeah, it's hacking your brain, </joey>
<joey> you are becoming dependent on it </joey>
<joey> because it's also part of your job. </joey>
<garnt> You have a vested interest to keep up with everything. </garnt>
<garnt> But it is like- </garnt>
<joey> - It doesn't matter how much you like your job, </joey>
<joey> at the end of the day, it's still your job. </joey>
<joey> So eventually whether you like it or not </joey>
<joey> there's gonna be some parts of a way, just like, </joey>
<connor> "Ugh" you know, like think back to when </connor>
<connor> you first started YouTube, </connor>
<connor> you first started up your Twitter account </connor>
<connor> and you were like fucking excited to check </connor>
<connor> if you got a notification. </connor>
<connor> - I mean yeah, maybe I guess. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like every YouTuber is like that. </connor>
<connor> Every YouTube who starts off </connor>
<connor> and like starts to get some amount of like numbers, </connor>
<connor> and has a Twitter is always excited to go onto the Twitter </connor>
<joey> to see if they got like a reply to something </joey>
<joey> or how many people like their thing. </joey>
<joey> But we've been doing it for so long now </joey>
<joey> where it's just like, you know the same over and over again. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, think of it this way. </joey>
<garnt> Do you know any other YouTuber, actual YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> who hits the bell notification? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I'm saying? </garnt>
<connor> - On a YouTube channel? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, I do. </connor>
<garnt> - Wait, you do? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, which ones? </connor>
<connor> - I don't want to miss </connor>
<connor> like an Internet Historian video, right? </connor>
<connor> Like I wanna know- </connor>
<joey> - It's pretty hard to miss, </joey>
<connor> he uploads like once every three months. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I want a notification on my phone when he does </connor>
<joey> so I can, like- </joey>
<connor> - I wanna be the first hundred viewers. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you also noticed that YouTube recommendations </garnt>
<garnt> have been kind of shit recently? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I think they've been the opposite. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really, they've been better? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I think mine have been garbage recently, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe because you're watching garbage content. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<connor> Yeah, there, I said it. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe it's because- </joey>
<garnt> - No more Anime Man videos to me then, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm done watching The Anime. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I feel like just because </joey>
<connor> you've watched so much YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Actually that could be it. </connor>
<connor> - You know that you just run out. </connor>
<connor> - You run out of all the good one. </connor>
<joey> - You just run out of content, right? </joey>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's true like any medium, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck, maybe you are right, Garnt, fuck. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I mean, my recommenders has been great </joey>
<connor> because I've just been watching Vtube clips. </connor>
<joey> So all of my recommenders, </joey>
<joey> it's just Vtube clips I haven't seen. </joey>
<connor> - Just watch streams at that point, right? </connor>
<joey> - No, I mean, I do. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but sometimes I don't wanna go through </connor>
<joey> a three hour stream to watch five minutes of it, right? </joey>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean in my mind and I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> the best YouTube recommendations is like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know the one video it gets recommended </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like a sub minute video </garnt>
<garnt> that has like 5 million views. </garnt>
<joey> They're always ended up being amazing. </joey>
<joey> Like my favorite YouTube genres now </joey>
<joey> is that a title that it says exactly what is there, </joey>
<joey> a video that does exactly what it says on the title. </joey>
<joey> Like I remember, like I saw a video the other day </joey>
<joey> that was like, ducks annihilate a bowl of peas. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "All right, this can't be right." </joey>
<joey> And it's just a fucking two ducks, just annihilating </joey>
<joey> this bawl of peas. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, this is peak YouTube content right now. </joey>
<joey> - That's like Twitter content, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like Twitter videos put on to YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - But in terms of like YouTube recommendations, </joey>
<joey> I mean there's only a certain set of content creators </joey>
<joey> that like I would say, </joey>
<garnt> make content that you are very invested in. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like getting excited over </garnt>
<joey> when they upload and- </joey>
<joey> - You always have that like, boom, right? </joey>
<joey> Of like a certain type of content, like inside of you. </joey>
<connor> - And we can talk about the YouTube as we like on next week. </connor>
<joey> It's just gonna be the YouTubers episode. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yes. </joey>
<connor> - We're gonna talk about our favorite YouTubers. </connor>
<joey> - It's gonna be the giant shout out episode. </joey>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah, I mean, like, I think YouTube recommendations </garnt>
<garnt> comes in like waves, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you like... </garnt>
<garnt> All it takes is like one video and you are recommended. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you like recommended... </garnt>
<garnt> Your recommendations are like good for like a good </garnt>
<garnt> like few days. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you're like, "Oh, this is a new kind of rabbit hole </garnt>
<garnt> I've found myself in. </garnt>
<garnt> But when you're in that like low moments </garnt>
<garnt> when you end up watching so much YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> then you just end up watching- </garnt>
<garnt> - You've exhausted the recommended. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, what sucks about living in Japan </connor>
<connor> is that everyone uploads while we're sleeping. </connor>
<joey> So when I wake up I already know all the videos </joey>
<joey> that are gonna be uploaded during my day. </joey>
<garnt> But from people I'm subscribed to. </garnt>
<joey> So I already know like the best videos when I wake up, </joey>
<joey> so I can watch all the best videos </joey>
<joey> in like the first hour, hour and a half, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then I have nothing else. </joey>
<joey> While I was living in the UK they were like </joey>
<joey> coming up gradually during my evening. </joey>
<joey> So it was always like, "Oh, this videos, okay, </joey>
<joey> go back and-" </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I've had that problem my entire life. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know, I mean I know your tim... </joey>
<joey> Oh, well Australia. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> We're only one hour difference, so. </joey>
<joey> - It's so weird for me, 'cause it's like, </joey>
<joey> Oh wait, okay. </joey>
<connor> So all the videos are out in the morning </connor>
<connor> and I've watched all in the morning. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I like about it. </joey>
<joey> It's that like you wake up in the morning </joey>
<joey> and all the content is there for that day. </joey>
<connor> - But it sucks, when I'm in the middle of the day </connor>
<connor> and I wanna watch something, and there's nothing, </connor>
<joey> no one's uploading anything, so. </joey>
<joey> - Right, but then that's why- </joey>
<joey> - I've never cared about that. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I've always just- </connor>
<joey> - I cared about that Garnt, clearly. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I'm talking about it. </connor>
<connor> - Shit, that means YouTube upload schedules actually matter? </connor>
<connor> - Joey forgot to plug in his PC. </connor>
<connor> - Shit, that means YouTube upload schedules actually matter </connor>
<joey> 'cause I thought everyone was like me who just like </joey>
<joey> watches videos indiscriminately- </joey>
<joey> - Just upload whenever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and just like, Oh, I'll just watch this video </joey>
<garnt> when I feel like it, I don't care when it's uploaded. </garnt>
<connor> - I care when it's uploaded. </connor>
<joey> - Fuck, again, I don't so much care when it's uploaded </joey>
<joey> because for me, like my entire like idea of YouTube content </joey>
<joey> for that day has always been like wake up in the morning, </joey>
<joey> like go down my sub-list be like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, I'm probably gonna watch this video, </joey>
<joey> this video, this video. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I usually just like, watch it </garnt>
<joey> as I'm like having breakfast or getting ready for the day. </joey>
<joey> And then once I've exhausted that selfie </joey>
<connor> then I'm like, alright, now I can go on with my day </connor>
<connor> and actually do productive shit. </connor>
<connor> It's like out of the way now. </connor>
<connor> - I just can't do anything until I've watched </connor>
<connor> all the good videos today. </connor>
<joey> - I need my fix of selfie. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, I don't think there's </garnt>
<garnt> that much good content out there where </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, I need good con... </garnt>
<garnt> Like I don't, there's not enough content </garnt>
<garnt> out there that's good </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind that can keep me entertained </garnt>
<garnt> every day, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> There's like certain YouTubers where I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "It's a bang of video and I know I'm gonna enjoy this." </garnt>
<garnt> But most of the YouTube content you watch is just </garnt>
<garnt> fills the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] True. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's just it, and it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> can this fill the time without me getting bored? </garnt>
<joey> - Is it not weird that like </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is just me, </joey>
<joey> but like has it gotten to the point now where </joey>
<joey> like the sub feed has just basically turned </joey>
<joey> into like a timeline just to see what everyone's doing? </joey>
<joey> You know? It's kind of like a YouTube timeline. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, all right, let's see what people are doing today. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] True. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like, you don't watch 80% of the videos </joey>
<joey> that are on your selfie, but you just do something </joey>
<connor> because you're wondering like, </connor>
<joey> "All right, what are they up to now?" </joey>
<joey> It's weird how that's become- </joey>
<joey> - I feel bad when don't watch a YouTube video. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) - Oh, my God. </joey>
<connor> - We're all very tired today. </connor>
<joey> - We're all very tired. </joey>
<joey> - This is probably been the most tired </joey>
<joey> that we've all been for Trash Taste episode. </joey>
<connor> Like I slept horribly, Garnt went to bed at 6:00 AM </connor>
<connor> and Joey's tied too. </connor>
<joey> - I'm always tired. </joey>
<connor> - But you were saying you feel bad when? </connor>
<connor> - I feel bad when I don't keep up with YouTube </connor>
<connor> especially if I know that I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh man, I just I didn't watch that new video of you, </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry, man. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, I'm a bad friend." </connor>
<connor> - Have you always done that though? </connor>
<connor> With like, YouTuber friends? </connor>
<connor> - I try to keep up with what my friends make, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I try to keep up just so I can like be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh nah man, nice, you killed it." </joey>
<joey> Like if they did something really ambitious </joey>
<joey> I'd have to let them know, be like, </joey>
<connor> "Hey man, you fucking killed it bro, nice." </connor>
<joey> - I don't know if that's a rare thing. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause my general understanding is like, </connor>
<joey> again it's like people just sub to you to like, </joey>
<connor> you know, show support of course. </connor>
<connor> But also to be like, just to see what's up with- </connor>
<connor> - It might be different for every viewer, </connor>
<connor> like this one, I'm sure not everyone watches </connor>
<joey> every episode of Trash Taste, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Or cares about when it comes out, like I'll give- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Even though you should. </connor>
<joey> You should be watching every Trash Taste episode. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyway, this has been a very weird two hour. </garnt>
<garnt> I hope you've enjoyed the two hour therapy session </garnt>
<garnt> between the boys. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, this has been like the least, </connor>
<connor> like I feel like exciting episode. </connor>
<connor> We're all just tired of shit, we are like, </connor>
<connor> "What are we fucking doing now?" </connor>
<connor> - It's just basically just addicts anonymous. </connor>
<connor> - It's like- - I'm addicted to this. </connor>
<joey> - Hello, Internet, I'm addicted to the internet </joey>
<joey> and I need to take a break and conscious' like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't have an issue, I don't know where you... </joey>
<joey> Oh, maybe I do have an issue, oh okay." </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the shittiest addicts anonymous, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, "I don't have an issue, </garnt>
<connor> therefore you don't have an issue, fuck you. </connor>
<joey> - My league issue, my YouTube issue. </joey>
<joey> What's the next, dude? </joey>
<joey> - It's like you want me to fix your league issue? </joey>
<joey> Just quit, just stop. </joey>
<joey> - This heroin is still good. </joey>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - To bring some positivity back into the podcast though. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause we need that. </joey>
<joey> - What? - Heroin. </joey>
<joey> - [Mayline] Like the drug? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, heroin is a drug Mayline, yeah. </connor>
<joey> That was the joke. </joey>
<connor> The joke is that heroin is better than all those things. </connor>
<joey> - Confirmed, Mayline doesn't count heroin as a drug. </joey>
<garnt> - [Mayline] Like heroin, like, you know, character. </garnt>
<joey> - No, not a he... </joey>
<joey> No. - No. </joey>
<connor> - Mayline's equally as tired as us. </connor>
<connor> - Going down a pint of- </connor>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - A pint of cocaine. </connor>
<connor> - Yes to bring some positivity back into the podcast. </connor>
<connor> We got spare... </connor>
<garnt> We were send something super special this week. </garnt>
<connor> - Did we? </connor>
<connor> - I guess we did. </connor>
<connor> - Bring it out onto the table. </connor>
<connor> - On the sub Reddit and the Twitters, this post blew up </connor>
<joey> that somebody made a nice little a quilt for us. </joey>
<joey> Actually, I think it's actually a quite large. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's a large. </joey>
<joey> There was also a letter included from Shelby, </joey>
<connor> I believe, right? </connor>
<connor> - Shelby from Cali, yes. </connor>
<garnt> - I did read it, Shelby. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we did read it. </garnt>
<connor> We're not gonna read it out on the podcast, </connor>
<connor> but it was- </connor>
<joey> - Tear that boy open, boy. </joey>
<joey> - We read it though, all right. </joey>
<joey> - So I think there's different gifts for different people. </joey>
<joey> Oh, I mean, I assume this is the- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, this is the main. </connor>
<joey> - Well, while you guys opening that, </joey>
<garnt> I'll just go ahead and explain. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't have a PO box and we probably won't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've had a PO box before and although it is great </garnt>
<connor> receiving stuff, it's also equally frustrating </connor>
<connor> figuring out what the to do with all the stuff </connor>
<connor> that you get sent. </connor>
<connor> And I have so much food go stale on me, </connor>
<connor> so much fruit go bad. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like opening PO box is kind of like, </garnt>
<joey> you know, like opening your first discord, right? </joey>
<joey> It's sounds great in theory. </joey>
<connor> But then when you get to a point where you get sent </connor>
<connor> too much stuff that it's manageable. </connor>
<connor> That's when it becomes a second job basically. </connor>
<connor> - We are like super grateful that people </connor>
<connor> who wanna send me stuff- </connor>
<connor> - But that doesn't mean we're not grateful. </connor>
<connor> We know you guys wanna send us stuff </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<joey> Just at this point, we just want less things to manage, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yes, its the worse thing to worry about. </joey>
<joey> - But like when we see something cool like this </joey>
<joey> like get posted on a radio or something </joey>
<garnt> we just wanna see- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Holy fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh shit. - Jesus. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Holy shit that's huge. </connor>
<connor> That's the wrong way around. </connor>
<connor> - The wrong way round. </connor>
<connor> - Holy fuck, that's confidential. </connor>
<connor> Audio users can take that out of context if you like. </connor>
<connor> Wow, that is... </connor>

<connor> is just a giant Trash Taste quilt. </connor>
