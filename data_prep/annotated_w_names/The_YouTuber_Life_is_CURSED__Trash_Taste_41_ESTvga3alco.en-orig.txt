<garnt> the thing about this like frail asian </garnt>
<garnt> kid wearing a beanie walking around you </garnt>
<garnt> look like a [ __ ] cancer patient </garnt>
<garnt> so i was like i'm tired of this i want </garnt>
<garnt> to change my style right </garnt>
<garnt> there right so i went for the skinhead </garnt>
<joey> look i looked like a complete </joey>
<joey> i look like i just came out of prison </joey>
<garnt> man </garnt>
<garnt> hello and welcome to another episode of </garnt>
<garnt> the trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> podcast i am your host for today gant </garnt>
<joey> that is a real name i can assure you and </joey>
<joey> i'm joined today </joey>
<joey> with my co-host connor and joey the ones </joey>
<joey> with the real names </joey>
<garnt> the the actual real name the actual real </garnt>
<connor> name the whitest man on earth </connor>
<garnt> so by the time this comes out this would </garnt>
<garnt> have been very old by now but we haven't </garnt>
<joey> really got a chance to have </joey>
<joey> had a real debrief on our cycling </joey>
<joey> special oh yeah </joey>
<joey> um because we we filmed an outro and </joey>
<connor> that turned out to be 26 minutes or </connor>
<connor> something like that and we were just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> yeah originally and people we were like </connor>
<garnt> people don't want to hear us talk about </garnt>
<garnt> a special thing by the way </garnt>
<connor> if you haven't watched the cycling </connor>
<garnt> special you should go and do that before </garnt>
<garnt> we we're going to talk he's talking </garnt>
<connor> about that video so if you want to watch </connor>
<garnt> that link down below or </garnt>
<garnt> on screen now but um i think the biggest </garnt>
<connor> thing i mean obviously the reaction for </connor>
<connor> that has been absolutely </connor>
<connor> incredible but what i found funny was </connor>
<connor> how seriously people took when it came </connor>
<garnt> to </garnt>
<garnt> discussing who won and who lost and who </garnt>
<garnt> cheated </garnt>
<garnt> in that cycling special there was i've </garnt>
<joey> never seen </joey>
<joey> like our subreddit turn into like just </joey>
<joey> the most like </joey>
<garnt> no you don't it was a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> free-for-all for a good </garnt>
<garnt> for a good period of time there it was </garnt>
<joey> it was like it was like a [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> team guard </joey>
<garnt> and joey versus team connor battle is </garnt>
<garnt> this how the twilight fandom were in </garnt>
<connor> their prime </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean i get it you know they they </connor>
<garnt> they're invested they're investing which </garnt>
<garnt> is good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah but i mean okay i think i i'm </garnt>
<garnt> very like i'm very fake salty like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> always like </garnt>
<garnt> fake i think we are all fake salty and </garnt>
<garnt> fake but like in real life as well i'll </garnt>
<garnt> get like i'll start like getting like </garnt>
<connor> i'll sound like loud i'm like yo this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up and then i'll be like well you </connor>
<connor> you really can't like no no not really </connor>
<connor> i just like getting annoyed about things </connor>
<connor> in a way that isn't like that's very </connor>
<connor> twitter </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah british very british it's </connor>
<joey> like this is i can't believe this </joey>
<connor> oh my god really like i don't know [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> i mean like you know </joey>
<joey> the chili i was like at the moment i'm </joey>
<connor> sure when i found out you cheated i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] and then i probably just </connor>
<connor> thought like all right yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> but then obviously </connor>
<connor> because there's also clips of like me </connor>
<connor> talking about on my live stream but </connor>
<joey> obviously like i play up the saltiness </joey>
<joey> because i have you know it's good </joey>
<connor> showmanship you know </connor>
<joey> but it's unfortunate that like a large </joey>
<joey> majority of the internet doesn't </joey>
<connor> understand sarcasm there was </connor>
<connor> so i there was a there was like enough </connor>
<connor> subreddit people discussing </connor>
<connor> yeah who cheated who really won the real </connor>
<joey> world who done it </joey>
<joey> there was this one comment i can't </joey>
<joey> remember where it was called but they </joey>
<joey> were like it was like big man connor </joey>
<connor> cahoon </connor>
<connor> thinks he's a real winner real chad huh </connor>
<connor> calling his friends </connor>
<connor> cheetahs when he cheated he was getting </connor>
<connor> so angry about it and i was like what </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> it was just so funny seeing how like the </joey>
<joey> fact that </joey>
<joey> there were so many people who are </joey>
<joey> infinitely more saltier than we are like </joey>
<connor> we didn't give a [ __ ] it's like to us </connor>
<connor> it's you know we make the video we film </connor>
<connor> it yeah yeah if someone cheats you know </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> and it makes for good content it makes </connor>
<garnt> for good content yeah yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> originally i remember going on a cycling </garnt>
<garnt> special i i think i i </garnt>
<garnt> this this got cut out the uh video but i </garnt>
<connor> remember telling connor </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm gonna do the whole thing </connor>
<connor> because you know </connor>
<connor> i'll feel good if i do the whole thing </connor>
<connor> yeah and so the fourth challenge </connor>
<connor> happened </connor>
<connor> and then joey suggested the cheating and </connor>
<joey> i just thought to myself </joey>
<joey> that'll make for a really funny segment </joey>
<joey> if we do actually that's exactly what it </joey>
<connor> was it's like yeah </connor>
<connor> you know saying that oh i wanted to take </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] free car ride like you know </connor>
<connor> i'd be lying if i say i didn't want that </connor>
<connor> but ultimately i was like no no let's do </connor>
<joey> this because it'll make for great </joey>
<connor> content and it did it's not it's not </connor>
<connor> about the race it was about </connor>
<garnt> friendship it was it wasn't about it it </garnt>
<garnt> was about the friends we lost along the </garnt>
<joey> way </joey>
<joey> which is apparently each other very true </joey>
<garnt> no because like i i feel like you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's there's there's a difference </garnt>
<garnt> between </garnt>
<garnt> obviously none of their scripted which </garnt>
<garnt> you know it's it we don't script what </garnt>
<garnt> happens on the specials but we we are </garnt>
<garnt> still </garnt>
<garnt> you know we we are we do still have that </garnt>
<garnt> my that voice in the back of our head </garnt>
<garnt> that says this is going to be content </garnt>
<garnt> people are going to watch this for </garnt>
<joey> entertainment </joey>
<joey> because let's be real like you know </joey>
<joey> there was a part of me that was like </joey>
<joey> you know i'm sure there will be some </joey>
<joey> level of entertainment factor if </joey>
<joey> hypothetically all three of us with no </joey>
<joey> accidents whatsoever </joey>
<joey> completed everything from start to </joey>
<joey> finish but you know it's the little bits </joey>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> unexpected drama that makes for an </joey>
<garnt> interesting drama it's the banter i i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like that's what makes for the </garnt>
<garnt> interesting video </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like part of this discussion it's </garnt>
<joey> it's like we </joey>
<joey> we laugh at it because we know we didn't </joey>
<joey> take it seriously but i'm glad people </joey>
<joey> are that invested in our content to </joey>
<joey> really go </joey>
<joey> balls deep to really like break down the </joey>
<joey> levels of cheating </joey>
<joey> yeah and like okay i had like i i swear </joey>
<joey> some people could make a spreadsheet </joey>
<garnt> of like every little thing that like </garnt>
<joey> there's like thesis papers </joey>
<joey> like the dream cheating thing yeah </joey>
<joey> who cheated technically there's a one in </joey>
<joey> seven trillion chance that </joey>
<joey> god's chain would break at that very </joey>
<joey> moment </joey>
<connor> there was one comment there's like why </connor>
<connor> didn't gon just put the chain back on i </connor>
<connor> did think that i was like with the god </connor>
<connor> why didn't god put the chain back </connor>
<garnt> actually </garnt>
<garnt> this wasn't uh there's a lot of my you </garnt>
<garnt> know trying to fix the chain did get cut </garnt>
<joey> out but it was like </joey>
<joey> completely lodged in there so yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> like uh the three the reason you were </joey>
<joey> waiting so long for us was because i was </joey>
<joey> like trying to unlodge this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> chain </joey>
<joey> and then like i got it back on and then </joey>
<joey> it came off again immediately and i </joey>
<joey> was trying to figure out what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> was wrong with my bike so i had this </joey>
<joey> like half an hour to 45 minutes </joey>
<joey> where i realized that i had gone the </joey>
<joey> entire cycle </joey>
<joey> without uh without first gear so so </joey>
<joey> the reason the reason the chain came off </joey>
<joey> was because when i went went to </joey>
<connor> um the highest it just slipped off um </connor>
<connor> yeah these bikes were very cheap and </connor>
<connor> like i i realized why i was suffering </connor>
<joey> so much now on the [ __ ] hills was </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> i i was in second gear the entire way um </joey>
<joey> i also love though how like there was so </joey>
<joey> many comments even on the video being </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> oh man their seats are too low their </joey>
<joey> bikes are too small it's like </joey>
<garnt> look that was the biggest bikes they had </garnt>
<garnt> those were the biggest bikes and i think </garnt>
<joey> i did adjust my seats to be the highest </joey>
<joey> so the highest </joey>
<joey> um because these people are designed for </joey>
<joey> japanese people by far </joey>
<joey> because these we didn't buy the bikes </joey>
<garnt> there were the rental bikes from the </garnt>
<connor> lake because we had a place to </connor>
<connor> fly to the other side of the country </connor>
<joey> yeah so we couldn't bring these bikes </joey>
<joey> we're definitely not suited for six foot </joey>
<connor> foreigners that's for sure </connor>
<connor> speak for yourself five foot gang over </connor>
<joey> here </joey>
<connor> even but even for your size it was </connor>
<connor> smaller that was just </connor>
<connor> maybe okay for me but like i'm really </connor>
<joey> pushing it like yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> because i remember i put my seat all the </connor>
<joey> way to the top i was like oh no this is </joey>
<joey> the highest it goes i'm gonna [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> okay we're pretty [ __ ] dumb right </connor>
<joey> yeah we're not we're not that dumb </joey>
<joey> like i saw comments that were also like </joey>
<connor> they did they even use any gears i'm </connor>
<connor> like bro </connor>
<connor> you'd know i can't you wouldn't know if </connor>
<connor> we didn't change gear because god would </connor>
<connor> not be moving up anything </connor>
<connor> else i think god could pedal at six gear </connor>
<garnt> up a hill i was already suffering enough </garnt>
<garnt> on second gear let alone [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> some people pretend like it was the </joey>
<joey> first time we ever saw a bicycle with </joey>
<joey> gears </joey>
<joey> like that day it's like what what are </joey>
<garnt> these things let's just leave it alone </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't realize until i saw the footage </garnt>
<joey> actually how much of a </joey>
<joey> how much of a clown i looked with like </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] bike </joey>
<joey> with my massive legs just like just like </joey>
<joey> pedaling along you're basically on like </joey>
<joey> one of those like you know the kid bikes </joey>
<connor> like young and like sitting there the </connor>
<connor> feet are going </connor>
<connor> oh man that dude squats every time i'm </connor>
<joey> glad people enjoyed it but man </joey>
<joey> just it's not that serious guys it was </joey>
<garnt> just it was just a little bit of i mean </garnt>
<connor> there was a lot of there was a lot of </connor>
<connor> like fluff that got cut out shout out to </connor>
<connor> mudan </connor>
<connor> for editing that and going through jesus </connor>
<joey> how much footage </joey>
<joey> like 100 hours between us because it was </joey>
<connor> like we had </connor>
<connor> the six gopros it was like one terabyte </connor>
<connor> of footage </connor>
<connor> we had six gopros for so two gopros </connor>
<connor> between each of us and then also the </connor>
<connor> handycams and whatever and the gopro in </connor>
<connor> the camera uh the gopro and the car as </connor>
<connor> well which is </connor>
<connor> that's why it took so long we filmed </connor>
<connor> that in october that's why </connor>
<garnt> the production took so long for our next </garnt>
<garnt> special we </garnt>
<garnt> probably won't like scale up until we </garnt>
<garnt> have like a super super big idea maybe </garnt>
<garnt> try something a bit smaller you know </garnt>
<joey> yeah i feel like at this rate it's just </joey>
<joey> gonna get like bigger </joey>
<joey> it's going to turn into like a mr beast </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah if we don't scale back a </connor>
<joey> little bit i mean because we're the ones </joey>
<joey> mainly arranging this as well so we have </joey>
<connor> to come up with all the equipment we </connor>
<connor> need </connor>
<connor> to figure everything out and so like </connor>
<garnt> it's quite it's quite a lot to do it for </garnt>
<garnt> us like i i kind of realized this when </garnt>
<garnt> uh we were doing the thing and then </garnt>
<garnt> connor's </garnt>
<garnt> tire popped and every comment was just </garnt>
<garnt> like wow </garnt>
<garnt> i can't believe they didn't plan for </garnt>
<garnt> like a spare tire or something like that </garnt>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> yeah in hindsight it sounds [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> stupid doesn't it </joey>
<joey> but you have to understand that most of </joey>
<joey> our planning went into </joey>
<joey> how the [ __ ] are we going to power six </joey>
<joey> gopros yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> on our bicycles when we have one car and </joey>
<joey> none of us near each other yeah </joey>
<joey> so we we were trying to figure out the </joey>
<joey> logistics of trying to get this filmed </joey>
<garnt> and that's where the last thing we were </garnt>
<joey> expecting was a pop-tart yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> these bikes were like extra heavy </connor>
<connor> because we had like duct tape the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> out of stuff to it like there was like </connor>
<joey> portable batteries </joey>
<connor> strapped to these like a break just to </connor>
<connor> like keep the gopro and also gopros are </connor>
<joey> such </joey>
<joey> fickle things they're amazing when they </joey>
<joey> work but the moment like there's any </joey>
<connor> heat </connor>
<connor> they just stop working yeah because we </connor>
<connor> realized this during the drifting </connor>
<connor> special because </connor>
<connor> people look at this content and think </connor>
<connor> they they don't see the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> effort and logistics that goes into this </garnt>
<garnt> because i didn't think about this until </garnt>
<joey> i had to go out and film it they just </joey>
<joey> think oh just buy some cameras and </joey>
<garnt> attach it yeah so with the with the </garnt>
<garnt> drifting special a lot of connor's </garnt>
<connor> footage just got lost yeah so like it's </connor>
<connor> a shame because like </connor>
<connor> the when i was doing like the sick </connor>
<connor> doughnuts like all of that footage was </connor>
<joey> lost because the gopro just </joey>
<joey> overheated in like five minutes 100 </joey>
<joey> degrees yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah it's an oven in that thing and mine </connor>
<joey> turned off luckily your guys has worked </joey>
<joey> mine kept dying in the second half yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah it just sucked because like all you </connor>
<connor> get to see is an outside shot it doesn't </connor>
<connor> even look like i'm in the car doing the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] thing and you missed all like me </joey>
<joey> getting [ __ ] hyped screaming </joey>
<connor> spoiler it was a stunt dog yeah exactly </connor>
<garnt> like it looks like it could look like a </garnt>
<connor> stunt dog yeah it's so sad i'm like </connor>
<garnt> that's my trip </garnt>
<garnt> like i recently watched this horror </garnt>
<garnt> movie with sydney i don't remember the </garnt>
<garnt> name it's a korean horror movie right </garnt>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> the premise of this horror movie is that </garnt>
<garnt> there's this company who basically does </garnt>
<garnt> live stream content </garnt>
<garnt> right and so this company hires a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> of </garnt>
<garnt> people from the public to live stream </garnt>
<joey> going into this like </joey>
<joey> haunted haunted asylum and you know live </joey>
<joey> streaming their experiences there </joey>
<joey> um and so i was watching this movie and </joey>
<joey> they </joey>
<joey> they had this like jank set up with some </joey>
<joey> gopros that are apparently like live </joey>
<joey> streaming to this base camp that was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> like a literal camp that they had set up </joey>
<joey> outside this mental asylum right yeah </joey>
<joey> and when i was watching this i couldn't </joey>
<joey> get invested in the movie because i felt </joey>
<joey> like that guy doing like </joey>
<joey> youtuber reacts to youtuber movies right </joey>
<joey> and all i could see in the back of my </joey>
<joey> head was </joey>
<joey> they these gopros don't even have any </joey>
<joey> spare cameras [ __ ] lie there they </joey>
<joey> were like live streaming for five hours </joey>
<joey> or something like that two out of ten </joey>
<connor> not really yeah yeah there's no way that </connor>
<connor> would work also </connor>
<connor> how are they getting signal in this </connor>
<joey> mental asylum there's no way the stream </joey>
<joey> would be this clean </joey>
<joey> while they were streaming places inside </joey>
<joey> backpacks exactly </joey>
<joey> they didn't even have the [ __ ] 5g </joey>
<garnt> twitch backpacks like this is </garnt>
<garnt> fake movie two out of ten </garnt>
<joey> oh my god i mean i'd like to do </joey>
<joey> something like that but like just you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] effort it would take to just </joey>
<joey> try and organize the technicalities </joey>
<joey> behind that just sounds like a nightmare </joey>
<garnt> in and of itself </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean to me twitch uh like irl </garnt>
<garnt> streamers are just built different i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<connor> like i don't know i think you have to be </connor>
<joey> an another level of like masochist </joey>
<joey> yeah i think i i to me it seems like why </joey>
<joey> would you want to be embarrassed in </joey>
<garnt> public </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah like constantly yeah i don't </joey>
<garnt> mind doing it for a video every now and </garnt>
<garnt> then yeah but like </garnt>
<garnt> having it constantly on because at least </garnt>
<connor> in a video </connor>
<connor> when you're out there filming when </connor>
<connor> you're out and about there filming at </connor>
<connor> least you can like edit it so it's the </connor>
<connor> most </connor>
<connor> interesting things that happened on the </connor>
<connor> day but if it's an irl stream </connor>
<connor> you see everything and i'm just and it's </connor>
<connor> just especially </connor>
<connor> when you're not even even in the safety </connor>
<connor> of your own home either you're out there </connor>
<connor> in public people can see you people can </connor>
<garnt> judge you </garnt>
<garnt> and to me that's just a level of like </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's the dystopian future that </garnt>
<garnt> i i don't want in my life </garnt>
<joey> i don't know yeah i've gone wrong yeah i </joey>
<joey> was saying like not to mention like </joey>
<joey> in japan especially where people are </joey>
<joey> already [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> way too wary about filming in public </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> yeah i i don't know how you can just </joey>
<joey> like rock up to an izakaya full of </joey>
<joey> people and just be like yeah i'm just </joey>
<joey> gonna put this camera here and just </joey>
<garnt> start talking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i i i don't know i don't i </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't do that either i don't know i </garnt>
<garnt> haven't tried it but like </garnt>
<garnt> i i don't know how it i would get over </garnt>
<garnt> that mental barrier </garnt>
<garnt> of just going going to around </garnt>
<garnt> restaurants like having the phone in </garnt>
<garnt> front of me and just talking to the </garnt>
<connor> phone now i'm too british i can't do </connor>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> the thought of going into just a place </garnt>
<connor> and doing that is like what like just </connor>
<joey> like on the street as well like </joey>
<connor> i don't get how like like j vloggers for </connor>
<connor> instance can like just be walking on the </connor>
<connor> streets by themselves </connor>
<connor> just have a camera like this and being </connor>
<connor> late all right guys so we're going to go </connor>
<joey> to blah blah blah and just </joey>
<joey> have people staring at you i've done </joey>
<connor> that it looks like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hostage video i'm like [ __ ] talking </connor>
<connor> down to the camera like yeah like i i i </connor>
<joey> wouldn't go like </joey>
<joey> some people just like yeah hello hello </joey>
<connor> the giant selfie stick outwards this is </connor>
<connor> everyone in ikebukuro right now </connor>
<connor> check it out like i don't know i mean to </connor>
<connor> me it's like you know and i watch some </connor>
<connor> of these irl streams except i'm quite </connor>
<connor> interested in it myself and i think yeah </connor>
<connor> like oh maybe i could do it sometime but </connor>
<connor> then </connor>
<connor> you know when i watch it i'm like okay </connor>
<connor> cool they did like one cool thing in the </connor>
<joey> day </joey>
<joey> and the rest of it like a lot of the </joey>
<joey> time they were just being like sitting </joey>
<joey> there asking their chat like what do you </joey>
<joey> guys want to do </joey>
<joey> you just want to do what should we do </joey>
<joey> guys and it's like all right and then </joey>
<joey> anybody get what the appeal was because </joey>
<joey> most of the time </joey>
<joey> real life's pretty [ __ ] boring you're </joey>
<joey> just like traveling or waiting </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly i think though in this day </joey>
<joey> and age i feel it's a type of content </joey>
<connor> that is like really small </connor>
<connor> yeah maybe right now i can understand </connor>
<connor> that but before that i'm like why would </connor>
<connor> you want to watch someone just kind of </connor>
<connor> like wait </connor>
<connor> and sit around all day and maybe do </connor>
<connor> something interesting for one hour </connor>
<joey> because </joey>
<garnt> it's like you're really there i i get it </garnt>
<garnt> in covert times isn't this some kind of </garnt>
<connor> like black mirror-esque [ __ ] that we're </connor>
<connor> getting on though like </connor>
<garnt> i just want i don't want to have a day </garnt>
<connor> myself i'm gonna watch someone else have </connor>
<connor> a day </connor>
<connor> and i'm going to give them money it's </connor>
<joey> literally that [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> image of you know that kid sitting in </connor>
<joey> front of like the the poster and being </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> every podcast be like that just keeps </joey>
<joey> getting posted on our subreddit </joey>
<joey> yeah that's really what that is cause </joey>
<joey> like for me like i i feel awkward </joey>
<connor> if i have a hands-free set and i'm just </connor>
<connor> in public </connor>
<connor> and i'm on the phone like sometimes i </connor>
<connor> have hands-free set and i have the phone </connor>
<joey> up to my face </joey>
<joey> to look like i'm talking on the phone </joey>
<joey> yeah as opposed to exactly supposed to </joey>
<joey> talking to myself i don't know yeah </joey>
<joey> because the other day uh </joey>
<joey> i had to go buy like some uh some like </joey>
<connor> eyelashes for archie </connor>
<connor> so i went to like the local was it this </connor>
<connor> one yeah no yeah the local pharmacy and </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i don't know which one she wants so </connor>
<connor> so i tried to like </connor>
<connor> you know take some pictures and send up </connor>
<connor> being like yeah pick out which one it is </connor>
<connor> and she just [ __ ] calls me and it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> just show me so i had to like flip the </connor>
<connor> camera and i'm just i'm just doing this </connor>
<joey> while talking on a hands-free set and </joey>
<joey> these old women are looking at me like </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is this guy doing </connor>
<connor> like that they probably understand </connor>
<joey> filming eyelashes </joey>
<joey> and being like which one i don't know </joey>
<connor> why i find like </connor>
<connor> only irl content is where it feels a </connor>
<connor> little black mirrory to me a little </connor>
<connor> weird i don't know why like </connor>
<connor> no other type of content makes me feel </connor>
<connor> in that weird kind of </connor>
<connor> this is like no other content makes you </connor>
<connor> feel like this is too far </connor>
<connor> like irl just some something about it </connor>
<connor> sometimes i'm watching it i'm like </connor>
<joey> well because like i feel that like if </joey>
<joey> you stream in like say a studio like </joey>
<joey> this right </joey>
<joey> there's like a performative side to it </joey>
<joey> it's almost like a stage or like a setup </joey>
<garnt> like like there is literal sets that we </garnt>
<joey> perform in like yes yeah </joey>
<joey> but sitting down for like three hours at </joey>
<joey> an izakaya while like having a casual </joey>
<connor> beer it's a little too realistic </connor>
<connor> as well like i saw a lot of them like a </connor>
<joey> lot of them get like drunk a lot of the </joey>
<joey> time and that's like the audience </joey>
<joey> loves that oh yeah they love it when </joey>
<joey> they get drunk because they're like oh </joey>
<joey> they could [ __ ] up they could say </joey>
<joey> stuff like so the audience constantly </joey>
<joey> eggs them into drinking yeah people are </joey>
<joey> like waiting for the next like stream </joey>
<joey> and i'm like i'm like [ __ ] is that </joey>
<connor> that's a horrible relationship to have </connor>
<connor> your viewers where they just want to see </connor>
<connor> you [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] everything that's probably yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i i feel like even though </garnt>
<garnt> even though you're it's an irl stream </garnt>
<garnt> you know when we're streaming we do have </garnt>
<connor> this performative side to us that we </connor>
<connor> just talked about um that we feel like </connor>
<connor> we want to be </connor>
<connor> we want something interesting to happen </connor>
<connor> or we at least want an interesting </connor>
<connor> conversation to happen </connor>
<connor> so i feel like it's a very i </connor>
<garnt> i don't know like unhealthy kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> relationship to have with your viewers </garnt>
<garnt> at that point because your your best </garnt>
<garnt> interest </garnt>
<garnt> is for something to happen so you are in </garnt>
<garnt> this performative side and i've talked </garnt>
<garnt> to a few irl streamers who </garnt>
<garnt> have done things on their streams which </garnt>
<garnt> they probably wouldn't have done if </garnt>
<garnt> you know nobody is watching right yeah </garnt>
<connor> you definitely get that like fake </connor>
<joey> confidence yeah yeah stream watching you </joey>
<joey> i mean isn't that where like the whole </joey>
<connor> generalization of like </connor>
<connor> you know fan bases of ireland streamers </connor>
<connor> being like </connor>
<connor> they're pretty [ __ ] toxic yeah like i </connor>
<connor> i know a couple of viral streams in </connor>
<connor> japan as well and you know they're all </connor>
<connor> lovely people </connor>
<connor> yeah you know off stream yeah but i </connor>
<joey> think it's because of the fact that they </joey>
<joey> have this really </joey>
<joey> toxic and you know quite aggressive type </joey>
<joey> of audience that loves to egg them on to </joey>
<joey> make them do </joey>
<joey> stupid [ __ ] or you know fail in some way </joey>
<joey> that they kind of get </joey>
<joey> dragged into that yeah you know hate to </joey>
<joey> say it </joey>
<joey> a lot of them on stream turn into a bit </joey>
<joey> of an [ __ ] but that's also because </joey>
<joey> you know you have thousands sometimes </joey>
<joey> tens of thousands of people being like </joey>
<joey> yo </joey>
<joey> do this thing that makes you look like </joey>
<connor> an [ __ ] for our entertainment yeah </connor>
<joey> it's kind of unfortunate because it's </joey>
<joey> like a you know if you're being an </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> you know but your audience is enjoying </connor>
<connor> it and the egging you on you could you </connor>
<connor> can almost get lost in the fact that </connor>
<connor> no i don't think i'm being an [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> think i'm being entertaining right right </connor>
<joey> right i think so but then you know you </joey>
<joey> see them when you talk to them one on </joey>
<garnt> one you realize </garnt>
<garnt> oh they're actually quite normal nothing </garnt>
<joey> like they are nothing like this they're </joey>
<connor> really nice most of the time i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> maybe i'm over generalizing i don't know </connor>
<connor> i haven't met many but the ones i have </connor>
<connor> met are very different to how they act </connor>
<joey> on stream </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean yeah i only really know </joey>
<joey> like a few who are like exactly the same </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<garnt> that's i feel it's a rare breed yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but i i feel i i completely agree </garnt>
<garnt> with you with like irl stream content </garnt>
<garnt> being </garnt>
<garnt> the black mirror kind of content as </garnt>
<joey> opposed to any other </joey>
<joey> stream kind of content in my opinion and </joey>
<joey> i'm not sure why maybe it's because </joey>
<joey> it's you it literally is like kind of </joey>
<garnt> like a slice of life where it's </garnt>
<joey> it feels a bit too intimate i feel </joey>
<joey> especially when it's those irl streams </joey>
<joey> where it's like it's not the camera </joey>
<joey> pointing at the person but it's like </joey>
<joey> shot in pov </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah like that [ __ ] especially it's </joey>
<joey> like whoa </joey>
<connor> it's just weird it's just it just makes </connor>
<joey> you think like where's it gonna go from </joey>
<connor> here like what's the next step because </connor>
<connor> it's gonna be a next step and like i'm </connor>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> it's only going to one-up itself yeah </garnt>
<connor> which is why i'm like i wonder where </connor>
<connor> it's going to go </connor>
<joey> like it's just it's really interesting </joey>
<joey> streaming my wife's pregnancy </joey>
<connor> kind of scary honestly i i i i could see </connor>
<garnt> that happening </garnt>
<joey> screaming my child's birth </joey>
<joey> streaming my child's conception dad </joey>
<joey> reacts to child birth well </joey>
<joey> it's like those [ __ ] oh there it is </joey>
<connor> there are those families on youtube that </connor>
<connor> have like more kids because </connor>
<connor> more kids is more clickbait pregnancy </connor>
<garnt> oh my god i just got reminded of that </garnt>
<connor> video you found the other day connor </connor>
<connor> about the uh </connor>
<joey> the uh what's up what's in your bum </joey>

<joey> i'm scared yeah going back to the uh </joey>
<joey> cycling special yeah so we've i mean </joey>
<joey> we've </joey>
<joey> it's funny how we've talked about </joey>
<connor> like online privacy so so much on this </connor>
<connor> podcast </connor>
<connor> yeah we've talked about it a lot and </connor>
<joey> sometimes i feel like we're you know </joey>
<joey> beating a dead horse because we're just </joey>
<joey> like yeah you know we we have a lot of </joey>
<joey> crazy stories </joey>
<joey> yeah um so it kind of surprises me when </joey>
<joey> there are still some people </joey>
<connor> out there despite how many times we've </connor>
<connor> talked about it </connor>
<connor> we'll do some uh not pretty pretty not </connor>
<connor> cool stuff yeah i mean uh </connor>
<connor> so if if you haven't been following my </connor>
<joey> twitter so yeah someone </joey>
<joey> someone tried to leak some monk photos </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<connor> i had which were private on my mum's </connor>
<connor> facebook and yeah </connor>
<connor> uh i mean i i said this i said this on </connor>
<connor> my twitter longer but you know i </connor>
<connor> i purposely didn't release it because </connor>
<connor> you know it's i'm fine people </connor>
<connor> knowing that i was a monk and meaning </connor>
<connor> that aspect just you know </connor>
<connor> meaning the knowledge or whatever but i </connor>
<connor> was just like i i kept </connor>
<connor> that part private because you know there </connor>
<connor> are like quite intimate photos it's like </connor>
<connor> a </connor>
<garnt> religious ceremony so i didn't i didn't </garnt>
<connor> want that part of my life there i mean </connor>
<connor> because when you initially told the </connor>
<garnt> story i remember after it you were like </garnt>
<connor> yeah boys i don't want to show a photo </connor>
<joey> i'm pretty sure he said it on the clip </joey>
<connor> did you like i'm pretty sure on the clip </connor>
<connor> we were like i think one of us said like </connor>
<joey> oh we'll put the pictures and then god </joey>
<joey> was like no i don't want to put the </joey>
<garnt> pictures oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think i might have said that it's been </garnt>
<connor> a while it's been a while </connor>
<connor> i remember being like you didn't want to </connor>
<garnt> share the pictures we were like yeah i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just sure whatever i understand what </garnt>
<connor> happened </connor>
<connor> yeah and you know it's become a meme i'm </connor>
<connor> completely fine with you know being the </connor>
<connor> monk has become a meme </connor>
<connor> but uh yeah someone someone literally </connor>
<connor> stalked my mum's facebook </connor>
<connor> um which you know it's there's there's </connor>
<connor> there's a difference between you know if </connor>
<connor> i [ __ ] up and you know i </connor>
<connor> there's some part of my private life </connor>
<connor> that you know i forgot to private you </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> it's still an [ __ ] move but you know </joey>
<connor> as a public figure you can expect that </connor>
<joey> people are going to try and dig into </joey>
<joey> your past everything like that just </joey>
<joey> in and of itself yeah yeah i mean it's </joey>
<connor> you know we can talk about that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that you know we kind of had to </connor>
<connor> expect that but you kind of do have to </connor>
<connor> expect that but </connor>
<connor> it just felt dirty that someone tried to </connor>
<garnt> stalk my family especially like my close </garnt>
<joey> family yeah </joey>
<joey> that's actually [ __ ] yeah it's pretty </joey>
<garnt> funny and like these are really old </garnt>
<garnt> pictures as well so they would have had </garnt>
<garnt> to go back </garnt>
<joey> years and years worth of like my mom's </joey>
<joey> pictures that she had so creepy to think </joey>
<joey> someone's just scrolling </joey>
<connor> i don't know and and like all this all </connor>
<connor> this for a meme </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like that thanos mean </connor>
<garnt> like all this for like a single meme </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> as well the person knew that they were </garnt>
<connor> being scummy as well yeah they even like </connor>
<joey> self-admitted that they were like </joey>
<joey> yeah i know this is scummy lol it's like </joey>
<garnt> nah </garnt>
<garnt> because i i feel like you know we i mean </garnt>
<garnt> we literally talked about this last week </garnt>
<garnt> where you know the </garnt>
<joey> the barrier of privacy between reality </joey>
<joey> and what's entertainment is like slowly </joey>
<joey> slowly </joey>
<joey> drifting apart and slowly being erased </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<garnt> i don't know it feels weird finally </garnt>
<garnt> experiencing that for myself </garnt>
<connor> and being in the crossfire yeah it sucks </connor>
<connor> i mean i i'd like to tell my parents i </connor>
<connor> was like you know </connor>
<connor> because luckily my parents you know </connor>
<connor> they're mega boomers </connor>
<connor> so they they think that facebook is the </connor>
<connor> play can always has people yeah so they </connor>
<connor> never signed up to it </connor>
<connor> yeah um but i still have to tell them </connor>
<connor> like listen if anyone asks you questions </connor>
<connor> about me </connor>
<connor> or like anything private about me and </connor>
<connor> tries to get anything just tell them </connor>
<connor> like okay </connor>
<joey> don't answer it just tell them to ask me </joey>
<joey> like if if </joey>
<joey> even if it's like you know like someone </joey>
<joey> claiming to be like a government agency </joey>
<connor> which like i think somebody </connor>
<connor> i remember who called them up and asked </connor>
<connor> somehow got my parents number or </connor>
<connor> something and i'm like trying to ask </connor>
<connor> them questions about me and i was like </connor>
<connor> don't don't answer anything </connor>
<connor> just you know if the police want me the </connor>
<connor> police will find me right i mean like </connor>
<connor> yeah anyone who claims to be anything </connor>
<joey> don't [ __ ] tell them anything </joey>
<connor> it's sad that you have to do that right </connor>
<connor> yeah like the thought i think it's just </connor>
<joey> really sad </joey>
<joey> that i would rather be harassed like a </joey>
<joey> hundred times personally </joey>
<joey> than my parents be harassed once yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah you know what i mean like i just </joey>
<joey> couldn't because </joey>
<joey> they've got nothing to do with it why </joey>
<joey> did they have to get involved right it's </joey>
<joey> hard enough raising me as it was right </joey>
<joey> like let alone </joey>
<connor> the little [ __ ] that you are the little </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] that i was you know it's hard </joey>
<connor> enough </connor>
<garnt> i don't want to have to give them extra </garnt>
<garnt> work after yeah he's trying to enjoy </garnt>
<garnt> retirement you know so </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it's been kind of funny seeing </garnt>
<connor> the transition between </connor>
<connor> like my parents at least because my </connor>
<connor> parents like really technologically </connor>
<connor> illiterate </connor>
<connor> and i've had to basically teach them </connor>
<connor> everything but it's been funny seeing </connor>
<connor> the transition between them </connor>
<connor> like not understanding social media at </connor>
<connor> all and just like </connor>
<connor> not using it at all and then </connor>
<connor> transitioning that to </connor>
<connor> like transitioning that to most of my </connor>
<connor> family now use facebook </connor>
<connor> right remember when facebook was just </connor>
<garnt> like a cool kids thing </garnt>
<garnt> and like the parents their parents </garnt>
<connor> didn't get it my parents </connor>
<connor> still didn't they still think it that </connor>
<garnt> way </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because it was really funny because </garnt>
<garnt> i remember one day um </garnt>
<garnt> because i you know i've you know we are </garnt>
<garnt> all grown up on the internet and </garnt>
<garnt> especially </garnt>
<garnt> i've been doing youtube and social media </garnt>
<garnt> for like a long time </garnt>
<garnt> but one day my mum phones me up um and </garnt>
<garnt> this this was </garnt>
<garnt> this was when i had stopped using </garnt>
<joey> facebook by this point i'd like most of </joey>
<joey> my online life has gone to twitter </joey>
<joey> because that's my job and everything </joey>
<joey> um but my parents had just started </joey>
<joey> really getting into facebook and you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> being being that being that parents who </joey>
<joey> you know tag tag you in everything </joey>
<joey> comment on people's photos you know </joey>
<joey> properly involved yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> and i remember she phones me up one day </joey>
<joey> and she goes </joey>
<joey> uh gant um someone left a mean </joey>
<joey> comment on one of my photos what do i do </joey>
<joey> i'm just like what do you mean mom what </joey>
<joey> what do you mean what do you do </joey>
<joey> and she's like i i don't know what to do </joey>
<joey> it makes me feel </joey>
<joey> sad i kind of want to reply and i'm just </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> mom do not do not do this do not reply </connor>
<joey> right now </joey>
<joey> do not get involved that's the one thing </joey>
<connor> you should not do </connor>
<joey> it was just funny because um because </joey>
<connor> like years ago she was like </connor>
<connor> she's like you know just just just </connor>
<connor> ignore all the mean comments online and </connor>
<connor> just don't worry about it as you know as </connor>
<connor> the parents do because you know </connor>
<connor> as someone as as a parent watching a kid </connor>
<joey> do </joey>
<joey> social media and do youtube that you </joey>
<joey> just don't get it you see comments </joey>
<joey> you're just like </joey>
<joey> these comments don't mean anything right </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but it was funny seeing </joey>
<joey> seeing my parents who had never been </joey>
<joey> into social media go through the same </joey>
<joey> cycle that we had to go </joey>
<garnt> we had to go through being like what </garnt>
<garnt> what is a mean comment why are people </garnt>
<garnt> commenting mean things on me this </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't make </garnt>
<garnt> sense you know what i'm gonna reply i'm </garnt>
<garnt> going to give the trolls everything they </garnt>
<joey> want </joey>
<joey> at least your mom wasn't like do you </joey>
<joey> know the number to the cyber police </joey>
<joey> i need to report a crime </joey>
<joey> no like my mom's like my mom's really </joey>
<joey> smart about it like because she's been </joey>
<joey> using uh </joey>
<joey> do you know about this website called </joey>
<joey> mixi i don't think it's any brand </joey>
<joey> anymore but basically it's like </joey>
<joey> it's really all web it's basically like </joey>
<joey> the old japanese version of like </joey>
<joey> uh myspace or like facebook and stuff </joey>
<joey> like that but i don't even think it's </joey>
<joey> around anymore basically my mom's been </joey>
<joey> like using that </joey>
<joey> so like she's had a pretty good </joey>
<joey> understanding of like </joey>
<joey> you know privacy can be very easily </joey>
<joey> leaked on the internet if you're not </joey>
<joey> careful </joey>
<joey> so like my mum has openly told me she's </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> yeah i follow you on twitter and </connor>
<joey> instagram but yeah you'll never know </joey>
<joey> which account is mine </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] it out that's some death note [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> she's like </joey>
<connor> like she's like because like she just </connor>
<connor> uses like you know a completely separate </connor>
<joey> name and like doesn't use any photos and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that and i'm like yeah i'm </joey>
<joey> glad that you know </joey>
<joey> she understands that you know if she </joey>
<joey> used her real face a name that could </joey>
<joey> lead to a whole lot of problems </joey>
<joey> me while my dad is like you know [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> openly comments on my videos and being </connor>
<connor> like that's my son </connor>
<connor> that's my boy no no i remember i </connor>
<connor> remember one time he's like </connor>
<connor> did you see the comment on my latest on </connor>
<connor> your latest video and i'm like </connor>
<connor> uh no i get i get thousands of comments </connor>
<connor> every day and he's like oh okay i'll </connor>
<connor> send you a screenshot of it </connor>
<connor> and it's like and he's like oh you might </connor>
<connor> have missed it because i don't use my </connor>
<connor> name on it </connor>
<connor> but instead he didn't use his name on it </connor>
<connor> right it's like a completely different </connor>
<connor> username </connor>
<connor> but i knew immediately it was my dad </connor>
<connor> because the comment starts with hey son </connor>
<joey> hey son i really like this video the </joey>
<joey> editing was done really well </joey>
<joey> it's like you'll never know it's me oh </joey>
<connor> yeah sure that's so [ __ ] wholesome i </connor>
<joey> don't know why that that's so [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hot yeah but the problem </joey>
<joey> is is that like when i was still using </joey>
<connor> facebook back in the day </connor>
<joey> yeah like you know again like my mom </joey>
<connor> would use a completely like separate </connor>
<connor> name right so like you know it was fine </connor>
<connor> or whatever but my dad </connor>
<connor> would not only use his real name but </connor>
<joey> would also comment on </joey>
<joey> every [ __ ] thing i posted always </joey>
<joey> starting with hey son </joey>
<connor> so like hey guys joey's dad here yeah </connor>
<connor> and so like and so i had to like </connor>
<garnt> and so like one day he came in being </garnt>
<garnt> like really upset at me being like </garnt>
<garnt> why did you block me on facebook son i'm </garnt>
<joey> like because you keep [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> stop commenting oh stop stop opening a </joey>
<joey> comment with hey son </joey>
<connor> your dad sounds like such a fun guy no </connor>
<joey> he's a great guy don't get me wrong but </joey>
<joey> like i had to </joey>
<joey> i had to literally block him on every </joey>
<joey> social media just because </joey>
<joey> he kept [ __ ] doing that and now the </joey>
<connor> only </connor>
<joey> the number one harasser yeah and now the </joey>
<joey> only way i can get in contact with my </joey>
<joey> dad </joey>
<connor> is get this through email </connor>
<joey> because like a number or something you </joey>
<connor> know okay like i have his number or </connor>
<connor> whatever but like you know obviously </connor>
<connor> because it's international it costs a </connor>
<connor> bit of money right yeah and so </connor>
<connor> i was like hey dad you should start a </connor>
<joey> lion account because everyone in japan </joey>
<joey> has line </joey>
<joey> everyone in my family has a line right </joey>
<joey> yeah if you guys don't know that lion is </joey>
<joey> like you know </joey>
<joey> facebook messages it's just a messaging </joey>
<joey> app that we use in japan a lot so i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you should start lying and he's like oh </joey>
<joey> i don't want to start on other social </joey>
<joey> medias and i'm like dad it's not a </joey>
<joey> social media it's just it's just a </joey>
<joey> messaging app and he's like all right </joey>
<joey> all right fine i'll do it </joey>
<joey> and so i added him and i messaged him </joey>
<joey> and it was like three months later he </joey>
<joey> came back being like what's up son </joey>
<joey> so now so i just like i was like all </joey>
<connor> right i guess i'm just sticking the </connor>
<joey> email now with my dad if my dad ever </joey>
<joey> needs anything i'll just be like just </joey>
<garnt> email me </garnt>
<joey> it's urgent i've got to email him right </joey>
<joey> now urgent hey son </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<garnt> now every one of your comments on every </garnt>
<joey> one of your videos </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah no i guess that's good </joey>
<joey> there because then now i'll truly won't </joey>
<joey> know which one my dad is </joey>
<garnt> the comment section is all gonna be my </garnt>
<garnt> dad he's gonna have to try and find </garnt>
<joey> something like a new phrase to go with </joey>
<joey> like hey boy hey boy </joey>
<joey> i love you dad i'm just joshing but what </joey>
<joey> were we talking about internet privacy </joey>
<garnt> i guess internet privacy i mean i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know like i've never </garnt>
<garnt> i i guess this is the first wake-up call </garnt>
<garnt> for me that i've had to really </garnt>
<garnt> think about my internet privacy it took </garnt>
<garnt> me way too long to make my facebook </garnt>
<garnt> uh my my facebook privates um that was </garnt>
<joey> that should have been the first stage </joey>
<garnt> but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think the problem with internet like </garnt>
<garnt> celebrities or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> nowadays is that there's a difference </garnt>
<joey> between say </joey>
<joey> it's you know someone who's signed to a </joey>
<joey> big film or someone gets picked up by a </joey>
<joey> music label like old school celebrities </joey>
<joey> who </joey>
<joey> there was this system by which they got </joey>
<joey> picked up and they knew they were going </joey>
<joey> to be famous but the problem is anyone </joey>
<joey> can be famous now </joey>
<joey> anyone can have their privacy leaked and </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> not really think about the consequences </joey>
<joey> of really going through their entire </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] past </joey>
<connor> and just making it private or you know </connor>
<connor> making it not public because </connor>
<connor> we were we were teenagers we don't </connor>
<connor> remember every [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> site that we signed up to oh my god like </connor>
<connor> i i don't know how many one of my like </connor>
<connor> old forum like old anime forum profile </connor>
<connor> pictures are still </connor>
<connor> like public or whatever you know because </connor>
<connor> i signed up to a lot of slides back then </connor>
<connor> because i was a teenager but </connor>
<connor> it's it's something that you you don't </connor>
<connor> really think about </connor>
<connor> when you don't make content on the </connor>
<connor> internet because you don't no one really </connor>
<connor> expects to be famous or no one really </connor>
<connor> expects to have </connor>
<garnt> an audience or anything like that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and i feel like i i do wonder if </garnt>
<garnt> like the newer generation is going to </garnt>
<garnt> think about this when whenever </garnt>
<garnt> they do anything or if we're just going </garnt>
<garnt> to continue to be stupid kids that </garnt>
<garnt> i don't really think about anything i </garnt>
<joey> would i would like </joey>
<garnt> for it to be the first option if i'm </garnt>
<garnt> being honest just because like you know </garnt>
<garnt> again it's like </garnt>
<garnt> i i think that whole pre-notion of like </garnt>
<connor> yeah you know you you should expect your </connor>
<connor> privacy to be </connor>
<connor> you know hacked and slashed yeah because </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah it's like it's like what is it </joey>
<joey> about suddenly being you know quote </joey>
<joey> unquote famous you know regardless of </joey>
<joey> how you view </joey>
<joey> you know fame to be where it's suddenly </joey>
<joey> like oh well you know you </joey>
<joey> you have a presence on the internet that </joey>
<joey> you share openly with a large audience </joey>
<joey> so that means that </joey>
<joey> you know you don't have a privacy if </joey>
<garnt> it's on the internet it's not private </garnt>
<garnt> anymore it's literally like the same </garnt>
<garnt> argument as </garnt>
<garnt> like old-school paparazzi have you ever </garnt>
<garnt> seen any [ __ ] interviews with like </garnt>
<garnt> any paparazzi photographer </garnt>
<connor> it's the most they're all [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> it's it </connor>
<connor> it's the most like you see these people </connor>
<connor> openly being arseholes </connor>
<connor> and they're they're just they they're </connor>
<connor> proud of it </connor>
<connor> they're [ __ ] proud of it like i think </connor>
<joey> i remember the last one i saw was </joey>
<joey> i think anthony's like sitting down with </joey>
<joey> a paparazzi i thought yes </joey>
<connor> literally everyone he interviewed was </connor>
<garnt> just the the biggest class they are sold </garnt>
<connor> you know they do that whole [ __ ] of </connor>
<connor> like oh if i don't do it someone else is </connor>
<joey> gonna get it yeah it's like how about </joey>
<joey> none of you [ __ ] do it </joey>
<joey> and it sucks because like i think 99 of </joey>
<joey> people again who are watching this are </joey>
<joey> like super chill </joey>
<joey> don't but like think that way there's </joey>
<joey> all it takes that one percent to make </joey>
<joey> your life happen </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah like and that's unfortunate </joey>
<joey> right because you know i i don't i don't </joey>
<joey> have any resentment to mine like </joey>
<joey> audience or anything like that i don't </joey>
<joey> know most of them are super [ __ ] nice </joey>
<joey> exactly just a [ __ ] shame that some </joey>
<connor> people are just like i'm a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> ruin this man's life yeah it's a shame </garnt>
<garnt> that you know you have to change your </garnt>
<garnt> behavior </garnt>
<garnt> for literally one percent of the people </garnt>
<garnt> watching you and you know that most </garnt>
<garnt> most of everyone that you interact with </garnt>
<garnt> is just going to be a generally nice </garnt>
<garnt> cool person yeah and then it just sucks </garnt>
<garnt> that there's that small percentage that </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately it's it's that small </garnt>
<garnt> percentage that ruins it for everyone </garnt>
<garnt> and it's i guess i guess that's just the </garnt>
<joey> world in general right yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but you know we'd be living in </joey>
<joey> the utopia if everyone was being honest </joey>
<joey> and kind of </joey>
<joey> flying cars we're not flying cars by now </joey>
<joey> that's not the case right now some of us </joey>
<joey> are still walking on the ground </joey>
<joey> so yeah big sad i was i was watching </joey>
<joey> this video the other day </joey>
<joey> and it was like um it's not blue's clues </joey>
<joey> blue or not blues </joey>
<joey> trust me this is related back to the </joey>
<joey> show okay okay so </joey>
<joey> did you watch blue's clues when you're </joey>
<joey> growing up of course what's blue's clues </joey>
<connor> all right so blues clues this tv show </connor>
<connor> and especially this guy </connor>
<connor> who was like talking to the camera kind </connor>
<connor> of like dora style </connor>
<connor> this is where it started this kind of </connor>
<joey> style i maybe didn't know but i'm </joey>
<joey> definitely popularized where there would </joey>
<joey> be like a a task </joey>
<connor> and there was this you know a notebook </connor>
<connor> and they'd have to do x amount of tasks </connor>
<joey> it was a really good show actually </joey>
<joey> there was a dog called blue yeah okay </joey>
<joey> yeah and so that you the dog would help </joey>
<joey> uh steve steve steve find all the clues </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> and um yeah so i always wondered i was </joey>
<joey> like why did he stop doing it because if </joey>
<connor> you if you watch the show </connor>
<connor> he basically swaps halfway through the </connor>
<connor> show with another actor </connor>
<connor> i thought oh that's where's weird why </connor>
<connor> did that happen so it turns out </connor>
<connor> that uh he was losing his hair and that </connor>
<connor> he didn't want to like go bald on like </connor>
<connor> tv right okay right right so </connor>
<connor> and then i was like [ __ ] that hit me i </connor>
<connor> was like oh my god </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] cause like i mean okay there's like </connor>
<connor> tons of comments about it and it's like </connor>
<connor> it's frustrating because like i don't </connor>
<connor> really give a [ __ ] anymore like </connor>
<connor> i've gotten over it but like </connor>
<connor> unfortunately my dad did not give me a </connor>
<connor> lucky dice roll with my genetics and i </connor>
<connor> am going bald eventually </connor>
<connor> it's gonna happen and obviously it's </connor>
<connor> been happening a little bit </connor>
<joey> and it's so frustrating that people will </joey>
<joey> like go to other videos and be like </joey>
<joey> connor </joey>
<joey> yeah did you know you're balding and i'm </joey>
<joey> like keep pointing it out yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> and it's so frustrating because the </joey>
<connor> thing that bothers me is that like again </connor>
<connor> like i fully accepted that it's </connor>
<connor> happening i know people are gonna be </connor>
<connor> like have you tried doing this have you </connor>
<connor> tried [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> doing voodoo and it's like yes </joey>
<garnt> because people are always like hey just </garnt>
<garnt> just try pushing the ball because people </garnt>
<joey> always like hey man just take these </joey>
<connor> drugs do these things like yeah okay </connor>
<connor> i've honestly like done all that tried </connor>
<connor> all that yeah unfortunately like </connor>
<connor> i can't do surgery either so whatever so </connor>
<connor> i just kind of got to the point where i </connor>
<connor> was like all right i think i've tried </connor>
<connor> enough things or i'm like </connor>
<joey> this [ __ ] sucks yeah but it can't </joey>
<joey> really do much about it </joey>
<joey> right yeah and so i kind of got over it </joey>
<joey> but it's really frustrating like i said </joey>
<joey> when people go to other videos and be </joey>
<joey> like bro you're balding it's like yeah </joey>
<joey> like like i'm i am aware but it's </joey>
<joey> frustrating </joey>
<joey> that sometimes i feel like edit videos </joey>
<joey> differently because it's like all right </joey>
<joey> if i don't edit this part out people are </joey>
<joey> going to comment about this </joey>
<connor> instead of the [ __ ] video and only </connor>
<joey> comment about it yeah it's like it's </joey>
<connor> like i just want to focus on the video </connor>
<garnt> and it's so frustrating people feel they </garnt>
<connor> need to point it out yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's like why like yeah yeah i mean i i </garnt>
<garnt> know exactly how you feel </garnt>
<connor> because i too have not been luckiest </connor>
<connor> with my gene pool so like </connor>
<connor> joey i envy your perfect hair so like </connor>
<connor> um so like pretty much everyone on my </connor>
<connor> dad's side who's a male </connor>
<connor> yeah same with the same yeah it's kind </connor>
<connor> of nice it's something that i knew was </connor>
<connor> always going to happen we don't think </connor>
<connor> it's going to happen i mean yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> like as as like when you're when you're </joey>
<garnt> a teenager you're like i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> i'm i'm i'm the exception your hair's </joey>
<connor> like your hair's like when you're like </connor>
<connor> 18 your hair's like warm it's </connor>
<garnt> lost yeah [ __ ] man my hair's so sick as </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] and i'm just like you think i'm the </garnt>
<garnt> exceptional girl </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember um you know i've seen </garnt>
<connor> like my entire family on my dad's side </connor>
<connor> everyone's everyone's bold so i asked my </connor>
<connor> dad </connor>
<connor> i've seen like pictures of my dad when </connor>
<garnt> he was young and he had hair down to </garnt>
<connor> here man he's bad yeah yeah he was </connor>
<joey> dripping um but yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah he had a he had a [ __ ] luscious </garnt>
<garnt> hair </garnt>
<connor> yeah and i saw what it looks like now </connor>
<connor> and i'm just like so um </connor>
<connor> dada when when did you start losing your </connor>
<connor> hair just just just </connor>
<connor> out of curiosity so just so i can take a </connor>
<joey> look and uh take a look at my own hair </joey>
<joey> and he goes </joey>
<joey> um i guess late 20 30 year old and i </joey>
<garnt> asked this when i was 28 i was like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] why did you not tell me earlier for </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] sakes yes </connor>
<connor> yo this is like i i can't i hadn't i had </connor>
<connor> a feeling like </connor>
<connor> it's probably gonna happen to me right </connor>
<joey> but like i i didn't like quite know </joey>
<joey> but then i realized okay my older </joey>
<joey> brother who's like 10 years older than </joey>
<joey> me was going bold and i was </joey>
<joey> like oh [ __ ] she's starting to sweat a </joey>
<joey> lot all right </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> yeah and like i you know what i totally </connor>
<connor> get why kids think it's funny to like </connor>
<connor> mock </connor>
<connor> hairlines because you just think like </connor>
<connor> it's never gonna happen yeah yeah i've </connor>
<connor> got hair my hair is [ __ ] luscious </connor>
<connor> right now it's never gonna happen </connor>
<connor> but it does oh yeah what is it like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] two out of three </connor>
<joey> especially if you're white i think two </joey>
<joey> out of three men get like some signs of </joey>
<joey> hair loss or whatever all right </joey>
<joey> yeah but i remember like i thought okay </joey>
<joey> if it happens to me at 30 no biggie </joey>
<connor> you know it's by then i'll probably be </connor>
<connor> chilling out i'll be settling down </connor>
<connor> when i was like 21 or like 20 i started </connor>
<connor> to notice just a little bit it's getting </connor>
<connor> a little bit thin and i'm like </connor>
<joey> right what's going on up there huh </joey>
<connor> better put a timeout </connor>
<connor> so even when i was like 20 i started </connor>
<connor> like trying to do things to like help it </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> doing those like you know taking it all </connor>
<joey> the [ __ ] fda approved all that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah yeah but </joey>
<joey> unfortunately </joey>
<connor> for some people it is purely just </connor>
<connor> genetics yeah you just [ __ ] like some </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> that helps and like you know you do a </connor>
<connor> lot of research you look into it </connor>
<joey> some guys you might be in a place where </joey>
<joey> maybe the building you're living in is </joey>
<joey> like really bad case of like damp or </joey>
<joey> something that's [ __ ] with your like </joey>
<joey> your hair right </joey>
<connor> right so some people who you know their </connor>
<connor> living conditions are the reason why </connor>
<connor> they're losing their hair yeah </connor>
<connor> no unfortunately as much as i wish that </connor>
<connor> i could do something about it it was </connor>
<connor> just kind of like </connor>
<connor> whatever and it's it's yeah i guess the </connor>
<connor> the main </connor>
<connor> reason why i just thought [ __ ] it i'll </connor>
<connor> just talk about it because it's like </connor>
<connor> i've gotten to the point now right </connor>
<garnt> people are pointing out anyway </garnt>
<joey> it's it's like it's not going to stop </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah i feel like if we just say </connor>
<joey> something yeah facebook can at least be </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<garnt> especially with a growing audience right </garnt>
<garnt> like new york are going to come into </garnt>
<connor> being like oh this is the inside meme </connor>
<joey> okay </joey>
<connor> i'll add on to it for the millionth time </connor>
<connor> yeah because you know it's like </connor>
<joey> unfortunately it's just kind of a thing </joey>
<joey> of like </joey>
<connor> you know it's just something that i i </connor>
<connor> can't really do anything about and </connor>
<connor> unfortunately people are going to see it </connor>
<connor> you know because i'm not like i'm not </connor>
<joey> unfortunately not gonna you're not gonna </joey>
<joey> wear a hat every day yeah my videos </joey>
<connor> aren't just me statically in front of </connor>
<connor> the camera never moving my head so it's </connor>
<garnt> like how do you guys </garnt>
<garnt> you can't go anything further than like </garnt>
<garnt> a 90 degree angle otherwise </garnt>
<connor> that's a red zone yeah yeah and it was </connor>
<joey> like so when i dyed my hair </joey>
<joey> blonde it wasn't that bad because my </joey>
<connor> scalp is like white </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah so it didn't look that bad but </joey>
<connor> it's when it starts to go brown and </connor>
<connor> certain lighting like especially studio </connor>
<joey> lighting </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] reflects that [ __ ] yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> where it doesn't look too bad if you </connor>
<connor> look at me like normally </connor>
<connor> in like video where the lighting is </connor>
<connor> washed out it looks [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> awful yeah right and it's like when i </connor>
<connor> see it on video i'm like [ __ ] it </connor>
<connor> that bad i check it i'm like oh it's not </connor>
<connor> too bad like that's what happened yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty much at peace with it and </connor>
<connor> i'll probably shave it at some point </connor>
<connor> because i kind of want to see how it </connor>
<garnt> look </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i reckon you're good </garnt>
<joey> like you have you have you lucked out </joey>
<joey> though in that regards because </joey>
<garnt> the one thing no no like the one thing </garnt>
<garnt> is like you know like the fact that </garnt>
<garnt> you've already accepted that you're </garnt>
<garnt> probably going to go bored and like you </garnt>
<garnt> probably already know </garnt>
<joey> whatever but at least the good thing is </joey>
<joey> is that you can grow a beard </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah there is nothing weirder than </garnt>
<joey> a dude </joey>
<connor> who is bald and has a clean face why are </connor>
<connor> you doing my boy johnny sims like that </connor>
<connor> man come on man </connor>
<connor> he's got the biggest dick in the </connor>
<joey> industry yeah sure and you know and </joey>
<connor> that's why he </connor>
<connor> like you know yeah i can't say that in </connor>
<connor> front of johnny sims right because he </connor>
<connor> probably smacked </connor>
<connor> particularly across my face </connor>
<connor> but like you know at least like you know </connor>
<connor> a beard on a bald guy </connor>
<connor> usually nine times out of ten looks </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] great yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> you look you look hard as [ __ ] dude i </connor>
<connor> appreciate you trying to gasp me up here </connor>
<connor> jay </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah no no but like that's </joey>
<connor> once but like it's weird because like </connor>
<connor> you know you you said like you know i'm </connor>
<connor> jealous of you joy but like i actually </connor>
<connor> had the opposite because like </connor>
<connor> i have too much hair i have too much </connor>
<connor> what a problem guys </connor>
<joey> because my because like your entire </joey>
<joey> dad's side right </joey>
<connor> dude they're like i think my dad was </connor>
<connor> born like [ __ ] 20 yeah </connor>
<joey> see my mom's side is exactly the same </joey>
<connor> because my granddad went bold at like </connor>
<connor> 24. </connor>
<joey> yeah so for the longest time in my like </joey>
<joey> early 20s </joey>
<joey> my mom and my sister would just [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> egg me on being like when are you gonna </garnt>
<garnt> get that hair </garnt>
<garnt> you better enjoy that hair while you </garnt>
<garnt> still have it on your head boy and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> the head of </garnt>
<joey> all the hairline's receding a bit yeah </joey>
<garnt> and like i would like i remember when i </garnt>
<joey> was like 18 i like asked my granddad </joey>
<connor> being like how old were you when you </connor>
<connor> like started to go to the ball and he </connor>
<connor> was like oh like </connor>
<connor> like 23 and i was like that's like five </connor>
<connor> years for me </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] but you know obviously i at that </connor>
<connor> point i was like </connor>
<connor> look if i go bald [ __ ] it i'll just </connor>
<joey> accept it you know like </joey>
<connor> i'd rather just like shave it all off </connor>
<joey> then like leave it half fast right so </joey>
<connor> i'm just like [ __ ] it </connor>
<connor> the more i thought about it and um the </connor>
<connor> more because i i can't actually get any </connor>
<connor> surgery even i wanted to because i have </connor>
<connor> my like a blood condition yeah yeah the </connor>
<connor> more i thought about i was like do i </connor>
<connor> do i really want to just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> desperately cling on to this like at the </connor>
<connor> end of the day i was like i don't really </connor>
<joey> think i give that much for a [ __ ] where </joey>
<joey> i think i need my hair to function yeah </joey>
<joey> like i think i'll still be fine without </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> right that's the thing right like i </joey>
<joey> don't understand why people love people </joey>
<joey> people make it seem like if you lose </joey>
<joey> your hair it's gone because it's like </joey>
<garnt> a bold person right right i sleep </garnt>
<garnt> someone with full hair i sleep </garnt>
<garnt> balding free real estate for bullying </garnt>
<garnt> is where it's at yeah i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> because people i feel like people just </garnt>
<connor> want to have like at least some comments </connor>
<connor> out there i feel like they need to have </connor>
<connor> like a one-up on you they don't feel </connor>
<connor> like they can mock you in some way but </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> but they but they keep mentioning it </connor>
<joey> like as if like oh if you lose your hair </joey>
<connor> you're not funny anymore like </connor>
<connor> was making fun of like something to do </connor>
<connor> with like genetics like a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> slammed out to me i was like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like you you you you know you take </garnt>
<joey> the piss out someone's look no no no too </joey>
<joey> far </joey>
<joey> boarding yeah oh free </joey>
<joey> yeah like like it's the same thing </joey>
<connor> you're taking a piss out of what someone </connor>
<connor> was born with right like </connor>
<connor> i do notice like as you know as as </connor>
<connor> someone who went through </connor>
<garnt> the phase of you know like just </garnt>
<garnt> accepting that they were bolding you </garnt>
<garnt> know you do go through that </garnt>
<garnt> five stages you do you just there is </garnt>
<connor> like the first few </connor>
<connor> i think year or two when it's happening </connor>
<connor> you're like no i can i can reverse this </connor>
<joey> i can </joey>
<joey> i can reverse this five stages of bald </joey>
<joey> english yeah i mean i think you do right </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> and i'm sure this conversation is quite </joey>
<connor> close to home to a lot of our viewers </connor>
<joey> because our audience is mainly dudes </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah if it is happening to you </connor>
<garnt> don't give a [ __ ] man it's whatever just </garnt>
<garnt> whatever you're wrong i mean </garnt>
<garnt> you can do whatever you want it's not </garnt>
<garnt> like society [ __ ] rejects you yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know i feel like you know some </garnt>
<connor> people are you know i i for one i have </connor>
<connor> been bored before </connor>
<connor> um i do i do </connor>
<connor> man yeah but i i do like my hair and you </connor>
<connor> know i am putting in steps to </connor>
<connor> you know i i don't expect to keep this </connor>
<connor> forever but i would like to </connor>
<connor> elongate it for as long as i can you </connor>
<connor> know i'm like me too </connor>
<connor> i'm self-aware enough to know that you </connor>
<connor> know once it's past the point </connor>
<connor> all right yeah i got it too far it's </connor>
<connor> gone but at least at least right now </connor>
<connor> when i still have this hair i'm gonna be </connor>
<connor> like okay you know i'm gonna lose this </connor>
<connor> eventually yeah </connor>
<connor> but i am going to try and do my best at </connor>
<connor> this point to just keep it and i don't </connor>
<connor> think </connor>
<connor> there's anything particularly wrong </connor>
<connor> about it there's no there's nothing </connor>
<joey> particularly wrong </joey>
<joey> with either direction that you go to all </joey>

<garnt> to the bold conversation </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like rock rocking and style and </garnt>
<garnt> everything like that so i remember i </garnt>
<garnt> had to go through this exact process </garnt>
<garnt> when i finished being a monk </garnt>
<joey> yeah and i i was just i was just bold </joey>
<joey> right and we talked about before how you </joey>
<joey> know you can't you can't really </joey>
<joey> it's hard to rock a bold style </joey>
<joey> when you don't have a beard or anything </joey>
<joey> i i feel like it's especially hard as an </joey>
<joey> asian as well </joey>
<joey> right so like initially all i did was </joey>
<joey> just like wear it like </joey>
<joey> wear a beanie and the thing the thing </joey>
<joey> about this like frail </joey>
<joey> asian kid wearing a beanie walking </joey>
<joey> around you look like a [ __ ] cancer </joey>
<joey> patient </joey>
<joey> like that's that's you know that's </joey>
<joey> that's that's </joey>
<joey> that's kind of like what i look like on </joey>
<joey> the outside so i was like i'm tired of </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> you know i i want to at least i want to </joey>
<joey> change my style right </joey>
<joey> there right so i was thinking well what </joey>
<joey> can i possibly do </joey>
<joey> and the only other style i can think of </joey>
<joey> is like what what do you think of when </joey>
<joey> you think you know </joey>
<joey> bold head shaved you think you kind of </joey>
<joey> you kind of you kind of think of like </joey>
<joey> someone who just like a delinquent right </joey>
<connor> someone's </connor>
<joey> yeah like a skin head right so </joey>
<connor> i tried to go for that look and i i have </connor>
<connor> a picture actually </connor>
<connor> i i i i dug this up </connor>
<connor> during the break let me see if i can get </connor>
<connor> it but yeah i went for </connor>
<connor> i went for the skinhead look and for the </connor>
<connor> first for the first and only time in my </connor>
<garnt> life </garnt>
<joey> i looked like a complete whoa i look </joey>
<garnt> like i just came out of prison man </garnt>
<connor> like asian adjacent statement </connor>
<garnt> it's the this is the first and only time </garnt>
<garnt> in my life where </garnt>
<connor> i felt dangerous right so i i would </connor>
<connor> i would be like i would be walking down </connor>
<connor> i will move away from you no exactly i </connor>
<connor> would be because i was living in china </connor>
<connor> at this time right </connor>
<connor> and so i would be walking down the </connor>
<connor> streets and sometimes if </connor>
<connor> if it was it was dark you know i could </connor>
<connor> see like </connor>
<connor> groups of girls or groups of anyone just </connor>
<joey> like subtly cross the road whenever i </joey>
<joey> was approaching </joey>
<connor> i was like okay and this this one time </connor>
<connor> so i was with some friends then it took </connor>
<connor> me like to this local bar who's </connor>
<connor> run by this like frail you know you know </connor>
<connor> one of the </connor>
<connor> old asian ladies who run this local bar </connor>

<garnt> okay there's there's always this there's </garnt>
<garnt> always like every time i wear a suit </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> there's always this countdown of like </garnt>
<joey> when am i going to take this jacket off </joey>
<joey> because inevitably </joey>
<joey> when you go to like any celebrations or </joey>
<joey> something you're going to get too hot in </joey>
<joey> that so yeah </joey>
<joey> of course of course and i i feel like </joey>
<joey> you know if you're going to take </joey>
<joey> pictures or do anything </joey>

<joey> night because yeah there's there's </joey>
<joey> nothing more messier than like just the </joey>
<joey> suit that you know has just been </joey>
<joey> battered and damaged and like you can </joey>
<joey> tell </joey>
<joey> it's it's not the suit itself it's the </joey>
<joey> tie right yeah like at the beginning </joey>
<joey> you're like you got </joey>
<joey> you're buttoned up right to the top </joey>
<joey> button your tie is tight you look </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] suave </garnt>
<garnt> yeah five hours in god you're a sweaty </garnt>
<garnt> mess that tie </garnt>
<garnt> has taken a beating it's like it's like </garnt>
<connor> halfway down your chest </connor>
<connor> one thing japan is like advanced </connor>
<joey> technology in is like their business </joey>
<joey> shirts are like next level yeah like </joey>
<joey> i've i don't know how they've done it </joey>
<joey> but japan has like optimized the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> out of like shirts like business [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like of course they have because </garnt>
<garnt> everyone every </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's wearing every other person </garnt>
<garnt> here is a salary man yeah yeah i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> put this thing on at first and it was a </garnt>
<connor> little pricey i thought </connor>
<connor> you know i mean i guess you know from </connor>
<connor> buying a nice suit i'll buy a nice </connor>
<connor> shirt it's always an afterthought cause </connor>
<connor> i always think if it's white who gives a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> then i put this thing on i'm like whoa </connor>
<connor> it breathes it stretches it looks clean </connor>
<connor> it washes super easy and i'm like whoa </connor>
<connor> i've never like appreciated </connor>
<joey> a shirt until japan i remember i </joey>
<connor> remember i saw an ad for like uh </connor>
<connor> like last summer yeah when it was like </connor>
<connor> you know that [ __ ] heat wave game </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and like it doesn't matter if it's </connor>
<connor> like 40 degrees or it's four degrees </connor>
<connor> people are wearing a suit the material </connor>
<connor> feels amazing but i remember i saw an ad </connor>
<connor> which dead i said like </connor>
<garnt> this business shirt has self-cooling </garnt>
<garnt> technology </garnt>
<garnt> i get it there's like cooling technology </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like </garnt>
<joey> it's a it's a piece of cotton some of </joey>
<joey> them like have like a stretchiness to it </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> makes it like feel really like aerated i </joey>
<joey> don't know what it is okay if you come </joey>
<joey> to japan right and you like </joey>
<joey> your shirt yeah dead ass you know [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> bringing my </joey>

<joey> shirts </joey>
<joey> go to like perfect suit factory here and </joey>
<joey> just go and put get go get some biceps </joey>
<connor> yeah that's self-calling </connor>
<joey> they're legit they're good i feel like </joey>
<joey> whenever japan like advertises this new </joey>
<joey> fancy technology and clothing though </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's hit or miss because </joey>
<joey> sometimes you get good things like the </joey>
<joey> heat tech here </joey>
<joey> the heat tech when you go to uniqlo and </joey>
<joey> it's winter those are [ __ ] great yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> every kind of cool shirts you know every </joey>
<joey> cold cafe yeah the the cooling shirts </joey>
<joey> obviously great </joey>
<joey> i remember though recently like uniqlo </joey>
<joey> also released the they </joey>
<connor> you know this was deep during the </connor>
<connor> pandemic it was debuting during </connor>
<connor> quarantine they released like their own </connor>
<connor> uh aries and masks or something like </connor>
<connor> that that was meant </connor>
<connor> that was meant to like be more </connor>
<connor> breathable fabric </connor>
<connor> or something like that and um and it got </connor>
<connor> so hyped that it sold out on the first </connor>
<connor> day immediately </connor>
<connor> people were queuing up to buy these </connor>
<connor> masks and i think around </connor>
<connor> three months into it i was at uniqlo and </connor>
<connor> miraculously they were just back on sale </connor>
<garnt> they just come back into stock so i was </garnt>
<garnt> like you know i'm going to give this a </garnt>
<garnt> try because this has been sold out and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm tired of my you know of like of </garnt>
<garnt> my mask so </garnt>
<garnt> let's let's see how breathable this is </garnt>
<garnt> um and </garnt>
<garnt> it literally it literally felt like you </garnt>
<garnt> just worn like you know one of those </garnt>
<garnt> like anime knickers </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah it literally just felt like </garnt>
<garnt> you had underwear in your face </garnt>
<garnt> and it was a [ __ ] lie it this thing </garnt>
<garnt> was this thing this thing felt like it </garnt>
<garnt> was going to give me asthma </garnt>
<garnt> it was not breathable at all yeah they </garnt>
<connor> have a lot of fats there here and it's </connor>
<connor> very </connor>
<garnt> fat technology yeah wasn't there that </garnt>
<garnt> like the uh </garnt>
<garnt> necklace or something that was meant to </garnt>
<connor> prevent yeah literally i see some people </connor>
<joey> wearing it's called virus out </joey>
<connor> yeah just like a literally just like a </connor>
<connor> necklace </connor>
<joey> and everyone's wearing it yeah aki made </joey>
<joey> like an entire video about like a bunch </joey>
<joey> of like coronavirus scam items and </joey>
<joey> one of them was that it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] lucky charm looking thing </joey>
<connor> where it's like </connor>
<connor> go away virus it was literally that </connor>
<connor> energy </connor>
<connor> it's just like it's just it's just a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like car air freshener around </connor>
<connor> your neck </connor>
<connor> that's all it is like i'd rather you not </connor>
<connor> care than have that and be like i care </connor>
<connor> yeah right </connor>
<garnt> because because like at least you're not </garnt>
<joey> pretending at that point yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but like the fact that they're like i </joey>
<joey> saw a bunch of people who like like </joey>
<joey> especially like older like women </joey>
<joey> who you know always believe in that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> for some reason who would like wear that </joey>
<joey> and be like </joey>
<joey> well i don't have to wear a mask anymore </joey>
<garnt> yeah i'm fully protected with </garnt>
<garnt> this you know i mean it's the same </garnt>
<connor> reason [ __ ] anti-vaxxers and stuff </connor>
<connor> like exists right because this kind of </connor>
<connor> you know if </connor>
<connor> you have if we have a small small enough </connor>
<connor> group who traded not trade information </connor>
<connor> within that group </connor>
<connor> um then they're just going to start </connor>
<connor> believing the wilder [ __ ] sometimes </connor>
<joey> and you know it's a lot of like the </joey>
<joey> image globally is that a lot of people a </joey>
<joey> lot of this is </joey>
<joey> confined to america but you know it's </joey>
<joey> all over it's it's all over it's all </joey>
<garnt> over the world like </garnt>
<garnt> it's definitely it is all over the place </garnt>
<joey> it's just stupidity's not confined by </joey>
<garnt> one type of like nationality just the </garnt>
<garnt> big difference is </garnt>
<garnt> like it seems in america it's just more </garnt>
<garnt> documented and it's more widespread yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's unfortunate because like i </connor>
<connor> mean like you said like the stupid i do </connor>
<connor> agree they are stupid </connor>
<joey> but it's been like proven right if you </joey>
<joey> keep calling them stupid it like makes </joey>
<garnt> them </garnt>
<joey> believe in it more yeah yeah you're like </joey>
<joey> you've got you're like you're a </joey>
<joey> conspiracy you're like </joey>
<garnt> you're on the internet are you working </garnt>
<garnt> with the government you're one of them </garnt>
<connor> but also at the same time i don't want </connor>
<connor> to sit there and humor [ __ ] stupid </connor>
<connor> ideas yeah </connor>
<joey> so it's like yeah i don't know i don't i </joey>
<joey> don't really talk about it i don't </joey>
<connor> really get involved with it because i'm </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> i feel like it's a loose lose these </connor>
<connor> people should know better yeah you know </connor>
<connor> i i just like to think that </connor>
<connor> you know like for example if my mum one </connor>
<joey> day got into something like that that </joey>
<joey> i'd like to be able to think that i </joey>
<joey> could maybe talk her out of it like mum </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah come on </joey>
<joey> yeah the pg tips is not poison you can </joey>
<joey> drink the tea in them </joey>
<connor> i'm pretty sure we'd all be dead with it </connor>
<connor> you know you know just giving you a fake </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's unfortunate wasn't it like the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] in </connor>
<connor> in england what like the 5g towers </connor>
<connor> caused that was </connor>
<connor> embarrassing that was like coconut or </connor>
<joey> whatever it was here </joey>
<joey> that was like huge in the uk yeah that </joey>
<joey> people were like burning down these </joey>
<joey> towers yeah it's embarrassing </joey>
<connor> you're like these are like i live in the </connor>
<connor> same country these people i went to the </connor>
<connor> same schools </connor>
<connor> yeah there's these people who burned </connor>
<connor> down [ __ ] 5g towers </connor>
<connor> there's also that fat of like you know </connor>
<connor> you should you shouldn't like when when </connor>
<joey> wireless uh like bluetooth headphones </joey>
<joey> first came out for your phone </joey>
<joey> people should use those because if you </joey>
<joey> if you're on the phone like this then </joey>
<garnt> the signal </garnt>
<garnt> actually i remember that yeah i remember </garnt>
<garnt> that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and there were people at least in </garnt>
<garnt> australia like when i was growing up </garnt>
<joey> there were like people dead ass </joey>
<joey> being like [ __ ] i have to go and buy </joey>
<joey> some bluetooth headphones you know </joey>
<joey> i don't i don't want to get a tumor in </joey>
<joey> my brain from all these phone calls i'm </joey>
<garnt> taking i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> what are you on i think one of the most </garnt>
<garnt> interest </garnt>
<garnt> uh interesting things i've like i've </garnt>
<garnt> seen happen recently that's happened </garnt>
<garnt> right in front of my eyes is the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> toilet paper shortage </garnt>
<joey> right like like i think back to that </joey>
<joey> and like what does that feel like 10 </joey>
<garnt> years ago i know </garnt>
<garnt> but like i think back to that and like </garnt>
<joey> our kids are going to be reading about </joey>
<joey> this or like they're going to see like </joey>
<joey> it's next they're going to see the </joey>
<connor> internet historian video like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> 20 years in the future and be thinking </joey>
<joey> like ha ha my generation were never this </joey>
<joey> stupid </joey>
<joey> it's like i'm just imagining like you </joey>
<joey> know 20 years from now like our kids </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> we'll be like in [ __ ] history class </connor>
<connor> like modern history being like yeah all </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> class so today we're going to be talking </connor>
<connor> about the 2020 great </connor>
<joey> toilet paper shortage </joey>
<connor> like it's the same as the [ __ ] great </connor>
<connor> depression it blew my mind how in japan </connor>
<connor> it happened as well i'm like we </connor>
<connor> literally have [ __ ] bidets </connor>
<garnt> it blew my mind what do you guys clean </garnt>
<connor> your ass it blew my mind that it </connor>
<connor> happened </connor>
<connor> worldwide it was literally like a idea </connor>
<joey> that spread worldwide even though like </joey>
<joey> nobody nobody knew </joey>
<joey> where it came from oh no no </joey>
<joey> like the thing is nobody like in other </joey>
<joey> countries really knew that it came from </joey>
<garnt> australia because they were just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh toilet paper i must buy i'm not i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why but everyone else is </garnt>
<garnt> buying toilet paper therefore i must buy </garnt>
<connor> toilet paper </connor>
<connor> it didn't occur to people that maybe </connor>
<connor> like you know if everyone just keeps </connor>
<connor> using toilet paper at the same rate that </connor>
<connor> we've all been using it </connor>
<connor> it'll continue to be the same right like </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know why because it was out of </garnt>
<garnt> every household necessity that you think </garnt>
<joey> would happen </joey>
<joey> that you think people would need an </joey>
<joey> apocalypse food water </joey>
<garnt> i sleep toilet paper i wake yeah this is </garnt>
<garnt> the real [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> so what did people think that like if </joey>
<joey> you got covered you also got irritable </joey>
<joey> bowel syndrome like </joey>
<connor> in my mind as well i'm like do i really </connor>
<connor> want to be an [ __ ] who just goes and </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] takes everything in the shop i'm </connor>
<connor> like ah i mean i'll i'll take like a </connor>
<connor> little bit of like pasta a little bit of </connor>
<connor> canned goods yeah nothing crazy </connor>
<joey> yeah i mean you know like we like we </joey>
<connor> stocked up yeah but we didn't [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like be like can i have </connor>
<joey> everything on that shelf from there to </joey>
<garnt> there no we we we only stocked up just </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> there was a literal shortage and there </garnt>
<connor> was a little point where </connor>
<connor> i had trouble wiping my ass because </connor>
<connor> there wasn't there was no toilet paper </connor>
<joey> you know i was i was gonna clean my ass </joey>
<connor> with a bidet but i wasn't gonna </connor>
<connor> step out with a weird ass right like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that [ __ ] i just jiggle you know </connor>
<connor> a little shake because it was the one </connor>
<joey> piece of like everyday household </joey>
<joey> equipment there you know you can </joey>
<joey> understand soap you know okay i </joey>
<joey> understand yeah there would be a </joey>
<garnt> shortage of soap i can understand hand </garnt>
<garnt> sanitizer of course i understand why </garnt>
<garnt> there would be </garnt>
<garnt> food and water food and water there </garnt>
<connor> wasn't any i'm like do you know how easy </connor>
<connor> it is to live like rice or pasta </connor>
<connor> like you don't need much of that but </connor>
<joey> there was even a shortage of like pasta </joey>
<connor> as well like </connor>
<connor> i remember yeah yeah they're actually i </connor>
<garnt> remember i remember the video of uh i </garnt>
<connor> think it was in italy </connor>
<connor> there there was like all of this </connor>
<connor> supermarkets yeah they're like </connor>
<connor> and the old guy was like getting pissed </connor>
<connor> off that there was no pastor in the </connor>
<connor> supermarket and he was like </connor>
<joey> people weren't even this obsessed during </joey>
<joey> world war two </joey>
<joey> we had more pass through world war ii </joey>
<joey> than we do now what the [ __ ] going on </joey>
<connor> yeah i guess the problem is that like </connor>
<connor> everyone's telling each other you should </connor>
<connor> panic like in real time right </connor>
<connor> spread it yeah it's like oh my god i </connor>
<connor> don't know i had a bunch of cup ramen </connor>
<connor> and i was like i'm pretty i think i'm </connor>
<connor> good </connor>
<connor> yeah i'll see what happens like i'm </connor>
<connor> pretty sure the stores aren't just gonna </connor>
<garnt> shut </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i like there would be an exact </garnt>
<garnt> point </garnt>
<garnt> where i would like start panicking and </garnt>
<garnt> that exact point </garnt>
<joey> is if i found out the kombini was closed </joey>
<joey> because like i i feel like </joey>
<joey> here if the combination closes you're </joey>
<joey> going through some real [ __ ] that is </joey>
<joey> when i'm truly watching </joey>
<joey> okay how are we really going through an </joey>
<garnt> apocalypse okay i wake now </garnt>
<connor> i'm [ __ ] yeah it's like america </connor>
<connor> they're like waffle house </connor>
<joey> and like you can judge on like the </joey>
<joey> disaster based on whether waffle house </joey>
<joey> is open or closed </joey>
<joey> it's like it's an actual like study like </joey>
<joey> thing </joey>
<joey> where like even when there's like </joey>
<joey> hurricanes yeah </joey>
<joey> waffle house in america is still open </joey>
<connor> wow </connor>
<connor> seriously yeah seriously look it up it's </connor>
<connor> really interesting like i think i </connor>
<connor> don't know which big natural disaster it </connor>
<connor> was i think it was a katrina or </connor>
<connor> something like yeah </connor>
<connor> it was still open like </connor>
<joey> because they're all equipped with like </joey>
<joey> generators right why </joey>
<joey> in case disasters yeah they're like one </joey>
<joey> of the only things that like will try </joey>
<joey> their best to stay open unless like </joey>
<connor> you know the disaster is so bad yeah </connor>
<joey> when waffle house in america like damn </joey>
<joey> my roof just got blown off </joey>
<joey> i could kill for some waffles right now </joey>
<connor> if like windows and [ __ ] are broken i </connor>
<joey> think they'll still continue to be open </joey>
<joey> like they'll let you in </joey>
<joey> like i i i'm not i'm not sure exactly i </joey>
<connor> could be chatting out my ass but </connor>
<garnt> it's as far as i'm concerned anyways </garnt>
<garnt> because i i think </garnt>
<garnt> what this entire situation has made me </garnt>
<garnt> realize is i i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like oh before before 2020 watching like </garnt>
<connor> old school </connor>
<connor> zombie movies and something like that </connor>
<connor> and you think to yourself man they made </connor>
<connor> the they made the people really stupid </connor>
<connor> in this </connor>
<connor> zombie movie this would never happen in </connor>
<connor> real life and now i look back and i'm </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> like definitely gonna happen i'm like </connor>
<garnt> they didn't make them stupid enough </garnt>
<connor> jesus christ </connor>
<connor> there'll be a sect of people that like </connor>
<connor> rounds up people and feeds them to the </connor>
<joey> zombies because if they think it'll </joey>
<joey> probably appease the zombie or something </joey>
<connor> there'll be some [ __ ] like that </connor>
<connor> there'll be something like that i look </connor>
<connor> at something like dead rising and i'm </connor>
<joey> like well this is unrealistic there's </joey>
<garnt> still things inside all of the stores </garnt>
<connor> the toilet paper is still a little bit </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> there isn't a subgroup of people </connor>
<connor> praising the zombies what's going on </connor>
<connor> i i i i am curious what every like </connor>
<connor> zombie </connor>
<garnt> story and like every like every kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like apocalyptic story </garnt>
<garnt> like would like how if 2020 would have </garnt>
<garnt> changed like how cliches and trolls are </garnt>
<connor> just going to get a million </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] boring movies about this current </connor>
<connor> pandemic and </connor>
<garnt> you know can you make an exciting movie </garnt>
<joey> about the pandemic i don't care i mean </joey>
<joey> they tried to do it with 2012 right </joey>
<connor> they made one like in 2006 or something </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> that oh it was pandemic right that was a </connor>
<connor> little pandemic there's like a few </connor>
<connor> movies that like </connor>
<connor> that are like worryingly close to like </connor>
<joey> what happened yeah that was the there </joey>
<joey> was the one that i </joey>
<joey> that went viral i think i saw it last </joey>
<connor> year um </connor>
<connor> it was like crazy yeah yeah like in the </connor>
<joey> movie there was like a pandemic </joey>
<joey> that was like completely obviously named </joey>
<joey> something completely differently years </joey>
<joey> before </joey>
<joey> and uh and i think it got viral because </joey>
<joey> people </joey>
<joey> found it on netflix and started watching </joey>
<joey> it and the </joey>
<joey> dead asked the plot is that there was a </joey>
<joey> virus that was started </joey>
<joey> in china through that really yeah </joey>
<connor> and people were like yeah some chef had </connor>
<joey> it and he shook hands with a business </joey>
<joey> woman yeah and then and then it spread </joey>
<joey> to america and then like </joey>
<joey> half of americans [ __ ] mad i think </joey>
<joey> and people are like oh my god this is </joey>
<joey> almost scarily similar to what's </joey>
<garnt> actually happening right so probably </garnt>
<garnt> smarter because people probably acted </garnt>
<garnt> much a lot smarter in that movie </garnt>
<connor> i don't know no no no no no well then </connor>
<connor> but in that movie as well they would </connor>
<joey> just like instantly die </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah for some reason matt damon and </connor>
<joey> his kid i think were immune you were the </joey>
<joey> ones that were immune because of course </joey>
<joey> matt damon </joey>
<connor> i'm pretty sure if that happened matt </connor>
<connor> damon and tom cruise be [ __ ] immune </connor>
<joey> to him yeah </joey>
<joey> matt damon i think matt in the movie </joey>
<joey> matt damon was like i quarantined for </joey>
<joey> two weeks </joey>
<joey> never mind i'm immune now </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> he leaned like that i stayed inside of a </joey>
<joey> room for two weeks and then the doctor </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<connor> guess you're immune now it's a pretty </connor>
<garnt> good movie have you watched it </garnt>
<garnt> i've just seen clips of it yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> pretty good it's pretty fun </connor>
<connor> watching it now being like yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] weird it must be weird watching </garnt>
<garnt> it during the pandemic and seeing being </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> this is uh this is uncomfortably close </garnt>
<connor> to what's happening now </connor>
<connor> it just makes you realize like how lucky </connor>
<connor> we got that it could have been </connor>
<connor> way worse like you could have just </connor>
<garnt> immediately killed people yeah </garnt>
<connor> because i i think you know we we've </connor>
<connor> obviously gone through a really harsh </connor>
<garnt> period right now but i feel like </garnt>
<connor> humanity really just got like we got the </connor>
<connor> best warnings yeah yeah this was this </connor>
<garnt> was the best warning sign that </garnt>
<garnt> we could have gotten and i say this </garnt>
<garnt> obviously knowing that you know it's </garnt>
<joey> it's a [ __ ] tragedy </joey>
<joey> how many people have died but the the </joey>
<joey> scary thing is that it could have been </joey>
<joey> so much [ __ ] worse yeah than it was </joey>
<joey> and this was this was kind of like the </joey>
<joey> worst case scenario for </joey>
<joey> how easily transmittable this virus </joey>
<joey> could have been but </joey>
<garnt> in terms of like in terms of like its </garnt>
<garnt> actual effect it could have been a lot </garnt>
<garnt> worse </garnt>
<garnt> and i say this with the [ __ ] awful </garnt>
<garnt> results we've gotten </garnt>
<joey> so far i mean it's just it's just scary </joey>
<joey> to think that you know if </joey>
<joey> this had happened you know 50 100 years </joey>
<joey> prior yeah like how much probably much </joey>
<joey> much much worse it could have been you </joey>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> it's weird because i i've been thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about this a lot because it's uh </garnt>
<connor> it's been like a full year now since </connor>
<connor> since i remember thinking </connor>
<joey> oh this is gonna this is gonna last a </joey>
<connor> few months this is </connor>
<joey> there's this quarantine thing right this </joey>
<garnt> is a this is a little this is this is a </garnt>
<joey> fun day everyone came together it's like </joey>
<joey> we'll bunk up for like two months and </joey>
<joey> then you know we'll be able to go </joey>
<garnt> outside and enjoy the summer </garnt>
<joey> i remember the joke was like oh anime </joey>
<joey> nerds haha i found </joey>
<joey> i was born for this yeah and then i kind </joey>
<joey> of you realize pretty soon that there's </joey>
<joey> a big difference between choosing to </joey>
<connor> stay home </connor>
<joey> and being forced to stay home there's i </joey>
<connor> don't know what it is but there's a big </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] difference </garnt>
<connor> i saw a tweet that was like man are </connor>
<connor> people gonna judge people who have a </connor>
<connor> tough time readapting to </connor>
<connor> social situations right i was like what </connor>
<joey> what do you mean </joey>
<joey> what do you mean re-adapting like people </joey>
<connor> who have been uh </connor>
<joey> like in live in their house for too long </joey>
<connor> alone yeah they were like i hope we </connor>
<joey> don't get judged what </joey>
<joey> what they're suddenly gonna go outside </joey>
<joey> being like how do i interact with humans </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i thought it was a little odd </connor>
<joey> you don't you see [ __ ] like that on </joey>
<joey> twitter and it was just read something </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> it was like it they they made it out </joey>
<connor> like it was way more serious and like a </connor>
<connor> big issue than it was </connor>
<connor> and i'm like bro it's literally talking </connor>
<joey> to people what are you what are you </joey>
<joey> doing how is this not second nature to </joey>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> i'm not i know people you know struggle </connor>
<connor> to socialize but acting as if like </connor>
<connor> your life has just been flipped upside </connor>
<connor> down and it's gonna take so much </connor>
<connor> readjusting like you'd </connor>
<connor> like to get over this i'm like bro it's </connor>
<joey> like it's like it's not like you trying </joey>
<joey> to learn </joey>
<joey> a language that you stopped learning </joey>
<connor> afterwards maybe maybe this is a shitty </connor>
<joey> take i don't know it could be a shitty </joey>
<connor> take i </connor>
<connor> i was just like what am i doing am i </connor>
<joey> dumb well you're obviously </joey>
<joey> not part of that right it's like hashtag </joey>
<connor> obviously i you know i know i'm quite </connor>
<connor> extroverted and i i obviously </connor>
<connor> can't sympathize 100 with all introvert </connor>
<connor> problems </connor>
<joey> but like you know i mean to me i was </joey>
<joey> like it kind of seemed like they were </joey>
<joey> trying to make it like </joey>
<connor> i don't know because sometimes twitter </connor>
<connor> does this where it's like guys guys </connor>
<connor> i have a problem guys i need to tell you </connor>
<connor> about my problem guys please come on </connor>
<joey> fellow i believe that i believe that's </joey>
<joey> called first world problems yeah maybe </joey>
<joey> yeah maybe </joey>
<connor> yeah or it's like the woe is me right </connor>
<garnt> well i don't know like i </garnt>
<garnt> i i can kind of understand but at the </garnt>
<garnt> same time </garnt>
<garnt> how is it going to be different like how </garnt>
<garnt> are you gonna how is it that much </garnt>
<garnt> different from what you were like before </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's like it's like </connor>
<joey> normal yeah i mean it's like no one's </joey>
<joey> gonna force you to go outside after the </joey>
<garnt> pandemic if anything people are probably </garnt>
<joey> gonna </joey>
<garnt> just don't worry about it just go back </garnt>
<connor> to being we'll just go back to the </connor>
<connor> situation people will choose to be </connor>
<connor> inside </connor>
<garnt> taking a flight guard going on a plane </garnt>
<garnt> you know if you loved being inside </garnt>
<connor> before the pandemic you're probably </connor>
<connor> still going to be inside after the </connor>
<connor> pandemic let's be real </connor>
<garnt> no it's like the police aren't going to </garnt>
<garnt> come and be like all right you've been </garnt>
<garnt> in this room for too </garnt>
<garnt> long all right get the [ __ ] out get the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] out you got it you gotta </garnt>
<garnt> do you think there are going to be any </garnt>
<garnt> big changes once this pandemic's over or </garnt>
<garnt> we're just going to be like </garnt>
<garnt> ah that was a funny thing that happened </garnt>
<joey> last year right i mean like in terms of </joey>
<joey> japan </joey>
<joey> like you know because we're already such </joey>
<garnt> a yeah do you think japan is never going </garnt>
<garnt> to stop wearing masks </garnt>
<garnt> now no like because before you know it </garnt>
<garnt> was still a socially accepted norm </garnt>
<joey> for people to wear masks but not </joey>
<joey> everyone wore masks </joey>
<joey> and now i feel like now it's going to be </joey>
<joey> so deeply ingrained in the culture that </joey>
<joey> i feel like </joey>
<garnt> 90 to 80 percent of people are just </garnt>
<garnt> gonna be permanently wearing masks oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah of course </joey>
<joey> i mean you know like people already wear </joey>
<connor> masks here like you know during </connor>
<connor> especially this time of year </connor>
<connor> like you know flu season yeah people </connor>
<connor> have hay fever because you know that </connor>
<joey> kind of stuff and then you know you have </joey>
<joey> like the influenza season in like </joey>
<joey> november where people are getting sick </joey>
<joey> all the [ __ ] time yeah everyone's </joey>
<joey> wearing a mask and it's like </joey>
<joey> is your face a little bit cold wear a </joey>
<garnt> mask you know do you know what i'm </garnt>
<garnt> hoping </garnt>
<garnt> and i think it's going to happen and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> happy for it </garnt>
<joey> people are going to take care of the </joey>
<connor> hygiene during conventions that's good </connor>
<joey> i don't know but you're asking them yeah </joey>
<joey> that's a tall order </joey>
<joey> i i i am hopeful that a global pandemic </joey>
<joey> will make nerds care more about the </joey>
<garnt> hygiene during a big social gathering </garnt>
<garnt> am i am i being too hopeful for this am </garnt>
<joey> i being grateful for this i feel you </joey>
<joey> know what i feel if anything it's going </joey>
<joey> to be like </joey>
<joey> listen we're all not going to get each </joey>
<joey> other sick now we've we've all gotten </joey>
<joey> the shot yeah </joey>
<joey> and and i've been and i've been forced </joey>
<joey> to use hand sanitizer and bathe and wash </joey>
<joey> my hands for </joey>
<joey> far too long i am going to go on a </joey>
<connor> bathing strike </connor>
<connor> i think i'd like to just see the like </connor>
<connor> the alcohol stay in front of like yeah </connor>
<garnt> especially at conventions where you are </garnt>
<garnt> shaking hands with </garnt>
<connor> so many [ __ ] people and you know you </connor>
<connor> know maybe wearing more masks in </connor>
<connor> convention that's </connor>
<connor> that's not exactly a bad thing because </connor>
<connor> con flu is just </connor>
<connor> an accepted part that is an accepted </connor>
<garnt> part of every convention you go </garnt>
<joey> you go to right well it's more like see </joey>
<joey> here's the one thing i've never </joey>
<joey> understood about conflict right like </joey>
<joey> right whenever you catch a cold </joey>
<joey> right it's usually from someone yeah </joey>
<joey> who's the [ __ ] who's going to a con </joey>
<joey> with a cold i mean there's loads of </joey>
<joey> people because i mean i get it right </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> if you if they booked it yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> you've you've already taken </garnt>
<garnt> them off work you've already paid money </garnt>
<garnt> you've booked your hotel yeah but </garnt>
<joey> they'll get a cough </joey>
<joey> the least you can do is like try and </joey>
<connor> stay as hygienic as possible right </connor>
<connor> which is what you're talking about i </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<joey> can we can we change this please like </joey>
<garnt> that's that's what i'm saying </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm hoping that i go to the next </garnt>
<joey> convention or maybe like not just the </joey>
<connor> next one because obviously the next </connor>
<joey> one's gonna be affected yeah but maybe </joey>
<connor> in like three years time we still got </connor>
<connor> the same etiquette of you know if </connor>
<joey> you know maybe wearing masks isn't such </joey>
<joey> a bad thing we're a master use hand </joey>
<joey> sanitizer </joey>
<joey> or people having hand sanitizers just </joey>
<joey> like easily readily available like if </joey>
<joey> i'm just like </joey>
<joey> oh [ __ ] does anyone have any hand </joey>
<connor> sanitizer and like three people around </connor>
<joey> me just be like yeah bro i got your back </joey>
<connor> i think that's the positive change maybe </connor>
<joey> you know maybe the smell can change but </joey>
<garnt> that's that's just hopeful thing </garnt>
<connor> that that is hopeful can we make those </connor>
<connor> ones that like [ __ ] wet your hand to </connor>
<connor> oblivion illegal you know the ones when </connor>
<connor> you get it and it's just like </connor>
<connor> a oil has been dropped on your head that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] should be illegal </joey>
<joey> where it's like way too sticky but it's </joey>
<joey> like sticky it's </joey>
<joey> it's like feels like it's been hydrated </joey>
<joey> to like one thousand percent like it's </joey>
<joey> weird why do they keep buying this [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> stop making that that's the potent [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> dude </connor>
<garnt> is it really though i i i like the </garnt>
<garnt> feeling of that one because </garnt>
<garnt> your hands feel clean because it's like </garnt>
<connor> the man puts his hand in a tangle one </connor>
<connor> time and now he wants to like have his </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> groove all over him </connor>
<garnt> because like sometimes you get like you </garnt>
<garnt> go to a restaurant here and they're like </garnt>
<joey> please please sanitize your hands and </joey>
<joey> they give you like this they spray like </joey>
<joey> the tiny spray on and you're </joey>
<joey> meant to like make this tiny spray last </joey>
<joey> like like cover your entire </joey>
<joey> absorbs into your palm before you </joey>
<joey> stretch it out i'm just like you you </joey>
<joey> know that picture where it's like the </joey>
<connor> door that's being held by the cheeto and </connor>
<connor> like the swat team </connor>
<connor> breaking down the door that's what it </connor>
<connor> feels like when they put like that </connor>
<joey> piddly little spray on and you're like </joey>
<connor> okay i can see this does nothing but </connor>
<connor> you're just doing it because it's like </connor>
<connor> regulation </connor>
<connor> yeah like i don't want my hand been feel </connor>
<connor> like i've just dunked it in like a vat </connor>
<connor> of oil </connor>
<garnt> like that's what it feels like sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> i like the feeling of like </garnt>
<garnt> like it's one it covers your hands and </garnt>
<garnt> two you can feel it evaporate so you get </garnt>
<garnt> like a </garnt>
<garnt> little tingly cooling sensation i rather </garnt>
<joey> than go overboard with the hand </joey>
<joey> sanitizer than on the board like i </joey>
<garnt> i feel i feel like it's clean otherwise </garnt>
<joey> it's it is [ __ ] it's like </joey>
<joey> i know there is my hands are the </joey>
<joey> cleanest it is sanitized that's that's </joey>
<garnt> the point of hand sanitizing it [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> sanitizes </joey>
<joey> that point zero one percent of germs is </joey>
<joey> clinging on for dear life on my hands </joey>
<garnt> right now like </garnt>
<garnt> i just prefer to use like soap i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know i like the food </garnt>
<connor> all right spray a little bit on and i'm </connor>
<connor> going to go toilet and clean my hands </connor>
<garnt> what takes so much more effort yeah but </garnt>
<connor> i like that is the least </connor>
<joey> optimized thing yeah coming from a man </joey>
<connor> who optimizes everything in his list </connor>
<connor> restaurants aren't </connor>
<connor> inherently an unoptimized experience </connor>
<connor> there's so much waiting </connor>
<garnt> image imagine the queue to the toilet </garnt>
<connor> yeah if that if that was just </connor>
<connor> norm not everyone could be large brained </connor>
<joey> like myself you know </joey>
<joey> shut up just shut up all you have to do </joey>
<garnt> is buy this gel </garnt>
<connor> it sanitizes your hands more feel like </connor>
<joey> it strips your skin i don't know why </joey>
<joey> you're not even well that's just your </joey>
<connor> weak ass epidermis apparently it is it </connor>
<garnt> is my weak ass epidemic </garnt>
<connor> because sometimes i love it when i can </connor>
<connor> feel my bone </connor>
<garnt> yeah because some people have just know </garnt>
<connor> some people some people just have like </connor>
<connor> really sweaty hands and it feels like </connor>
<connor> you know that spray </connor>
<garnt> that spray does nothing some people need </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] sweater your hands not my hands </joey>
<joey> my hands are like it's the one </joey>
<joey> that you handshake at a corn you know </joey>
<garnt> it's it's the moist hand it's the </garnt>
<garnt> moisture </garnt>
<garnt> you felt the moist hand and for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason the moist hand always caught as </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it's like you feel the moistness </garnt>
<joey> and you're literally a cold wet fish </joey>
<garnt> that's what it feels like that's what it </garnt>
<joey> feels like right it's like a dead fish </joey>
<joey> right it's like going to a supermarket </joey>
<joey> and like seeing one of those fish in the </joey>
<joey> fish it's actually just grabbing it </joey>
<joey> that's what it feels like </joey>
<joey> it is gross and you can never shake that </joey>
<joey> feeling off after it's like </joey>
<garnt> off your hand yeah yeah yeah apologies </garnt>
<garnt> to anyone who has </garnt>
<connor> cold wet hands but uh yeah </connor>
<connor> whoever's handshaking their fish at home </connor>
<garnt> yeah sand shaking their fish arms </garnt>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean i i would like to see that </joey>
<connor> from future cons but </connor>
<connor> i mean [ __ ] it's it's really it's just a </connor>
<joey> matter of </joey>
<joey> when is the future called it's just got </joey>
<connor> a postponed didn't you yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> i i just have no interest in going to </joey>
<connor> digital conventions i couldn't think of </connor>
<garnt> a more </garnt>
<garnt> boring thing it's it's it's just sad to </garnt>
<connor> me </connor>
<connor> i get it they got to keep it they got to </connor>
<connor> do it but to me to me it doesn't </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't make me feel happy that </garnt>
<garnt> they're doing digital conventions it </garnt>
<connor> just makes me feel </connor>
<connor> sad yeah unless i'm staying in a scuffed </connor>
<connor> hotel room that's [ __ ] up from </connor>
<connor> every all everyone's [ __ ] like just not </connor>
<garnt> the same yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's it's kind of the same as like </joey>
<connor> virtual concerts yeah right </connor>
<connor> like like uh i thought the fortnite one </connor>
<connor> was pretty cool with like travis scott i </connor>
<joey> did a whole thing for it </joey>
<joey> that's like a different experience </joey>
<joey> that's a different experience but like </joey>
<connor> someone on zoom just dancing in front of </connor>
<connor> that webcam being like you know </connor>
<joey> did you see the one that post malone did </joey>
<joey> for pokemon no no </joey>
<joey> yeah postmo so like pokemon just </joey>
<joey> recently announced uh well </joey>
<joey> uh past the 25th anniversary this year </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> post the pokemon the official pokemon </joey>
<joey> youtube channel </joey>
<joey> did a virtual concert with post malone </joey>
<joey> and it is </joey>
<garnt> weird it is weird as [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> did pokemon reach out to post malone or </garnt>
<joey> was it </joey>
<joey> what it was like it was like literally </joey>
<joey> like think of think of like the travis </joey>
<garnt> scott he's like the least </garnt>
<garnt> family-friendly kind of image you could </garnt>
<garnt> go for that </garnt>
<joey> i expect from nintendo it was this clip </joey>
<joey> on twitter that went viral </joey>
<joey> where like one of the lyrics uh to like </joey>
<joey> post malone's song like obviously you </joey>
<joey> know like </joey>
<connor> a lot of his songs you know he swears </connor>
<joey> and writes so they said it but i guess </joey>
<connor> they forgot to censor this one line </connor>
<connor> where he was like </connor>
<joey> it was just the sex though the sex </joey>
<joey> though meanwhile there's lugia flying in </joey>
<connor> the distance </connor>
<connor> post malone rapping and it was like yeah </connor>
<connor> so like </connor>
<connor> they had like the the virtual model of </connor>
<connor> post malone </connor>
<connor> but again it's like in a pokemon way </connor>
<connor> not even it's like i don't know he was </connor>
<joey> kind of </joey>
<joey> halfway between a pokemon model and just </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> a regular 3d model okay and it was </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] weird and especially </joey>
<joey> weird because like </joey>
<joey> when you think of pokemon and you think </joey>
<joey> of </joey>
<joey> modern pop stars yeah post malone is not </joey>
<joey> the first person you think of </joey>
<joey> no right and yet yeah it was really </joey>
<joey> weird just being like at the end of the </joey>
<joey> concert he's like </joey>

<joey> just a very strange </joey>
<joey> like i don't know if i enjoyed it it's a </joey>
<garnt> very odd combo it's a very odd combo </garnt>
<garnt> especially especially coming from </garnt>
<joey> nintendo as well one of the most was </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean it was it was good like </joey>

<connor> concert it'll come up </connor>
<connor> i just yeah i just don't want to be in </connor>
<connor> my room attending another this is just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> that's just sad there's just something </garnt>
<joey> about the energy of having a crowd there </joey>
<joey> that's just that that you need that </joey>
<joey> energy i mean it's something that you </joey>
<garnt> can't because nothing's sadder than a </garnt>
<joey> virtual mosh pit </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah oh god that sounds so </garnt>
<garnt> depressing yeah oh my god i'm playing </garnt>
<joey> what's the virtual mosh pit it's just </joey>
<joey> twitch chat going insane right that's a </joey>
<joey> virtual mosh pins like it's </joey>
<connor> not quite the same i love twitch chat </connor>
<joey> and i i love interacting and i love </joey>
<joey> streaming but there's something about it </joey>
<joey> when it was supposed to be live </joey>
<joey> yeah like in person when it goes to </joey>
<joey> twitch it feels weird or yeah </joey>
<joey> it feels weird i don't really know why </joey>
<joey> and like conventions i just think are an </joey>
<connor> experience you inherently just cannot </connor>
<garnt> experience </garnt>
<garnt> i mean you go to convention for the </garnt>
<garnt> people for the atmosphere otherwise </garnt>
<connor> everyone would be [ __ ] going on their </connor>
<joey> discord service and talking about anime </joey>
<connor> being cringy exactly you go to be cringy </connor>
<connor> and personal yeah </connor>
<joey> meet other cringy people it's like the </joey>
<joey> whole reason why you go to like concerts </joey>
<connor> right it's like </connor>
<connor> it's it's of course to see whoever </connor>
<joey> you're seeing live but it's also to </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> see it with people yeah there's </garnt>
<garnt> something different about seeing you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> seeing a bland live as opposed with </garnt>
<joey> other people </joey>
<joey> as opposed to seeing it you know </joey>
<joey> listening to the album or seeing music </joey>
<connor> videos </connor>
<joey> like that there's just there's just an </joey>
<connor> energy you can't capture if you're </connor>
<connor> watching it through a screen exactly </connor>
<connor> um and i mean that's that's why i get </connor>
<joey> why people have to do virtual events and </joey>
<joey> everything but i'm kind of i'm kind of </joey>
<joey> i just want to attend i [ __ ] miss </joey>
<joey> concerts i miss crowds </joey>
<joey> yeah and i never thought i would miss </joey>
<joey> crowds because like hey i hate crowds i </joey>
<joey> hate crowds so much but </joey>
<joey> like even like it's not just even being </joey>
<joey> there in a crowd but just </joey>
<joey> seeing an event and just hearing that </joey>
<joey> crowd scream </joey>
<joey> there's just something special there's </joey>
<joey> just something that brings that hype to </joey>
<joey> it yeah </joey>
<joey> i get that i get that like um the most </joey>
<connor> recent like </connor>
<connor> the most recent event i can think of is </connor>
<connor> uh league of legends worlds right </connor>
<connor> normally i'm like super super hyped for </connor>
<connor> worlds because as you would be for any </connor>
<connor> other sporting event </connor>
<connor> but there was just something about </connor>
<connor> seeing this gameplay </connor>
<garnt> that just didn't have the crowd raw </garnt>
<garnt> behind it that just made it feel like </garnt>
<garnt> you were just watching a </garnt>
<garnt> tyler1 stream or something like that </garnt>
<connor> yeah like you're watching an online </connor>
<garnt> tournament yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i remember the players they were </garnt>
<joey> saying as well they were like yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> not the same without a crowd yeah of </garnt>
<joey> course when you get a win </joey>
<connor> you know when the crowd's that uh you </connor>
<garnt> know like when someone makes a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> amazing play </connor>
<joey> and you hear that roar there's just </joey>
<connor> something special about that that </connor>
<connor> even though i'm not there in person </connor>
<connor> because i've i've been to you know i've </connor>
<connor> been there in person and the energy </connor>
<connor> there is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] incredible um but even just </connor>
<connor> capturing a bit of that energy and </connor>
<connor> putting it like just hearing that crowd </connor>
<joey> scream </joey>
<joey> it's it's it's something that can't be </joey>
<joey> replicated and </joey>
<joey> like i know um and i i think it was </joey>
<joey> china </joey>
<joey> that tried adding like that that they </joey>
<joey> tried the cans laughter effect where </joey>
<connor> they they they added </connor>
<joey> fake crowds effects yeah yeah yeah to </joey>
<joey> the league of legends yeah yeah i think </joey>
<joey> so i heard </joey>
<joey> about this this stuff like someone's </joey>
<joey> probably gonna fact check and call me </joey>
<connor> out on this but i think i heard that and </connor>
<connor> that just sounds i wouldn't be surprised </connor>
<garnt> that just sounds even worse </garnt>
<garnt> yeah if they did that just like the </garnt>
<connor> friends [ __ ] like soundtrack started </connor>
<joey> playing like the science old bass just </joey>
<joey> comes in </joey>
<joey> yeah because like i remember like uh you </joey>
<joey> know because february just passed and </joey>
<joey> like i love watching like the sumo </joey>
<joey> yeah and the sumo season is like during </joey>
<joey> the winter yeah so just finished but </joey>
<joey> like of course because it's a pandemic </joey>
<joey> you can't have people in this tiny you </joey>
<connor> know stadium </connor>
<joey> watching the summer so like yeah it was </joey>
<connor> really sad to see this like </connor>
<joey> massive sumo stadium only having maybe </joey>
<joey> like four people in it yeah </joey>
<joey> and it's just like and you know </joey>
<connor> obviously after every win right usually </connor>
<connor> the crowd you know like claps or like </connor>
<connor> cheers or something </connor>
<connor> but instead it's like someone does this </connor>
<joey> like epic win yeah and like </joey>
<joey> three people are clapping it just sounds </joey>
<joey> like a cow [ __ ] it just feels like </joey>
<garnt> there's zero stakes </garnt>
<connor> yeah you can't if you can't hear </connor>
<garnt> anything it's not hype at all yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's really interesting cause the sumo </joey>
<joey> they were like all wearing mash before </joey>
<joey> they got on stage yeah they take it off </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's just funny seeing them like all </joey>
<joey> right we have these precautions they </joey>
<connor> take their masks off they step up and </connor>
<connor> immediately just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] put their faces together i'm </connor>
<connor> like yeah i don't know i don't know </connor>
<joey> about this </joey>
<connor> there's not so much point i don't know </connor>
<joey> how socially distant sumoing is but i </joey>
<connor> mean </connor>
<garnt> it is funny how crowds can play into </garnt>
<garnt> sporting event hype because i </garnt>
<garnt> so i've been recommended a lot of like </garnt>
<connor> since we did the chess tournament i've </connor>
<garnt> been </garnt>
<garnt> like been recommended way more chess </garnt>
<connor> clips and been watching like share </connor>
<garnt> streamers like </garnt>
<garnt> hikaru and everything like that and </garnt>
<connor> there's just </connor>
<garnt> like there's just something about the </garnt>
<connor> image i had about chess before that was </connor>
<garnt> boring </garnt>
<garnt> and i feel a big part of that was just </garnt>
<garnt> how bored everyone looks in any big </garnt>
<garnt> chess crowd right it's it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> like people playing a chess tournament </connor>
<garnt> during a coughing </garnt>
<garnt> coughing event yeah and and what i've </garnt>
<garnt> what i've realized </garnt>
<garnt> i like one thing i've realized about how </garnt>
<garnt> we could like how the the image could be </garnt>
<garnt> easily changed was i was recommending </garnt>
<garnt> this other events </garnt>
<garnt> like clips of this other event where </garnt>
<garnt> it's just a bunch of grand masters </garnt>
<garnt> um who went who are just like chewing </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> uh shooting [ __ ] and having fun and they </garnt>
<garnt> were like having team tournaments and </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> and like trash talking each other and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like dude this seems like a </garnt>
<garnt> legit fun event and this </garnt>
<garnt> this could have easily changed the image </garnt>
<garnt> of chess </garnt>
<garnt> which i think it's it's great now that </garnt>
<garnt> the image of chess is being like slowly </garnt>
<garnt> changed </garnt>
<connor> you know i know not everyone will agree </connor>
<connor> with you going down </connor>
<garnt> i mean that's that's my opinion as a </garnt>
<connor> filthy casual chess player </connor>
<connor> gm tweeted out being like man it's such </connor>
<connor> a shame that chess is going in this </connor>
<connor> direction </connor>
<joey> yeah and then everyone's just like in </joey>
<joey> like a not serious direction yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah because you know chess has a lot of </joey>
<joey> history behind it and there's a lot of </joey>
<joey> people who are like it's it's </joey>
<joey> you know it's it's big brain it's </joey>
<connor> intelligent and it's being watered down </connor>
<connor> for these common folk you know </connor>
<garnt> yes i mean you you are like an ex you </garnt>
<garnt> know you you've played chess </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean for your country how do you </garnt>
<garnt> feel about it i mean you can it doesn't </garnt>
<joey> really seem like you had that like </joey>
<connor> purest view on it yeah </connor>
<connor> no because like i hated it because like </connor>
<connor> when i was doing it it was a bunch of </connor>
<connor> you know 60 year old white men who would </connor>
<connor> just be in charge of everything </connor>
<connor> and they talked about it like you were </connor>
<connor> like the [ __ ] night's god </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah culture like yeah because you </connor>
<connor> know it's taken very seriously in the uk </connor>
<connor> and the history behind it is like very </connor>
<connor> long and you know what not but </connor>
<connor> you know i don't give a [ __ ] i mean you </connor>
<connor> know if if the sports </connor>
<joey> you know wants to have more funding and </joey>
<joey> be more popular i think it's good thing </joey>
<joey> people get into chess i mean yeah it's a </joey>
<joey> good game </joey>
<joey> i think that it's you know one of the </joey>
<joey> probably the better better games your </joey>
<connor> kid can get into </connor>
<joey> yeah um i mean it's gonna evolve </joey>
<joey> together with the times right and pure </joey>
<connor> is always </connor>
<connor> behind you know i mean you know </connor>
<connor> unfortunately chess is </connor>
<connor> probably on its own a bit boring yeah </connor>
<connor> let's be honest right like i play it </connor>
<connor> i you know say that but i think you know </connor>
<connor> adding these tournaments that </connor>
<connor> don't really take away anything from the </connor>
<connor> pro scene you know if it gets you know </connor>
<connor> if you look at chess viewership on </connor>
<connor> twitch you know outside of like pog </connor>
<connor> champs and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> the big chess streamers viewership has </connor>
<garnt> grown a lot i mean </garnt>
<garnt> how many street how many viewers does </garnt>
<connor> hikaru get now it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> 25k yeah and it's it's [ __ ] great </connor>
<garnt> because before you literally could not </garnt>
<garnt> make money </garnt>
<garnt> play like players there's so many big </garnt>
<garnt> chat streamers now yeah and it's really </garnt>
<garnt> epic </garnt>
<joey> you know epic one it's really </joey>
<joey> interesting that's coming up </joey>
<joey> it's pretty epic seeing uh that like you </joey>
<connor> know there's room for </connor>
<connor> like many chess streamers to make a </connor>
<garnt> living off this and stream it and you </garnt>
<connor> know </connor>
<garnt> i mean it makes sense right like i mean </garnt>
<connor> it it's really taught me how important </connor>
<connor> images </connor>
<garnt> yeah in regards to like a sport and </garnt>
<connor> stuff like that because yes you know </connor>
<connor> there's there's </connor>
<connor> there's you know you got to respect the </connor>
<connor> legacy and history and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> but you get to a point where </connor>
<connor> it's modernized yeah it needs to </connor>
<connor> modernize they need to catch up with the </connor>
<connor> times and i've </connor>
<connor> it's great because i've gotten way more </connor>
<connor> into chess simply because </connor>
<garnt> it just it just looks funner yeah you </garnt>
<connor> know it looks way more fun </connor>
<connor> and i mean there's like like stuff like </connor>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> everyone thinks that sports like rules </joey>
<joey> don't change yeah like rules are like </joey>
<joey> sacred but like stuff like basketball </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty sure the nba changes the rule </joey>
<joey> have changed the rules a few times based </joey>
<joey> on what makes a </joey>
<joey> more fun viewing experience yeah yeah so </joey>
<joey> it begs to question is like what's more </joey>
<joey> important the sport or </joey>
<joey> the audience yeah and so i think chess </joey>
<joey> is out there for crossroads where </joey>
<joey> there's obviously people who have been </joey>
<joey> training their whole life to be </joey>
<joey> you know pros and whatnot yeah and </joey>
<joey> obviously it sucks that maybe your sport </joey>
<joey> is a little less serious </joey>
<joey> but on the other hand you have way more </joey>
<connor> opportunities way more money </connor>
<connor> you know way more chance to have a </connor>
<connor> platform and do whatever you want and if </connor>
<connor> you want to </connor>
<connor> be on the sidelines being salty about it </connor>
<connor> you're probably going to be the one left </connor>
<connor> behind yeah </connor>
<joey> it's it's a balance at the end of the </joey>
<connor> day right yeah you can't go too far in </connor>
<garnt> either direction </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i feel that like i remember when </garnt>
<connor> hikari got signed up for tsm </connor>
<connor> i was just like holy [ __ ] that's pretty </connor>
<joey> cool this this is a pogba </joey>
<joey> that is a part right </joey>
<joey> like like just just like imagine imagine </joey>
<joey> if we had a chess tournament where </joey>
<joey> people showed up in like esports gowns </joey>
<joey> you know in </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] esports shirts and stuff like </joey>
<garnt> that that would be pretty hype in my </garnt>
<garnt> opinion but obviously i'm a filthy </garnt>
<garnt> casual </garnt>
<garnt> don't play i don't play chess out of </garnt>
<garnt> anything but just casually so </garnt>
<connor> that's just my opinion i totally forgot </connor>
<connor> i played in chatham like last week </connor>
<joey> i totally forgot i did that oh yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> oh yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah it was fine i mean i had like one </joey>
<connor> hour sleep so it's pretty brutal and i </connor>
<connor> had to film </connor>
<garnt> like i had to go somewhere i mean you </garnt>
<garnt> say that but you're like knowing your </garnt>
<garnt> schedule i kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> i was like kind of you were you're </garnt>
<garnt> addicted to apex back then </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah you kind of did it to </joey>
<connor> yourself yeah you kind of did it you </connor>
<connor> know i did i just you know you just say </connor>
<joey> yes to something and you're like you </joey>
<joey> don't really think about like how it </joey>
<joey> will like </joey>
<joey> actually fit into your schedule it just </joey>
<joey> sounds cool until it happens </joey>
<connor> yeah so i got invited to twitch rivals </connor>
<connor> which was like they wanted to do like a </connor>
<connor> chess tournament where </connor>
<connor> you get paired with like a gm or </connor>
<joey> something and they tell you which piece </joey>
<joey> to move </joey>
<joey> and you have to choose which of that </joey>
<connor> piece if they say pawn </connor>
<joey> you choose which of the eight pawns to </joey>
<connor> move right and so it's pretty fun i mean </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i haven't played chess in a like since </joey>
<joey> our tournament yeah so i was pretty </joey>
<joey> rusty and obviously </joey>
<joey> not having much sleep and so yeah but it </joey>
<joey> was good fun i like doing it it's fun i </joey>
<joey> like playing chess but it's really </joey>
<joey> annoying how like there's some comments </joey>
<joey> as well that like bro </joey>
<joey> conor wasn't kind of didn't play like </joey>
<connor> when he was a kid that's a lie he's so </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] now and i'm like </joey>
<connor> bro if you didn't play for like seven </connor>
<joey> years and you played now i bet you </joey>
<joey> probably wouldn't ever heard about you </joey>
<joey> ever heard of a gap </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and also i think i'm probably </joey>
<joey> like the same </joey>
<joey> level or probably better as a child than </joey>
<joey> i am now yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah which could be weird to say i mean </joey>
<connor> like yeah i mean i mean </connor>
<connor> it's the same logic it's like oh you </connor>
<connor> learned the quadratic equation during </connor>
<connor> school and you can't do it now you </connor>
<connor> didn't learn it </connor>
<connor> yeah it's also like people think like </connor>
<connor> you know how good do you think that like </connor>
<connor> 12 11 year olds are at this game like </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean i yeah there are some exceptions </connor>
<connor> of amazing </connor>
<joey> characters there's only so many magnus </joey>
<connor> castles right yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and i was like bro i was like the worst </connor>
<garnt> on my team yeah i just sneaked in </garnt>
<garnt> like i remember when i was talking about </garnt>
<garnt> you know my uh </garnt>
<garnt> my masters and i was like explain to you </garnt>
<garnt> i couldn't remember what </garnt>
<connor> equation i was talking about it was </connor>
<connor> second order differential equations i </connor>
<connor> remember that now and </connor>
<connor> connor says is it integer you're </connor>
<connor> thinking of and i guess i was like </connor>
<connor> yeah i guess there was i think i should </connor>
<connor> know too as well i also have an </connor>
<connor> engineering yeah there was so many </connor>
<garnt> comments being like god's word </garnt>
<garnt> god didn't pass his masters can't even </garnt>
<connor> remember that jesus christ </connor>
<connor> if you don't use something surprisingly </connor>
<connor> you forget it yeah you'll </connor>
<joey> have to understand that a lot of times </joey>
<joey> during this podcast a lot of us are just </joey>
<joey> brain dead </joey>
<joey> we're just we're just chatting it's just </joey>
<connor> like again you know it's the whole vibe </connor>
<joey> of the show </joey>
<joey> we just talk we don't really plan </joey>
<joey> anything none of the topics ever planned </joey>
<connor> beforehand we just </connor>
<connor> we just kind of shoot the [ __ ] you know </connor>
<joey> we didn't plan to go in the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> masters talk of engineering </connor>
<connor> like i'm sure if i applied for an </connor>
<connor> engineering job i'm more qualified than </connor>
<connor> someone who is like hasn't got the </connor>
<connor> degree but might be studying that thing </connor>
<connor> yeah who probably knows more than me at </connor>
<garnt> this current time but because i haven't </garnt>
<connor> done anything </connor>
<connor> yeah like three years like [ __ ] i don't </connor>
<connor> know i mean you forget </connor>
<garnt> you forget i forgot everything i did i </garnt>
<connor> finally understand that he knew it at </connor>
<connor> the time yeah </connor>
<connor> that's the thing i i feel like now i </connor>
<connor> finally understand how like </connor>
<connor> my parents felt when i was like going to </connor>
<joey> them and being like can you help me with </joey>
<connor> this math equation it's like you you </connor>
<connor> finished school right you've done this </connor>
<connor> before </connor>
<connor> and my parents are like uh i i don't </connor>
<joey> know how to do this i'm like what do you </joey>
<garnt> mean you don't know how to do it </garnt>
<garnt> you did this in school i think i can't </garnt>
<garnt> even remember like having passed my </garnt>
<garnt> masters in engineering i probably can't </garnt>
<garnt> remember how to do basic trigonometry </garnt>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<connor> if someone came if like some </connor>
<garnt> ten-year-old came up to me and was like </garnt>
<connor> can you help me solve this long division </connor>
<joey> equation i'd be like [ __ ] so far </joey>
<joey> i don't know how to [ __ ] to do this to </joey>
<connor> like research real quick but i'm sure </connor>
<joey> i can get the answer let me google it </joey>
<garnt> real quick like i totally get that now </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i remember as a kid you're </garnt>
<connor> just like </connor>
<garnt> how can you not know this you're an </garnt>
<connor> adult you know everything you learned </connor>
<garnt> this before </garnt>
<connor> you know how you see this [ __ ] like </connor>
<garnt> facebook quizzes that pop up that are </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you know it'll be like different tanks </connor>
<connor> of water it'll be like which one will </connor>
<connor> fill up first </connor>
<connor> yeah and that was like literally like </connor>
<joey> part of my fluids exam we had stuff like </joey>
<joey> that and i'm like back in the day i'm </joey>
<joey> sure i can answer that </joey>
<joey> right now i got no [ __ ] idea because </joey>
