<connor> orange is the worst flavoring known to </connor>
<joey> man i think orange is like strong are </joey>
<joey> you from australian sarcasm or are you </joey>
<connor> like actually serious </connor>
<joey> what's up lads welcome to another </joey>
<joey> episode of the trash taste podcast i'm </joey>
<garnt> your boy joey and i'm with my other two </garnt>
<garnt> boys and connor and we are back in japan </garnt>
<garnt> where are we right now what is this </garnt>
<garnt> place where are we you know what's scary </garnt>
<garnt> i realized just today that it's been </garnt>
<garnt> three months since we've recorded here </garnt>
<garnt> yeah has it actually yeah the last time </garnt>
<garnt> we filmed which was the goodbye japan </garnt>
<connor> episode i think was like mid-may that we </connor>
<connor> recorded that well i recorded a trash </connor>
<connor> taste podcast episode was like june </connor>
<garnt> something yeah so it's been a month in </garnt>
<joey> l.a right that we last recorded yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's been it's been over a month since </garnt>
<joey> we recorded our last trash taste it's </joey>
<garnt> been three months since we were here </garnt>
<joey> yeah so uh i don't know how to podcast </joey>
<garnt> yeah well uh i guess welcome back to the </garnt>
<joey> japan studio guys uh the la arc is not </joey>
<joey> over yet we just thought you guys might </joey>
<joey> just miss just the three of us have a </joey>
<joey> bit of a breath </joey>
<joey> we're gonna have a little bit of a </joey>
<joey> breather and just come back with just </joey>
<garnt> the three of us because we haven't </garnt>
<garnt> actually been able to talk about </garnt>
<joey> anything that we've done abroad yet sure </joey>
<joey> talk sure let's let's talk but uh as you </joey>
<joey> guys can see from the title of this </joey>
<joey> episode uh the first topic we're going </joey>
<garnt> to be talking about is our tour yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so we've announced it now tickets are on </garnt>
<garnt> sale but i know there's been a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> questions that's been up in the year uh </garnt>
<garnt> just because we haven't really been able </garnt>
<garnt> to talk much about it on the podcast </garnt>
<joey> because we've been busy on a different </joey>
<joey> tour </joey>
<joey> but yes we will be touring north america </joey>
<joey> even though it's just like all of </joey>
<connor> america and then one show in canada it's </connor>
<joey> north america guys it's north america </joey>
<joey> the canadians are like yeah </joey>
<connor> i know a lot of people asked uh okay </connor>
<connor> there's been a ton of questions about </connor>
<connor> the tour yeah because like a lot of </connor>
<connor> people like because we're too fair we </connor>
<connor> haven't been very good at explaining </connor>
<connor> what's yes yes uh the first one was why </connor>
<connor> not other locations uh well the main </connor>
<connor> reason we chose america i think is </connor>
<connor> because uh it just made sense and it was </connor>
<garnt> easier </garnt>
<connor> yeah well also uh logistics and most </connor>
<connor> more importantly visas </connor>
<connor> yeah visas is a massive headache uh so </connor>
<connor> when you want to go to a like a </connor>
<connor> southeast asia tour or a europe tour um </connor>
<connor> we would have to think way more than uh </connor>
<connor> what we would need to do in america </connor>
<joey> because that's basically just one </joey>
<joey> country </joey>
<joey> and that's taken up enough resources </joey>
<joey> just setting up this one tour because </joey>
<joey> the reason we wanted to do this tour is </joey>
<joey> that we've wanted to do a tour since </joey>
<joey> cove it happens right yeah yeah yeah i </joey>
<connor> mean we've been planning this for about </connor>
<connor> like a year or so uh as an as a back </connor>
<connor> burner idea and then suddenly the world </connor>
<connor> opened up and we were just like guys </connor>
<connor> we're going to do it now we've got to do </connor>
<connor> it now </connor>
<connor> not knowing that we kind of slid this </connor>
<garnt> tour in on possibly like already the </garnt>
<joey> busiest year of our lives oh no it's </joey>
<joey> absolutely the business yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> exactly for sure but like yeah i guess </garnt>
<joey> the other reason as well like we chose </joey>
<joey> america specifically because it's like </joey>
<connor> it's kind of on brand for trash taste </connor>
<joey> you know yeah if you've been on uh our </joey>
<connor> afternoon streams especially uh which by </connor>
<joey> the way you totally should if you </joey>
<joey> haven't then uh we uh we like to talk </joey>
<joey> about america listen we </joey>
<joey> it's obvious we're obviously we're </joey>
<connor> obsessed with the americans yeah </connor>
<connor> but also our biggest audience is in </connor>
<connor> america so this just made the most sense </connor>
<joey> really and you know we hate them because </joey>
<joey> we ain't them </joey>
<connor> we hate we just hate that we aren't you </connor>
<joey> yeah okay yeah and you know i don't </joey>
<joey> think we've ruled out the possibility of </joey>
<joey> doing tours in future in other locations </joey>
<garnt> yeah is this but like it also no </garnt>
<connor> promises that we'll ever do another </connor>
<garnt> promises no because we might we might be </garnt>
<connor> like oh no that was that was a lot yeah </connor>
<connor> we might [ __ ] hate it </connor>
<connor> none of us have ever been on a tour </connor>
<connor> before none of us have ever been close </connor>
<connor> to anything like this yeah so this is </connor>
<connor> new for all of us and so we figured you </connor>
<connor> know what better place to do it to start </connor>
<connor> it off than uh in a place that we're </connor>
<connor> hopefully a little more familiar with </connor>
<joey> when it comes to our audience and stuff </joey>
<connor> like that and uh you know </connor>
<connor> we should go around all the us none of </connor>
<connor> us have ever been around like every </connor>
<joey> single state yeah yeah yeah not even </joey>
<garnt> close like like there's so much of </garnt>
<garnt> america considering how much we've [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> on america there's so much of america </connor>
<connor> that we've just never been to yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> absolutely what are you googling uh i'm </connor>
<garnt> googling the exact cities that we're </garnt>
<connor> going to be going oh yeah yeah okay so </connor>
<garnt> keep keep talking guys i was going to </garnt>
<garnt> say because i saw one comment that was </garnt>
<connor> like it's so [ __ ] they talk about </connor>
<connor> america because they've only been in l.a </connor>
<connor> well [ __ ] you this is what i'm doing </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm going around all of your </joey>
<joey> country absolutely not sure i am going </joey>
<connor> to all of your country so that i can say </connor>
<connor> that i know your country better than you </connor>
<connor> and i will talk [ __ ] about it how many </connor>
<joey> states have you guys been to so far </joey>
<garnt> quite a lot actually yeah i feel like i </garnt>
<joey> think you guys have been to more than me </joey>
<joey> yeah i bet you fair amount of states </joey>
<connor> actually yeah yeah i've been like maybe </connor>
<joey> 10 or 15. i'd say probably around that </joey>
<joey> area as well yeah yeah i mean because </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry montana what am i going to do </joey>
<joey> montana </joey>
<joey> why montana specifically because i've </joey>
<joey> never heard anyone talk about montana </joey>
<joey> sorry dakota the only thing i know about </joey>
<joey> montana is hannah and that's it </joey>
<joey> i mean that's all you need to know she </joey>
<connor> has done more pr for the state of </connor>
<garnt> montana than anyone else hey hey hey hey </garnt>
<garnt> tony from scarface tony it's tony </garnt>
<joey> montana tony montana </joey>
<garnt> he might not even be from montana i </garnt>
<connor> don't know that might just be a name </connor>
<joey> i hate to i hate to break your heart god </joey>
<joey> i think hannah montana is a little more </joey>
<joey> street cred currently is hannah montana </joey>
<connor> based in montana i don't even know i </connor>
<connor> think it's tennessee </connor>
<garnt> tennessee </garnt>
<garnt> which we will be going to tennessee </garnt>
<joey> actually can you fact-check </joey>
<connor> that where is hannah montana where is </connor>
<connor> hannah montana from </connor>
<garnt> i don't know this i was obsessed but to </garnt>
<garnt> name all of the places that we're going </garnt>

<joey> orlando florida dallas and austin in </joey>
<joey> texas </joey>
<joey> i mean texas is a big state yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah kansas city in </connor>
<joey> you got this i know you got it come on </joey>
<joey> do you know your states no i don't </joey>
<garnt> what's what's the initials ammo what's </garnt>
<joey> our [ __ ] i've already failed the america </joey>
<joey> geography test is it </joey>
<joey> montana </joey>
<joey> no it's not </joey>
<joey> i was like what starts with an ammo </joey>
<connor> montana i know that one gonna save us i </connor>
<joey> actually don't know this one wait ammo </joey>
<joey> is uh </joey>
<garnt> well we got this we got this </garnt>
<joey> i thought kansas city was in kansas </joey>
<joey> but it's not i found out today that </joey>
<joey> kansas is not a state so it's uh no </joey>
<joey> kansas is a state but kansas city is not </joey>
<connor> in kansas this is missouri </connor>
<joey> okay missouri sought that out wait hold </joey>
<joey> on kansas city yeah no it can't be mi </joey>
<joey> because michigan that's why oh yeah </joey>
<joey> kansas city okay hold on let's get this </joey>
<joey> straight so </joey>
<joey> kansas city is not in kansas </joey>
<joey> how does that make sense </joey>
<connor> because there is a kansas city in canada </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty sure as well oh so there's </connor>
<joey> two kansas cities well it's like how </joey>
<joey> there's like a billion londons god damn </joey>
<joey> it okay okay anyway </joey>
<garnt> guys we haven't even started yet we're </garnt>
<garnt> already complaining we're already </garnt>
<garnt> complaining </garnt>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> missouri is like right next to kansas </joey>
<joey> yes yeah i think kansas city is </joey>
<joey> literally like 10-minute [ __ ] drive </joey>
<joey> oh really i think maybe i'm i maybe have </joey>
<joey> pollock it's very close missouri's like </joey>
<connor> that's ours now yeah i think so i think </connor>
<connor> they were like let's just take that over </connor>
<garnt> we've got denver colorado yeah salt lake </garnt>
<connor> uh salt lake city soul play </connor>
<joey> flake if you don't come to the city </joey>
<joey> salt lake city in utah phoenix arizona </joey>
<garnt> la san francisco in california uh </garnt>
<garnt> seattle in washington and portland </garnt>
<joey> oregon nice see i haven't been to most </joey>
<connor> of those places yeah i i've always </connor>
<connor> wanted to go </connor>
<joey> it's been like a dream of mine to always </joey>
<connor> just go around the us anyway oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> i think i think that's part of the </connor>
<connor> reason why we wanted to do this tour </connor>
<connor> which was it's a reason for us to go to </connor>
<connor> all the places we've wanted to go in the </connor>
<garnt> us and we've just never had the </garnt>
<garnt> opportunity uh to go to before hold on i </garnt>
<joey> think we're getting breaking news </joey>
<connor> where's hannah montana from </connor>
<connor> oh my god oh i know my [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bigger question why is hannah montana </connor>
<joey> called hannah montana why is it not </joey>
<connor> hannah 10. because it doesn't work </connor>
<connor> because hannah tennessee doesn't rhyme </connor>
<joey> well then based it on montana </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] okay </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] tv </joey>
<joey> but yeah no as god was saying like it's </joey>
<joey> a great excuse for us to actually go </joey>
<connor> around america and i feel like we'll </connor>
<connor> actually be able to on this tour we'll </connor>
<connor> be able to get kind of a more i guess </connor>
<joey> in-depth look into america as well </joey>
<connor> because we'll actually be on a tour bus </connor>
<joey> which yeah i'm really excited for </joey>
<joey> yeah as like someone who's like super </joey>
<joey> into like rock music and stuff and just </joey>
<joey> like seeing rock bands go on like tour </joey>
<garnt> buses and stuff i'm like i want that i </garnt>
<garnt> think i'm i i think i'm excited for the </garnt>
<connor> idea of a tube of a tour bus you know </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm not yeah i heard that you don't </joey>
<connor> have a poop on it so yeah yeah i'm </connor>
<connor> disappointed because i like to have </connor>
<joey> boundaries oh well it's uh five weeks of </joey>
<garnt> constipation then boys yeah because i've </garnt>
<connor> seen pictures and basically we're just </connor>
<connor> going to be in bunk beds for an entire </connor>
<connor> closed bunk beds yeah close bunk beds </connor>
<connor> for an entire two months we're basically </connor>
<connor> going to be asking that's fine yeah </connor>
<garnt> we're basically just going to be in a </garnt>
<connor> space shuttle for like a month right </connor>
<connor> yeah doesn't that sound cool </connor>
<garnt> i mean it's going to be a real test of </garnt>
<garnt> our friendship i mean these guys cool i </garnt>
<garnt> i i love these guys i love these guys </garnt>
<joey> but i don't know how i'm going to be </joey>
<joey> after sitting with them for like what </joey>
<garnt> was it five weeks which one for five </garnt>
<joey> years in a cramped little bus i think uh </joey>
<joey> i think like aaron was especially saying </joey>
<joey> um that like </joey>
<joey> definitely what makes a tour bus </joey>
<joey> experience the best is if you have like </joey>
<connor> a tour family quote unquote which is </connor>
<connor> like you know like all of the other like </connor>
<connor> producers and like tour people who are </connor>
<connor> coming on with you like if you can vibe </connor>
<connor> with them yeah then it makes the tour </connor>
<connor> bus experience a million times better </connor>
<connor> right so fingers crossed we have a nice </connor>
<connor> tour family otherwise we're going to be </connor>
<connor> at each other's throats but um yeah i </connor>
<joey> mean i guess like you know because we </joey>
<joey> chose the tour bus experience i think </joey>
<joey> because it's you know for one i feel </joey>
<joey> like you get to see more of america yeah </joey>
<joey> you know because we're going to be </joey>
<joey> driving from you know city to city and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that whereas like i don't </joey>
<joey> know if you fly you i feel like you miss </joey>
<joey> a lot of what goes on in between you </joey>
<joey> know yeah exactly because it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like there there are some places where </joey>
<garnt> people say they've visited but you've uh </garnt>
<garnt> but really they've just visited like the </garnt>
<garnt> airport right you know and i don't </garnt>
<garnt> really count that or you like visited </garnt>
<garnt> the city yeah but like you haven't </garnt>
<garnt> really like actually seen outside of the </garnt>
<garnt> cities of america and you know yeah </garnt>
<joey> we're talking about america there's a </joey>
<garnt> lot of outside the city let's be honest </garnt>
<garnt> guys we're trash tastes we're here to </garnt>
<garnt> make america content right </garnt>
<garnt> we're here to get the stories </garnt>
<connor> i mean we will be vlogging the entire </connor>
<connor> thing as well so you guys who aren't </connor>
<joey> attending the tour will you know still </joey>
<connor> get something out of it hopefully i </connor>
<connor> think a lot of america is very similar </connor>
<connor> though like americans like to pretend </connor>
<garnt> like it's very diverse but if you look </garnt>
<connor> at like any pictures of any road in </connor>
<garnt> america they all look exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> save it save it okay yes because because </garnt>
<garnt> we can we we would be able to confirm </garnt>
<connor> that yeah yeah yeah i'm just saying this </connor>
<joey> now let's see if i still feel this way </joey>
<connor> keep the bar low so that when cool </connor>
<joey> things do happen we can be like </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> just monstrosity gas stations that are </joey>
<joey> massive they're like the middle of the </joey>
<garnt> highway yeah because i've seen some of </garnt>
<joey> them some of the dentist office yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah in the middle of like guest stop </connor>
<garnt> it's insane do you think people are </garnt>
<garnt> going to still be complaining about gas </garnt>
<connor> prices by the time we get there yeah </connor>
<connor> that's that's i i hope it is because </connor>
<connor> otherwise i don't know how to talk to </connor>
<garnt> people in the u.s that's that's my </garnt>
<connor> opening line every single time the </connor>
<connor> ultimate icebreaker </connor>
<joey> it's the american life hack if you want </joey>
<connor> to start a conversation you just talk </connor>
<garnt> about gas prices it works every single </garnt>
<joey> day and they're like oh thank god he's </joey>
<joey> on my side </joey>
<connor> but yeah i guess the other thing as well </connor>
<garnt> for you guys who have potentially </garnt>
<garnt> already bought tickets or are thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about buying tickets uh is uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> what we're going to be doing what can </garnt>
<garnt> you do what can you expect what can you </garnt>
<garnt> expect and you know obviously we don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to give too much away because we </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to you know keep an element of </garnt>
<joey> surprise for you guys who are actually </joey>
<joey> coming on tour but um let's just say it </joey>
<joey> won't just be this it won't just be us </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's not just a talk show yes it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's not a live podcast </garnt>
<connor> if that's what you were thinking there </connor>
<connor> will be some of that there will be a </connor>
<connor> little bit of talking yes just just a </connor>
<connor> little bit of talking but if you were </connor>
<connor> expecting some of the panels that you </connor>
<connor> might have seen get leaked online from </connor>
<connor> like us at like ax </connor>
<connor> or also like any other conventions that </connor>
<connor> we've been to in the past few months </connor>
<connor> it's going to be a bit more of like it's </connor>
<connor> going to be a bit of that but more crowd </connor>
<connor> interactions and more bringing what you </connor>
<connor> know trash taste for onto a live stage </connor>
<connor> yeah as much opportunity as much </connor>
<garnt> opportunity to get you guys involved </garnt>
<garnt> with uh some of the [ __ ] that we get up </garnt>
<joey> to on stage yeah so you guys won't </joey>
<connor> merely just be sitting in the crowd you </connor>
<connor> know hopefully laughing to our [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> jokes like you guys will actually be </connor>
<joey> involved with the show yeah there'll be </joey>
<connor> some segments where </connor>
<connor> a lot of your interaction yes uh will be </connor>
<connor> required and it should lead for some </connor>
<connor> interesting results because yeah you </connor>
<connor> know because we're doing the show a lot </connor>
<connor> of you know we're gonna be doing this 20 </connor>
<connor> times yeah we want it to be different </connor>
<connor> every time yeah so one of the main </connor>
<connor> reasons that we decided we want to get </connor>
<connor> as much viewer interaction as possible </connor>
<connor> is that all right we want to make it so </connor>
<joey> that we don't get bored of teams yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah that every single show is different </joey>
<joey> but also can we try and like suss out </joey>
<connor> some of the segments i wonder if i do </connor>
<connor> this the next time it'll it'll yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah exactly it'll it'll kind of be like </joey>
<connor> a a growing theme for us as well with </connor>
<connor> every show as well so i did see a lot of </connor>
<connor> people in the comments and stuff like </connor>
<joey> that being like oh are they just going </joey>
<joey> to like talk on stage for now short </joey>
<joey> answer is no it'll be a lot more than </joey>
<joey> that basically if you've heard some of </joey>
<joey> our takes or some of the [ __ ] that we've </joey>
<connor> said and you've ever wanted to clown on </connor>
<connor> us in real life this is probably the </connor>
<joey> closest </joey>
<joey> this is this is this is the closest </joey>
<connor> you're ever going to get because we're </connor>
<garnt> going to give you that opportunity yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's that's all i'll say about that </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah i saw a lot of people </connor>
<connor> asking like oh what's the how long do </connor>
<connor> you reckon the show is going to be uh we </connor>
<connor> still haven't like 100 percent decided </connor>
<connor> the exact timing because we haven't </connor>
<connor> rehearsed it all yet no but we've been </connor>
<connor> going through it we reckon it'll be </connor>
<connor> around i don't know like hour 45 to </connor>
<connor> maybe just two hours yeah yeah so you </connor>
<garnt> know should be a good show yeah because </garnt>
<connor> i think we've been to like a few live </connor>
<connor> shows in the past few months we went to </connor>
<connor> uh mogul money live yeah at ludwig's </connor>
<connor> live event as well and that definitely </connor>
<connor> taught us a lot because i was thinking </connor>
<connor> man two hours is just like a normal </connor>
<connor> trash taste episode right i don't know i </connor>
<connor> don't know if that's like long enough </connor>
<connor> for like something special but </connor>
<connor> what i've realized being in a live show </connor>
<connor> is that you can't just pause the show </connor>
<connor> that's the big thing i've noticed is </connor>
<connor> that you can't just pause trash taste </connor>
<connor> and just go off and do your own thing </connor>
<connor> and then come back you're going to be </connor>
<connor> sitting there for the full time and </connor>
<connor> there will be breaks maybe here and </connor>
<joey> there but we want to make the show as </joey>
<joey> entertaining as it possible for everyone </joey>
<joey> sitting down because it's not like a </joey>
<joey> normal trash taste episode where you can </joey>
<joey> just take breaks you know you can go to </joey>
<joey> the toilet you can just put us on the </joey>
<garnt> second monitor no we are main monitor </garnt>
<joey> this time there is no other monitor okay </joey>
<joey> close those tabs there is only one tab </joey>
<connor> open </connor>
<connor> and it's us i think as well uh one of </connor>
<connor> the other things is that uh [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> forgot what i was going to say and then </connor>
<connor> i had the thought </connor>
<connor> i had it in the forefront of my head and </connor>
<connor> then </connor>
<garnt> i threw my head off yeah </garnt>
<garnt> uh uh i was going to say something </garnt>
<garnt> to do with the show it was sent through </garnt>
<garnt> the show okay and i forgot oh one of the </garnt>
<garnt> main things we i think we went into this </garnt>
<garnt> and when we planned out the show is that </garnt>
<garnt> because we understand that not every </garnt>
<garnt> single person who's gonna go to the show </garnt>
<connor> is gonna be a gigantic trash taste fan </connor>
<connor> yep we have kept in mind we just want to </connor>
<connor> make a good show we didn't try to make </connor>
<connor> it of like a complete fan service thing </connor>
<connor> it's like if you want to just turn up </connor>
<connor> have hopefully a fun show should be </connor>
<joey> there yeah so if you you know say for </joey>
<joey> example you're the only one in your </joey>
<joey> friend group who watches and listens to </joey>
<joey> trash taste then there is i i think i </joey>
<connor> would like to think that like we've kind </connor>
<connor> of structured this show so that even if </connor>
<connor> you have the bare minimum idea of who we </connor>
<connor> are and what this show is yeah you can </connor>
<connor> hopefully still enjoy yourself yeah you </connor>
<connor> should be able to yeah so you can bring </connor>
<connor> a plus one you know you can bring your </connor>
<connor> friend who has maybe not doesn't know </connor>
<joey> anything about us and be like you want </joey>
<joey> to go watch three idiots on stage talk </joey>
<joey> about some [ __ ] and do some fun stuff </joey>
<garnt> that's totally what it's gonna be yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah we want to we wanted this to </garnt>
<garnt> be as newbie friendly as possible like </garnt>
<garnt> all our content uh we just wanted to i </garnt>
<connor> guess like we just wanted to be this is </connor>
<connor> kind of like trash tasters final form </connor>
<connor> it's like taking everything that we've </connor>
<joey> learned from the podcast from after dark </joey>
<connor> yeah from touring around ultra instinct </connor>

<joey> everyone in everywhere else in the world </joey>
<joey> just like kind of crying right now not </joey>
<joey> being able to come to the america show i </joey>
<joey> think for for all three of us this is </joey>
<joey> kind of like a litmus test yes um </joey>
<joey> because we do i do want to travel to </joey>
<connor> more places i do want to travel to more </connor>
<connor> places across the world i mean i'd want </connor>
<connor> to travel to our home cities home </connor>
<joey> countries go on represent our own </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] regions right exactly exactly um </joey>
<joey> i think we are kind of using this tour </joey>
<joey> as a barometer not only for how natural </joey>
<joey> barometer </joey>
<connor> we're using it as a gauge okay </connor>
<connor> as a gauge not only to see how much it </connor>
<connor> affects our mental well-being doing a </connor>
<connor> tour this intensive uh but just seeing </connor>
<connor> if this is financially viable to uh </connor>
<connor> pursue visas and all the logistics in </connor>
<connor> other places that might be more </connor>
<connor> difficult as well um so you know </connor>
<connor> americans please show up because you </connor>
<connor> might give the chance to uh other people </connor>
<connor> from around the world to be able to </connor>
<connor> experience what you're experiencing as </connor>
<connor> well yeah yeah and uh i think that's </connor>
<garnt> basically everything we want to like </garnt>
<joey> kind of like spoiler so if you're </joey>
<joey> watching uh this episode right now and </joey>
<joey> you were kind of on the fence of whether </joey>
<joey> you want to come to the show or not then </joey>

<connor> this is one of those things where we all </connor>
<connor> agreed to it like very early on okay </connor>
<connor> we're going to do this i think </connor>
<joey> especially looking at our tour schedule </joey>
<joey> and tour like our our schedule and </joey>
<joey> breaking down logistics and what we're </joey>
<joey> gonna do on tour i went from yeah this </joey>
<joey> is a great idea to like holy [ __ ] this </joey>
<joey> is that's a lot of work terrifying yeah </joey>
<joey> and now especially we've just come back </joey>
<connor> from traveling for about two and a half </connor>
<garnt> months i'm already [ __ ] knackered </garnt>
<joey> from traveling right sure </joey>
<joey> yeah regardless of whether this tour </joey>
<connor> does well or not and if we decide to do </connor>
<connor> future tours uh it's probably not gonna </connor>
<connor> happen for a while because just well not </connor>
<joey> this year at least at least not this </joey>
<connor> year because all three of us are it's </connor>
<connor> not even possible to do this yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> because all three of us are definitely </joey>
<garnt> absolutely [ __ ] knackered yeah </garnt>
<joey> touring already or just not touring but </joey>
<garnt> like traveling i guess uh you know which </garnt>
<joey> we can talk about because it's been uh a </joey>
<garnt> while since we've talked yeah it has </garnt>
<joey> well it's not been awhile since we've </joey>
<joey> talked it's been a while it's been a </joey>
<joey> while since we talked about what we did </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> this episode is sponsored by </joey>
<joey> expressvpn lads watching netflix without </joey>
<joey> using expressvpn is kind of like going </joey>
<joey> to a taylor swift concert but only being </joey>
<joey> able to watch the opening act </joey>

<joey> anyone want it why would you do that </joey>
<joey> well you see gentlemen that's exactly </joey>
<joey> what netflix does netflix has different </joey>
<joey> content libraries for every country </joey>
<joey> which means even though netflix has </joey>
<joey> thousands of shows without a vpn you can </joey>
<joey> only get access to a fraction of the </joey>
<garnt> shows that are available with expressvpn </garnt>
<garnt> you can control where netflix or other </garnt>
<garnt> streaming sites think that you're </garnt>
<garnt> streaming from connor what have you been </garnt>
<connor> watching on netflix recently well i've </connor>

<garnt> taste that's </garnt>
<garnt> expressvpn.com trash taste get an extra </garnt>
<connor> three months for free don't back to the </connor>
<garnt> episode yeah yeah movie yeah because we </garnt>
<garnt> did we've been traveling i think for </garnt>
<connor> like how long have you guys been </connor>
<garnt> traveling because i've been traveling </garnt>
<garnt> for almost three months i don't really </garnt>
<garnt> count the week i was back i was </garnt>
<joey> traveling </joey>
<joey> you've been traveling all right i was </joey>
<connor> traveling for a little over two months </connor>
<connor> i think i was just under two months yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's way too long </garnt>
<joey> because one thing i think i've realized </joey>
<joey> is that we tried to like </joey>
<joey> like test a lot of little things to see </joey>
<joey> if this tour would be possible one thing </joey>
<joey> was this intense travel schedule that we </joey>
<connor> had over the past three months to be </connor>
<connor> like can we do this without going insane </connor>
<connor> well it definitely [ __ ] burnt not </connor>
<connor> burned me up but it definitely took a </connor>
<connor> toll but it didn't make me go insane </connor>
<connor> that's a good thing yeah and also we did </connor>
<joey> uh we announced the road trip special as </joey>
<joey> well oh yes yeah yes did so we have </joey>
<garnt> spent a week an intensive week with each </garnt>
<connor> other in the same car yeah that was a </connor>
<connor> lot that that was a lot yeah that that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] was how nine days was it that was </joey>
<garnt> including travel was ten days yeah ten </garnt>
<garnt> ten whole days oh yeah well i mean </garnt>
<joey> that'll be out by the end of october </joey>
<garnt> yeah so that'll be fun yes and uh it </garnt>
<connor> should be a big boy long special that </connor>
<joey> would be a big boy long special so we've </joey>
<garnt> already got a taste big name big boy </garnt>
<joey> that's what the ladies call me </joey>
<garnt> so we've already got a taste of what </garnt>
<garnt> it's like to be with these boys for like </garnt>
<connor> 10 days mm-hmm don't be able to go </connor>
<connor> anywhere that was worse though because </connor>
<connor> the car was tiny that's true at least </connor>
<joey> the bus we can you know walk around yeah </joey>
<joey> we have at least our own private </joey>
<connor> quarters but yeah i guess we should talk </connor>
<joey> about the special after it's come out </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> just look forward to it yeah it's gonna </garnt>
<connor> be a good one yeah i'm i'm hoping that </connor>
<garnt> my car sickness is better on a bus it is </garnt>
<joey> all right </joey>
<connor> on a bus definitely yeah right right </connor>
<connor> because you're in a [ __ ] freight </connor>
<connor> train equivalent of a car like yeah </connor>
<connor> you're moving in a building </connor>
<joey> you know because when you're in a tiny </joey>
<connor> car the back of the car gets [ __ ] with </connor>
<connor> suspension yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like it's you you get like thrown around </connor>
<connor> you're on a bus it's so big did you get </connor>
<joey> motion sickness on a train </joey>
<garnt> no oh then you should be good okay </garnt>
<joey> because i remember like </joey>
<joey> i remember on the road trip there was </joey>
<joey> like a lot of downtime in the car and i </joey>
<joey> was like i could read manga or watch </joey>
<connor> anime or play games and i like got read </connor>
<connor> one chapter of a manga and i'm like okay </connor>
<connor> can't do that and basically it was just </connor>
<connor> a lot of a lot of me just listening to </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] music and uh just darling out </connor>
<connor> pretty much i wish i could do more and i </connor>
<connor> think that's why it felt so exhausting </connor>
<connor> because i wanted to do more stuff on the </connor>
<garnt> car just to like chill out but i </garnt>
<joey> hopefully can do that on the tour bus </joey>
<garnt> there's like communal space there's like </garnt>
<garnt> tables and stuff in the car it's like </garnt>
<joey> whatever can fit on your lap is </joey>
<joey> technically the table yep so that that </joey>
<joey> also makes you just not want to work or </joey>
<connor> do anything like i just i'm not </connor>
<joey> comfortable this is awful the same thing </joey>
<joey> on a plane right yeah yeah it's like an </joey>
<connor> economy where you're like i'm gonna work </connor>
<connor> and then you'll realize your laptop </connor>
<connor> doesn't even open up fully yeah like </connor>
<connor> because you can't even like actually get </connor>
<connor> 90 degrees because the chair especially </connor>
<joey> if the chair in front of you is leaned </joey>
<connor> all the way back it's just like yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah oh dude </connor>
<connor> i've got to say the worst flight i've </connor>
<joey> ever been on was the was the la to miami </joey>
<joey> flight at like </joey>
<joey> oh the economy flight yeah it was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] awful yeah because like the </joey>
<joey> moment the flight hadn't even taken off </joey>
<garnt> and you know you can't even like move </garnt>
<garnt> i'm sorry we got one on like uh a detour </garnt>
<garnt> here no no no no no no no no no no no no </garnt>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<garnt> welcome back to trash days yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> actually we're like a billion flights </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and so we've got the red-eye flight from </garnt>
<connor> la to miami and normally when you're on </connor>
<connor> a flight people wait until the plane is </connor>
<connor> like in the air and the seat belt things </connor>
<connor> got off before they recline no not on </connor>
<connor> this flight it was just like immediately </connor>
<connor> sat down dude full reclined and i was </connor>
<connor> like oh this is going to be there like </connor>
<joey> this all right okay i saw i saw people </joey>
<joey> as they were walking up to their seats </joey>
<connor> just grabbing the back of the seat </connor>
<joey> reclining it back and then sitting yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah just like chill </connor>
<joey> we have six hours on this flight you can </joey>
<joey> do it whenever it's a red-eye flight </joey>
<garnt> right yeah i assume people were just </garnt>
<garnt> like these were seasoned veterans </garnt>
<connor> i'm ready to sleep yeah i'd never been </connor>
<connor> on a flight before people like everyone </connor>
<connor> was calling right before the moment of </connor>
<connor> takeoff and the moment the plane touched </connor>
<connor> the ground not even like a taxi or </connor>
<connor> anything everyone's whipped out their </connor>
<connor> phones started making calls and i was </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is this </connor>
<joey> i didn't even notice that i didn't </joey>
<connor> notice that no because we landed in </connor>
<connor> miami at like [ __ ] 5 30 in the </connor>
<joey> morning i'm just like struggling to open </joey>
<joey> my eyes so i just couldn't [ __ ] see </joey>
<connor> anything yeah i don't know if i'm the </connor>
<connor> dumb one i probably am um but i don't </connor>
<connor> like stand up right away when the plane </connor>
<connor> takes the plane lands and in america bro </connor>
<connor> it was like a summoning salt video </connor>
<connor> people were trying to like clip through </connor>
<connor> the chairs trying to get their luggage </connor>
<connor> out right away they'd be like holding </connor>
<connor> their luggage like this just to stand up </connor>
<joey> for like 10 minutes standing up on the </joey>
<joey> first available frame </joey>
<connor> i'm sitting on the end and i can tell </connor>
<connor> this guy next to me is visibly getting </connor>
<connor> annoyed that i'm not standing up right </connor>
<connor> yeah because we're in the back yeah </connor>
<joey> we're not going anywhere yeah yeah we </joey>
<joey> literally are lashed to get on the only </joey>
<joey> reason i would stand up in a situation </joey>
<joey> like that is if my knees are killing me </joey>
<joey> which they were on that flight because </joey>
<joey> the seats were [ __ ] tiny so i was </joey>
<joey> just like i just need to [ __ ] stretch </joey>
<joey> out my legs yeah so then i'll stand up </joey>
<joey> for a bit you know maybe you know do </joey>
<joey> some exercise a little bit but then i'll </joey>
<connor> just yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't know if i'm missing something </connor>
<connor> like i don't know why people stand up </connor>
<connor> right away when there's </connor>
<joey> maybe they think they can just like </joey>
<joey> quickly [ __ ] go to the front yeah if </joey>
<connor> you're in a rush and you have a </connor>
<garnt> connection i can kind of understand the </garnt>
<connor> the you know the impatience but even </connor>
<garnt> then it's like max you save a minute max </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah because you got to wait until </garnt>
<garnt> the doors open anyway so you're going to </garnt>
<connor> be standing up for like a good 5-10 </connor>
<connor> minutes right yeah that like </connor>
<connor> again that it's like you even if you </connor>
<connor> stand up first and you're in the front </connor>
<connor> you're still not getting off until they </connor>
<joey> open the goddamn doors like i get that </joey>
<connor> you want to get ready but you you know </connor>
<connor> when you can see the crowd moving you </connor>
<joey> know it makes sense if you're in like </joey>
<joey> premium economy and you're at the front </joey>
<connor> of the yeah yeah yeah because you also </connor>
<connor> have room then as well </connor>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> because like in in economy you can see </garnt>
<connor> where the line goes and people go in </connor>
<connor> order anyway yeah right because </connor>
<garnt> even if you're sitting down you know </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's an order to this there's </garnt>
<garnt> an order to this chaos otherwise there </garnt>
<joey> isn't an [ __ ] like 10 seats back </joey>
<joey> being like out of the way out of the way </joey>
<connor> whatever you can't like yeah a fight </connor>
<connor> would happen yeah yeah but even every it </connor>
<connor> doesn't matter where i've gone in the </connor>
<connor> world everyone every country does this </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know why there's just </connor>
<connor> people on the plane that stand up </connor>
<connor> immediately and they're like i'm getting </connor>
<connor> off first and then max they save 10 </connor>
<connor> seconds </connor>
<connor> and i mean if it's just purely uh my </connor>
<connor> legs hurt i want to stand up all right </connor>
<joey> it's totally fine i get that but you can </joey>
<joey> tell who the the flight veterans are </joey>
<joey> because they're the ones who usually </joey>
<connor> just remain seated </connor>
<connor> i'm lazy as [ __ ] i'm i'm if i have 10 </connor>
<connor> minutes left on my my netflix thing i'm </connor>
<garnt> watching that until i get kicked off </garnt>
<connor> what doesn't make sense is when people </connor>
<connor> do this on international flights right </connor>
<connor> because you get up you save your 10 </connor>
<connor> seconds you're like [ __ ] yes i've saved </connor>
<connor> 10 seconds you've got to wait [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> half an hour to get your bags anyway </connor>
<connor> yeah it doesn't make any difference </connor>
<joey> you're going to be leaving the airport </joey>
<joey> at the same time anyway that's true and </joey>
<joey> like customs as well you don't know how </joey>
<joey> long that's going to be i i honestly </joey>
<joey> just do it at a pure instinct </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know i don't even think </joey>
<joey> about it anymore i think i think for me </joey>
<connor> for the most part i do it again not to </connor>
<connor> because i want to get out of the plane </connor>
<connor> quickly which i do but i know i'm not </connor>
<connor> realistically going to for me it's just </connor>
<connor> i need to stretch my legs that's fair </connor>
<connor> enough </connor>
<connor> because like because if it's i know </connor>
<connor> because if i know it's taking a while </connor>
<connor> then </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> because i just </joey>
<joey> because if i know it's taking a while </joey>
<connor> i'll just sit back down yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> you're like ah that's too early i was </joey>
<joey> like oh damn i'm missing okay i will say </joey>
<connor> that on that one flight it had one thing </connor>
<connor> that i'd never seen before and i think </connor>
<connor> that every flight should have this from </connor>
<connor> now on </connor>
<connor> so right where the tv normally was uh </connor>
<joey> there's no tv on this on this flight but </joey>
<joey> like you know where it is right yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah so they had this thing that popped </connor>
<connor> out and it was a phone holder oh yeah so </connor>
<connor> it would it would have your phone you </connor>
<connor> could just put your phone or ipad in </connor>
<connor> this thing and it would just be like i </connor>
<garnt> love okay because i was about to </garnt>
<garnt> complain about one thing in every flight </garnt>
<garnt> which is uh now that we've flown so many </garnt>
<joey> times within the past few months i've </joey>
<joey> basically seen every every movie i want </joey>
<joey> to see </joey>
<joey> on like the flights right i know i know </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] catalogue i know the library </joey>
<joey> okay that is the most first world </joey>
<joey> problem ever </joey>
<joey> no it's just like someone when you're </joey>
<joey> traveling for business there's no </joey>
<joey> entertainment left when when you've just </joey>
<connor> watched everything okay look i've look </connor>
<connor> there's only so many times i can see the </connor>
<joey> entire library of harry potter on there </joey>
<connor> and that one episode of [ __ ] hbo show </connor>
<joey> you know like i've wanted to load up my </joey>
<joey> own season three episode four yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> well on unlike some flights where you </garnt>
<connor> have to like </connor>
<connor> so like when you have to load up on your </connor>
<connor> phone or an ipad or something you're </connor>
<connor> like oh this is a great idea i can just </connor>
<joey> watch what i want but unfortunately the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] tray tables that come out means </joey>
<joey> that you have to like watch it like like </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> or you just put your phone flat on the </joey>
<joey> table and you just watch it like this </joey>
<joey> both are horrible for your neck yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly and i finished that [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> plane at that plane flight with a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] 80 year old neck and i have to </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> i definitely need to visit a </connor>
<connor> chiropractor afterwards because you just </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] your neck up you cannot [ __ ] get </joey>
<joey> off the plane </joey>
<joey> okay actually actually actually actually </joey>
<joey> actually question question what is your </joey>
<garnt> guys's sleeping like </garnt>
<garnt> what is your sleeping position on a </garnt>
<garnt> plane </garnt>
<garnt> like what is how how do you feel normal </garnt>
<joey> position </joey>
<connor> are we talking like an economy yeah </connor>
<joey> economy oh bro i i look like i'm about </joey>
<garnt> to like die </garnt>
<connor> i i like i like kneel over like i put my </connor>
<joey> head but like between my legs if i can i </joey>
<connor> saw you doing that on the on the florida </connor>
<connor> flag like how the [ __ ] is he sleeping </connor>
<joey> like that i tried to because like i </joey>
<joey> i thought you were throwing up no no no </joey>
<connor> no i like because for me </connor>
<joey> i don't know why i just i i cannot sleep </joey>
<joey> sitting up right i need to feel like my </joey>
<joey> head is resting on something like this </joey>
<joey> or like yeah at this i don't know </joey>
<joey> i'm the same though maybe it's like the </joey>
<connor> pressure on my head kind of makes me i </connor>
<joey> don't know why no i'm the same i need to </joey>
<connor> feel like like i'm leaning on either </connor>
<connor> side </connor>
<connor> so what i do is i take the you know the </connor>
<connor> seat at the back like the cushion thing </connor>
<connor> most of those cushion things you can </connor>
<connor> kind of fold the edges yeah yeah like </connor>
<connor> that so what i do is i do that and then </connor>
<garnt> i kind of yeah it doesn't doesn't work </garnt>
<joey> that does that doesn't work but that's </joey>
<joey> the best we've got </joey>
<joey> now i got to work with what i've god </joey>
<garnt> guys the reason i ask is because i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know what it is about planes where any </garnt>
<garnt> other form of transportation you there's </garnt>
<garnt> enough room to get like a decent decent </garnt>
<garnt> sleeping position i think i i can't i'm </garnt>
<connor> decent enough i'm i'm like i'm i think </connor>
<connor> i'm like wider than you </connor>
<garnt> so like </garnt>
<garnt> like you call yourself dummy thing </garnt>
<garnt> my frame is just larger like you're </garnt>
<garnt> taller but i have like a wider frame i </garnt>
<connor> swear that's like that it sucks because </connor>
<connor> if you're tall you can just like origami </connor>
<connor> yourself into a position or right </connor>
<connor> you're like </connor>
<connor> my arms are gigantic right [ __ ] giant </connor>
<joey> biceps right obviously you're not </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] arnold schwarzenegger </joey>
<joey> i i i got a dummy ass right </joey>
<joey> now because i have i have this dilemma </joey>
<connor> right of like i need something to i need </connor>
<connor> to be leaning my face like the sides of </connor>
<connor> my face on something to get even just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> a tiny amount of sleep yeah so then you </connor>
<connor> might be thinking well joey just sit on </connor>
<garnt> the window seat because then you can </garnt>
<garnt> just lean against the wall no that </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't work my problem is that that </garnt>
<garnt> works except i have the bladder the size </garnt>
<connor> of a peanut and so i have to get up </connor>
<connor> every like hour or two to go to pee and </connor>
<connor> so i need to sit on at least the aisle </connor>
<connor> seat because otherwise i just feel </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] horrible for the two other </connor>
<connor> people i'm sitting next to right so now </connor>
<connor> i'm stuck in this dilemma of like do i </connor>
<joey> prioritize my bladder or do i prioritize </joey>
<joey> my sleep and most of the time i just </joey>
<joey> prioritize my bladder so i just have to </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] deal with this thing yeah see my </garnt>
<garnt> my plain sleep nerf because everyone has </garnt>
<garnt> a plain sleep nerf like a condition that </garnt>
<garnt> has to be met </garnt>
<connor> um is that my head needs to be like </connor>
<connor> beyond 45 degrees otherwise it doesn't </connor>
<connor> feel like i'm actually like sleeping </connor>
<connor> right so when when i see people sleeping </connor>
<connor> next to the window with their with their </connor>
<connor> heads on the window like i literally </connor>
<garnt> cannot get my head at a like a cute </garnt>
<garnt> enough angle to like trick my brain into </garnt>
<garnt> thinking i'm going to understand that i </garnt>
<connor> think that's why i like leaning forward </connor>
<connor> like for me i think it's certain about </connor>
<connor> like the pressure on my head or like the </connor>
<connor> way that i don't know how the blood's </connor>
<connor> flowing yeah it makes me like it like </connor>
<connor> recreates how i sleep </connor>
<garnt> i'm not we're basically going to like a </garnt>
<garnt> coma patient you just </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> so the reason why i choose the aisle or </connor>
<connor> the window and i don't go for the middle </connor>
<connor> it's because on the on the middle one </connor>
<connor> the only place you can put your head why </connor>
<connor> are you laughing so much </connor>
<garnt> i am a comatose patient just imagine the </garnt>
<connor> one time like if connor ever gets into </connor>
<joey> like a plane crash and the pilot goes </joey>
<connor> everyone regretted your brace position </connor>
<connor> can literally fall asleep and he'll be </connor>
<connor> in the brace position all right fall </connor>
<garnt> asleep in the race position okay that's </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> it's comfortable it makes sense the </connor>
<connor> reason why you're bracing it </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<joey> as i was saying before godly rudely </joey>
<connor> and if i lean in the middle i can only </connor>
<connor> go straight and my head will hit the </connor>
<connor> chair and i can't get my head into the </connor>
<connor> position i want because it's too close </connor>
<connor> yeah because i i can't just get it in </connor>
<connor> enough and it'll like push against my </connor>
<connor> neck yeah if i if i do </connor>
<connor> so i have to do the window because the </connor>
<connor> window the thing that the downtown by </connor>
<joey> the window right </joey>
<joey> is that uh there's a little gap between </joey>
<joey> the window and the chair yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so i put my head in that little </joey>
<joey> crevice </joey>
<connor> so as long as the guy behind me doesn't </connor>
<connor> randomly like try to tickle my head i'm </connor>
<connor> good and i do the same thing on the </connor>
<joey> aisle but the problem is if you do on </joey>
<connor> the islands risky because if they bring </connor>
<connor> the car they wake you up </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> when i said i lean on the window i i </joey>
<connor> obviously meant that the crack between </connor>
<connor> the window and the seat belt so you're </connor>
<connor> going forward so same as me no no i lean </connor>
<garnt> kind of back oh into that crate oh you </garnt>
<joey> lean forward into the crack yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like really forward </joey>
<connor> i would not want to sit in front of you </connor>
<connor> because then if i look this way it'd </connor>
<joey> just be like god feels so </joey>
<joey> in between the cracks </joey>
<connor> that'd be horrifying </connor>
<joey> everyone who sits in front of conor gets </joey>
<garnt> them gets a gets a viewing of the </garnt>
<joey> shining yeah </joey>
<connor> it pretty much imagine looks like that </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> they don't turn around </joey>
<joey> how often are you looking in that </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] crevice behind you well you know </joey>
<joey> if you might you know because sometimes </joey>
<joey> if you're sitting on the window seat the </joey>
<connor> window can be positioned a little bit </connor>
<connor> far back than what is normal so you know </connor>
<connor> what if your window's like back here and </connor>
<joey> you just look good </joey>
<connor> if you're being a little embarrassed and </connor>
<connor> having a good sleep i'll tell you i'll </connor>
<joey> take i'll take this how the [ __ ] do you </joey>
<connor> sleep like that again i don't know i </connor>
<joey> have wouldn't it make more sense to do </joey>
<connor> it on the back side i i can't like i </connor>
<joey> can't sleep lying down like like face uh </joey>
<joey> back down yeah and so </joey>
<joey> reclining the chair is just a beta </joey>
<joey> version wait how do you sleep normally </joey>
<joey> uh on my sides </joey>
<joey> oh so you can't sleep on your back i i i </joey>
<connor> sleep no i've never been able to sleep </connor>
<joey> with my back really so i sleep on my </joey>
<connor> side but like i want to say </connor>
<joey> if it's my side but my body is very much </joey>
<joey> leaning towards my stomach the face of </joey>
<joey> the bed all right right kind of like </joey>
<connor> like yeah </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like i don't </connor>
<connor> yeah actually just exactly how like a </connor>
<garnt> cat yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay yeah i've tried the coma strap </garnt>
<garnt> because there's some times where i </garnt>
<garnt> couldn't go overseas </garnt>
<joey> yeah because i've tried and that's where </joey>
<joey> like being tall is enough because i can </joey>
<joey> never like i can never get my body into </joey>
<connor> enough of a position where because when </connor>
<connor> when i try to lean forward yeah this is </connor>
<connor> like the this is like the most forward i </connor>
<garnt> can go right i can't even get close like </garnt>
<joey> the trait </joey>
<joey> even when all right even when say for </joey>
<joey> example you do have enough space to just </joey>
<joey> be able to squeeze in to lie on the tray </joey>
<connor> table yeah my back just [ __ ] no i </connor>
<connor> don't i don't like my trade table on my </connor>
<connor> knees </connor>
<joey> that's even further down yeah doesn't </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] you back up uh maybe </joey>
<joey> i sleep so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hell your knees yeah jesus </joey>
<connor> christ </connor>
<joey> i put my arms on my knees as a pillow </joey>
<joey> i'm i feel i'm trying to i'm trying to </joey>
<joey> remember i feel more worried about your </joey>
<connor> back </connor>
<joey> no that would kill me </joey>
<connor> no the end of your knees you're on your </connor>
<connor> thighs </connor>
<garnt> try it i'm going to lean back try it try </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think i can even do this because </garnt>
<connor> i've i've i have a couple of friends who </connor>
<garnt> have slept like they're just like that </garnt>
<connor> no my back the shinji position my back </connor>
<connor> would </connor>
<connor> just the permanent shinji </connor>
<joey> he's like are you asleep or depressed </joey>
<connor> yeah i'll never tell you stretch </connor>
<connor> i i got another 5 10 and i was like stop </connor>
<joey> stop stop going stop stop </joey>
<connor> bro so the coma strat is a backup strat </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> the cop is risky because like you </connor>
<joey> you're rash putting your head in like </joey>
<connor> the crevice and you're relying on the </connor>
<connor> crevice right yeah right and you know if </connor>
<connor> they're playing shakes it's not as not </connor>
<garnt> as bouncy as your bones right the shinji </garnt>
<garnt> strat is only open to those on the five </garnt>
<connor> terms yeah right </connor>
<connor> it's just it's locked for us it's locked </connor>
<connor> discovered that the american airlines uh </connor>
<connor> chairs are really [ __ ] close together </connor>
<joey> compared to like because i've done it a </joey>
<joey> bunch in japan on the domestic a a </joey>
<joey> flight and i noticed you we have way </joey>
<joey> more room on those domestic economies </joey>
<joey> right right than the american airlines </joey>
<joey> one that was [ __ ] close those </joey>
<connor> american airline flights are so goddamn </connor>
<connor> compact yeah yeah yeah i'm not [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> around yeah any closer and i'd be </joey>
<joey> kissing the person in front of me yeah </joey>
<joey> like pretty much the head yeah </joey>
<connor> hope you're having a good flight </connor>
<joey> yeah but that that red-eye flight to </joey>
<joey> miami was rough yeah i mean you know i'm </joey>
<joey> glad we still did it because we got to </joey>
<joey> do the uh the ludwig barrier cut </joey>
<connor> tournament yeah yeah so so super fun we </connor>
<joey> did the ludwig bureau car which is mario </joey>
<joey> kart double dash but you can't drive um </joey>
<joey> but you have to down a b you have to you </joey>
<joey> can't drive </joey>
<joey> you can't drink and drive because that's </joey>
<connor> illegal and that's bad yeah but you have </connor>
<joey> to down your beer either before you </joey>
<connor> start driving or any point when you stop </connor>
<connor> if your car still completely stopped </connor>
<connor> yeah so we really wanted to do this </connor>
<connor> and uh ludwig said that it would start 2 </connor>
<joey> p.m and our flight was at 3. there was </joey>
<joey> no way we could do it so we moved it to </joey>
<connor> a 9pm flight so we could make it yeah </connor>
<joey> right um but that flight was brutal that </joey>
<joey> was horrible yeah because we got to </joey>
<joey> miami at i think it was like five or six </joey>
<connor> a.m </connor>
<connor> and then we and that was the first day </connor>
<garnt> of the convention as well so we had a </garnt>
<garnt> signing from 1 p.m that day so we got </garnt>
<connor> luckily though the airport and the hotel </connor>
<connor> we were staying at were pretty close it </connor>
<connor> was like 15 20 minute driveway uh so we </connor>
<connor> just literally just got to miami got to </connor>
<joey> the hotel slept for as long as we could </joey>
<joey> and then immediately headed to the con </joey>
<joey> but that was still a chill con i enjoyed </joey>
<connor> that yeah miami was a really cool place </connor>
<connor> yeah i thought miami was really </connor>
<joey> beautiful um obviously i wish i just </joey>
<joey> wish we had more time to actually kind </joey>
<joey> of explore miami yeah yeah cause i was </joey>
<garnt> gonna ask because i've never been to </garnt>
<joey> florida before um like how was florida </joey>
<joey> in general did you meet florida man did </joey>
<joey> you meet luckily luckily not luckily not </joey>
<connor> people were more chill in florida than </connor>
<joey> la i think i feel like it was um the </joey>
<joey> food was really good </joey>
<connor> food the cuban restaurant was insane </connor>
<connor> human food was nutty my god we were </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] up there we were so full so much </joey>
<joey> so much so </joey>
<connor> much uh like peruvian food another day </connor>
<connor> and that was really good yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah approved that hummus they made this </connor>
<connor> was insane remember that peruvian so did </connor>
<garnt> you only stay there for the weekend of </garnt>
<joey> the convention uh yeah yeah yeah we </joey>
<joey> landed on the the first day of the con </joey>
<joey> and then we left the morning of the day </joey>
<connor> after yeah it was good though i mean i </connor>
<garnt> i'd like to go back to miami at some </garnt>
<garnt> point and just be a tourist yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but also there's a lot of old people in </garnt>
<garnt> miami i didn't notice that yeah it </garnt>
<joey> wasn't as young as i thought it would be </joey>
<joey> but i guess it's a lot of old people </joey>
<joey> retiring i guess yeah so i saw a lot of </joey>
<garnt> 60 year old looking men that were bronze </garnt>
<garnt> basically </garnt>
<joey> with with uh with six-year-olds </joey>
<joey> permanently who were bronze as well and </joey>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> so is this is miami just a glorified </connor>
<joey> retirement home that's why all the </joey>
<joey> buildings are really bright it's so that </joey>
<connor> you can find the people </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> no but miami was really fun it was like </connor>
<joey> too humid though oh it's like </joey>
<garnt> yeah it was basically japan wouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> talk to me about humidity right now guys </garnt>
<joey> it's basically what you're feeling here </joey>
<connor> is what it was like in my mind it was </connor>
<connor> too much it was pretty brutal yeah i </connor>
<connor> just wish i had enough time to like go </connor>
<joey> to the beach or you know even go to the </joey>
<joey> pool or anything but like i didn't even </joey>
<connor> have enough time to do that we were just </connor>
<connor> tired as well because we've been in la </connor>
<garnt> for like a month we were in the uk </garnt>
<garnt> before so i think you're just dead </garnt>
<connor> you're just so dead yeah yeah i was </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> well we did get the taste of la life </garnt>
<garnt> guys </garnt>
<garnt> how did you feel because we actually i </garnt>
<garnt> think </garnt>
<garnt> this so what we did was you were </garnt>
<garnt> currently in the la arc on trash taste </garnt>
<joey> um and we what we did was we rented out </joey>
<joey> an airbnb and we used it as a studio but </joey>
<joey> also it was kind of like our first </joey>
<joey> experience living with each other as </joey>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> in terms of living with each other sorry </connor>
<joey> it's like a disney show </joey>
<connor> just a couple of friends </connor>
<garnt> just filming some videos </garnt>
<garnt> what will they get up to yeah we </garnt>
<joey> basically just made a trash taste house </joey>
<joey> you know because everyone in l.a thought </joey>
<joey> we already lived next to each other or </joey>
<joey> by each other </joey>
<joey> and that wasn't the case in japan </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] we live actually pretty far away </joey>
<connor> from each other like </connor>
<connor> close enough that we can get to the </connor>
<connor> office but </connor>
<connor> not close enough where we could easily </connor>
<connor> make content with each other like </connor>
<connor> everyone else does in l.a games yeah we </connor>
<connor> just don't live together so yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly exactly uh yeah and i i thought </connor>
<garnt> it was a [ __ ] like a [ __ ] blast </garnt>
<joey> honestly living with the boys it was </joey>
<connor> really really fun but i feel it was fun </connor>
<connor> because of the time limit that we had </connor>
<connor> right like if you told me you know no </connor>
<joey> offense to you boys but like this </joey>
<joey> applies i feel with anybody yeah right </joey>
<joey> that's not like your significant other </joey>
<joey> or whatever if you lived for long enough </joey>
<connor> with each other i feel like you're going </connor>
<connor> to be [ __ ] sick of each other and i </connor>
<connor> feel that's why a lot of content houses </connor>
<garnt> just don't work out in the long run </garnt>
<garnt> right because it's like it's it's a </garnt>
<connor> honeymoon period to begin with but then </connor>
<joey> the longer you're with together you're </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> yeah i kind of value my privacy as well </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i might have my own room but it's not </joey>
<joey> quite the same </joey>
<garnt> another thing i noticed as well is that </garnt>
<garnt> if we did have a trash taste house like </garnt>
<connor> a trash taste content house i don't </connor>
<connor> think i'd get anything done no because </connor>
<connor> these boys are distractions like </connor>
<connor> normally normally i want to hang out </connor>
<connor> with you </connor>
<connor> normally i go i i wake up go to my </connor>
<connor> office i'm like great work starting you </connor>
<joey> know catch up to emails or something </joey>
<joey> this time i go up go to the living room </joey>
<garnt> see mailing or jerry up and i'm like oh </garnt>
<garnt> what are you what are you up to what are </garnt>
<garnt> you up to what do you just like have </garnt>
<garnt> breakfast and chat for about three hours </garnt>
<joey> yeah just things just go slower because </joey>
<joey> you're talking to other people yeah so </joey>
<joey> like whereas maybe i get lunch and i eat </joey>
<joey> in 10 minutes so i go right back to work </joey>
<joey> at my house yeah lunch becomes like an </joey>
<joey> hour and a half yeah exactly exactly </joey>
<joey> it's good though i think is this the </joey>
<joey> first time i've gone to la where </joey>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> went with the like express purpose of </connor>
<connor> trying to make like as much content as </connor>
<connor> possible </connor>
<connor> so it was really fun because i there was </connor>
<connor> like no days where i wasn't </connor>
<connor> uh doing hanging out with someone or </connor>
<connor> making something and so it was really </connor>
<connor> satisfying because i </connor>
<connor> but for me it's like </connor>
<connor> i i feel like i get my battery recharged </connor>
<connor> through making content um yeah i'm </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] addicted to making like youtube </connor>
<joey> videos </joey>
<joey> right here yeah so like for me it's like </joey>
<connor> if i'm not doing that it's like oh i get </connor>
<connor> like i'm like oh i want to make </connor>
<connor> something yeah i want to film something </connor>
<connor> so it was like a whole month of just </connor>
<connor> being creative and getting to perform </connor>
<connor> and getting to go on stuff it was just </connor>
<joey> great you are you are truly a shining </joey>
<connor> beacon for content creators </connor>
<connor> like i i think people are like oh dude </connor>
<connor> i'm like no dude i [ __ ] love this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like this is what i'm addicted to </connor>
<connor> like i don't know why like i love being </connor>
<connor> on i love being on [ __ ] shows i love </connor>
<connor> doing events like yeah yeah it did </connor>
<garnt> constantly like la did constantly feel </garnt>
<connor> like you were filling up a progress bar </connor>
<connor> or like something in terms like content </connor>
<connor> or connections or projects or something </connor>
<connor> even if even if we weren't like actively </connor>
<garnt> filming something every day but even so </garnt>
<garnt> i still felt like i was way more </garnt>
<garnt> distracted in la than </garnt>
<joey> i would normally be at home yeah i feel </joey>
<joey> there were just like too many nights </joey>
<joey> especially when like most or all of us </joey>
<connor> were just like hanging out for the night </connor>
<connor> where i was just like i could be in my </connor>
<connor> room streaming or making content but i'd </connor>
<connor> rather just go out onto the balcony and </connor>
<joey> just chill with everyone yeah </joey>
<garnt> there'd be so many times where i'm like </garnt>
<connor> i could just set up a like we had like a </connor>
<connor> bare bones basic stream set up in one of </connor>
<connor> the rooms and i was like i got time to </connor>
<connor> stream but joey's out there chilling </connor>
<connor> maybe maybe i'll go chill with joey for </connor>
<joey> a bit and then i'll just have like a </joey>
<joey> quick five minute chat and then we'll go </joey>
<joey> stream and then seven hours later </joey>
<joey> and then the five minute chat turns into </joey>
<garnt> like half an hour then we've got to get </garnt>
<garnt> lunch and then you know we're meeting </garnt>
<garnt> someone in like an hour so i'm like okay </garnt>
<joey> i guess i can't stream you know yeah i </joey>
<joey> would i might my main channel would be </joey>
<garnt> non-existent yeah if we had a trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste house i feel yeah i can see why </garnt>
<garnt> there are so many streamer houses now </garnt>
<garnt> because you know living your life is </garnt>
<joey> just [ __ ] content at that point </joey>
<joey> pretty much uh and if you if i had to </joey>
<joey> like actively go out and make the kind </joey>
<joey> of content i do my main channel that </joey>
<joey> just wouldn't [ __ ] happen if we had a </joey>
<garnt> trash taste house no i'm not yeah these </garnt>
<garnt> boys are too much fun yeah exactly it </garnt>
<connor> was just very motivating though yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah i got very motivated oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> definitely to make more stuff and push </joey>
<connor> push it i'll shout out to ludwig always </connor>
<connor> uh the inspiration yeah he was so nice </connor>
<connor> yeah i can love that guy yeah </connor>
<connor> i feel like he's my long-lost american </connor>
<connor> brother </connor>
<connor> disconnected from that i honestly feel </connor>
<garnt> most if not all the like new and old </garnt>
<garnt> faces we met up in l.a were just like </garnt>
<garnt> really really nice people </garnt>
<connor> yeah you know and yeah no it is true </connor>
<connor> like i always get a massive kick of </connor>
<connor> inspiration out of like hanging out with </connor>
<connor> someone who perhaps i've never met </connor>
<connor> before but i know their content or like </connor>
<connor> you know some other content creator i </connor>
<connor> don't get to see or talk too often and </connor>
<connor> you know like conventions for me are the </connor>
<connor> same thing as well just like you know </connor>
<connor> being in a convention setting which we </connor>
<connor> were a lot this past couple of months </connor>
<garnt> just like it's like oh yeah this this is </garnt>
<connor> why i do this like this is this is this </connor>
<garnt> is just motivating me to like do better </garnt>
<garnt> for these people you know yeah um yeah </garnt>
<garnt> no so it's good i i mean you know i may </garnt>
<joey> not have been </joey>
<joey> necessarily motivated while we were in </joey>
<joey> la or while we were traveling but after </joey>
<joey> i came back to japan i had like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] list of ideas so you know that's </joey>
<garnt> that's always good </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like it's important for every </garnt>
<garnt> content creator to get their content </garnt>
<connor> battery recharged and i feel like the </connor>
<connor> best way to do that is just to hang out </connor>
<connor> with other people </connor>
<connor> hanging out with other like creative </connor>
<connor> people because so many ideas get thrown </connor>
<connor> around and you're like damn all right i </connor>
<connor> could actually do this all right i've </connor>
<connor> got so many ideas now whereas if you're </connor>
<connor> just sitting in a room just constantly </connor>
<connor> pumping out content it kind of like you </connor>
<connor> just get into a grind and you get into </connor>
<connor> like it's monotonous yeah it does get </connor>
<connor> monotonous a lot of times and you forget </connor>
<connor> why you started doing this in the first </connor>
<connor> place and one thing i will say about </connor>
<connor> hanging out with so many people in la so </connor>
<joey> many other content creators is that it </joey>
<joey> definitely gets those </joey>
<joey> creative juices flowing again yeah </joey>
<joey> absolutely yeah especially seeing some </joey>
<joey> of the like seeing the what motivates me </joey>
<joey> the most is seeing other people do </joey>
<connor> something exciting yeah because then i'm </connor>
<connor> like damn i want to do something yeah </connor>
<connor> this looks [ __ ] incredible exactly </connor>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> and la is just like the central hub of </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<garnt> um but yeah aside from that there were </garnt>
<garnt> it was i mean did you guys enjoy your </garnt>
<connor> experience in la overall oh yeah i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] loved it yeah me personally yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i i enjoyed la i think because of </connor>
<connor> the people i got to see yeah if i if i </connor>
<connor> didn't get to see anyone and i was just </connor>
<connor> living in l.a you know without ever </connor>
<connor> interacting with other content creators </connor>
<connor> personally </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> yeah just because like i don't think the </connor>
<joey> la lifestyle necessarily meshes with me </joey>
<connor> yeah i i i [ __ ] hate the lifestyle </connor>
<joey> but when i was there i had like an </joey>
<joey> amazing time oh yeah yeah definitely um </joey>
<garnt> and also i mean i i hate to admit it </garnt>
<connor> there's some amazing food there oh no </connor>
<garnt> the food's great oh that's food that was </garnt>
<joey> some amazing amazing god i must have </joey>
<connor> ordered the porto's cubano sandwich like </connor>
<joey> a million [ __ ] times that that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> went hard </joey>
<joey> in california nutty yeah yeah also joe </joey>
<connor> and the juice yeah yeah no so we have </connor>
<connor> during the juice in the uk right do we </connor>
<connor> we do okay and there's one in australia </connor>
<connor> as well so it's this coffee [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> chain and like i don't really care for </connor>
<connor> their coffee but in the in the one in </connor>
<joey> america </joey>
<joey> they sold like this sandwich it's like a </joey>
<joey> spicy tuna sandwich and it was so </joey>
<connor> goddamn good me and joey must have eaten </connor>
<connor> it like five times i i think i ate it </connor>
<connor> like ten times i was so goddamn good i </connor>
<joey> froth of the mouth every time i think </joey>
<connor> about that my comments go back i know i </connor>
<connor> just i want to go back just for that me </connor>
<connor> and joey we had one in la yeah i was </connor>
<connor> like you have to try this tuna sandwich </connor>
<connor> i know i know you're going to love it so </connor>
<connor> he tries it like this is insane yeah we </connor>
<connor> pull up to our hotel in miami </connor>
<connor> at the bottom of the hotel is a joe in </connor>
<joey> the video literally like the next thing </joey>
<joey> over from the hotel wasn't john there's </joey>
<connor> just like it's fade we're like fish </connor>
<joey> bomber like nice </joey>
<joey> so every morning we would just wake up </joey>
<joey> and be like coffee and tuna spicy </joey>
<joey> sandwich i got you </joey>
<garnt> i think i only had one bad meal in l.a </garnt>
<connor> um what was it was it the attack shame </connor>
<joey> them yeah yeah yeah okay oh my god yeah </joey>
<connor> dude you remember this do you remember </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> i think i think on like the third day or </connor>
<connor> something that we all arrived together </connor>
<garnt> we wanted to go to one italian but it </garnt>
<connor> was like uh it was like a saturday was </connor>
<joey> uh look at the bapo we were originally </joey>
<connor> going to go to boca de beauvo because i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] love it but yeah yeah as god was </connor>
<joey> saying it was a weekend so we were like </joey>
<connor> a book of the pepper is probably going </connor>
<joey> to be really [ __ ] crowded so let's </joey>
<connor> find one on the way and then we found </connor>
<joey> this uh one italian place i don't even </joey>
<connor> remember that it was like family earned </connor>
<connor> we thought oh that'd be that'd be good </connor>
<connor> to support a local business yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> exactly </connor>
<connor> and maybe we shouldn't have </connor>
<joey> how do i regret it yeah i forgot like </joey>
<connor> the one golden rule of like like how to </connor>
<garnt> judge a restaurant which is if it's peak </garnt>
<garnt> time on saturday and you go in and it's </garnt>
<garnt> almost empty that's that's a bit that's </garnt>
<connor> a big red flag </connor>
<garnt> also to do with this restaurant i had </garnt>
<garnt> been told this and i come from japan </garnt>
<joey> right if a restaurant has four stars in </joey>
<joey> google </joey>
<joey> it must be good yeah exactly good </joey>
<joey> exactly apparently in america if it's </joey>
<garnt> not higher than 4.5 it's dog [ __ ] is </garnt>
<garnt> what i've been told really that's what i </garnt>
<garnt> was told is it the 4.5 4.5 is apparently </garnt>
<connor> the like if it's higher than that it's </connor>
<connor> you can you know it's good right right </connor>
<joey> don't maybe americans are just nicer do </joey>
<joey> people just rate in america four stars </joey>
<connor> if the food is edible i i don't know so </connor>
<connor> remember when we got there like yeah </connor>
<garnt> we got absolutely scammed right away oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right so </garnt>
<garnt> it's all coming so we pull up into this </garnt>
<connor> restaurant right and </connor>
<connor> there's clear parking spots right yeah </connor>
<connor> so and there's valet though there's </connor>
<connor> valet parking right no one is here no </connor>
<connor> one is in this restaurant this may be </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> we should have turned back at this point </connor>
<connor> honestly yeah so we go in the we gotta </connor>
<connor> start parking our car and this guy comes </connor>
<connor> over and he knocks on the window he's </connor>
<connor> like oh uh valet service eight dollars </connor>
<connor> and we we i think we misunderstood that </connor>
<joey> he we thought that he was like oh you </joey>
<joey> have to pay it right right but i think </joey>
<connor> it was you offering it yeah </connor>
<connor> so we were like oh okay so then we get </connor>
<connor> out the car hand him the eight dollars </connor>
<connor> and he literally just continues backing </connor>
<connor> it up into the spock and gets out and is </connor>
<joey> like all right there you go he was he </joey>
<joey> was probably in the car for about eight </joey>
<connor> ten seconds ten seconds like ten seconds </connor>
<connor> tops that man got the biggest conversion </connor>
<connor> of time to to payment uh and known in </connor>
<connor> history it's like those memes of like </connor>
<connor> bill gates when he drops a hundred </connor>
<joey> dollars on the floor it's like </joey>
<joey> it was literally the car was basically </joey>
<joey> parked and then he just went </joey>
<joey> that's it </joey>
<joey> and i couldn't believe this man took our </joey>
<joey> money i couldn't believe he was still </joey>
<joey> willing to take dollars for that i'm </joey>
<joey> like only and only in the us </joey>
<joey> am i if this happened in the uk fist </joey>
<connor> would be thrown if you try to get the </connor>
<connor> eight dollars off of me it just wouldn't </connor>
<connor> work that's why we don't have valet </connor>
<joey> parking but that wasn't that wasn't the </joey>
<joey> only thing yeah yeah yeah so that set </joey>
<joey> the tone yeah that definitely said </joey>
<joey> that's wrong </joey>
<garnt> that was the red flag i think all of us </garnt>
<connor> were just like we we all stood there and </connor>
<joey> we were just like we just got robbed </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah we we this is like </connor>
<joey> i can't believe you've done this yeah so </joey>
<joey> yeah we uh immediately go into this </joey>
<garnt> restaurant after losing eight dollars </garnt>
<garnt> um and then afterwards we go in it looks </garnt>
<garnt> pretty it looks like a pretty decent </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant um and so </garnt>
<garnt> sorry no </garnt>
<connor> say something yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't like it when restaurants do this </connor>
<connor> and this is just for me preference i </connor>
<connor> understand that people don't care if i'm </connor>
<connor> in an italian restaurant and you're </connor>
<connor> trying to like set an ambiance don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] play an mlb game in the corner </connor>
<connor> on a giant monitor like i'm sorry to me </connor>
<connor> it's like that's not the italian vibes </connor>
<connor> are ruined but there was just like two </connor>
<connor> giant sports games and they were just </connor>
<joey> playing the audio and i'm like </joey>
<joey> also there was a very american looking </joey>
<connor> bar in the middle yeah yeah yeah well </connor>
<connor> that's fine i don't care about the bar </connor>
<connor> being in the middle right i just it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> i think it's got a mood i think it's i </joey>
<joey> think it's the bar in combination with </joey>
<joey> dmob on the screen that just made a very </joey>
<connor> non-attack yeah it was like two giant </connor>
<connor> like 50 inches on the wall blasting this </connor>
<connor> audio and you're just like eating your </connor>
<connor> thing and you're saying and that's a </connor>
<connor> strike and that's a </connor>
<connor> thank you </connor>
<connor> and it's just like ah this is just like </connor>
<connor> what am i am i crazy like is this weird </connor>
<connor> this is weird right </connor>
<garnt> yeah so i i get you i get you because i </garnt>
<connor> like i don't like that in restaurants </connor>
<connor> either where they play a game or </connor>
<connor> something like that okay yeah at a bar </connor>
<connor> okay i get it i get it it's a bar yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's the time in a place it's a bar </connor>
<connor> it's a bar this is this is a restaurant </connor>
<connor> you know i i would prefer to you know </connor>
<connor> just have some music and uh just have </connor>
<connor> that set this thing up if you went on a </connor>
<garnt> date there you would look bad that's </garnt>
<connor> what i'm saying yeah ambiance would </connor>
<garnt> already make it look you're in a rough </garnt>
<connor> spot </connor>
<garnt> better make up for it yeah i mean like </garnt>
<connor> everyone ordered their food and of </connor>
<connor> course of course i was like </connor>
<connor> i gotta try the lasagna all right all </connor>
<connor> right because i i think that's my </connor>
<connor> default thing i order every italian </connor>
<connor> restaurant that's like that's how i </connor>
<connor> gauge how good the rest of the italian </connor>
<connor> food is right because you'd have to like </connor>
<connor> try an italian would have to try really </connor>
<connor> hard to [ __ ] up a lasagna sure because </connor>
<garnt> there are way more like complicated </garnt>
<garnt> dishes in the italian cuisine so i </garnt>
<garnt> always rewarded lasagna um </garnt>
<connor> and then </connor>
<connor> i will say the guy did look a bit </connor>
<garnt> panicked when you ordered the lasagna he </garnt>
<connor> was like </connor>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> he's like oh that one yeah he was like </joey>
<joey> oh you're ordering that one i was like </joey>
<joey> it's been a while since i've had lasagna </joey>
<joey> and of course it it comes out and it's </joey>
<joey> probably been an order it's probably </joey>
<joey> been a while since they ordered this </joey>
<joey> yeah it comes out and i'm just like oh </joey>
<garnt> that looks it looks a little soggy </garnt>
<garnt> that looks like a little bit of a soggy </garnt>
<garnt> lasagna it was it was something like </garnt>
<connor> what 20 something dollars yes like 20. </connor>
<connor> like this but it wasn't like a giant </connor>
<garnt> piece either no no no no normal size </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a 28 like but like all the </garnt>
<joey> dishes in that restaurant were about </joey>
<joey> like yeah they're all at least 20 </joey>
<joey> dollars eight dollars quite a lot of </joey>
<connor> money it's a lot of money um and i like </connor>
<connor> i put my fork into it and it just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] this this pasta just </connor>
<connor> disintegrates right </connor>
<connor> this thing wasn't made out of pasta it </connor>
<connor> was made out of air and </connor>
<connor> i'm like i've never seen pasta so soft </connor>
<connor> in my life yeah and i take it i </connor>
<connor> i take like my first bite and you know </connor>
<connor> when you can immediately immediately </connor>
<connor> tell that you're just going to have the </connor>
<connor> worst meal of your life yeah so god </connor>
<connor> looks so disappointed </connor>
<connor> everyone everyone was like staring at me </connor>
<connor> because i because they were so excited </connor>
<connor> because like oh go and order lasagna </connor>
<garnt> let's see let's see what he thinks about </garnt>
<garnt> it i take one spoonful i think my face </garnt>
<garnt> conveyed everything that needed to be i </garnt>
<joey> wish i had taken a photo of the face </joey>
<joey> that you had made because it was like if </joey>
<joey> you looked up disappointment in the </joey>
<garnt> dictionary that was the face </garnt>
<garnt> because the first bite first of all the </garnt>
<garnt> pasta was soggy all of it was soggy yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it somehow even though the pasta even </garnt>
<connor> the lasagna was like full of tomato </connor>
<connor> sauce somehow they've made tomato taste </connor>
<connor> nothing taste of nothing like i don't </connor>
<connor> know how you make tomato taste of </connor>
<connor> nothing because it just it was cold on </connor>
<connor> the inside right as well and and it was </connor>
<connor> called it was so obviously microwaved </connor>
<connor> yeah as well because the hot the outside </connor>
<garnt> was super super hot but then the inside </garnt>
<connor> was lukewarm and i was just like this is </connor>
<connor> this is yeah to the restaurant's credit </connor>
<connor> my dish was actually pretty decent i </connor>
<connor> think i would have like a uh a lamb </connor>
<connor> pasta it was pretty good actually yeah i </connor>
<joey> like uh i like a gnocchi i think which </joey>
<joey> was like it wasn't the best gnocchi i've </joey>
<connor> had but it was it was decent i know you </connor>
<connor> should you get lasagna to see if the </connor>
<connor> restaurant's good yeah i feel in my mind </connor>
<connor> if i get the calamari that's how i can </connor>
<connor> normally tell because the calamari is </connor>
<connor> one of those dishes where it's it's </connor>
<connor> really easy to buy it frozen yeah and </connor>
<joey> just deep like chuck it in the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> deep fryer yeah just call it a day but </joey>
<joey> like if they actually care you can tell </joey>
<joey> that it's it's fresh and it's not </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] rubbery and then you know it's </joey>
<joey> everything else could be good because </joey>
<joey> that's a very specific thing that you'd </joey>
<joey> have to go out of your way to make sure </joey>
<joey> it's fresh that's true that's true that </joey>
<joey> was bad i mean like it wasn't worth the </joey>
<connor> money it was just too expensive it was </connor>
<joey> so expensive it was yeah it was </joey>
<joey> definitely i mean the gnocchi was like </joey>
<joey> decent but i would not pay the amount i </joey>
<garnt> paid for it yeah yeah i mean like one </garnt>
<garnt> one of my biggest pet peeves when i go </garnt>
<garnt> to a restaurant is that </garnt>
<connor> i like as someone who grew up in like </connor>
<connor> the whole restaurant kind of like area </connor>
<connor> you do you sh if you can't make a good </connor>
<connor> dish don't put it on the menu like you </connor>
<connor> know what i mean like there are some </connor>
<connor> restaurants i go to where they give you </connor>
<joey> the menu and it's just the entire </joey>
<joey> history of your country's cuisine i'm </joey>
<joey> like there is there is no [ __ ] way </joey>
<garnt> you can cook all of these dishes </garnt>
<joey> and like a good kind of </joey>
<joey> there's like 200 items on the menu it's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> are you sure </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i get it if there's that one </garnt>
<garnt> guy comes to your [ __ ] restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> he's just like oh why don't you have </garnt>
<garnt> this dish that everyone else has you </garnt>
<garnt> know i'm just like you know [ __ ] [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> that [ __ ] you know just serve good just </garnt>
<garnt> serve the dishes that you know you can </garnt>
<joey> cook really really well five to ten </joey>
<joey> items i feel is like i feel a good </joey>
<connor> middle ground because it's like you know </connor>
<connor> maine's yeah okay like five to ten mains </connor>
<joey> i think is like the good middle ground </joey>
<joey> because it's like you know those five to </joey>
<connor> ten mains are gonna slap we went to </connor>
<connor> another italian place that was really </connor>
<joey> good around the same price and it was </joey>
<joey> amazing oh yeah so good oh yeah the one </joey>
<joey> we went with uh yeah yeah amazing and it </joey>
<joey> was i think it was around the same </joey>
<garnt> prices for like everything yeah yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> i thought wow okay well so it isn't just </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm i'm being cheap it's like no </garnt>
<garnt> these are the same prices we just got </garnt>
<connor> ripped off in this one yeah yeah but </connor>
<connor> that's how it is and that made me </connor>
<connor> understand more like when i went to more </connor>
<connor> independent uh restaurants and more uh </connor>
<connor> coffee places a lot of the time i kind </connor>
<connor> of understand why a lot of people just </connor>
<connor> want that familiarity of a chain well </connor>
<connor> you know what you get because it's such </connor>
<connor> a gamble in the u.s oh like oh it's a </connor>
<garnt> gamble everywhere yeah but like in japan </garnt>
<joey> you like </joey>
<garnt> you you gotta be pretty unlucky </garnt>
<garnt> like you talk about the us being a </garnt>
<garnt> gamble let's talk about the [ __ ] uk </garnt>
<connor> the uk's are sad this is the same though </connor>
<connor> this is why like restaurants in the uk </connor>
<connor> like and cafes like a lot of the </connor>
<connor> independent ones struggle because a lot </connor>
<connor> of people don't like they want that </connor>
<connor> familiarity yeah and they want like you </connor>
<connor> know when you go to a [ __ ] wendy's </connor>
<connor> you know exactly what you're getting </connor>
<connor> sure yeah whereas if i go out of my way </connor>
<connor> i i take a date i pay a [ __ ] ton of </connor>
<connor> money and i get half-assed meal pasta </connor>
<connor> i'm like [ __ ] i should have just gone </connor>
<garnt> olive god like i know what i would have </garnt>
<garnt> got yeah yeah cause we we talked about </garnt>
<garnt> the us having like the 4.5 google </garnt>
<garnt> reviews kind of meta the uk just doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> have a meta when it comes to google </garnt>
<garnt> reviews you just like people in the uk </garnt>
<garnt> don't know how to review food that's </garnt>
<joey> that's just the end or be all the water </joey>
<joey> was not spicy five stars </joey>
<garnt> because i've been to restaurants in the </garnt>
<garnt> uk that's like </garnt>
<joey> seven four point eight i'm like okay </joey>
<joey> this place must absolutely slap </joey>
<connor> it's awful </connor>
<joey> like really there are some places that </joey>
<garnt> are out there like the ratatouille </garnt>
<garnt> critic </garnt>
<garnt> i'm about to end this restaurant's </garnt>
<connor> career </connor>
<garnt> hold my pen </garnt>
<connor> to be fair to be fair i've like see in </connor>
<connor> recent years especially this trip i have </connor>
<connor> discovered way more decent restaurants </connor>
<joey> in the uk that i that i had that i did </joey>
<joey> than before i moved out of the uk i </joey>
<joey> think that i think the uk have just </joey>
<garnt> definitely upped their restaurant game </garnt>
<joey> um yeah because i don't know what you </joey>
<joey> experienced beforehand but this was the </joey>
<connor> first time for me that i probably </connor>
<connor> explore explored london and like the </connor>
<joey> food culture surrounding and i'm like </joey>
<joey> why is what are people complaining about </joey>
<joey> this is actually pretty decent maybe i </joey>
<joey> just got lucky i don't know but yeah we </joey>
<connor> just have it we just steal other </connor>
<connor> people's food and uh you know that's </connor>
<joey> good </joey>
<joey> i mean australia kind of does the same </joey>
<connor> thing yeah we don't have like a cuisine </connor>
<connor> it's like what do you want like there's </connor>
<connor> probably someone here who makes it like </connor>
<connor> church do you want like new zealand rat </connor>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> because i remember when we went to the </joey>
<joey> uk i think maylin landed and i think two </joey>
<joey> days after she landed she'd had like </joey>
<connor> four meals and she'd message me being </connor>
<connor> like in all caps do reviews not mean </connor>
<connor> anything here </connor>
<connor> how do you know who to trust how do you </connor>
<connor> know which google review to trust and i </connor>
<connor> was like do you review things i don't </connor>
<joey> remember i review things really oh i </joey>
<joey> never i never even looked at google </joey>
<garnt> reviews before i moved to japan oh okay </garnt>
<joey> yeah right now </joey>
<joey> because i just looked at something and </joey>
<joey> i'm just like oh that looks like a </joey>
<joey> couple of photos i'm like yeah that was </joey>
<connor> good i review things i feel like </connor>
<connor> people like me are keeping society </connor>
<connor> together without me there won't be </connor>
<connor> there's so much chaos how will everyone </connor>
<connor> know what did you always review though </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah i've been doing it for a long </garnt>
<garnt> time okay so before you move to japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah before i move to japan because like </garnt>
<connor> i understand the culture here because </connor>
<connor> you review something it means something </connor>
<connor> here yeah you throw you throw a review </connor>
<connor> in the in the uk google reviews it's </connor>
<connor> just like a message and you throw a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] message in the bottle into the </garnt>
<joey> sea like it's not gonna reach anyone man </joey>
<joey> it's like a message in dark souls </joey>
<garnt> i am guilty though of the whole </garnt>
<joey> five-star one-stop meta i am guilty of </joey>
<joey> that what do you mean i'm either a </joey>
<joey> five-star guy or a one-star guy you've </joey>
<joey> never rated anything three stars no i </joey>
<joey> have i just like in my head </joey>
<joey> if something's three a lot of the time i </joey>
<joey> want to go back and confirm it's a three </joey>
<joey> yeah but also why would i want to go </joey>
<joey> back to the three because you're kind of </joey>
<joey> indifferent to it right yes i'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah whatever yeah yeah and like some </joey>
<joey> places i </joey>
<joey> like a lot of the times i've gone to </joey>
<connor> restaurants i've ordered one thing and </connor>
<connor> i'm like and then for some reason i've </connor>
<connor> gone back and i've got a different dish </connor>
<connor> and i'm like oh oh this is just this is </connor>
<connor> so much better this dish like i just </connor>
<connor> happen to get the dish that they do </connor>
<connor> poorly right you could argue that that's </connor>
<connor> like reflective on them and they that </connor>
<connor> they shouldn't put it on the menu it's </connor>
<joey> better whatever but i feel like it can </joey>
<joey> vary so much whereas like if you have a </joey>
<joey> five-star time you're like everything </joey>
<joey> was perfect it was amazing staff were </joey>
<connor> amazing ambiance oh everything was </connor>
<joey> amazing right all right well five stars </joey>
<connor> where on the on the inverse side where </connor>
<connor> it's like if it was all [ __ ] i i knew it </connor>
<joey> was all [ __ ] right she's terrible so you </joey>
<joey> just nip it back yeah so i never go back </joey>
<joey> and give it one starts right right but a </joey>
<connor> lot of the times i </connor>
<connor> the places i go to in japan are just </connor>
<connor> purely off recommendations yeah so </connor>
<connor> i kind of normally go to places that </connor>
<connor> i've always really liked i've not gone </connor>
<connor> to many places that i haven't enjoyed in </connor>
<connor> japan yeah because everyone is always </connor>
<connor> like this is my favorite restaurant so i </connor>
<connor> go tricks i'm like oh it must be pretty </connor>
<joey> good i mean yeah at the end of the day </joey>
<joey> word of mouth i think is the most </joey>
<garnt> effective way of finding oh dude yeah </garnt>
<garnt> honestly some play some places in japan </garnt>
<connor> aren't even on google reviews or they're </connor>
<connor> not they're not on it if you just search </connor>
<connor> restaurants near me or something like </connor>
<connor> that yeah next kind of restaurant i'm </connor>
<connor> looking for sometimes you have to like </connor>
<connor> really really look uh and that's why </connor>
<connor> word of mouth means so much here in </connor>
<connor> japanese food culture because people </connor>
<connor> follow what other people say and if you </connor>
<connor> see a huge line at a japanese restaurant </connor>
<joey> you know that [ __ ] [ __ ] slaps even </joey>
<joey> though i never think it's worth waiting </joey>
<garnt> an hour for any meal in my life sure </garnt>
<joey> sure [ __ ] that yeah i'll go to </joey>
<connor> mcdonald's </connor>
<connor> i'm not waiting </connor>
<connor> of waiting well outside of a restaurant </connor>
<joey> yeah 20 minutes tops i'm not doing more </joey>
<joey> yeah for me it's like no more than 30. </joey>
<garnt> yeah i think 30 minute is the absolute </garnt>
<connor> limit it really depends like okay if we </connor>
<connor> have like 20 people and they say 30 </connor>
<connor> minutes i'm like we're waiting 30 </connor>
<connor> minutes we're not gonna find somewhere </connor>
<connor> else so it's like but if it's just me </connor>
<connor> and someone else 20 minutes tops yeah </connor>
<connor> and it's going to be a restaurant i know </connor>
<connor> it's true otherwise i'm like 10 minutes </connor>
<joey> yeah because it could just be a huge </joey>
<joey> waste of time and the food is kind of </joey>
<connor> mediocre yeah i'd rather just go </connor>
<connor> somewhere if like if you're in an area </connor>
<joey> where there's a bunch of restaurants </joey>
<connor> nearby i'd rather just go somewhere else </connor>
<garnt> just the name yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's true yeah one one one small thing </joey>
<joey> that annoyed me in some of the </joey>
<joey> restaurants we found in l.a was that you </joey>
<garnt> know sometimes we were in a group we </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to go out have a nice meal </garnt>
<garnt> together all right let's phone up the </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant and book a table you find out </garnt>
<connor> the restaurant they're like we don't do </connor>
<connor> bookings yeah it's like a thing in l.a </connor>
<garnt> right turn up in the door and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like why why </garnt>
<connor> yeah a lot of the restaurants we went to </connor>
<joey> wouldn't accept i never understood why </joey>
<joey> that's the case is it so to avoid people </joey>
<connor> flaking out i think </connor>
<connor> i there must be some math behind it </connor>
<connor> where someone has worked out that you </connor>
<connor> can make more money and get more </connor>
<connor> customers in the door by doing it just </connor>
<connor> turn up right because if they're full </connor>
<connor> and you can't reserve then you're not </connor>
<connor> going to show up but maybe you want to </connor>
<connor> go maybe they can squeeze you in if </connor>
<connor> there's two of you right i feel like if </connor>
<joey> for the restaurants that are in really </joey>
<connor> high demand it must make more money yeah </connor>
<joey> because you can get more customers in </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah people are willing to wait 20 </connor>
<garnt> 15 minutes at the door right right so i </garnt>
<connor> i feel for like yeah like what was it </connor>
<garnt> like sugar fish whatever </garnt>
<garnt> sugar fish was one of them there was i </garnt>
<joey> mean </joey>
<joey> we went to the first italian restaurant </joey>
<garnt> we went to before we found the other </garnt>
<garnt> italian restaurant yeah yeah yeah that </garnt>
<connor> was that was the biggest thing because </connor>
<connor> also when you when you go one day and </connor>
<connor> you can't get in you're like i should </connor>
<connor> come back again because clearly it's </connor>
<connor> good everyone's waiting and and to be </connor>
<connor> fair the restaurants where i did have to </connor>
<connor> wait we're pretty damn good </connor>
<connor> i i feel like yeah it's a strategy to </connor>
<connor> just make more money </connor>
<connor> and also you don't have to deal with </connor>
<joey> reservations not showing up yeah i think </joey>
<joey> i think that makes more sense to me than </joey>
<connor> because you you lose money right if you </connor>
<joey> serve a table and they don't show up or </joey>
<connor> they show up 20 minutes late or 15 </connor>
<connor> minutes late or they show up 20 minutes </connor>
<garnt> early and you're like </garnt>
<garnt> it's not ready basically they've just </garnt>
<garnt> min maxed restaurants right </garnt>
<connor> but but you know when there's a group of </connor>
<garnt> like four or more preserving is like </garnt>
<connor> amazing because it's like we know that </connor>
<connor> we can turn up at this time and we'll be </connor>
<connor> good and japan's great for that that's </connor>
<joey> why i love japan yeah because you can </joey>
<joey> reserve any or most places except except </joey>
<garnt> for a danny's it's not it's not even </garnt>
<garnt> japan in most places in the world i've </garnt>
<connor> been to there's </connor>
<connor> most restaurants do reservations and </connor>
<connor> three two to like i've okay let me let </connor>
<connor> me rephrase that i've never seen this </connor>
<connor> system ever anywhere outside of l.a i've </connor>
<connor> never have you ever seen it anywhere </connor>
<connor> outside of valley i'm sure it's in like </connor>
<joey> new york a place like that you call them </joey>
<joey> up and they they say no reservation yeah </joey>
<garnt> there's places that just don't take </garnt>
<joey> responsibility well other than like </joey>
<connor> other than like [ __ ] mcdonald's </connor>
<garnt> the restaurant meter mcdonald's every </garnt>
<connor> other restaurant </connor>
<connor> la restaurant donald's is a restaurant </connor>
<connor> all right the restaurant </connor>
<joey> the family </joey>
<joey> for families i guess so yeah because you </joey>
<joey> know because you know throwing it back </joey>
<joey> to the time we tried to reserve for </joey>
<joey> seven people </joey>
<joey> and they were like we don't take </joey>
<joey> reservations just show up please i'm </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah we'll pay </joey>
<joey> we really want that denny's though </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>

<joey> this so many times before but i </joey>
<connor> australia to me was like the uk except </connor>
<connor> everyone there was just way happier </connor>

<connor> australia wow i'm i'm like i'm like </connor>
<connor> trying i'm like trying to rack my brain </connor>
<connor> over something i can complain about </connor>
<connor> because we're [ __ ] british and we </connor>
<joey> need to complain about everything and i </joey>
<joey> guess the only thing i complain and i </joey>
<joey> can complain about is the lack of </joey>
<joey> anything to complain about basically </joey>
<joey> like every every australian was like oh </joey>
<joey> so sorry for the weather so sorry for </joey>
<garnt> the weather i was like what what why are </garnt>
<garnt> you apologizing for the weather this is </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing weather </joey>
<joey> it was a bit [ __ ] what are you talking </joey>
<joey> about it was a bit it was a bit cloudy </joey>
<connor> yeah i think it was just a shame because </connor>
<connor> we were really tired so we couldn't </connor>
<connor> really like have a hundred percent i i </connor>
<joey> want to have a vacation there for sure </joey>
<connor> yeah oh yeah yeah i feel </connor>
<connor> especially when it comes to sydney </connor>
<connor> because you know we were there mostly </connor>
<connor> for you know the convention yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> twitch stuff and stuff like that yeah i </connor>
<connor> feel you guys didn't really get to have </connor>
<connor> like a proper view of </connor>
<connor> sydney i guess to a reptile park oh yeah </connor>
<joey> i guess yeah you went around like alex </joey>
<connor> took you around yeah but like i feel </connor>
<garnt> like you and sydney didn't really get to </garnt>
<joey> see like actual sydney sydney yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> like but i mean you at least you got to </garnt>
<garnt> experience melbourne yeah yeah because i </garnt>
<garnt> after the uh after smash tour and i </garnt>
<connor> traveled to melbourne because we had </connor>
<connor> some uh i have some family there who </connor>
<connor> i've never visited in australia </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> and it was [ __ ] fantastic because </connor>
<connor> they live right like they live more on </connor>
<connor> the outskirts of melbourne they live </connor>
<garnt> near yarra valley which is basically </garnt>
<garnt> just a bunch of [ __ ] wineries so i </garnt>
<garnt> was me and sydney just had a whole </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] field day just going around </garnt>
<garnt> wineries one day they took us around </garnt>
<joey> you're engaging in an australian </joey>
<connor> activity yeah yeah that is yeah wineries </connor>
<garnt> is an australian activity </garnt>
<garnt> exactly how could i complain when we </garnt>
<garnt> just like what we did to to be showing </garnt>
<garnt> around was being shown around a bunch of </garnt>
<garnt> wineries and just trying a bunch of </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] wines beaches wineries and </joey>
<connor> breweries that's just australia saw some </connor>
<garnt> uh saw some kangaroos on a golf course </garnt>
<connor> that was that was weird oh yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> got to i went up to like little baby </connor>
<connor> kangaroos you can like pet them and </connor>
<garnt> stuff yeah it was fun yeah yeah joey's </garnt>
<connor> yeah little girl yeah </connor>
<connor> seeing kangaroo i've never heard that </connor>
<connor> one before </connor>
<connor> seeing kangaroos like up close in real </connor>
<connor> life for the first time um </connor>
<garnt> just made me like just confirmed with me </garnt>
<garnt> how [ __ ] batshit natural selection </garnt>
<garnt> was in australia like i just what </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] happened to natural selection </garnt>
<connor> australia i don't get it that's what </connor>
<connor> happens when you have a server </connor>
<connor> completely isolated from any other </connor>
<garnt> server sure like even just looking at </garnt>
<garnt> kangaroos right i'm like how the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> did </garnt>
<garnt> what what what happened in the history </garnt>
<connor> of kangaroos to lead your evolution </connor>
<connor> because you know basically everywhere </connor>
<connor> else in the world because what i've </connor>
<connor> realized is that kangaroos are basically </connor>
<joey> just australian deers right </joey>
<connor> they're basically just australian deers </connor>
<joey> but like in every other in in every </joey>
<joey> other side of the world </joey>
<joey> animals just decided okay four legs </joey>
<joey> walking on four legs that's the meta </joey>
<joey> that's the most effective meta and then </joey>
<joey> all the way in [ __ ] australia </joey>
<connor> kangaroos are like that's just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bounce everywhere right </connor>
<garnt> does not even [ __ ] walk let's bounce </garnt>
<garnt> everywhere like what the [ __ ] happened i </garnt>
<connor> mean if you're talking about dumb </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] evolution the koala is like the </garnt>
<garnt> king of like [ __ ] stupidity </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> when you hear like when i did the irl </connor>
<connor> stream we got to hear about the koalas </connor>
<connor> and literally every single koala </connor>
<connor> attribute had like 20 caveats right they </connor>
<joey> were like so goddamn dumb they all they </joey>
<joey> could only eat one [ __ ] plant yeah </joey>
<joey> eucalyptus tree and the best part is is </joey>
<joey> that if you take the eucalyptus leaf off </joey>
<connor> the tree they don't know what it is yeah </connor>
<connor> they're like i can't eat this yeah what </connor>
<connor> is this what's this leaf what is it what </connor>
<joey> i don't know what this is they don't eat </joey>
<joey> it how how and also the reason why they </joey>
<garnt> sleep for 16 hours a day is because the </garnt>
<garnt> toxins and the eucalyptus leaf basically </garnt>
<joey> act the same way that marijuana does to </joey>
<garnt> humans so they're just stoned </garnt>
<joey> that's what i realized koalas just are </joey>
<joey> just the [ __ ] stoners of the world </joey>
<joey> yeah they're just stoner bits yeah </joey>
<connor> that's all they are and the babies have </connor>
<garnt> to eat the mom's poop right yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> like i found this out at the smash con </connor>
<connor> panel where koalas have to like when </connor>
<garnt> koalas are born the mum needs to eat the </garnt>
<garnt> eucalyptus leaves and [ __ ] it out yeah </garnt>
<joey> right because the because the baby's </joey>
<joey> stomach isn't strong enough to break </joey>
<joey> down the toxins of the eucalyptus tree </joey>
<garnt> because it's technically toxic yeah how </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] did this animal survive in </garnt>
<garnt> australia one of the most dangerous </garnt>
<garnt> places in the world in terms of wildlife </garnt>
<garnt> how how the [ __ ] does that happen you </garnt>
<garnt> know like they literally lucked out by </garnt>
<garnt> putting all their points into cuteness </garnt>
<garnt> if humans didn't exist they'd be [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> man oh yeah absolutely cuteness only </joey>
<joey> from a distance though because like i </joey>
<connor> don't know if you ever got like did you </connor>
<connor> ever get to get like really close to a </connor>
<joey> quality yeah i got to touch it does it </joey>
<connor> not smell like [ __ ] oh yeah they all </connor>
<joey> smelled really good they smell [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> horrible actually yeah yeah well yeah </joey>
<joey> they they're literally born eating [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> so of course they're gonna smell like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] as well like there are a lot of </connor>
<connor> maintenance to keep them happy i think </connor>
<connor> as well yeah otherwise they just die </connor>
<connor> they're just like ah [ __ ] it i'll die </connor>
<connor> yeah guess i'll die </connor>
<joey> literally they will they're too stoned </joey>
<joey> to care man </joey>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<joey> i feel like you guys didn't even get to </joey>
<joey> see like the truly weird animals that we </joey>
<garnt> have no we didn't even </garnt>
<garnt> we only saw your base level animals and </garnt>

<joey> because i remember you were freaking out </joey>
<connor> about like all the wild cockatoos right </connor>

<garnt> like hundreds of years the pigeon and </garnt>
<joey> seagull mata yeah true true i mean we </joey>
<joey> have seagulls as well </joey>
<garnt> even your seagulls look way more </garnt>
<garnt> aesthetic than rc goals really yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> they do they do what do your seagulls </joey>
<joey> look like hideous </joey>
<joey> i don't look at a seagull and go like </joey>
<garnt> damn that's a good looking bird though i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't do that until i went to australia </garnt>
<garnt> and saw your seagulls they're so like </garnt>
<garnt> slim their beaks are nice and polished </garnt>
<garnt> they're actually clean and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] are the seagulls in </garnt>

<garnt> the ibis again the bean chicken or the </garnt>
<garnt> bin chickens yeah yeah yeah i just like </garnt>
<joey> it's this by the way for those of you </joey>
<connor> who've never been weird </connor>

<garnt> that like </garnt>
<connor> australia like allowed them to exist </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> because they feel like i feel like when </connor>
<joey> an animal gets too big </joey>
<connor> it just gets like destroyed yeah because </connor>
<joey> it gets destroyed yeah because i said </joey>
<connor> the reason why we can't [ __ ] keep </connor>
<joey> tigers alive because they're too big and </joey>
<joey> easy to [ __ ] capture sure yeah </joey>
<garnt> because i feel like it's too big of a </garnt>
<connor> bird it's not nimble enough it looks so </connor>
<garnt> weird as well yeah yeah literally like i </garnt>
<connor> remember i remember like the first time </connor>
<connor> i saw it was actually walking right in </connor>
<connor> the center of the streets of sydney oh </connor>
<connor> so many of them yeah there's so many </connor>
<connor> because normally i'm used to just seeing </connor>
<garnt> pigeons and seagulls in a city i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> and then i suddenly turn the corner and </garnt>
<garnt> this massive [ __ ] bird with a really </garnt>
<garnt> long thick like no a really long slender </garnt>
<connor> narrow beak and i'm like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> is that yeah yeah yeah can they fly yo </joey>
<joey> is that a pokemon oh yeah </joey>
<joey> uh nothing </joey>
<connor> honestly is there any like do they do </connor>
<connor> they have some ecological uh service </connor>
<connor> that they do for the </connor>
<joey> what are they they they they eat the </joey>
<joey> trash i guess oh that's why they're </joey>
<joey> called bin chickens because they're </joey>
<joey> always rummaging around because they're </joey>
<joey> like they're basically the rats of </joey>
<connor> sydney do you like spiders get rid of </connor>
<connor> flies and stuff yeah yeah yeah you know </connor>
<joey> what would have been chickens yeah i </joey>
<joey> don't know what </joey>
<joey> what have been look look up the purpose </joey>
<joey> of an ibis </joey>
<connor> like what ecological roles do they serve </connor>
<connor> in the hierarchy i don't know like to </connor>
<connor> entertain us yeah yeah funny chickens </connor>
<joey> entertainment to entertain foreigners </joey>
<joey> what the hell is that </joey>

<connor> that like every time if i'm like eating </connor>
<connor> outside or something and there's just a </connor>
<connor> bunch of ibises like </connor>
<joey> walking around i'll just be like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] off yeah yeah you know because like </connor>
<joey> i don't i haven't really ever seen or </joey>
<connor> heard of an ibis like attacking someone </connor>
<connor> or like someone getting hurt </connor>
<joey> oh they got a long beast they just </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] stopped speak out the way it's </connor>
<joey> like you're gonna do it </joey>
<joey> just grab it by the beach </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> i don't know do you know what it is </joey>
<joey> i figured that out okay okay tell me </joey>
<joey> what it is </joey>
<connor> everything we hate gets rid of another </connor>
<joey> insect i don't think i've ever seen an </joey>
<connor> ibis on a farm though they're always </connor>
<connor> like near the coast aren't they because </connor>
<connor> they're like just like </connor>
<connor> me i just discovered these things were a </connor>
<connor> month ago i don't know like they're in </connor>
<connor> this they're in the middle of the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] city i don't see a farm in the </joey>
<connor> middle of the city i think speaking of </connor>
<connor> bin chickens and terrible meals in l.a </connor>
<connor> reminding me of this i went to medieval </connor>
<joey> times </joey>
<joey> you know oh okay no you haven't seen </joey>
<garnt> medieval times do you ever watch cable </garnt>
<garnt> guy no the movie jim carrey where he's </garnt>
<joey> not where he's the cable guy no it's a </joey>
<connor> really good one explain yeah right so </connor>
<joey> medieval times is this kind of um is it </joey>
<joey> like a renaissance fair or uh it's like </joey>
<connor> a pantomime performance where there's </connor>
<connor> like an arena and there's like knights </connor>
<connor> of different colors and the </connor>
<connor> the seating areas like a stadium mini </connor>
<connor> stadium oh cool they're ranging to </connor>
<connor> colors and everything everyone gets a </connor>
<connor> house color right right and you sit and </connor>
<connor> you watch the performance and you get a </connor>
<connor> meal your drinks as well </connor>
<connor> and um yeah so then these dudes come out </connor>
<connor> and like white red or whatever and they </connor>
<connor> all do like games to see who's the the </connor>
<connor> best knight and then they have a fight </connor>
<connor> at the end to decide it's all </connor>
<connor> choreographed </connor>
<connor> and they all talk with british accents </connor>
<connor> and some some of the actors nail it and </connor>
<connor> some of them oh god there's this one </connor>
<connor> actor who like it sounded like sylvester </connor>
<connor> stallone tried to do a british accent it </connor>
<connor> was so bad </connor>
<connor> every time he spoke i just couldn't like </connor>
<connor> because i was with emily and died i just </connor>
<connor> couldn't stop laughing and then they </connor>
<connor> would start laughing so like connor he's </connor>
<connor> trying his best </connor>
<connor> it's just so bad he's so bad </connor>
<connor> um but it was really fun it was </connor>
<connor> interesting they're really [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> at their job yeah i mean </connor>
<joey> yeah it was a fun performance i thought </joey>
<joey> i was going to hate it because i was </joey>
<connor> like ah it seemed really true is the </connor>
<joey> meal any good or oh god knows </joey>
<connor> so i what did you get </connor>
<joey> i i i mean to their credit it was </joey>
<connor> accurate to the 1200s </connor>
<connor> like you don't get a knife and fork </connor>
<connor> which i'm fine with i'm fine with i just </connor>
<connor> i didn't know that so when i got a whole </connor>
<joey> chicken and a garlic bread and a soup i </joey>
<joey> i was like oh oh i just i just like grab </joey>
<connor> it </connor>
<joey> did i get no i don't think i got a knife </joey>
<joey> how the [ __ ] are you supposed to eat the </joey>
<joey> soup you just grab the plate just like </joey>
<garnt> that or yeah i think so just use your </garnt>
<garnt> just cup with your hand </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah you do </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> you're starving </connor>
<connor> yeah literally it was all with your </connor>
<connor> hands because like i remember they gave </connor>
<connor> us like two moist towelettes and i was </connor>
<connor> like rationing them while trying to eat </connor>
<connor> this full like quarter chicken right and </connor>
<connor> and there was no seasoning on this </connor>
<connor> chicken and this thing was bone dry </connor>
<joey> right bone with a capital b dry </joey>
<joey> right no no no no because the soup was </joey>
<connor> just tomato soup and it was like the </connor>
<connor> exact kind of like you know that if you </connor>
<connor> had to mass manufacture tomato soup </connor>
<connor> that's the exact taste it was </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> can i get this straight i'm not </connor>
<connor> complaining about the food because i i </connor>
<garnt> expected it to be good i know that when </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a pentaminos thing you're not </garnt>
<connor> going for the food yeah of course but if </connor>
<garnt> i could have like had my an option but </garnt>
<garnt> he didn't expect to eat like a peasant </garnt>
<connor> if i could an actual peasant if i could </connor>
<joey> have had an option to not eat the food </joey>
<joey> and eat somewhere else i would have done </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> oh it wasn't even an option to not have </joey>
<joey> the food no no you you get the food oh </joey>
<connor> and they gave us garlic bread bro and i </connor>
<connor> tap this on my glass and don't don't </connor>
<connor> don't </connor>
<connor> again again i don't care i literally </connor>
<joey> don't care i just thought it was funny </joey>
<joey> at least the show was good right now the </joey>
<joey> show was great </joey>
<joey> dude they were really whacking each </joey>
<joey> other with these metal swords because </joey>
<joey> there was like sparks flying out oh [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> it was hype as [ __ ] i got really into it </connor>
<connor> i was </connor>
<connor> screaming anyway this chicken chicken i </connor>
<connor> was like nearly i was in like the sahara </connor>
<connor> desert by the end of it i was drinking </connor>
<connor> i had like a four liter beer as well </connor>
<garnt> guess how much it cost me </garnt>
<garnt> four four liters it was like three liter </garnt>
<garnt> beer i'm exaggerating </garnt>
<joey> guess how much it cost me it's uh 20 30 </joey>
<garnt> bucks maybe how much do you think it was </garnt>
<garnt> i think about 30 bucks yeah it was 35 </garnt>
<connor> yeah this beer and i didn't know this </connor>
<connor> because it wasn't well explained to me </connor>
<connor> or maybe i'm just dumb i didn't listen </connor>
<joey> so you paid 35 american goddamn dollars </joey>
<joey> for unincluded tip um i i don't know if </joey>
<joey> i had a tip it was i was just at a bar </joey>
<joey> something like a service charge or </joey>
<connor> something i think so yeah yeah okay so </connor>
<connor> apparently you get to then refill that </connor>
<connor> i think you get to keep it i did i </connor>
<garnt> didn't keep it because i didn't know </garnt>
<connor> that but apparently refill the glass </connor>
<joey> with beer yeah yeah yeah right well then </joey>
<joey> that's [ __ ] that's worth it yeah no </joey>
<connor> no no that's all you can drink for 35. </connor>
<connor> for the refill how much </connor>
<joey> eight or nine bucks oh that's not too </joey>
<joey> bad right but i mean getting through </joey>
<connor> three liters of beer in like an hour and </connor>
<connor> a half show how many beers can i chug </connor>
<joey> bro like that's that wasn't even the </joey>
<joey> worst though remember the [ __ ] beer </joey>
<joey> that i bought for everyone at the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] mogul money </joey>
<connor> oh remember how expensive that would be </connor>
<joey> like a can of corona it's like a can of </joey>
<joey> corona for like 18 and i'm just like i i </joey>
<connor> bought four so we were all in mogul </connor>
<joey> yeah let's let's go to the bar and you </joey>
<connor> know buy a can of beer because it's a </connor>
<joey> show </joey>
<joey> yeah and i was just like guys don't </joey>
<joey> worry i got this one you know i was </joey>
<joey> feeling good that day i got full like </joey>
<joey> you know tall boys of beer it was like </joey>
<connor> 96 dollars i'm like all right okay </connor>
<connor> that's fabulous that's the stadium </connor>
<joey> i actually tried to okay i didn't i had </joey>
<joey> to ration this [ __ ] out i didn't tell </joey>
<joey> you boys this about what happened before </joey>
<joey> you bought the beer yeah because the </joey>
<joey> reason joey bought all the beers was </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> uh to get into this venue you had to you </joey>
<joey> either had to have like a </joey>
<joey> a clear bag uh or you had to like put </joey>
<joey> your bag into storage or or it was a </joey>
<joey> small bag or it has to be like a really </joey>
<joey> really small bag like a bomb yeah so my </joey>
<joey> bag was too big to go into the security </joey>
<joey> and this bag is tiny yeah yeah it was a </joey>
<joey> really really tiny bag um and so i was </joey>
<joey> like great i'll just put my bag into </joey>
<joey> storage that's no problem i'll bring out </joey>
<joey> my credit card just in case need to buy </joey>
<joey> something i put it in and then only </joey>
<joey> after i go into security </joey>
<joey> do i remember </joey>
<joey> oh yeah my id was in that bag and i </joey>
<joey> completely forgot to bring my id </joey>
<joey> and so </joey>
<joey> and so </joey>
<joey> we go up we go up and it's it's like </joey>
<joey> it's actually pretty chill right it's </joey>
<joey> not like we got grilled or anything like </joey>
<joey> that they just you know they just ask </joey>
<connor> for id </connor>
<connor> and so i tried to explain that you know </connor>
<connor> i didn't have my id but i'm [ __ ] 32 </connor>
<connor> okay i'm i'm i'm 32. i forgot my bag uh </connor>
<connor> i forgot my id in my bag that's in a </connor>
<connor> storage case ten minutes down away uh i </connor>
<connor> i asked me where i was at 911 </connor>
<garnt> and so and so they were like do you have </garnt>
<garnt> any kind of form of id on you that we </garnt>
<garnt> can take at all </garnt>
<garnt> and like i look at him then i was just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> do you uh so this is going to sound </garnt>
<garnt> weird </garnt>
<garnt> but i have a wikipedia article </garnt>
<garnt> and i have a favorite should we do that </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like oh are you serious </garnt>
<garnt> can i see it and so i i load up my </garnt>
<garnt> wikipedia article and i can see this guy </garnt>
<connor> just he he he looked at it and he was </connor>
<connor> just like [ __ ] is this a form of id i </connor>
<connor> can actually accept and he actually </connor>
<connor> considers it for about like a minute or </connor>
<garnt> two and i'm like please guy my guy come </garnt>
<garnt> on look i i am actually 32 and he's just </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> oh sorry i don't think i can accept that </garnt>
<connor> but if but if you get someone else to </connor>
<connor> buy it on your behalf aka joey then </connor>
<garnt> that'll be fine so that's that's why </garnt>
<connor> they allowed joey to buy it for me </connor>
<joey> you literally pulled the </joey>
<garnt> i'm kind of famous </garnt>
<connor> like this is the first time i've ever </connor>
<garnt> tried to flex the fact that yeah okay </garnt>
<connor> okay </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> there's some mileage out of it you know </joey>
<joey> that i i hope they [ __ ] normalize </joey>
<joey> that from now on though </joey>
<garnt> like that's photo id yeah </garnt>
<joey> famousbirthday.com yeah come on my </joey>
<connor> photo's there my birthday's there </connor>
<connor> i can't believe that's something i would </connor>
<connor> do </connor>
<connor> that's a me thing that's not easy </connor>
<connor> i was desperate for a [ __ ] beer okay </connor>
<connor> because i because the reason is we once </connor>
<connor> we went in we couldn't go back out so </connor>
<connor> there was no way i would i thought there </connor>
<garnt> was no way i could get a beer for this </garnt>
<garnt> show and i was like i can't sit through </garnt>
<garnt> a [ __ ] three-hour show so why are you </garnt>
<garnt> kidding me </garnt>
<garnt> that's how i'm british of me you know </garnt>
<joey> um yeah the beer was stupidly expensive </joey>
<connor> i paid like 90 bucks for four beers and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like what the actual [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that's where they're making all their </connor>
<joey> money not these [ __ ] tickets of </joey>
<connor> course of course yeah i guess i guess </connor>
<joey> the medieval times one was good in </joey>
<joey> comparison oh yeah i don't think what </joey>
<connor> time is good though it's a good show you </connor>
<joey> should go sometime it's fine oh i loved </joey>
<connor> it that sounds really really fun yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it was surprisingly good they did </connor>
<connor> the whole thing at the start of the show </connor>
<connor> where they read out everyone's birthday </connor>
<connor> and it was like timothy uh 11 years old </connor>
<connor> congratulations oh yeah i'm on a kids </connor>
<connor> thing technically that's good fun though </connor>
<joey> oh yeah get a good piss up with the boys </joey>
<joey> yeah hell yeah that sounds fun yeah we </joey>
<garnt> should definitely go next time yeah </garnt>
<garnt> going back to australia though one thing </garnt>
<garnt> i did notice uh hanging out with </garnt>
<garnt> australians is that </garnt>
<garnt> australian sarcasm is just on a level </garnt>
<garnt> that i've never seen before okay </garnt>
<garnt> because how sir because here's the thing </garnt>
<joey> it's like you guys are constantly </joey>
<joey> looking for the next target to prank and </joey>
<joey> you never talk about this verbally but </joey>
<joey> as soon as you say as soon as someone </joey>
<joey> makes up a lie or jokes about someone or </joey>
<joey> about something to a foreigner or </joey>
<joey> something everyone just univer everyone </joey>
<joey> in australia universally agrees to get </joey>
<joey> in on this joke oh yeah yeah right and </joey>
<joey> that's why like one thing i didn't </joey>
<joey> understand before going to australia is </joey>
<connor> like why every australian just agreed to </connor>
<garnt> try to trick the world about drop bears </garnt>
<connor> yeah which uh what what is like the drop </connor>
<joey> bear law what do you mean trick they're </joey>
<joey> real </joey>
<connor> this guy this guy </connor>
<joey> like they pretend like people live in </joey>
<connor> australia </connor>
<joey> yeah right you all would live in a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] house no one lives there it's a </garnt>
<connor> simulation so when i saw this happening </connor>
<connor> first hand yeah it was uh we did a </connor>
<connor> stream in australia where like we found </connor>
<joey> out what tim tam slams were </joey>
<joey> yeah that was my favorite thing we found </joey>
<joey> out what happened uh we found out what </joey>
<joey> team time slams were so tim tam slams uh </joey>
<joey> so tim tams are kind of biscuits in </joey>
<joey> australia like a chocolate biscuit yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like two uh two biscuits with like </joey>
<joey> a chocolate filling and what happens is </joey>
<connor> you bite you bite off two corners and </connor>
<connor> you put it in tea or coffee or whatever </connor>
<connor> whatever and then you suck out the uh </connor>
<connor> liquids literally no point in doing this </connor>
<connor> yeah absolutely no there's no benefit to </connor>
<joey> either the drink i think i think you </joey>
<joey> have to know how to do it in order to </joey>
<connor> get a visa yeah australia but um yeah </connor>
<connor> it's definitely on the citizenship test </connor>
<connor> that's for sure but we did it because </connor>
<connor> they're you know because we're on the </connor>
<connor> australia set and the the live stream we </connor>
<garnt> did was australia theme so they were </garnt>
<joey> like oh let's just get the boys to do a </joey>
<garnt> team team slam exactly completely failed </garnt>
<garnt> at it yeah um but one person who wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> there was sydney </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> we were we had a panel together </garnt>
<garnt> where </garnt>
<garnt> someone asked us on stage if we'd done a </garnt>
<garnt> tim tam slam and obviously me and me and </garnt>
<garnt> connor had just done one so we said yes </garnt>
<garnt> and sydney's like what's a tim tam slam </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason as soon as she said </garnt>
<garnt> that everyone every australian perks up </garnt>
<garnt> and i was just like this is this is </garnt>
<garnt> content right here this is content right </garnt>
<garnt> here and then so joey jokingly says okay </garnt>
<garnt> so what happens in australia when you </garnt>
<garnt> get a pack of tim tams is you just slam </garnt>
<garnt> it on the floor and you just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> slam it uh until it's [ __ ] until it's </garnt>
<garnt> crumbs and you eat the crumbs and that's </garnt>
<joey> the tim tam slam yeah right and then you </joey>
<joey> know and and you know uh the crowd and </joey>
<joey> the the emcee were all just like yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah that's he's right and the thing is </joey>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> me being british i was like they said </garnt>
<garnt> that so sarcastically yeah of course </garnt>
<garnt> sydney's never going to fall for that so </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind i was like i thought sydney </garnt>
<garnt> got the joke yeah i thought sydney had </garnt>
<garnt> gotten the joke </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<joey> she didn't really question it she was </joey>
<joey> just kind of like oh okay yeah okay </joey>
<garnt> and so </garnt>
<garnt> after this the next day we all had a </garnt>
<garnt> signing together </garnt>
<connor> and someone in sydney signings </connor>
<connor> brings her a pack of tim tams </connor>
<connor> and then </connor>
<connor> and then she go and then he goes oh do </connor>
<joey> you mind doing a tim tam slam for me </joey>
<joey> and sydney goes yeah of course of course </joey>
<joey> i'll do it </joey>
<joey> i know what that is so i'm sitting </joey>
<garnt> necessarily just signing away and all i </garnt>
<garnt> hear next to me is just </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like what the [ __ ] cindy </garnt>
<garnt> what are you doing what are you doing </garnt>
<connor> sydney she's just like i'm doing my </connor>
<joey> tim's up slime why are you stopping me </joey>
<connor> why are you stopping me i'm like sitting </connor>
<joey> there sort of </joey>
<joey> they've tricked you </joey>
<joey> as soon as i said that everyone every i </joey>
<connor> swear every [ __ ] australian everyone </connor>
<connor> in the queue looked at me and i was like </connor>
<connor> god what are you doing what are you </connor>
<connor> doing why would you say that and i was </connor>
<garnt> just like how how have you all just </garnt>
<garnt> agreed to just like try to trick </garnt>
<garnt> everyone that you've everyone that </garnt>
<connor> you've met were they just was everyone's </connor>
<joey> gonna watch her batter these biscuits </joey>
<joey> absolutely i was going to she was </joey>
<joey> battering it for like a good few seconds </joey>
<garnt> and nobody said [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> everyone was everyone was just like yep </joey>
<joey> you got it you gotta just keep doing a </joey>
<joey> couple times </joey>
<garnt> being like you got this queen all right </garnt>
<garnt> next step you just gotta pick the crumbs </garnt>
<connor> up and eat it and i'll just like </connor>
<connor> it was so funny i was impressed </connor>
<connor> oh my god that the australia chose one </connor>
<connor> of the most boring [ __ ] food items to </connor>
<connor> be like their mascot like it's literally </connor>
<connor> just a chocolate biscuit and it's a very </connor>
<connor> very ordinary chocolate tasting biscuit </connor>
<joey> like you guys can't talk you you guys </joey>
<joey> are like yes </joey>
<connor> chips and a fried fish listen the uk is </connor>
<connor> not any better right but i expected </connor>
<connor> better from australia because you had a </connor>
<connor> do-over you got to do it right and you </connor>
<joey> were like oh let's just get the generic </joey>
<joey> ash chocolate biscuit which we have we </joey>
<joey> have tin times in the uk they're just </joey>
<joey> called [ __ ] normal chocolate biscuits </joey>
<joey> like we have the exact same type of </joey>
<connor> biscuits we just don't care because </connor>
<connor> they're nothing special but yeah but </connor>
<connor> australia decided oh this is gonna be </connor>
<connor> our thing and you go to the airport and </connor>
<connor> everything's tim tam themed in the gift </connor>
<connor> section like this is [ __ ] yeah no it's </connor>
<joey> just no it's because it's it's because </joey>
<connor> it's the most uh non-challenging food </connor>
<connor> item that any foreigner from any country </connor>
<connor> can be like yes that's good that's </connor>
<connor> acceptable i like chocolate i like </connor>
<connor> biscuits right like it's kind of </connor>
<connor> difficult to be like you know oh so </connor>
<connor> australia we have this thing called </connor>
<connor> vegemite and we have this part </connor>
<connor> it's good and we have this party food </connor>
<joey> called fairy bread uh favorite [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly right it's good </joey>
<joey> two opposites right here but i think </joey>
<joey> anyone of any palette can agree that </joey>
<joey> like yeah [ __ ] who doesn't like </joey>
<joey> chocolate biscuits </joey>
<joey> i don't like drinking biscuits well </joey>
<joey> that's a you problem everyone else </joey>
<joey> everyone else likes chocolate biscuits </joey>
<joey> so that's why we used it as like a </joey>
<connor> marketing method as a kid i like </connor>
<connor> chocolate tasting stuff and then you </connor>
<connor> know what happened as i got older i just </connor>
<connor> felt that chocolate tasting things just </connor>
<connor> taste bad and like really artificial </connor>
<connor> almost i don't know why </connor>
<connor> even though it's not because a lot of </connor>
<connor> times you melt chocolate in it or just </connor>
<joey> put chocolate i don't know why i mean </joey>
<joey> like i i'll i'll admit that i don't eat </joey>
<connor> as much chocolate as i used to </connor>
<connor> definitely i can't eat as much chocolate </connor>
<connor> just like physically because i start to </connor>
<connor> get sick but like i'm not i'm too sickly </connor>
<connor> i want to go as far as to say that i </connor>
<joey> will just pass up chocolate at any </joey>
<connor> chance i can get like normal chocolate </connor>
<connor> like chocolate bars i'm there but like </connor>
<connor> chocolate flavored things it'll be </connor>
<connor> really sickly am i i don't know </connor>
<joey> personally i don't know if given the </joey>
<joey> chance i can i can slam a packet </joey>
<connor> he said that i'm just like okay go ahead </connor>
<connor> have your opinion what do you why </connor>
<connor> chocolate flavored things whoa something </connor>
<connor> about chocolate flavored like chocolate </connor>
<connor> ice cream chocolate biscuits just makes </connor>
<garnt> me feel kind of sick </garnt>
<joey> is this is this is crazy i can do this </joey>
<joey> again are you playing devil's advocate </joey>
<connor> or is this your favorite </connor>
<garnt> this is genuinely how i feel that's </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way you actually believe that </garnt>
<connor> i believe that it's a [ __ ] copious </connor>
<connor> that's how it is when i taste chocolate </connor>
<connor> flavored things i'm like literally any </connor>
<garnt> other flavor would be better than this </garnt>
<garnt> bro you you advocate for vanilla i love </garnt>
<joey> vanilla you advocate for vanilla </joey>
<connor> chocolate i'm sorry vanilla is an </connor>
<joey> amazing taste </joey>
<joey> i have a feeling you've said an opinion </joey>
<connor> about chocolate where you were praising </connor>
<connor> like chocolate flavored things in a part </connor>
<connor> maybe i'm just tripping maybe our </connor>
<connor> audience will remember chocolate bars </connor>
<connor> like milk chocolate dark chocolate bars </connor>
<connor> i [ __ ] love i think that they're </connor>
<connor> amazing but that's like the that's like </connor>
<garnt> just the chocolate in its purest form </garnt>
<garnt> give me the [ __ ] cocoa bean bag and </garnt>
<garnt> to [ __ ] shove it in my mouth yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> that's like chocolate cookies i don't </garnt>
<connor> really like chocolate cookies fudge uh </connor>
<connor> fudge is okay chocolate cake chocolate </connor>
<garnt> cake is too much oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<joey> i am trying to process i can i can hear </joey>
<connor> the blood boiling in here i just think </connor>
<connor> there's too much chocolate like shoved </connor>
<garnt> into like per bite but like you fudge is </garnt>
<garnt> like even more intense than chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> cake is and you're saying chocolate cake </garnt>
<garnt> some fudges are okay but </garnt>
<connor> it's some </connor>
<garnt> brownies brownies okay brownies are good </garnt>
<garnt> but brownies isn't like more heavy they </garnt>
<joey> say but they [ __ ] up that's like </joey>
<joey> concentrated chocolate yeah brownies are </joey>
<joey> like got to be warm brownies as well i </joey>
<garnt> don't like cold brownies well nobody </garnt>
<garnt> likes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah okay </garnt>
<garnt> there we go there we go i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> just i don't know brownies uh again like </garnt>
<joey> and i can't i i'm sure you're the same i </joey>
<joey> i don't know anyone anyone who could eat </joey>
<joey> like a [ __ ] ton of brownies like i could </joey>
<joey> wash it </joey>
<joey> that's the stone when you talk yeah okay </joey>
<garnt> like stoners be like oh just watch me </garnt>
<connor> i'll bet </connor>
<connor> plain fresh cookies chocolate chip </connor>
<connor> perfect like that's that's perfection in </connor>
<connor> the cookie to me </connor>
<joey> right a chocolate cookie is too much </joey>
<joey> too much chocolate flavor </joey>
<joey> i'm not trying to say this i'm trying to </joey>
<joey> comprehend this is not one of my </joey>
<joey> opinions where i'm like i believe that </joey>
<connor> you both are wrong and you should </connor>
<joey> definitely 100 understand my like i get </joey>
<connor> it that oh don't worry we're not this </connor>
<joey> could definitely be </joey>
<connor> the weird opinion why is so much dust in </connor>
<connor> front of me what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> happened just like sneeze getting that </connor>
<connor> old </connor>
<connor> dust particles in my face yeah so i </connor>
<connor> think here there's dust in my face </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> my oxygen has been compromised but it's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] dust </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> yeah no i i i just think vanilla is an </connor>
<connor> amazing flavor um of course you do </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> yeah it's just too sickly for me i i </connor>
<connor> know that that's not normal though i </connor>
<joey> know that's me yeah okay look don't give </joey>
<joey> her like i understand the point of too </joey>
<joey> much chocolate it gets me sick right </joey>
<joey> because we think but that's a lot of </joey>
<connor> sweet things like too much vanilla will </connor>
<connor> make me sick as well i will say one of </connor>
<connor> my favorite desserts is uh sticky toffee </connor>
<joey> pudding that's good though that's like </joey>
<joey> more i like it when you have the </joey>
<joey> chocolate stuff with like a big like a </joey>
<joey> sauce or something to help with the </joey>
<joey> flavor like a chocolate sauce for </joey>
<joey> instance no no chocolate sauce on </joey>
<joey> chocolate is [ __ ] disgusting that's </joey>
<joey> way too much well that's that wouldn't </joey>
<joey> that be like a chocolate lava cake like </joey>
<connor> you don't like those no no actually </connor>
<joey> they're okay it depends </joey>
<joey> it's like a few bites like one or two </joey>
<joey> again it's a sickly thing it's not it's </joey>
<connor> not a taste thing it's a sickly thing so </connor>
<joey> are you like this with any other sweet </joey>
<joey> things or is it just specifically </joey>
<garnt> chocolate sticky toffee pudding is like </garnt>
<garnt> way more sickly than anything chocolate </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's why you have the vanilla ice </connor>
<connor> cream to neutralize it you know what i </connor>
<joey> mean yeah okay so are you the same with </joey>
<joey> vanilla ice cream for instance like if </joey>
<joey> you eat enough vanilla ice cream will </joey>
<connor> you get some no i can i can go to town </connor>
<connor> on vanilla ice cream </connor>
<garnt> that was our same brain cells just </garnt>
<connor> firing off being like yes </connor>
<joey> oh connor has an opinion again yeah it </joey>
<joey> is it is it's the slow head zone of like </joey>
<joey> excuse me i i i'm sure there are some </joey>
<connor> other people out there who think that </connor>
<connor> chocolate is too sickly </connor>
<joey> no i agree with you on chocolate beans </joey>
<garnt> that's actually like </garnt>
<connor> that's actually that's actually a common </connor>
<garnt> opinion </garnt>
<connor> a lot of chocolate is very very heavy </connor>
<connor> this is the problem tastes right is that </connor>
<connor> i don't know if my opinion is a general </connor>
<connor> shed opinion and you two are just clowns </connor>
<joey> it's a bit of both i think we're all </joey>
<joey> clowns here that's a bit of a point </joey>
<joey> that's the point of it you can't just </joey>
<garnt> dismiss every chocolate item aside from </garnt>
<connor> chocolate bars </connor>
<connor> i know </connor>
<garnt> uh what was the [ __ ] fountain what </garnt>
<garnt> are you talking about </garnt>
<garnt> the lava cake whatever yeah lava </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate cake right great example one </garnt>
<connor> bite god tier i love that [ __ ] it tastes </connor>
<connor> great mm-hmm two bites i'm like oh my </connor>
<garnt> god i feel like i'm about to [ __ ] do </garnt>
<garnt> that's why literally you use the same </garnt>
<garnt> strat as you do with the sticky toffee </garnt>
<garnt> pudding you never have a chocolate lava </garnt>
<garnt> cake by itself </garnt>
<connor> or ice cream or a whipped cream </connor>
<connor> toffee sauce is a game changer yes i </connor>
<garnt> just love toffee toffee's great </garnt>
<garnt> i like i i hate toffee for the same </garnt>
<connor> reason you hate chocolate stuff because </connor>
<joey> exactly yes way too sickly i like i i </joey>
<connor> don't like caramel stuff it's a weird </connor>
<connor> one because i know i i especially on </connor>
<connor> this chocolate thing i contradict myself </connor>
<connor> a lot yeah so it's very much dish </connor>
<joey> dependent i i get you on the fact that </joey>
<connor> like too much chocolate is sickly but </connor>
<connor> i'm like that with all sweet things not </connor>
<connor> just chocolate like if i eat enough </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] strawberry flavored ice cream or </joey>
<connor> like vanilla rice like for me i think </connor>
<connor> i'll get sick i think chocolate ice </connor>
<connor> cream has got to be like bottom tier </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] f tier it's like one of the </connor>
<joey> ones no strawberries bought them too </joey>
<connor> strong okay okay strawberry </connor>
<garnt> do we agree boys </garnt>
<connor> strawberries strawberry ice cream unless </connor>
<connor> they they use like god tier fresh </connor>
<connor> strawberries and it's made up yeah but </connor>
<garnt> it's never i know it's never done no no </garnt>
<garnt> nevertheless you could say that's the </garnt>
<connor> same thing about any kind of like </connor>
<connor> dessert right you use the fresh </connor>
<connor> ingredients yeah it's gonna be better no </connor>
<connor> well then that's like okay every every </connor>
<connor> like ice cream or dish or milkshake or </connor>
<connor> whatever has that it has that the </connor>
<connor> distinct like </connor>
<connor> uh cheap flavor that every like flavor </connor>
<joey> alternative has like banana has that </joey>
<connor> cheap flavor yeah yeah chocolate has </connor>
<connor> that cheap flavor go-to right strawberry </connor>
<joey> has that but so does vanilla uh yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah vanilla but i think out of all of </connor>
<connor> them like the cheap flavor like </connor>
<connor> strawberry is probably the worst one oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah and then chocolate because i i </garnt>
<connor> realized like two of my favorite fruits </connor>
<connor> are strawberry and banana right i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] love eating those fruits </connor>
<connor> yeah absolutely </connor>
<garnt> gods here but i hate anything that's </garnt>
<garnt> flavored like them you know i like </garnt>
<connor> flavored things do you like banana ice </connor>
<connor> cream uh yeah yeah yeah i like banana </connor>
<connor> flavor but it's not my go-to it's it's </connor>
<joey> it's like my fourth choice listen if i'm </joey>
<connor> getting the banana i'm getting three </connor>
<joey> scoops someone is one of them like i </joey>
<joey> need something else to ride right right </joey>
<joey> because yeah dude i mean there's this </joey>
<connor> one there's an ice cream place in </connor>
<connor> hokkaido and so got it's like a chain </connor>
<connor> that you want to get in hokkaido dude </connor>
<connor> they do like the most insane flavors of </connor>
<connor> ice cream and it just makes ice cream </connor>
<joey> like another level it's like you just </joey>
<joey> can't go back to here but that's just </joey>
<joey> hokkaido just being but like it was like </joey>
<connor> it was like you'd get ice cream and it's </connor>
<joey> like tiramisu ice cream and i'm like i'm </joey>
<connor> just i'm just there for that like that's </connor>
<connor> i am there okay that is a game changer </connor>
<connor> and there was caramel macchiato ice </connor>
<joey> cream i what oh my god that's </joey>
<garnt> if that's what it means to eat ice cream </garnt>
<garnt> like that i'm i'm on board then would </garnt>
<connor> you ever order a sorbet for dessert oh </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] no sorbet is sorbet is dog [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> here of like i think the problem with </joey>
<joey> sorbet is that you can have really good </joey>
<joey> sorbets but at the same time you can </joey>
<connor> have some real dogs </connor>
<connor> sometimes it's so bad </connor>
<connor> what are you doing you must have had </connor>
<connor> some really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> when they tell me </connor>
<connor> i'm like come here just tell me you </connor>
<connor> couldn't afford gelato or ice cream just </connor>
<garnt> just say it okay because like you've </garnt>
<connor> literally complained about chocolate ice </connor>
<connor> cream being too heavy sometimes you have </connor>
<garnt> a heavy meal you're like they bring out </garnt>
<connor> the dessert </connor>
<connor> just come in just give me a just [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> come out with a tune teaspoon and just </garnt>
<garnt> pour the flavoring directly in my mouth </garnt>
<connor> don't give it to me through this icicle </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i don't want a [ __ ] ice cone </garnt>
<garnt> right it's not even an ice hole it's </garnt>
<connor> like an ice cream that you literally </connor>
<connor> just caught sorbet it's like a hard ice </connor>
<connor> cone bro it tastes like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> if you need a light dessert if something </joey>
<joey> creamy like ice cream cone sometimes i </joey>
<garnt> have a meal so </garnt>
<connor> i don't want a knife it's not creamy </connor>
<joey> enough it's just that's the whole point </joey>
<garnt> of it cream's heavy it's not meant to be </garnt>
<connor> a heavy dessert it's like it's like </connor>
<connor> just admit it you're you're you're a </connor>
<connor> snow cone with like a droplet of cream </connor>
<garnt> just get it out of the way some </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you need a dessert that's a </garnt>
<joey> different kind of heaviness to ice cream </joey>
<joey> sometimes i don't want ice cream to </joey>
<joey> finish yeah sometimes i don't want ice </joey>
<garnt> cream and sometimes i don't want fruit </garnt>
<joey> as a dessert sometimes i want it's like </joey>
<connor> it's like the sorbet the probably </connor>
<connor> strawberry mainly is okay one the </connor>
<connor> texture's awful i just don't like it </connor>
<connor> because i'm also i'm a i'm a snow cone </connor>
<connor> hater uh and and it's it leans too </connor>
<connor> closely to that kind of okay you know </connor>
<joey> like you don't like cocky guardian </joey>
<connor> snowflakes </connor>
<connor> it's awful oh my god um and </connor>
<connor> also my other problem with it is that </connor>
<connor> every sorbet flavor just seems to be </connor>
<connor> awful like they just they they can never </connor>
<garnt> make it it's literally like fruit </garnt>
<joey> flavored a lot of times you know like </joey>
<joey> do you know like orange orange orange is </joey>
<joey> the worst flavoring known to man i think </joey>
<joey> orange is like orange </joey>
<connor> orange has to be like </connor>
<joey> okay i said strawberry from australian </joey>
<connor> sarcasm or are you like actually serious </connor>
<connor> like i i know we said that strawberry </connor>
<connor> was down there and now that i would </connor>
<connor> remind me because i must have blocked it </connor>
<garnt> out because i don't want to exist </garnt>
<garnt> strawberry is by far by far i think the </garnt>
<garnt> worst flavor of any fruit it's so bad </garnt>
<connor> strawberry oh sorry uh orange sorry </connor>
<connor> orange is such a chocolate oh </connor>
<connor> right but the moment you get just orange </connor>
<joey> on its own i don't like too much </joey>
<joey> chocolate orange flavor sucks but orange </joey>
<joey> chocolate though orange chocolate damn </joey>
<connor> it's the rare combination where two </connor>
<connor> flavors if they you know they they drop </connor>
<connor> their differences they can come together </connor>
<garnt> make something decent but </garnt>
<garnt> i hate chocolate i hate orange orange </garnt>
<connor> chocolate two negatives three negatives </connor>
<connor> make a plus it's where you should never </connor>
<connor> rule out possibilities right i just </connor>
<connor> think that orange sorbet awful like </connor>
<connor> orange flavored drinks orange flavored </connor>
<connor> ice cream oh it's just so bad it's just </connor>
<joey> so bad i think i think i think i figured </joey>
<joey> it out connor just has some of the most </joey>
<connor> skewed taste </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> food that i've ever seen where it's like </connor>
<connor> you you really like what you really like </connor>
<connor> but you really don't like what you </connor>
<joey> really do i just think that like and you </joey>
<joey> are so [ __ ] particular about [ __ ] if </joey>
<connor> i went to a restaurant and it's all </connor>
<connor> i had for dessert no i'm not i just i </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> someone who won't eat it like if you </connor>
<connor> give me an orange sorbet i'm going to </connor>
<joey> eat it but i'm going to be begrudgingly </joey>
<joey> annoyed the whole time that you gave me </joey>
<connor> an orange so you're just a stubborn </connor>
<joey> picky eater no no no no i i will eat </joey>
<connor> anything i got a real can you give me </connor>
<connor> this [ __ ] slimy thing i'll stomach it </connor>
<connor> and i'll be like fine i'll [ __ ] eat </connor>
<connor> this slimy thing i don't want to eat but </connor>
<joey> i'll eat it like i really because every </joey>
<joey> yokan we've been to together you've </joey>
<joey> passed me the slimy [ __ ] immediately if </joey>
<connor> you're gonna eat it let's </connor>
<garnt> let's let's move back for a second my </garnt>
<connor> point being is a picky eater somebody </connor>
<garnt> doesn't eat it i will always eat it </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah let's move back for a second </garnt>
<garnt> what is this tirade against oranges what </garnt>
<garnt> it's literally the vanilla of the fruit </garnt>
<garnt> world how'd you hate how do you hate </garnt>
<connor> oranges </connor>
<connor> it is such it's not gonna because </connor>
<connor> vanilla is quite mild in flavor right </connor>
<connor> it's a very like light flavor it's not </connor>
<connor> intense orange it's a very intense </connor>
<connor> flavor you just hate it it's so acidic </connor>
<connor> okay let me guess do you like orange </connor>
<connor> juice no i hate orange we've said this </connor>
<garnt> before i hate orange juice do you just </garnt>
<garnt> like because the thing is oranges are so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] refreshing do you know </connor>
<connor> refreshing stuff it's like acid </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ass how weak </connor>
<connor> it is it is absolutely because there was </connor>
<garnt> a lot of fruit juice you know i feel </garnt>
<connor> literally most fruit juices </connor>
<connor> of the citrus family lemon and lime </connor>
<connor> absolute god tier they figured it out </connor>
<garnt> how to make it refreshing you literally </garnt>
<garnt> want to have a raw lemon versus having a </garnt>
<garnt> raw orange </garnt>
<connor> yeah definitely </connor>
<connor> are you serious like i know lemon is </connor>
<connor> like more acidic but like the flavors </connor>
<connor> that you get in like lemonade are less </connor>
<connor> acidic than you get in say orange juice </connor>
<connor> like orange juice is always way more </connor>
<joey> acidity yeah that's because lemonade is </joey>
<connor> very different to lemon juice i know the </connor>
<connor> lemon flavored things are also nicer i </connor>
<garnt> find </garnt>
<garnt> hold on </garnt>
<garnt> there's so much [ __ ] that's being </garnt>
<joey> spewed right now that like i'm having a </joey>
<garnt> trouble processing like </garnt>
<connor> orange juice </connor>
<connor> is is awful like it's just a it's just a </connor>
<connor> bad drink like it just doesn't taste </connor>
<garnt> good you're so you are so wrong you're </garnt>
<connor> so wrong i mean you're </connor>
<connor> just there's there's not enough well </connor>
<garnt> there's not enough hats in the world to </garnt>
<garnt> indicate how much cap that is man that's </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm just trying no there's viewers </garnt>
<connor> out there who are watching this who know </connor>
<connor> that orange is [ __ ] who knows that </connor>
<connor> sorbet is bad who knows that chocolate </connor>
<garnt> is too much yeah </garnt>
<garnt> orange is like oranges yeah your altar </garnt>
<garnt> count </garnt>
<connor> your 10 </connor>
<connor> orange is like by like it's probably </connor>
<connor> like one of the worst fruits no no </connor>
<connor> like aren't people what's truly the </connor>
<connor> worst so also orange is just a miserable </connor>
<connor> eating experience it's just terrible how </connor>
<joey> are you eating about are you eating the </joey>
<connor> rind like it's just like a banana </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] easy as [ __ ] you should get it </connor>
<joey> what do you want do you know a thing </joey>
<joey> there is a thing called a knife </joey>
<connor> but no knife needed i love that </connor>
<connor> i wanna [ __ ] have to peel this open </connor>
<connor> like a caveman banana easy bro you lit </connor>
<connor> you just [ __ ] cut it into quarters </connor>
<connor> the banana has an elegancy to it the the </connor>
<joey> the orange you gotta [ __ ] pry it open </joey>
<joey> like a caveman scrambling for his meal </joey>
<joey> you literally have to do that with a </joey>
<connor> lemon and a lime as well though i don't </connor>
<joey> eat [ __ ] lemon and limes on their own </joey>
<joey> you literally just said you would rather </joey>
<garnt> eat a raw lemon than an orange i would </garnt>
<connor> never do it there's an elegance he says </connor>
<connor> the banana you could it's oh yes oh yes </connor>
<garnt> oh yes </garnt>
<garnt> don't mind if i do there's an elegance </garnt>
<garnt> he says talking about the fruit literal </garnt>
<garnt> apes eat you know there's a reason why </garnt>
<connor> they </connor>
<connor> they don't want to fumble around with an </connor>
<joey> orange it just makes more sense it </joey>
<joey> literally has two iq like </joey>
<connor> he's just like too many steps </connor>
<connor> also i just think the texture of like a </connor>
<connor> i just think everything about the orange </connor>
<connor> i just dislike like with the texture of </connor>
<connor> eating an orange i feel like the texture </connor>
<garnt> oh no like the texture of bananas are </garnt>
<joey> like not good it's waste waste it gets </joey>
<joey> way too much it gets weighted it gets </joey>
<joey> way too mushy </joey>
<joey> okay okay look it's it's a gamble with a </joey>
<connor> banana sometimes you gotta have the </connor>
<connor> perfect texture for it to be like yeah </connor>
<connor> that was a [ __ ] amazing look </connor>
<connor> sometimes the banana can be too hard </connor>
<joey> sometimes it's just a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> here thinking that banana has the best </connor>
<joey> texture of any fruit no it does when </joey>
<joey> it's when it's the optimal texture to </joey>
<garnt> a perfectly ripe banana is the best </garnt>
<connor> vegetable strawberry strawberry </connor>
<connor> watermelon watermelon watermelon's good </connor>
<garnt> that's no not enough taste not enough </garnt>
<connor> taste </connor>
<connor> strawberries like the pop rocks of fruit </connor>
<garnt> excuse me it's okay </garnt>
<joey> what did you say huh there's not enough </joey>
<joey> taste in watermelon </joey>
<connor> it's a very light flavor it's a very </connor>
<garnt> very light flavor it's diluted it's </garnt>
<garnt> mostly it's literally mostly water yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's why i like it yeah i will say </connor>
<connor> out of all the names like our orange is </connor>
<joey> pretty good i mean it's i assume the </joey>
<joey> color was named after the fruit yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah but watermelon yeah they were </joey>
<connor> pretty ripe by calling your watermelon </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm not getting clickbaited yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i know exactly what i'm going in </connor>
<joey> for with the watermelon and you you have </joey>
<joey> a better time </joey>
<connor> melon is better than watermelon just </connor>
<connor> because there's too much water in the </connor>
<connor> watermelon </connor>
<connor> no there is just far too much water like </connor>
<connor> i am getting way too hydrated eating a </connor>
<garnt> watermelon how can you say that apple </garnt>
<garnt> juice is the worst juice no so how can </garnt>
<connor> you say that orange juice is the worst </connor>
<joey> juice when apple juice exists yeah that </joey>
<joey> is i think i think juice is literally </joey>
<garnt> that is water that that is like that is </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> toddler they are like they are like they </connor>
<connor> are like neck and neck to me like apple </connor>
<connor> juice just </connor>
<connor> apple juice just wins in my mind because </connor>
<connor> it's not orange but it is just as bad </connor>
<garnt> what are you what is this orange slander </garnt>
<connor> orange what is this orange racism the </connor>
<connor> worst fruit i think it's by far what did </connor>
<garnt> oranges ever do to you i don't know just </garnt>
<connor> completely my entire life every time </connor>
<joey> i've tried it i just think this tastes </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] like did you get beaten up at </joey>
<connor> school like you're wearing an orange </connor>
<joey> shirt or something like why do you hate </joey>
<connor> art i don't know if it's like the </connor>
<connor> british ancestry of scurvy and [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> i would rather get scurvy than even </connor>
<connor> orange </connor>
<joey> bet </joey>
<connor> i rather would i would scurvy challenge </connor>
<connor> incoming let's go </connor>
<connor> i just don't want to i just don't want i </connor>
<garnt> just don't know what about what about </garnt>
<garnt> orange zest when when there's a dessert </garnt>
<garnt> or something we fancy dessert </garnt>
<connor> are you curious about orange liqueur i'd </connor>
<garnt> rather not if i don't like i again i'd </garnt>
<connor> rather any other i'd like any other uh </connor>
<garnt> citrus liqueur if possible i like </garnt>
<garnt> literally i'm trying to like process </garnt>
<connor> what where this hatred comes on comes </connor>
<connor> from because i'm like </connor>
<joey> maybe it's like the acidity i don't know </joey>
<joey> and then you you go you come here and </joey>
<garnt> say you'd rather eat a raw lemon than </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] did your father throw oranges at </joey>
<joey> you when you like misbehaved </joey>
<joey> like not the </joey>
<connor> oranges on an orange one </connor>
<connor> oh those oranges just taste bad </connor>
<joey> i don't that's what i just think it's </joey>
<joey> the like you have there has to be a </joey>
<joey> worse fruit in your mind right what was </joey>
<joey> from an orange in your mind what's the </joey>
<connor> worst fruit the worst fruit dragon fruit </connor>
<connor> oh it's such a cop out </connor>
<connor> what do you mean it's a cop people don't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] eat that at any time like it's </connor>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> talking about niche fruit are you </garnt>
<connor> talking about fruit that we can buy from </connor>
<garnt> fruit that you can get anywhere in like </garnt>
<joey> a daily life yeah you can get dragon </joey>
<joey> fruit </joey>
<connor> japan where you can buy dragon fruit </connor>
<joey> that's near you right now uh literally </joey>
<joey> the supermarket in my house sells drying </joey>
<connor> fruit bro what was your supermarket some </connor>
<connor> got like [ __ ] whole foods uh erin </connor>
<connor> like that's privilege right there </connor>
<connor> that's actually privilege that is a </connor>
<connor> privilege indicating yeah except it's </connor>
<joey> like a tiny [ __ ] corner there's like </joey>
<joey> two dragon fruits at most you know i'm </joey>
<connor> still there i've never even seen dragon </connor>
<joey> fruit in the store </joey>
<joey> you're probably not working okay so that </joey>
<connor> doesn't count because that's [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> fruit it doesn't exist okay so like a </joey>
<joey> common fruit right common fruit </joey>
<connor> what's the worst fruit the fruit that </connor>
<connor> you you when you thought about anything </connor>
<garnt> like no no i'd rather not you know i'm </garnt>
<garnt> trying to think and i know you're trying </garnt>
<garnt> to pull something out of us i literally </garnt>
<connor> can't think of a fruit i just don't like </connor>
<joey> what a cop out i i just </joey>
<garnt> i'm sorry i just like fruits okay </garnt>
<connor> if i had to like pick something okay </connor>
<joey> no i figured it out this is this is just </joey>
<joey> me personally but for me it's grapes </joey>
<joey> what yeah i'm not a massive fan grape's </joey>
<garnt> a god to you what are you talking about </garnt>
<garnt> joey i know you like wine how could you </garnt>
<connor> hate grapes how could you hate grapes </connor>
<joey> the reason why grapes is that's like </joey>
<joey> saying how could you hate bread you like </joey>
<connor> beer it's like there's nothing alike i </connor>
<connor> have to say grapes are the like and this </connor>
<connor> is this puts it in s here for me grapes </connor>
<connor> yeah it's the only fruit where you can </connor>
<connor> always get the perfect amount of the </connor>
<connor> fruit that you want like you can have as </connor>
<connor> many grapes as that suits you always if </connor>
<connor> you want a [ __ ] ton of grapes go down go </connor>
<connor> to town and it's also such a satisfying </connor>
<joey> eating experience </joey>
<joey> i don't know i'm just not a massive fan </joey>
<joey> of grapes i'll eat grapes but like i </joey>
<joey> would rather ha i would rather cut an </joey>
<joey> orange open than eat some grapes i'm </joey>
<connor> gonna say this that's just me personally </connor>
<connor> though i'm just gonna say it i'm i'm a </connor>
<connor> vegetable guy all the way i think </connor>
<garnt> vegetables are so goddamn superior to </garnt>
<garnt> fruit in every single way you just hate </garnt>
<garnt> desserts you just you just say sweet i </garnt>
<connor> just like sweet stuff like vegetables </connor>
<joey> are just so much better i hate sweet </joey>
<garnt> stuff if it's not vanilla like if if i </garnt>
<garnt> had to pick guns in my head worse fruit </garnt>
<connor> even though i don't really hate it </connor>
<connor> probably apple </connor>
<connor> like there's there is no category some </connor>
<connor> experience eating in the airport it's </connor>
<connor> like there is no category that apple </connor>
<connor> goes in that is that can't be beaten by </connor>
<garnt> another fruit i think i i think it's one </garnt>
<joey> of those i like i like i like green </joey>
<connor> apples i'm not huge into red apples i </connor>
<connor> don't like red granny </connor>
<connor> smith so yeah green ones granny smith </connor>
<connor> green apples banger i i it's i know i </connor>
<connor> really like eating apples actually but </connor>
<connor> it's just a lot like there's always a </connor>
<connor> lot of apples yeah it's one of them it's </connor>
<joey> actually i think it's the most filling </joey>
<joey> uh fruit oh absolutely yeah absolutely </joey>
<connor> and it feels like you eat like ate a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] a380 it's like it's a whole meal </connor>
<joey> so much food like if the apples </joey>
<joey> especially in japan where the apples are </joey>
<connor> like [ __ ] this big like that's a meal </connor>
<connor> um so yeah that's kind of where i stand </connor>
<connor> on it i just think vegetables are the </connor>
<garnt> superior ones they're more look don't </garnt>
<garnt> give me something so </garnt>
<connor> also vegetables are better for you just </connor>
<connor> saying is is that the reason why you </connor>
<connor> hate sorbets just because you hate </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] fruit i hate fruit flavored </connor>
<connor> things so </connor>
<connor> i figured it out you just hate [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> so if there was a vegetable flavored </connor>
<joey> sorbet would you oh [ __ ] no that sounds </joey>
<joey> awful why would you want that just just </joey>
<connor> a hypothetical no no no no no i i would </connor>
<connor> want i i just want okay first of all </connor>
<connor> don't want a sorbet i feel like the </connor>
<garnt> texture of it is just the worst i could </garnt>
<garnt> like i think a vegetable sorbet could </garnt>
<connor> work i just gelato like a like a gelato </connor>
<connor> and soft serve and normal ice cream all </connor>
<garnt> the way </garnt>
<garnt> but like sometimes sometimes </garnt>
<connor> there are sometimes never an occasion </connor>
<garnt> where i will say no there are </garnt>
<garnt> there are some times where you've had </garnt>
<garnt> such a [ __ ] filling heavy </garnt>
<garnt> main course but you still want something </garnt>
<garnt> just to like take the edge off because </garnt>
<joey> let's be real that's so bad </joey>
<joey> let's be real that whole saying of like </joey>
<joey> oh dessert is another stomach it's </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] no no no no it's not it's </connor>
<connor> actually not it's proved that you're </connor>
<connor> stuck you can actually make more room </connor>
<connor> for dessert because the way i can't the </connor>
<connor> way that it works with sweet and salty </connor>
<connor> is that you can trick your brain into </connor>
<connor> thinking that there's there's more room </connor>
<joey> than there is i'm sure that's why you </joey>
<joey> over eat i'm sure at the time yeah but i </joey>
<joey> know for a fact i stopped myself from </joey>
<joey> doing it because i know i'm going to be </joey>
<connor> sick afterwards there's been a lot of </connor>
<connor> studies on this you you can actually </connor>
<connor> make way more room when you're when you </connor>
<connor> have something sweet right </connor>
<connor> i do notice well that's just variety of </connor>
<connor> meals </connor>
<joey> if you have one of like the same thing </joey>
<garnt> over and over you can eat you can you'll </garnt>
<connor> you're gonna eat less of it but it's </connor>
<joey> emphasized when you go for something </joey>
<joey> savory it's something really sweet uh </joey>
<joey> just because of how i don't know how </joey>
<joey> much stupid brains work yeah </joey>
<connor> um so but yeah but the great thing about </connor>
<connor> ice cream is the moment you eat it it </connor>
<connor> becomes a liquid so it it'll definitely </connor>
<joey> fit in there so does sorbet it'll make </joey>
<connor> room </connor>
<joey> in fact </joey>
<connor> in fact </connor>
<connor> is more liquidy wait no no you're </connor>
<connor> putting your argument on me i never said </connor>
<connor> that it's too heavy you're you're you </connor>
<connor> just put your [ __ ] argument on to my </connor>
<connor> ice cream love i never said ice cream </connor>
<connor> was too heavy i never said sorbet was </connor>
<joey> too heavy </joey>
<joey> sometimes ice cream is too heavy </joey>
<connor> it's not it can't be too heavy because </connor>
<connor> it'll always fit in your [ __ ] stomach </connor>
<garnt> that's not the point the point is the </garnt>
<garnt> feeling of it right and cream is way </garnt>
<joey> heavier way heavier fruit juice it is if </joey>
<joey> i if i use the same amount of ice cream </joey>
<joey> versus the same amount of sorbet i would </joey>
<joey> feel more sick with the ice cream than </joey>
<garnt> the sorbet like like the exact the exact </garnt>
<garnt> same for the exact same reason why you </garnt>
<garnt> can't eat too much chocolate ice cream </garnt>
<garnt> versus too much vanilla ice cream it's </garnt>
<garnt> because vanilla ice cream feels lighter </garnt>
<connor> than the chocolate right i mean it's </connor>
<connor> just it's not so much there it's more </connor>
<joey> just feels more i don't know why it </joey>
<connor> makes me feel sick immediately i don't </connor>
<joey> even know what we're arguing about </joey>
<joey> anymore </joey>
<connor> i'm trying to argue understand too many </connor>
<joey> arguments happening at the same time </joey>
<garnt> this is this is just there's so many </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] taking husbands just been said in </garnt>
<connor> like uh 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> we just turned preferences into like </connor>
<joey> solid set and stone takes that must be </joey>
<connor> followed yeah because you're making it </connor>
<connor> that way i'm just saying my opinion and </connor>
<connor> then you guys are like connor has an </connor>
<connor> opinion what </connor>
<connor> that's </connor>
<connor> it i just said i think orange is a dog </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] which they are </connor>
<connor> chocolate as a flavor kind of sucks </connor>
<garnt> everyone knows that vanilla is the best </garnt>
<garnt> uh well we can we have the right to uh </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] argue your shitty opinion you </connor>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<connor> well i'm not saying that this is like </connor>
<joey> you know 100 that's what it has to be </joey>
<garnt> all i am is calling you a clown and i i </garnt>
<joey> think i think that's fair </joey>
<joey> you're entitled to your opinion but you </joey>
<connor> definitely said the most unpopular </connor>
<connor> opinion well we don't know because we've </connor>
<connor> had takes before where i've said it and </connor>
<connor> you guys are like no you're dumb as [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> and then all the comments are like nah i </joey>

<connor> reprimanded for no reason and i was </connor>
<connor> completely in the right with the </connor>
