<joey> isn't it so where'd you guys learn new </joey>
<joey> words from because like i told you </joey>
<joey> nintendo sometimes you just hear a word </joey>
<joey> and that like that sticks with you vg </joey>
<joey> games i learned </joey>
<connor> games movies nowadays i pronounce </connor>
<connor> something incorrectly on on a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> video or live stream i got ten thousand </connor>
<connor> comments and emails telling me i </connor>
<connor> pronounced it wrong yeah that's a pretty </connor>
<joey> good way i thought english was your </joey>
<garnt> first language </garnt>
<garnt> uh yes hello this is trash taste it is i </garnt>
<garnt> uh the biggest miku fan apparently uh </garnt>
<joey> idol simp guns right here you look like </joey>
<joey> you're about to go on an idol closet </joey>
<garnt> yeah so we're recording two episodes </garnt>
<garnt> today so we have to like change clothes </garnt>
<garnt> i guess i just gave that away um and </garnt>
<garnt> there was nothing else in the office </garnt>
<connor> aside from miku stuff so today i am the </connor>
<connor> biggest miku fan and uh with me is of </connor>
<connor> course the second biggest miku fan right </connor>
<connor> now don't call me out this was subtle </connor>
<connor> merch bro </connor>
<joey> i didn't even know that was miku yeah </joey>
<connor> it's me </connor>
<connor> no i should know </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> if i if i if i turned around people </connor>
<connor> would be able to see very clearly </connor>
<connor> yeah they don't even see that it's </connor>
<connor> business in the front yeah fun in the </connor>
<garnt> back </garnt>
<joey> and then there's just joey you know the </joey>
<joey> usual whatever </joey>
<joey> the actual miku oh yeah and uh merry </joey>
<joey> christmas everyone </joey>
<joey> i guess this is uh coming out on </joey>
<garnt> christmas it's also the last episode of </garnt>
<garnt> the year yeah </garnt>
<connor> because the next episode is going to be </connor>
<joey> coming out first of january we didn't </joey>
<garnt> even plan that [ __ ] out </garnt>
<garnt> um no i guess that's just how the stars </garnt>
<garnt> aligned when did the last episode come </garnt>
<garnt> out of like did it come out on new </garnt>
<joey> year's eve or did it come out on new </joey>
<joey> year's day i think it came out yeah like </joey>
<garnt> new year's eve i think because i </garnt>
<garnt> remember just getting drunk with chris </garnt>
<joey> and that was like the first </joey>
<joey> the first episode of the year right yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah so i think it must have been </garnt>
<joey> after new year's day then that doesn't </joey>
<joey> feel like a year ago it doesn't feel </joey>
<garnt> like 10 years ago </garnt>
<garnt> my god like where did this year go </garnt>
<garnt> because it feels like the past two years </garnt>
<joey> have just like flown by i mean 2020 just </joey>
<joey> disappeared in a flash obviously because </joey>
<joey> everyone was just inside and depressed </joey>
<connor> but like this year i feel we were able </connor>
<connor> to go out a little bit more at least in </connor>
<connor> japan we're able to go out a little bit </connor>
<connor> more than last year but i think in our </connor>
<joey> case we just had so much [ __ ] going on </joey>
<connor> that it all just like seems like a blur </connor>
<connor> i mean i was i thought i was busy in </connor>
<connor> 2020 and then 2021 was like allow me to </connor>
<connor> introduce myself and then yeah every </connor>
<connor> like you know on the uh on the iphone </connor>
<connor> calendar yeah yeah like when you have </connor>
<connor> something on the iphone calendar like </connor>
<connor> you have something on that day there's </connor>
<connor> like a little dot to symbolize it so </connor>
<connor> yeah it's very easy on iphone to see how </connor>
<connor> busy your past couple months were </connor>
<connor> because every month i came up to the </connor>
<connor> next month and i was like yeah i'll be </connor>
<connor> i'll be a lot more free next month like </connor>
<connor> this is super busy next month though no </connor>
<connor> dots enter that month </connor>
<joey> all dots </joey>
<joey> like oh cool i had three days off last </joey>
<garnt> month no wonder i'm [ __ ] tired yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's it was really </garnt>
<garnt> surreal seeing just your calendar fill </garnt>
<garnt> up because i remember when i first moved </garnt>
<garnt> to japan i i thought who needs a </garnt>
<garnt> calendar we're youtubers we don't need </garnt>
<garnt> calendars we make our own schedule you </garnt>
<garnt> move to japan and slowly you're just </garnt>
<joey> like maybe i need a calendar just to </joey>
<joey> like keep track of like one or two days </joey>
<joey> and then more stuff keeps creeping in </joey>
<joey> and you're just like oh wait i need to </joey>
<joey> put my personal life on my calendar as </joey>
<joey> well because like now i don't know when </joey>
<joey> like my mates want to hang out if i have </joey>
<connor> something going on that day yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> you know it's like </joey>
<garnt> it's so surreal just being this busy and </garnt>
<garnt> i never expected to be this busy in my </garnt>
<joey> life i mean it's definitely a good thing </joey>
<joey> right like you know it's a very uh </joey>
<joey> it's a definitely a very privileged </joey>
<joey> position i would say to be busy and </joey>
<joey> doing all sorts of cool stuff but like </joey>
<joey> at the same time you know it's only so </joey>
<garnt> much my body can handle you know that </garnt>
<garnt> scene in like every like business movie </garnt>
<connor> where the ceos like put it in my </connor>
<joey> calendar i i thought that was just a </joey>
<connor> cliche </connor>
<garnt> oh do i have time for this meeting put </garnt>
<garnt> it in my calendar it's only a matter of </garnt>
<joey> time until we all have our own deborah's </joey>
<connor> pencil [ __ ] in for us i think so i i i i </connor>
<connor> ironically want an assistant yeah right </connor>
<connor> i know that sounds terrible i thought </connor>
<joey> like what the [ __ ] i would never want </joey>
<connor> one then i'm like oh actually you know a </connor>
<connor> lot of things could be helped but if i </connor>
<connor> had someone who helped schedule things </connor>
<joey> yeah i know a couple of like youtuber </joey>
<connor> friends who live here that have like </connor>
<connor> personal assistants and i'm like oh my </connor>
<connor> god that seems like a [ __ ] lifestyle </connor>
<connor> i just oh man the thought of having to </connor>
<connor> like speak to someone </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> and be like hey my life's a mess can you </connor>
<connor> help me like it's not about that like </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm i i i feel i don't know how to </connor>
<connor> explain it i'm embarrassed about having </connor>
<connor> to get my life in order you know what i </connor>
<connor> mean that's what it is so it's like </connor>
<connor> going to the doctor i like i want you to </connor>
<connor> tell me that i'm i'm [ __ ] at health like </connor>
<connor> i know that but if i go to the doctor </connor>
<connor> you i'm gonna have 100 confirmation that </connor>
<joey> i am unhealthy i just don't want to be </joey>
<joey> that guy who's like talk to my pa yeah </joey>
<connor> let me say like if you want to like uh </connor>
<connor> get permission for stuff or get like i </connor>
<connor> don't know </connor>
<connor> you're like okay i i need to be able to </connor>
<connor> like arrange all this [ __ ] can you help </connor>
<connor> me do that yeah uh but like i mean some </connor>
<connor> days like i don't know about three three </connor>
<connor> four days of the week i pretty much fill </connor>
<connor> my schedule up from literally like eight </connor>
<connor> eight o'clock to like midnight yeah it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> stuff doing stuff but i like that i like </connor>
<connor> doing it and live streaming has added a </connor>
<connor> bunch of time that it needs to be </connor>
<garnt> squished i mean you've put more work on </garnt>
<connor> yourself this year because i feel like </connor>
<connor> this year is the year that you've really </connor>
<connor> upped your live stream live streaming </connor>
<connor> schedule </connor>
<garnt> as like you basically have almost like </garnt>
<garnt> three channels now you've got trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste you got </garnt>
<garnt> your channel </garnt>
<connor> you've got your live stream channel </connor>
<connor> right yeah because now now i'll do live </connor>
<garnt> streams in the morning or the evening so </garnt>
<garnt> if i'm not doing something in the </garnt>
<connor> morning like let's say i have something </connor>
<connor> at 12 o'clock like you know like we </connor>
<connor> record trashed or today we did it at 11. </connor>
<connor> yeah but if we did it at 12 i would be </connor>
<connor> like all right sick i wake up at eight </connor>
<connor> i'll live stream until 12. i'll come </connor>
<connor> here yeah and then i'll like work all </connor>
<connor> day and then i'll go do something in the </connor>
<connor> evening and then i'll sleep this is why </connor>
<joey> i can't watch shows actually this is </joey>
<joey> what i've realized i literally yeah </joey>
<joey> i i don't know what joe's excuses i'm </joey>
<connor> like streaming until i sleep so i </connor>
<garnt> realized i have no time to watch it i </garnt>
<garnt> literally have to pencil in the times i </garnt>
<garnt> watch anime now right because because </garnt>
<garnt> here's here's like the he's like the </garnt>
<garnt> ultimatum of every anime youtuber right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because a lot of the times it takes </garnt>
<garnt> more work to make a video about an anime </garnt>
<garnt> than to watch an anime so i actually </garnt>
<garnt> have to pencil in okay this is the time </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to put in into making a video </garnt>
<garnt> about anime and here's the time that i </garnt>
<garnt> have to pencil in to watch anime and </garnt>
<garnt> like the time i pencil to watch anime is </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like this the time of </garnt>
<garnt> penciling to make videos is like that </garnt>
<connor> yeah this is like the equivalent like </connor>
<connor> doctors having to like study new </connor>
<connor> practices to stay on top of that game </connor>
<joey> yeah i have to watch </joey>
<joey> i just want to r d i just love to think </joey>
<connor> that like you know if i was like like </connor>
<connor> you know if someone was like a maid of </connor>
<connor> guns it was like hey god you want to </connor>
<connor> like hang out on x day or next time and </connor>
<joey> god just being like </joey>
<joey> sorry man that's anime time </joey>
<garnt> actually </garnt>
<garnt> literally there have been times where </garnt>
<connor> sydney's like uh gone can uh we we hang </connor>
<connor> out on this night and i'm like sorry </connor>
<connor> sydney it's my anime watching night it's </connor>
<garnt> part of my job i i need to keep up with </garnt>
<garnt> like what's get what's airing right now </garnt>
<connor> my friends laugh at me because i have to </connor>
<connor> like ask them i have to like i send them </connor>
<connor> email no like invitations to like times </connor>
<connor> to like hang out yeah yeah let's hang </connor>
<joey> out i'll send you an email yeah </joey>
<joey> to like put it in your calendar yeah </joey>
<joey> because i'll forget and like send them </joey>
<joey> like a google calendar notification i </joey>
<joey> think about like the last 10 times i </joey>
<connor> agreed to hang out with someone at least </connor>
<joey> on like a call not like in person i i've </joey>
<connor> never like not turned up in person but </connor>
<garnt> my on-call to hang out with people who </garnt>
<connor> are like i don't get to see often or </connor>
<connor> people live in other countries yeah i </connor>
<garnt> think like the last </garnt>
<garnt> five out of ten that i didn't put in my </garnt>
<connor> calendar i think i like turned up late </connor>
<connor> or just forgot about yeah if i don't put </connor>
<connor> it in tonight i feel terrible about that </connor>
<garnt> i'm about a bad friend but yeah if i if </garnt>
<garnt> i don't put it in my calendar because </garnt>
<connor> because sometimes sometimes you get like </connor>
<connor> free time or you think you get free time </connor>
<connor> you're like </connor>
<connor> do i actually have free time so you say </connor>
<connor> whip out the calendar and you're like oh </connor>
<connor> i do have free time then an hour passes </connor>
<connor> and get a message and you're like oh </connor>
<joey> weren't you meant to be what we meant to </joey>
<garnt> have a call or we meant to be hanging </garnt>
<garnt> out you're like oh [ __ ] it's a lie it's </garnt>
<joey> so big it's a lie for me it's like for </joey>
<garnt> me the problem is like you know going </garnt>
<connor> back to like the apple calendar thing </connor>
<connor> i'm like all right that finally i wake </connor>
<connor> up and i'm like finally a day where the </connor>
<connor> dot is non-existent i have a day off i </connor>
<connor> can do whatever the [ __ ] i want but then </connor>
<connor> i go to my computer i look at my other </connor>
<garnt> schedule that's sitting at my desk and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like oh </garnt>
<garnt> i have to edit three videos and do two </garnt>
<garnt> sponsors all right so it's not a day off </garnt>
<garnt> it's a day to be inside but i'm not </garnt>
<joey> necessarily doing anything outside so </joey>
<joey> it's not a day off </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah that's been my life for the </joey>
<garnt> past did you guys have to-do lists </garnt>
<joey> yeah i've been starting to like do to-do </joey>
<joey> lists now because i have to forget what </joey>
<joey> i have to do list when i the day i </joey>
<garnt> discovered to-do lists like to do like </garnt>
<connor> like a caveman jumping over a rock yeah </connor>
<connor> a game changer there's a list of things </connor>
<connor> i had to do with it </connor>
<connor> i don't even think cavemen were that </connor>
<connor> impressed when they discovered fire like </connor>
<connor> well i i because like one of my friends </connor>
<connor> honestly dude like especially when it </connor>
<connor> comes like our stuff because because we </connor>
<connor> have so many things that we have to do </connor>
<connor> and so many things that we want to do </connor>
<connor> yeah right so </connor>
<connor> my dad actually taught me like how to </connor>
<connor> make the perfect to-do list which is you </connor>
<connor> wake up in the morning and you think to </connor>
<connor> yourself all right you jot down </connor>
<connor> everything that you can think of that </connor>
<connor> you can do and that you have to do </connor>
<connor> you jot it down and then from that list </connor>
<connor> everything that is super important goes </connor>
<connor> to the top yeah everything that </connor>
<connor> everything else that can wait a couple </connor>
<connor> of days goes to the bottom yeah and then </connor>
<connor> you go on with your day you tick off </connor>
<connor> everything that you do and at the end of </connor>
<connor> the day if you're left with a couple of </connor>
<connor> things that's all right that becomes the </connor>
<connor> top of your to-do list the next day </connor>
<connor> right and just i've been doing that for </connor>
<connor> the past year and i've become </connor>
<connor> infinitely productive like i i guarantee </connor>
<joey> that's what moodon does as well probably </joey>
<garnt> with the imagination </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm like how do i find more hours in </garnt>
<garnt> the day </garnt>
<garnt> you seem to like pull from this infinite </garnt>
<connor> pool of hours that i don't know where </connor>
<connor> you find i don't want to </connor>
<garnt> i just want to know what did mudan </garnt>
<connor> sacrifice you know what </connor>
<joey> i think you like how did it cost </joey>
<connor> everything i think he hooked his like </connor>
<connor> brain and cardo like brain and heart to </connor>
<joey> a car battery it was just like </joey>
<connor> constantly just going </connor>
<garnt> i can't wait to come on and explain </garnt>
<garnt> himself </garnt>
<garnt> it's like just don't sleep </garnt>
<connor> he's awful at like explaining how he's </connor>
<garnt> productive like he doesn't make it sound </garnt>
<garnt> realistic he's just like yeah you know i </garnt>
<garnt> just wake up in the morning i just do it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he's the epitome of just get good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you like with mood on i only see </garnt>
<garnt> like the input and output like input </garnt>
<garnt> editing work outputs a video i don't see </garnt>
<joey> like what happens it's basically just </joey>
<joey> like a black box right it's like the </joey>
<joey> youtube algorithm because like you kind </joey>
<joey> of know how it works but no one really </joey>
<joey> knows the inner workings of the youtube </joey>
<joey> algorithm that's just like mudan and </joey>
<joey> editing for me man have you ever seen </joey>
<joey> mudan edit </joey>
<connor> is on stream and that's where he's also </connor>
<connor> doing something else but he's probably </connor>
<garnt> like holding back on streams as well as </garnt>
<garnt> people don't get freaked out </garnt>
<connor> sorry </connor>
<joey> honestly that's how impressive it is </joey>
<joey> because it's like i i think you know </joey>
<connor> people already know who watch the show </connor>
<connor> are aware of just how much he edits for </connor>
<connor> trash taste and also for me and connor </connor>
<connor> but i think people forget that you know </connor>
<garnt> other people also ask him to edit oh </garnt>
<garnt> he's he's out for sydney now as well </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right so i'm just like and not to </garnt>
<garnt> mention he edits his own streams and he </garnt>
<joey> streams and he also streams and he also </joey>
<garnt> streams like pretty regularly so i'm </garnt>
<joey> like what how the beast man i would like </joey>
<connor> to know what i do mudan </connor>
<connor> episode we're also waiting for the </connor>
<garnt> country to open back up which hopefully </garnt>
<garnt> will finally happen next year as well </garnt>
<connor> ish that's the biggest thing i'm hoping </connor>
<connor> for um i think it'll i mean it's gonna </connor>
<connor> happen next year it's just when it's </connor>
<connor> like is it going to happen early or late </connor>
<joey> that's that's the you know that's the </joey>
<joey> big question i think everyone is saying </joey>
<connor> uh like as early as maybe feb or march </connor>
<connor> right i think much would be nice </connor>
<connor> visitors can come in because right now i </connor>
<connor> think uh if you're a non-visitor so if </connor>
<connor> you're like a student or you're on work </connor>
<connor> fees or stuff like that you can </connor>
<connor> technically come in now yeah um not that </connor>
<joey> i've seen any actual examples of people </joey>
<garnt> coming in well i assume they need to get </garnt>
<garnt> real i haven't looked into the process </garnt>
<joey> but i assume they need to reapply for </joey>
<joey> some kind of problem application </joey>
<joey> yeah um because you know not tourists </joey>
<connor> but at least if you have a working visa </connor>
<connor> or you've been waiting </connor>
<joey> for like a job or to study here then you </joey>
<connor> can come here which is which is good </connor>
<joey> which is like it shouldn't have taken </joey>
<garnt> two years to get to this point </garnt>
<joey> i feel bad for the students man yeah i </joey>
<joey> know right just being like finally i get </joey>
<joey> to live my dream of coming to japan no </joey>
<garnt> it makes me feel so bad because like </garnt>
<garnt> when we applied we have to wait like </garnt>
<garnt> what three months and that was just like </garnt>
<garnt> the worst three months right because </garnt>
<garnt> it's not it's not the fact that it's </garnt>
<garnt> three months it's the fact that it's </garnt>
<garnt> three months where you don't know what's </garnt>
<garnt> going to happen in your life and you're </garnt>
<garnt> just like your your life is kind of in </garnt>
<garnt> limbo until you get that confirmation to </garnt>
<garnt> be like oh okay finally i can start </garnt>
<garnt> packing i can start preparing to go and </garnt>
<garnt> then but while you're waiting you're </garnt>
<garnt> just like uh should i start should i go </garnt>
<garnt> what's kind of going on in my life right </garnt>
<connor> now i was wondering with the students </connor>
<connor> thing i was thinking like okay we had no </connor>
<connor> way of knowing that it's gonna take two </connor>
<connor> years for japan to open yeah and and </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i don't know what i i haven't really </connor>
<garnt> spoken to any students about it but like </garnt>
<garnt> what was like if you got to like you're </garnt>
<connor> like day one right you find out japan's </connor>
<connor> closing like do you just like wait and </connor>
<joey> see or do you just decide to do </joey>
<joey> something else and then like hope and </joey>
<connor> hope that you can just then go back i </connor>
<joey> don't know i think i think for most </joey>
<joey> students i don't think anyone was </joey>
<joey> anticipating </joey>
<joey> them to [ __ ] stay in limbo for two </joey>
<joey> years right so i'm sure the majority of </joey>
<joey> students were like oh you know i you </joey>
<connor> know i still got time i can wait imagine </connor>
<connor> losing two years of like i guess </connor>
<connor> progress you could have made in your 20s </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but then again it's not it's </connor>
<connor> not really that important because i </connor>
<connor> guess a lot of people in in life didn't </connor>
<connor> start doing the their main thing until </connor>
<connor> they were like 40. so i guess it really </connor>
<garnt> doesn't [ __ ] oh yeah yeah sure i mean </garnt>
<garnt> but i think what sucks is that you just </garnt>
<connor> have two years where you can't really </connor>
<connor> commit to something you know that's </connor>
<connor> that's what really sucks for me where i </connor>
<joey> i always want to have a goal that i'm </joey>
<joey> working towards and know that i'm </joey>
<joey> actively working towards that goal </joey>
<joey> because one one of my biggest pet peeves </joey>
<joey> is like if i feel like i'm not working </joey>
<joey> towards something then i just feel lost </joey>
<joey> and i i just feel like a [ __ ] lost </joey>
<joey> soul and i need i need i need something </joey>
<joey> concrete to work towards yeah that's why </joey>
<joey> like i really empathize to anyone </joey>
<garnt> waiting for a visa and thank god you </garnt>
<connor> guys can finally come here hopefully you </connor>
<connor> get here soon get to eat some superman </connor>
<joey> that's the number one thing [ __ ] the </joey>
<joey> sushi [ __ ] the ramen go to your local </joey>
<joey> skimming joint and discover true </joey>
<garnt> happiness yeah we had we had the </garnt>
<connor> michelin star ramen oh yeah we did and </connor>
<garnt> it was very exciting we didn't know it </garnt>
<connor> was michelin star right so there's a it </connor>
<joey> was the place man recommended to it yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah was it ramen because i i thought it </garnt>
<joey> was sober no it's ramen it's like chu </joey>
<joey> casaba which is like chinese soba which </joey>
<connor> is like technically some people call it </connor>
<joey> ramen the noodles are more ramen noodle </joey>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> it was </garnt>
<connor> very light for a ramen it was very light </connor>
<connor> because like when i when you said like </connor>
<garnt> ramen i was just like oh it's going to </garnt>
<garnt> be a heavy ramen because ramen's the </garnt>
<garnt> kind of meal that like takes you out it </garnt>
<garnt> knocks you out for like an hour yeah </garnt>
<connor> when i was thinking about it i'm like </connor>
<connor> okay what do i i think i have the wrong </connor>
<connor> expectations of michelin star the guy </connor>
<connor> expects some kind of stupid luxurious </connor>
<connor> like gourmet thing but i guess it's more </connor>
<joey> about value </joey>
<joey> yeah it was like a thousand yen i like </joey>
<connor> the one i got was like ten bucks yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean like eight dollars right i </connor>
<joey> guess like it's amazing i have a picture </joey>
<connor> of it it was it was very good but the </connor>
<connor> whole time i was thinking i was like i </connor>
<garnt> think tsukemen is more tasty i think i </garnt>
<garnt> think </garnt>
<garnt> was better than the michelin star robin </garnt>
<garnt> i agree honestly i i didn't enjoy the </garnt>
<garnt> ramen that much and </garnt>
<garnt> okay so because here's the thing right i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like michelin star if you've been </garnt>
<garnt> to enough of them especially in japan </garnt>
<connor> because it's like in japan there's so </connor>
<connor> many michelin star restaurants but i </connor>
<connor> i've realized that you cut with michelin </connor>
<connor> star you come in with like the wrong </connor>
<connor> expectations right yeah and this is </connor>
<connor> going to make me sound you know this is </connor>
<connor> going to make me sound so [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> privileged no </garnt>
<connor> michelin stars aren't all that great </connor>
<connor> about michelin star it's the michelin </connor>
<garnt> star but like here here's the thing the </garnt>
<garnt> retirement no </garnt>
<connor> like here's the thing when you go into a </connor>
<connor> michelin star restaurant your </connor>
<connor> expectations are like up here you're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> knows all well because he often </connor>
<connor> frequents the mission of course of </connor>
<connor> course no but like you you you come in </connor>
<connor> with these expectations that you you're </connor>
<connor> gonna get like a meal that's a cut above </connor>
<connor> the rest yeah right and so you start </connor>
<connor> judging things harsher than if you just </connor>
<connor> go to this random restaurant and just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> find out that there's like amazing food </connor>
<connor> because in japan i feel like there is </connor>
<connor> just as many restaurants that have food </connor>
<garnt> that are like michelin star quality that </garnt>
<garnt> just haven't been discovered yet you </garnt>
<garnt> know and i've and </garnt>
<garnt> to me like michelin star isn't always </garnt>
<garnt> the indicator of this is the best meal </garnt>
<garnt> that you can get in japan what it only </garnt>
<garnt> means is that it's it's become famous </garnt>
<garnt> enough that people have started to </garnt>
<garnt> notice it but there are so many there </garnt>
<garnt> are so many hidden gems and like for </garnt>
<garnt> example with the michelin star ramen </garnt>
<garnt> that is not like the best even the best </garnt>
<garnt> ramen that i've had with the best i've </garnt>
<connor> had i've had like </connor>
<connor> i've had like sketchy ass places </connor>
<joey> yeah i i i honestly think the uh the </joey>
<joey> insect ramen i had for my video was </joey>
<joey> actually better yeah </joey>
<joey> and that has a hundred times </joey>
<connor> it's not sitting on the street </connor>
<connor> we haven't named the ramen place because </connor>
<connor> i also don't want to like [ __ ] make </connor>
<joey> it i'm saying that because the insect </joey>
<joey> ramen was actually [ __ ] amazing no </joey>
<garnt> and and also like because it's michelin </garnt>
<garnt> star it actually made it a worse </garnt>
<joey> experience for me right because because </joey>
<joey> because you wait in line because </joey>
<joey> expectations are too high right one yet </joey>
<joey> your expectations is high and two it's </joey>
<joey> really really [ __ ] busy right so in </joey>
<connor> this ramen shop it's a tiny ass ramen </connor>
<garnt> shop it's it's like when we say michelin </garnt>
<connor> star it's a really it's a normal ramen </connor>
<connor> shop right ramen stores in general are </connor>
<connor> like not i would say they're good dining </connor>
<connor> experiences yeah like you it's not it's </connor>
<connor> like if you're if you want to come here </connor>
<connor> and chill out with your friends don't go </connor>
<connor> to a ramen it's it's a come in eat and </connor>
<connor> go yeah yeah yeah i mean it only that </connor>
<joey> place only said like what 10 or 12 </joey>
<connor> people maybe yeah yeah it's busy it's </connor>
<connor> like narrow you're like if you're even </connor>
<connor> remotely large then larger than normal </connor>
<connor> you're gonna have a tough time </connor>
<garnt> squeezing past everyone and like we went </garnt>
<connor> at about 2 p.m so not even like not even </connor>
<garnt> close to peak time and we still have to </garnt>
<connor> wait like a good 20 minutes like 20 </connor>
<connor> minutes and this is this is when the </connor>
<connor> country is closed the tourists so when </connor>
<connor> tourists come back in i was talking to </connor>
<connor> some people who've waited for this ramen </connor>
<connor> for like an hour an hour and a half two </connor>
<connor> hours right and you get you get shepherd </connor>
<connor> in and then you you're expected to just </connor>
<connor> eat the ramen and leave right there's no </connor>
<connor> there's no down time you get given a </connor>
<connor> bowl you eat it and then leave you going </connor>
<garnt> like to me part of like the food </garnt>
<garnt> experience is just </garnt>
<garnt> like not feeling pressured to eat the </garnt>
<garnt> food but just yeah but just like feeding </garnt>
<garnt> like i can take my time to enjoy this </garnt>
<joey> food yeah i couldn't i couldn't even </joey>
<joey> like bask like as good as the ramen was </joey>
<joey> i couldn't bask in it because there was </joey>
<joey> the pressure of oh i could take my time </joey>
<joey> with this but i'd also be pissing off </joey>
<joey> the 20 other people still waiting in </joey>
<connor> line exactly right standing outside this </connor>
<joey> is why i've realized that ramen is best </joey>
<connor> at like midnight yeah you can just like </connor>
<connor> because they they have time they always </connor>
<connor> serve beers everyone's having like a </connor>
<joey> good time in there like it's a way more </joey>
<connor> fun atmosphere like some of the stores </connor>
<joey> that open 24 hours normally have a few </joey>
<joey> more seats as well it is the ultimate </joey>
<joey> midnight snack for sure it's </joey>
<joey> honestly it's awful for your stomach </joey>
<joey> there's a good chance you might like </joey>
<joey> bring it back up but yeah but some of </joey>
<connor> the best ramen experiences i've had like </connor>
<connor> midnight we're in like a sketchy area of </connor>
<connor> some place in japan </connor>
<connor> everyone's drinking beers in the store </connor>
<connor> it's cool atmosphere everyone's talking </connor>
<connor> it's so much more fun than ramen during </connor>
<connor> the day where everyone's just there to </connor>
<joey> eat and get out yeah the best the best </joey>
<joey> ramen experience i had was when i was </joey>
<connor> absolutely shit-faced yeah at like 2am </connor>
<connor> and then my friend makoto was like </connor>
<connor> like 2 am and i was like uh okay so we </connor>
<connor> ran around the corner to this like awful </connor>
<connor> sketchy place like the ramen wasn't even </connor>
<connor> that good but just like fun it's just </connor>
<connor> fun like when the moment it went down i </connor>
<joey> was like damn good to feel alive but </joey>
<joey> then the moment you walk out it's like </joey>
<connor> oh it's awful all right yeah because </connor>
<connor> you've ruined your stomach with you i'm </connor>
<joey> about gonna die </joey>
<joey> because to me like the restaurant </joey>
<joey> experience goes beyond just the the </joey>
<joey> taste of the food right there's there's </joey>
<joey> like a reason why your mom's cooking </joey>
<connor> always tastes [ __ ] good right it's </connor>
<connor> because it's cause like because cause </connor>
<connor> that cooking means something to you you </connor>
<connor> you you know you know where's the heart </connor>
<connor> man what's the heart in the brain </connor>
<connor> honestly honestly you can taste in some </connor>
<connor> japanese restaurants where they put the </connor>
<connor> heart into the cooking oh yeah and like </connor>
<garnt> it's so obvious with some like very </garnt>
<connor> small </connor>
<connor> i mean i i just think that i just </connor>
<garnt> i realize that i don't like ramen as </garnt>
<garnt> much as i want to like ramen like oh no </garnt>
<connor> like i i uber eats men on sometimes all </connor>
<connor> right and that [ __ ] is [ __ ] good yeah </connor>
<connor> because because also ramen travels </connor>
<connor> terribly that's why never ever order </connor>
<connor> ramen it's i mean unless you have like </connor>
<connor> one of those really old star ones where </connor>
<connor> they like bring you the actual bowl with </connor>
<joey> everything that's that's the only one i </joey>
<connor> get problem is nowadays with ramen with </connor>
<connor> ubrites they separate the noodles and </connor>
<connor> the broth so they give you a broth and </connor>
<connor> like a plastic really a lot of the time </connor>
<joey> yeah they don't actually put the noodles </joey>
<joey> in you put the noodles in yourself yeah </joey>
<joey> it's not good and the noodle's supposed </joey>
<joey> to be like piping hot in the in the </joey>
<connor> broth so it doesn't really work but </connor>
<connor> it travels pretty oh like i'm pretty </connor>
<joey> okay because you it's because the broth </joey>
<joey> is so thick it's like magma yeah the </joey>
<connor> broth is so thick it stays really hot </connor>
<connor> and the noodles are supposed to be </connor>
<connor> separate anyway yeah and then you just </connor>
<connor> dunk the noodles in and it's almost as </connor>
<connor> good yeah no i wouldn't say it's </connor>
<connor> definitely better in shop but yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but like if you're you're you know </connor>
<connor> you're uh you need that you need that </connor>
<joey> edge </joey>
<garnt> man i've been advocating because like </garnt>
<garnt> ramen ramen is that one japanese dish </garnt>
<garnt> where before i moved to japan i was just </garnt>
<connor> i was thinking oh i'm gonna eat ramen </connor>
<connor> every [ __ ] week every day </connor>
<garnt> i've had ramen three times the past week </garnt>
<connor> though really but i didn't have ramen </connor>
<connor> for like months before that oh yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> i was saying like the last time i had </garnt>
<garnt> ramen before we went to this michelin </garnt>
<garnt> star ramen place uh was </garnt>
<connor> like i think a year before a year before </connor>
<connor> that's just because i have like zero </connor>
<connor> craving for ramen because why would i </connor>
<connor> have ramen when i can have tsukimen </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> like but the one dish that i haven't got </joey>
<garnt> bored off though is a sushi like i eat </garnt>
<garnt> sushi at least one once a week really at </garnt>
<joey> least once a week damn you eat more than </joey>
<joey> me </joey>
<joey> and i love sushi i probably go maybe </joey>
<connor> like yeah two or three times a month i </connor>
<connor> wish that was like a really quick and </connor>
<connor> easy one near my house i would probably </connor>
<connor> go i just i don't want to order it yeah </connor>
<garnt> no it doesn't order well but like i i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like there's there's a few conveyor </garnt>
<garnt> belts she's near my place and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> perfect for lunch man it's it's like </garnt>
<connor> there's like 100 yen because i even like </connor>
<connor> the 100 yen sushi which is like 80 80 </connor>
<connor> cents for like one piece of like salmon </connor>
<garnt> or something yeah it's so good yeah </garnt>
<garnt> honestly like my experience with sushi </garnt>
<garnt> in japan is that you know you they you </garnt>
<connor> know i've i've also you know melin's </connor>
<garnt> taking me to some michelin star sushi </garnt>
<garnt> places as well and of course she has </garnt>
<garnt> only eats if there's michelin </garnt>
<connor> she's like i don't see the michelin men </connor>
<garnt> anyway i'm not going basically part of </garnt>
<garnt> the big reason why we've gone to more </garnt>
<joey> michelin star places is because you know </joey>
<joey> melin suggested these places to us </joey>
<joey> where's buy it yeah which is how we </joey>
<joey> found the mid the the robin place which </joey>
<joey> is made and recommended the robin place </joey>
<joey> and it happened to be michelin star but </joey>
<joey> uh you know i i have tried like a few </joey>
<joey> like a lot of different sushi places of </joey>
<joey> like different price points and my </joey>
<joey> honest opinion is that </joey>
<joey> like sushi </joey>
<garnt> you reach about like you know you reach </garnt>
<garnt> about like thirty dollars a meal for a </garnt>
<garnt> sushi which is about you know mid mid </garnt>
<garnt> sushi uh in japan right it's not cheap </garnt>
<garnt> it's not expensive and that's about as </garnt>
<garnt> good as it gets to me because </garnt>
<garnt> you go you go you can get sushi from </garnt>
<garnt> like like thirty dollars like a hundred </garnt>
<connor> dollars like two hundred dollars gourmet </connor>
<garnt> super famous chefs out there like how </garnt>
<garnt> dare you guys yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and like my like my honest opinion is </garnt>
<garnt> that i've i've had the expensive sushi </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> it's better but it's not that much </garnt>
<garnt> better than like the 30 sushi that i can </garnt>
<connor> get that's how it always is though like </connor>
<connor> i find that the meals that are a little </connor>
<connor> more pricey than the the you know the </connor>
<connor> normal ones are generally like the the </connor>
<connor> nice ones and then when you get to the </connor>
<connor> stupid extravagant levels of prices it's </connor>
<garnt> just like not that yeah it's like a 10 </garnt>
<garnt> 10 10 fold increase for like a five to </garnt>
<garnt> ten percent better meal you know i i </garnt>
<joey> think i would argue that like if you're </joey>
<joey> ever going to go to like especially like </joey>
<joey> the high high-end sushi places which is </joey>
<connor> all around tokyo then like get something </connor>
<connor> that you could only get in that high-end </connor>
<connor> restaurant yeah so like because i </connor>
<connor> remember i took uh my friend luke to </connor>
<connor> like the the really high-end sushi place </connor>
<connor> because he's never been to like a </connor>
<connor> high-end sushi place so i took him to </connor>
<connor> the one in um harajuku yeah and it was </connor>
<connor> like 400 bucks between the two of us </connor>
<connor> so it's like really rushing a bit </connor>
<connor> but that place has like uh </connor>
<connor> uh i i think i don't know if you guys </connor>
<connor> have been to it but like it's the one </connor>
<connor> where you can have like the nine </connor>
<connor> different types of uh sea urchin </connor>
<connor> different types of seeds yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> they do this like especially </connor>
<connor> yeah so there's a special thing where </connor>
<connor> they do like nine different types of </connor>
<garnt> seeds we're talking about sushi and you </garnt>
<garnt> get </garnt>
<garnt> and you get like my stomach </garnt>
<garnt> and you get like taste tests like the </garnt>
<garnt> different types of sea urchin from like </garnt>
<garnt> different parts of japan and around the </garnt>
<garnt> world and stuff and like that is like </garnt>
<garnt> cool because i'm literally salivating </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'll give you 0 </garnt>
<connor> like that is cool because i've only ever </connor>
<connor> seen that in that store like yeah it's </connor>
<connor> expensive but that is an experience that </connor>
<connor> you can only get in that story you can't </connor>
<connor> go to like a [ __ ] sushi chain right </connor>
<connor> but like if you're just gonna go to a </connor>
<connor> high-end sushi place and just order </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] salmon on the ice then like </connor>
<connor> there's no point there's no difference </connor>
<connor> like you're not the average person is </connor>
<joey> not that much of a sushi snob where </joey>
<joey> they're gonna be like oh this is this </joey>
<joey> isn't the high grade salmon that they're </joey>
<garnt> using </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like even if it's high grade </garnt>
<joey> salmon it's like a like five percent </joey>
<joey> increase in how better the taste is and </joey>
<joey> sushi is basically just it's rice it's </joey>
<connor> the fish it's the wasabi and it's just </connor>
<connor> like the soy sauce they put on top and </connor>
<connor> like it's basically you just have to </connor>
<connor> like make sure the ratios are right and </connor>
<connor> then there's only </connor>
<connor> yeah and then there's only like so much </connor>
<connor> the fish can be fresh right yeah at </connor>
<garnt> which point do we at which point do we </garnt>
<garnt> just like say hey you just can't make </garnt>
<garnt> this taste any better with the </garnt>
<joey> ingredients you're given right because </joey>
<joey> unless you have like like ten times the </joey>
<joey> number of taste buds than the average </joey>
<garnt> human like it's not gonna change yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly exactly like my my tongue </garnt>
<joey> doesn't </joey>
<garnt> like i'm not i'm not part of like </garnt>
<garnt> shokugeki or something i can't like </garnt>
<garnt> taste like the exact percentage of </garnt>
<joey> salinity in the [ __ ] although i must </joey>
<joey> say when i did try the nine different </joey>
<joey> types of like uh sea urchin i was ready </joey>
<joey> to take my shirt off from how good it </joey>
<connor> was she's like oh i'm just i'm just an </connor>
<connor> unagi fan man it's my favorite food in </connor>
<connor> japan unani it's the best yeah but see </connor>
<joey> like even like unagi right like after a </joey>
<joey> certain price range it's like oh no no </joey>
<connor> you can't you can't taste it no no no </connor>
<connor> yeah but like that's why like </connor>
<connor> if you just go to an aggie place it's </connor>
<connor> kind of expensive in aggie in general </connor>
<connor> but i mean like even like the the lower </connor>
<connor> lower price point ones i'm always like </connor>
<connor> satisfied yeah exactly and i think it's </connor>
<garnt> somewhat good for you so that's good is </garnt>
<garnt> it it's it's not terrible it's not </garnt>
<garnt> terrible it's got a lot of like uh you </garnt>
<connor> know a lot of good uh omegas um those </connor>
<joey> fishy oils but they are also going </joey>
<joey> extinct as well that's the reason why </joey>
<connor> their prices well it's not like japan </connor>
<joey> eats like 80 percent of the world's eels </joey>
<joey> or something something like that but </joey>
<connor> then they there's tons of eels from </connor>
<connor> other countries it's it's it's 80 it's </connor>
<connor> like most of japan's eels they have like </connor>
<joey> nearly yeah yeah they're like almost all </joey>
<connor> gone that's why they're just getting </connor>
<joey> more expensive yeah </joey>
<connor> so i saw like a whole business insider </connor>
<connor> video on that yeah because they because </connor>
<connor> japan has a thing of like we don't want </connor>
<garnt> to import foreign things it's low </garnt>
<garnt> quality well they're starting like eel </garnt>
<joey> farms now yeah they're where they they </joey>
<joey> import the eels like as babies from </joey>
<connor> other countries yeah and grow them in </connor>
<joey> japan like they're like they're japanese </joey>
<garnt> it's like it's just like japanese eels </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which is why </garnt>
<garnt> which is why i realized you know when </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a restaurant and they serve </garnt>
<garnt> you this like really expensive dish or </garnt>
<garnt> really expensive meat right that doesn't </garnt>
<connor> necessarily mean it tastes any better </connor>
<connor> because a lot of it's like a lot of more </connor>
<connor> expensive </connor>
<connor> meats weren't that expensive in history </connor>
<connor> right so you know the taste hasn't </connor>
<connor> changed like for example lobsters you </connor>
<connor> know they they you know they used to be </connor>
<connor> like peasant food yeah they used to be </connor>
<connor> like peasant food or you know </connor>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<joey> these [ __ ] restaurants the ones that </joey>
<joey> are like the super high end you feel so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] out of place because you're not </joey>
<joey> like an oligarch from russia i don't </joey>
<connor> feel like i belong there i want to go to </connor>
<connor> the place that has a cool vibe yeah the </connor>
<connor> food's a little more uh pricey than </connor>
<connor> going into like a yacht </connor>
<connor> or something you know it's like a you </connor>
<connor> know a little bit more you get a vibe </connor>
<connor> you have a chill time there's no </connor>
<connor> expectations you don't have to worry </connor>
<connor> about how you've been dressed that's the </connor>
<connor> vibe i like it's a nice time i just want </connor>
<connor> to have my </connor>
<connor> 12 burger that's like it's better than </connor>
<connor> mcdonald's but it's it's got a little </connor>
<connor> gourmet but it's it's not it's not </connor>
<connor> gourmet but but they put avocado on it </connor>
<connor> or something i don't know i don't know </connor>
<connor> just that middle price point is my </connor>
<garnt> comfort zone i'm like this is nice </garnt>
<garnt> i just want to feel like the cooks and </garnt>
<garnt> the chef care about their foods yeah i i </garnt>
<connor> think that's a big thing for me yeah </connor>
<garnt> when i order a drink and they ask me if </garnt>
<garnt> it tastes okay before they serve it to </garnt>
<garnt> me that's when i feel like i'm out of my </garnt>
<joey> depth i'm like i i've never done this </joey>
<joey> before i ordered the thing you give me </joey>
<joey> the thing yeah is our mission in style </joey>
<joey> water </joey>
<joey> for your knees if i order a wine just </joey>
<connor> give me the wine um even if i told you </connor>
<connor> even if i told you it doesn't taste good </connor>
<connor> you should just be you should just laugh </connor>
<connor> at me and be like yeah well that's </connor>
<garnt> that's you you did like it it's the </garnt>
<garnt> small things if i get served food and </garnt>
<garnt> like they come to and ask like oh how </garnt>
<garnt> was it was it good i'm just like you </garnt>
<garnt> know what you know you care enough to </garnt>
<connor> like care about my opinion i meant as in </connor>
<connor> like they're going to take it back if i </connor>
<connor> say no yeah no i'm not like am i </connor>
<connor> enjoying it </connor>
<connor> but that's the kind of restaurants that </connor>
<connor> you know when they bring out the dish or </connor>
<connor> whatever and you look at and you're like </connor>
<connor> what is this and then a light novel </connor>
<connor> title of explanation starts right and </connor>
<connor> it's like i </connor>
<connor> can i just eat it </connor>
<connor> it's like two bites i would be done by </connor>
<joey> the time you finished explaining this </joey>
<connor> and i wouldn't care otherwise you know </connor>
<joey> those are the ones where i'm like if i </joey>
<joey> said if they came up to me and they were </joey>
<joey> like was it any good and if i </joey>
<joey> hypothetically said no then they would </joey>
<garnt> be like what can we do to help you </garnt>
<garnt> because like what the experience i </garnt>
<garnt> remember was during the cycling special </garnt>
<garnt> where we uh went to their restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> with their grandma who was basically </garnt>
<garnt> just like eyeballing us </garnt>
<connor> as we were watching he pretty much </connor>
<connor> pulled up a chair and sat with us </connor>
<connor> it was like you aren't feeding you yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah exactly </joey>
<garnt> i love that place though it's just cause </garnt>
<garnt> like when when someone cause because i </garnt>
<garnt> get it because like when you cook a meal </garnt>
<garnt> for someone and they enjoy that and they </garnt>
<garnt> enjoy the food and anything it tastes </garnt>
<garnt> good like there's such a there's like </garnt>
<garnt> such a rush to that right and i i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i i feel like i've seen enough </garnt>
<garnt> chefs who you know obviously obviously </garnt>
<joey> it is a job you know i understand some </joey>
<garnt> some people just do it for a job but </garnt>
<garnt> there's just there's just some magic to </garnt>
<garnt> a chef or a cook who cooks the food and </garnt>
<garnt> just gets such an enjoyment </garnt>
<garnt> from seeing people enjoy their food </garnt>
<garnt> right because i don't know it's it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't just it's this is this isn't </garnt>
<garnt> just chefs but you know if i just see </garnt>
<garnt> someone enjoying their job that just </garnt>
<garnt> makes my day better you know you know </garnt>
<garnt> even if you just go to a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> mcdonald's and you see like that one </garnt>
<garnt> person with a genuine smile and you're </garnt>
<garnt> just like you know what good for you man </garnt>
<garnt> you're you're having a good time working </garnt>
<joey> mcdonald's i'm [ __ ] happy i don't </joey>
<joey> know man if it wasn't mcdonald's i'd be </joey>
<connor> like oh someone's uh someone's getting </connor>
<connor> caught because you ordered a smile come </connor>
<joey> on </joey>
<connor> which is should i get a smile for that </connor>
<connor> for some reason on ubereats in japan at </connor>
<connor> the bottom of the page where you just </connor>
<connor> order all the stuff there is a muksmile </connor>
<connor> option </connor>
<connor> for zero yen and i don't understand how </connor>
<connor> you would purchase said mcsmile because </connor>
<connor> i'm not there to see the smile </connor>
<joey> genuinely go to yeah because in japan </joey>
<connor> you if you a day is ruined yeah it is a </connor>
<connor> lie in japan if you go into a mcdonald's </connor>
<garnt> restaurant and you say can i get a smile </garnt>
<joey> please then they'll give it to you so </joey>
<connor> but yeah but </connor>
<joey> i was fine with that right i don't i </joey>
<garnt> don't agree with that i don't think </garnt>
<connor> someone should have to smile </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<joey> why the [ __ ] why the [ __ ] on ubereats is </joey>
<joey> it listed when how is the uber delivery </joey>
<joey> guy get a smartphone i don't know </joey>
<connor> because i don't even see him because </connor>
<connor> they have the [ __ ] drop it off at my </connor>
<garnt> door opposite just [ __ ] like take </garnt>
<garnt> take like an instamax </garnt>
<connor> the [ __ ] uber driver just takes a </connor>
<connor> picture of the mcdonald's employee just </connor>
<connor> smiling i i don't understand why uber </connor>
<connor> added this to the menu i'm like what for </connor>
<connor> what i don't understand how this is </connor>
<connor> gonna work i added it one time and </connor>
<joey> nothing happened because it's legally </joey>
<joey> part of the mcdonald's menu because </joey>
<connor> obviously nothing is going to happen </connor>
<connor> when i ordered the mcsmile via ubereats </connor>
<connor> because what would happen i was just </connor>
<garnt> curious is this is this </garnt>
<connor> a japanese thing </connor>
<garnt> they would never work japanese </garnt>
<connor> the uk they would </connor>
<connor> employees would quit on the spot they'd </connor>
<connor> be like i'd rather die than smile </connor>
<joey> it's like yeah you want a smile please </joey>
<connor> order it yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like an actual menu item poor </joey>
<connor> workers being forced to smile upon </connor>
<joey> requests </joey>
<joey> at least give them like a tip or </joey>
<joey> something you know you can't tip you </joey>
<garnt> can't say you can't tip here so what's </garnt>
<garnt> the reason for smiling oh it's because </garnt>
<garnt> the customer ordered me to smile smile </garnt>
<joey> enjoy your job </joey>
<joey> i want someone to encourage me as i </joey>
<joey> order these 30 nuggets </joey>
<garnt> that will inevitably destroy my body </garnt>
<garnt> well what i enjoy is seeing someone </garnt>
<garnt> smile without me having to order them to </garnt>
<garnt> smile you know just just but in japan </garnt>
<connor> you're like you don't know if they're </connor>
<joey> doing it because they have to do it yeah </joey>
<joey> japan is the master of business smiles </joey>
<joey> at the end yeah i don't know i i feel </joey>
<connor> like i've been to enough places some </connor>
<connor> places in japan where i'm just like okay </connor>
<garnt> this is this is like the corporate smile </garnt>
<connor> and we're watching yeah because there's </connor>
<connor> no way if you turn up like half drunk to </connor>
<connor> a mcdonald's that they are happy to see </connor>
<connor> you there like stumbling ordering a </connor>
<connor> cheeseburger you know what i mean like </connor>
<connor> there's there's no way anyone is happy </connor>
<garnt> about it do you think you're gonna smile </garnt>
<connor> with that voice </connor>
<connor> all right i see mates in hockey harbor </connor>
<connor> and guys i don't think they're really </connor>
<connor> happy to talk to the customers i don't </connor>
<joey> know man maybe they're just not excited </joey>
<garnt> to talk to the people that they seem </garnt>
<joey> like they want to do you know you know </joey>
<joey> when you watch someone smile but their </joey>
<connor> eyes aren't smiling </connor>
<connor> that's all that means in our camera </connor>
<garnt> like they sound so chipper and you know </garnt>
<garnt> they have a big smile on their face as </garnt>
<joey> they're waving to you like this but deep </joey>
<joey> in their eyes it's just </joey>
<connor> all that industry is also dying yeah you </connor>
<connor> can't be too happy about that i mean </connor>
<connor> there's like significant amount less of </connor>
<connor> major um stores or cafes </connor>
<joey> but now they all have mass on so they're </joey>
<joey> probably not even smiling </joey>
<garnt> either </garnt>
<garnt> how can you how can you tell if they're </garnt>
<joey> smiling now they've perfected the i </joey>
<joey> sound happy without smiling voice you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> nico knee </joey>
<connor> good they shouldn't have to smile yeah </connor>
<joey> i'm all for people not needing to smile </joey>
<joey> that's all right i wasn't going to go </joey>
<joey> into those many cafes anyway so don't </joey>
<joey> worry about it </joey>
<joey> really really i've been to one it's </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] sucked wow yeah i've been to one </garnt>
<connor> as well yeah we've established many </connor>
<connor> times on this podcast that they are the </connor>
<garnt> worst thing on the world have you been </garnt>
<connor> to one uh no i don't i don't need to go </connor>
<connor> to one to no i don't want to get it i </connor>
<joey> i'm violently uncomfortable but it's an </joey>
<connor> experience you should just try to know </connor>
<connor> because i know it's so uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> it's like the most unbritish thing on </connor>
<connor> earth and i can't i can't do it i can't </connor>
<connor> like and i've seen like i saw like </connor>
<connor> offline tv went to one and i'm like i </connor>
<connor> can just only imagine how awkward this </connor>
<joey> was when they were in there like this is </joey>
<joey> terrible i would go back solely for the </joey>
<joey> reason to take chris with me i would </joey>
<garnt> that that would be an amazing video </garnt>
<connor> that's what i want to do there's a lot </connor>
<connor> of things i would do just to make chris </connor>
<connor> suffer </connor>
<connor> and to make myself suffer as well </connor>
<joey> can i take you and crystal make up sure </joey>
<joey> sure we'll see how we'll see how you </joey>
<garnt> guys react to that sure why not </garnt>
<connor> trash taste made cafe special </connor>
<connor> chris's reactions often are off camera </connor>
<connor> are almost funnier than his on camera </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> he'll just be like [ __ ] that was [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> why'd you make me do that see christian </garnt>
<joey> like the love love beam or whatever i </joey>
<joey> can't remember what they say about it </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> i want to see chris do that chris has </connor>
<connor> gotten to the point where she's the most </connor>
<connor> entertaining miserable british men like </connor>
<joey> he's so funny to watch be miserable </joey>
<connor> because he's perfected the art of like </connor>
<connor> you don't feel bad for making him angry </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you know what i mean yeah like </connor>
<garnt> some people when they get upset or </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable you're like you feel sorry </garnt>
<connor> for them but chris has perfected the way </connor>
<connor> of like you'd like he's just you just </connor>
<connor> just don't feel bad for laughing at </connor>
<joey> chris but he's he's the only man that </joey>
<joey> can somehow laugh while having a friend </joey>
<connor> oh yeah exactly that's right you don't </connor>
<connor> like but that's what's so good about </connor>
<connor> being british is that people don't feel </connor>
<connor> bad for laughing at you when you're </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable yeah </connor>
<connor> because people just like they're like oh </connor>
<garnt> he's having a horrible time it's funny </garnt>
<garnt> like like to me we've made cafes like to </garnt>
<connor> me it's the perfect determiner to see if </connor>
<connor> someone's like a lost soul when it comes </connor>
<connor> to differentiating between like anime </connor>
<connor> and real life yeah because if you go to </connor>
<connor> like if you go to like a maid cafe and </connor>
<connor> you don't feel uncomfortable then to me </connor>
<connor> that makes it that that makes me feel </connor>
<connor> like ripped </connor>
<connor> rooney he's a lost soul right now </connor>
<connor> because because like </connor>
<connor> because mates are meant to act like </connor>
<garnt> anime characters right and there's </garnt>
<garnt> nothing more uncomfortable to me than </garnt>
<garnt> seeing like a real life anime character </garnt>
<connor> like right in front of my art well </connor>
<connor> because in real life it's like extremely </connor>
<garnt> uncomfortable to see somebody talk that </garnt>
<garnt> way it's like yeah please because people </garnt>
<connor> listen </connor>
<connor> that way just act normal </connor>
<connor> please just i don't know slap me or </connor>

<connor> episode what have you guys been up to </connor>
<connor> this year then what's what's been the </connor>
<joey> the biggest growth the biggest </joey>
<joey> disappointments the biggest uh </joey>
<joey> achievements have you achieved anything </joey>
<connor> this year </connor>
<joey> i'm not dead </joey>
<garnt> i'm still alive i guess </garnt>
<joey> we all say that but i think to our </joey>
<joey> audience it's like well okay okay i can </joey>
<joey> name off about 50 things okay we have </joey>
<joey> moved studios uh we've got we've got a </joey>
<garnt> much without having </garnt>
<connor> yeah this is probably the biggest it's </connor>
<connor> difficult because you don't i often you </connor>
<connor> don't want to spend too much time </connor>
<connor> patting yourself on the back because if </connor>
<connor> you do you often get lost in uh in there </connor>
<connor> and you you can't be seen you want to </connor>
<connor> keep pushing forward yeah and never </connor>
<connor> never be complacent with what you've </connor>
<connor> done yeah i mean you know i i guess i'm </connor>
<connor> happy i moved house it didn't really </connor>
<connor> feel like something that i've achieved </connor>
<connor> but i felt like it was a big dub yeah </connor>
<connor> get moving to a better place </connor>
<joey> you know sorry man sometimes you know </joey>
<joey> what you have to stroke your own </joey>
<joey> decisions </joey>
<connor> that's definitely uh definitely a </connor>
<joey> minuses the gym has been less apparent </joey>
<connor> in my life yeah i i need to get started </connor>
<garnt> i'm just happy karen can i say where we </garnt>
<connor> used to live </connor>
<connor> uh you could i would just say the i </connor>
<connor> guess </connor>
<connor> so i'm glad we've moved out of summer so </connor>
<connor> all that time when we said that we lived </connor>
<garnt> in tokyo that was a [ __ ] lie well we </garnt>
<joey> we lived inside somewhere oh it's not </joey>
<joey> not exactly it's the greater tokyo </joey>
<joey> metropolitan okay okay okay it wasn't </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> is zone 6 really london </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> there was like different trains that we </connor>
<connor> could get to go into tokyo so we could </connor>
<connor> like either take like the rapid trade </connor>
<connor> which takes like 20 minutes or something </connor>
<connor> to get into central tokyo </connor>
<garnt> but like the rapid train is like </garnt>
<garnt> only comes with once an hour there's a </garnt>
<garnt> unicorn yeah then there's a commuter </garnt>
<garnt> rapid oh the commuter </garnt>
<garnt> there's the local rapid commuter rapid </garnt>
<garnt> the the local stops at every spot </garnt>
<joey> obviously the rapid stops like i'd say </joey>
<joey> japan are definitely going to feed that </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> maybe </connor>
<joey> i really think so yeah because the </joey>
<joey> commuter rapid is like only one train </joey>
<joey> line </joey>
<connor> oh really well no </connor>
<connor> there's a few stops that it goes to that </connor>
<joey> we could live in yeah but like you can i </joey>
<connor> think people in japan now figured out oh </connor>
<connor> it's definitely that line that they will </connor>
<connor> i guess well good thing we don't live </connor>
<garnt> there right now </garnt>
<connor> anymore so there you go </connor>
<joey> well they wouldn't know they wouldn't </joey>
<joey> know the exact start yeah yeah it's fine </joey>
<joey> it's fine but there's because there's </joey>
<joey> the there's okay there's two lines </joey>
<joey> inside though that you can get the kane </joey>
<joey> toku and the the yeah </joey>
<joey> sucks it stops at every stop it takes </joey>
<joey> like 10 hours to get anywhere </joey>
<joey> there's like two lines one of them </joey>
<connor> actually gets you places the other one </connor>
<connor> it literally takes like two hours to go </connor>
<joey> from like the the it's because </joey>
<joey> goes through four prefectures yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> great yeah it's nuts yeah and then like </garnt>
<garnt> where we where like where we used to </garnt>
<garnt> live like if you we could plan going </garnt>
<garnt> into tokyo right because you can plan to </garnt>
<garnt> go this time to get the commuter rapid </garnt>
<garnt> it's a fast train but my god going back </garnt>
<connor> was such a pain right shinjuku at like </connor>
<garnt> 11 was like nightmare yeah yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> you're you'll never get the commuter </garnt>
<garnt> rapid you'll never get like the rapid </garnt>
<connor> it's always the local and then you </connor>
<connor> suddenly a 20-minute commute </connor>
<connor> turns into an hour you know yeah on the </connor>
<connor> local train it was uh </connor>
<connor> like the first few times i was like okay </connor>
<garnt> okay i can do this and then afterwards </garnt>
<garnt> especially when we started coming to the </garnt>
<garnt> office where we moved office um it was i </garnt>
<connor> wanted to move a lot closer the first </connor>
<connor> show didn't bother me much i don't </connor>
<garnt> really care much then it got to but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm glad we moved uh i mean you know i </garnt>
<garnt> liked where we lived actually it was a </garnt>
<connor> nice area yeah it was a really nice area </connor>
<garnt> uh it's just too fast </garnt>
<connor> yeah and i i won't lie the ubereats </connor>
<connor> selection was shocking you pretty much </connor>
<joey> you had you had one option for every </joey>
<connor> cuisine yeah so it was like if if the if </connor>
<joey> the thai place was bad which luckily it </joey>
<joey> wasn't though </joey>
<joey> it was bad okay the typewriters are like </joey>
<garnt> the best place yeah but like </garnt>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<joey> all right because </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<garnt> like good italian food that delivered </garnt>
<garnt> which was like this i feel like this is </garnt>
<joey> the most privileged [ __ ] thing i </joey>
<connor> don't care i love italian food and i </connor>
<joey> love getting i don't know if you've </joey>
<joey> heard of dominoes </joey>
<joey> that's pretty italian if you want to do </joey>
<connor> uh pizza they do pizza and pasta there </connor>
<connor> was one place but it was ridiculously </connor>
<garnt> expensive for me the the biggest thing </garnt>
<garnt> that i was missing in the uber's </garnt>
<connor> selection was healthy options oh yeah </connor>
<connor> there's like no like salad or anything </connor>
<garnt> yeah like if you wanted healthy foods </garnt>
<connor> you needed to cook it yourself and a lot </connor>
<connor> of the times </connor>
<connor> a lot of the times i wanted to eat </connor>
<connor> healthy and then like but i would get </connor>
<garnt> back from work and then the day would be </garnt>
<garnt> over </garnt>
<connor> the first world problems god forbid i </connor>
<joey> chop up lettuce in my own home we like </joey>
<connor> the ubereats selection was rather poor </connor>
<connor> this is like pre-oligar like levels of </connor>
<joey> water i i used to just go out a lot to </joey>
<joey> eat just because when i did move into </joey>
<joey> the my previous place i saw the ubereats </joey>
<joey> options it was like </joey>
<connor> are you [ __ ] that i'm just gonna go out </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> but also you were a lot closer to the </connor>
<connor> places than i was saying yeah i guess so </connor>
<joey> i was like nothing new it was nice </joey>
<joey> though like that area was super nice to </joey>
<joey> walk around in yeah because </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<garnt> because like i i feel like i only </garnt>
<connor> started to really walk around and </connor>
<connor> explore when i was deciding whether i </connor>
<connor> should move or not </connor>
<connor> and i was just like oh there's a there's </connor>
<connor> a lot of cool places a lot of cool cafes </connor>
<connor> and restaurants that i just didn't </connor>
<connor> notice before because i'd never bothered </connor>
<connor> exploring the area and they didn't show </connor>
<connor> up in ubereat so why how could i </connor>
<connor> discover them yeah exactly right and uh </connor>
<connor> yeah like i i feel like there's a lot of </connor>
<joey> small local places that i miss now but </joey>
<garnt> you know i'm also happy to be in a more </garnt>
<garnt> convenient area and i've been be outside </garnt>
<joey> that time i'm just happy we've all moved </joey>
<connor> into much much bigger and nicer places </connor>
<garnt> now yeah you know and like you know as </garnt>
<connor> good as our previous places were like i </connor>
<connor> think you know </connor>
<joey> especially after we got this office i </joey>
<joey> think it was definitely time for an </joey>
<joey> upgrade in our in our personal lives as </joey>
<garnt> well </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like i </garnt>
<connor> i i i've said this before but i was </connor>
<connor> happy with my place and i was very lucky </connor>
<connor> to find the place that i have moved into </connor>
<connor> um but you know i was i was i was still </connor>
<connor> pretty happy with my place so </connor>
<connor> i i </connor>
<connor> it's it's to to me it's definitely an </connor>
<connor> upgrade but it's like it's it's like a </connor>
<connor> natural progression to me and i feel </connor>
<connor> like there are some things that i've </connor>
<connor> definitely progressed in in like 2021 </connor>
<connor> and then there's some things that i feel </connor>
<connor> like i've probably requested regressed </connor>
<connor> in or stayed the same i don't know it's </connor>
<connor> been a it's been a weird year because </connor>
<connor> after 2020 everyone was just like all </connor>
<connor> right ready to like hit the ground </connor>
<connor> running in 2021 and then the environment </connor>
<connor> just didn't allow </connor>
<connor> us to like hit the ground running yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so like i remember like i think for </connor>
<connor> a lot of 2021 like like you know i can </connor>
<connor> say this now because i think before </connor>
<connor> going back to england i was definitely </connor>
<connor> burnt out like um </connor>
<connor> i'm saying it's not like i was </connor>
<connor> definitely burnt out and everyone's just </connor>
<connor> everyone's just like oh why didn't you </connor>
<connor> take a holiday why why didn't you take </connor>
<connor> some time off to uh just look after your </connor>
<connor> mental health and all that stuff and </connor>
<connor> what i would say was there was nothing i </connor>
<connor> could do </connor>
<connor> there was nothing that i wanted to do </connor>
<connor> because what i wanted to do was see </connor>
<connor> family see friends you know back at home </connor>
<connor> seemed pretty two years for a long time </connor>
<connor> two years is a very long time and that </connor>
<connor> was like that's that was like my reset </connor>
<connor> right so before that like i was </connor>
<connor> definitely burnt out and i kind of just </connor>
<connor> dealt with it by just trying to fill up </connor>
<connor> my schedule and uh kind of kind of just </connor>
<connor> like ignoring it and i i didn't fully </connor>
<connor> realize that until i went back to </connor>
<connor> england and i just had nothing on my </connor>
<connor> schedule and i just realized </connor>
<connor> holy [ __ ] this is uh this is really </connor>
<connor> refreshing i'm getting a lot of ideas </connor>
<connor> and i want to go back to work i'm not </connor>
<connor> doing a single thing </connor>
<garnt> is this what it's like to uh have a </garnt>
<joey> break have a proper break this was like </joey>
<joey> to have a life </joey>
<garnt> to just not do anything </garnt>
<joey> yeah so i mean that's that's kind of </joey>
<joey> like what has been hardest in 2021 </joey>
<joey> because 2020 was like what was the year </joey>
<joey> where you know the entire world was </joey>
<joey> flagged 2021 was like me waiting for the </joey>
<garnt> world to get back to normal and it's </garnt>
<garnt> funny </garnt>
<garnt> finally finally looking like it is going </garnt>
<connor> to get back to normal now yeah fingers </connor>
<connor> crossed touchwood are you are you boys </connor>
<connor> happy with your youtube channel this </connor>
<connor> year </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> which one joey which one yeah i i love </connor>
<connor> it because uh 2021 is the year that joey </connor>
<connor> refined finally became an annie tuber </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> just not on the end of the just on the </joey>
<joey> anime man channel yeah yeah i have a </joey>
<joey> i i told gant about it but uh because </joey>
<joey> i've been uploading a lot more on my </joey>
<joey> second channel now and i've been making </joey>
<joey> a lot more anime content on my second </joey>
<joey> channel now that i have a playlist on my </joey>
<joey> second channel called actual anime </joey>
<joey> content </joey>
<joey> just to poke fun but like yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know um </joey>
<joey> i'm very harsh on myself when it comes </joey>
<joey> to my youtube channel and my content </joey>
<joey> stuff like that so like you know i'm </joey>
<joey> obviously proud of all the videos i </joey>
<joey> upload on both channels yeah otherwise i </joey>
<joey> wouldn't upload it at all but i'm </joey>
<connor> definitely not i'm [ __ ] not proud of </connor>
<joey> all the ones </joey>
<garnt> but like i'm definitely one of those </garnt>
<connor> people that's like </connor>
<garnt> after a week of that like honeymoon </garnt>
<garnt> period i'm like yeah i could have done </garnt>
<connor> better </connor>
<connor> i'll do better on the next one and then </connor>
<connor> i try and do it and i keep thinking i'm </connor>
<joey> going in the right direction then i'm </joey>
<joey> just like at the end of it i look back </joey>
<joey> at all of it i'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah like five percent of it was okay </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> 95 </connor>
<connor> could have used a bit of work but i </connor>
<connor> think uh yeah like i have like plans for </connor>
<connor> next year for what i want to do with my </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] but like yeah i don't know it's uh </connor>
<connor> it's going to be scary because it's </connor>
<connor> going to be a lot different yeah like </connor>
<connor> pretty much everything i've established </connor>
<connor> up until this point so yeah see how it </connor>
<connor> goes but uh you know that's i guess </connor>
<connor> that's what we have trash taste for </connor>
<connor> right like as a fail-safe almost or uh </connor>
<garnt> not so much a failsafe but like because </garnt>
<connor> i guess like </connor>
<garnt> yeah like a safety net i guess because </garnt>
<garnt> when we started again it's like when we </garnt>
<connor> started trash days we were like oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> this will be like a nice side project </garnt>
<connor> for you to do you know yeah and like we </connor>
<connor> could do all sorts of cool things on the </connor>
<connor> sideline while we focus on our main </connor>
<connor> content but now it's like well we're </connor>
<connor> like 1.1 million subs or something which </connor>
<connor> is insane on the main channel thank you </connor>
<connor> again by the way yeah um </connor>
<connor> it's and you know now it's like pretty </connor>
<joey> much become like the main basket now and </joey>
<joey> our main channels and our side channels </joey>
<joey> and whatever else that we do outside of </joey>
<joey> trash taste has become the safety net </joey>
<joey> almost no like trash chase has become </joey>
<joey> like almost the number one priority no </joey>
<joey> it is a number one it is </joey>
<joey> when we need to schedule recording </joey>
<joey> that's getting done before any of my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] videos or anything like any of </joey>
<garnt> my scripts </garnt>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> so it's like you know definitely because </joey>
<connor> like we do have like lots of exciting </connor>
<connor> plans for trash taste obviously next </connor>
<joey> year uh which obviously can't tell you </joey>
<joey> but look forward to it um yeah i </joey>
<garnt> definitely plan my work in greek my </garnt>
<garnt> working week around trash taste yeah not </garnt>
<garnt> the other way around yeah </garnt>
<joey> um and i think just like that right like </joey>
<joey> that mentality is already just telling </joey>
<joey> of like this is out but yeah </joey>
<connor> but but also when there's i think </connor>
<connor> because all three of us are involved i </connor>
<joey> think it i i guess we probably pay more </joey>
<joey> respect to the the scheduling of trash </joey>
<joey> taste yeah all right well definitely if </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] over my own channel that's my own </joey>
<joey> problem but yeah if i [ __ ] over the </joey>
<connor> scheduling with like trash taste yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's like a burden to everyone yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> and you know we have we have people who </connor>
<garnt> turn up to help us with trash taste so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you know when i [ __ ] around doing a </garnt>
<garnt> monkey tier list on my own channel you </garnt>
<connor> know if i don't do that it's you know </connor>
<connor> it's on me and yeah that's it right no </connor>
<joey> one else yeah yeah i think that that's </joey>
<joey> like i guess like going back to the </joey>
<joey> whole like getting a personal assistant </joey>
<joey> yeah or like getting a team yeah to help </joey>
<connor> you know behind the scenes of like my </connor>
<connor> main channel and stuff like that i think </connor>
<connor> that's the one thing i'm scared of which </connor>
<connor> is like i'm gonna feel more pressure now </connor>
<connor> to deliver on my main channel because </connor>
<connor> now it's not just me that i'm taking </connor>
<connor> care of it's taking care of a personal </connor>
<connor> assistant or like you know an editor or </connor>
<connor> you know a manager or whoever right </connor>
<connor> there's like multiple people's </connor>
<connor> livelihoods at stake right it's like </connor>
<connor> that's that's really the only thing i </connor>
<joey> guess that stopped me from personally </joey>
<joey> getting a personal assistant i don't </joey>
<joey> even know what to talk to them maybe </joey>
<connor> they'll realize i'm [ __ ] stupid i </connor>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<joey> like why am i helping it's a lost cause </joey>
<garnt> no like for me i think the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> change for me this year is i guess i've </garnt>
<garnt> been really trying to figure out not </garnt>
<garnt> what i want to do but how i want to do </garnt>
<connor> it i feel like you said this last year </connor>
<connor> in the year before </connor>
<connor> is it okay for me to say </connor>
<joey> did i say this last year you definitely </joey>
<connor> definitely said this last year yeah </connor>
<connor> because i i think this year has been the </connor>
<connor> year where i've really like knuckled </connor>
<connor> down to </connor>
<connor> try to really start thinking of my main </connor>
<garnt> channel as like content as a job that i </garnt>
<garnt> have to like break down and uh like </garnt>
<garnt> actually be strict on how long it takes </garnt>
<connor> to like make a video because right you </connor>
<connor> can't be taking months to make one video </connor>
<garnt> no i mean like it's like because because </garnt>
<garnt> i think one big thing that has changed </garnt>
<garnt> since joining trash case right is that </garnt>
<garnt> for better or worse my content </garnt>
<garnt> my content upload schedule is compared </garnt>
<garnt> to your guys right and like especially </garnt>
<garnt> like seeing how your guys's content is </garnt>
<connor> made like not saying like obviously i'm </connor>
<connor> not saying like anyone's content uh is </connor>
<connor> better or worse you know it's just like </connor>
<connor> i've kind of realized that </connor>
<connor> i want to upload as much as you guys but </connor>
<connor> with with the workflow of my kind of my </connor>
<connor> style of content i've tried to like cut </connor>
<connor> as many many corners as i can </connor>
<connor> and there is like there is just too many </connor>
<connor> bottlenecks that i can't i can't do to </connor>
<joey> like to like like i've i've reached max </joey>
<joey> productivity that i can reach with my </joey>
<joey> channel and </joey>
<joey> before </joey>
<joey> last year i was like i can improve i can </joey>
<joey> do better i can do like three videos a </joey>
<joey> month and trash taste and now i've kind </joey>
<joey> of i've come to realize that </joey>
<joey> not only is that setting the wrong </joey>
<joey> expectations for me to feel like i can </joey>
<joey> do it and you know i feel bad if i don't </joey>
<joey> do it but it also like sets the wrong </joey>
<joey> expectations for the viewer as well </joey>
<joey> because if the viewer is expecting me to </joey>
<garnt> upload that many videos a month and i </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> i kind of keep doing that </garnt>
<garnt> then that's that's just going to be </garnt>
<garnt> unsustainable and i'm just going to burn </garnt>
<garnt> out which which i did do this year but </garnt>
<garnt> that's like i didn't burn out because i </garnt>
<garnt> was putting myself in through too much </garnt>
<garnt> work i burnt out because of the world </garnt>
<garnt> situation but i've just realized that i </garnt>
<garnt> need to like i need to make a schedule </garnt>
<garnt> which is sustainable and </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately you know it's for better </garnt>
<garnt> or worse like i </garnt>
<garnt> my upload schedule does get compared to </garnt>
<garnt> your guys but like i've come to i've </garnt>
<garnt> come to realize to not feel guilty about </garnt>
<garnt> that anymore yeah </garnt>
<connor> you know i've when i make jokes about it </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah i don't give a [ __ ] but i i </garnt>
<joey> don't think it's a like just sound a bit </joey>
<joey> of fun yeah i also don't like i've never </joey>
<joey> considered </joey>
<garnt> i don't think that me or joe have ever </garnt>
<garnt> thought that your channel your content </garnt>
<garnt> and channel is comparable to ours in any </garnt>
<garnt> way like i don't think one upload is </garnt>
<connor> equal to one upload on </connor>
<garnt> no no i'm not like definitely not like </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> i guess it's like forced me to like </garnt>
<garnt> really break down a workflow to like the </garnt>
<joey> video right because like </joey>
<joey> how long would it take would it how long </joey>
<joey> does it take you guys to like make one </joey>
<joey> video like hour-wise would you say that </joey>
<connor> varies yeah yeah that varies literally </connor>
<joey> like two hours or like a hundred yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> there are some videos that like even one </connor>
<garnt> now that's really it's like a really big </garnt>
<garnt> video i've been working on that i've </garnt>
<garnt> been wanting to do for a very long time </garnt>
<garnt> yeah a lot of moving pieces and a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of a lot of love edits and a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of footage to go through but you know </garnt>
<garnt> that no matter even if i put like a </garnt>
<garnt> month's worth of like like let's say if </garnt>
<connor> you just took the hours i put into it </connor>
<connor> let's say it's like just a a full </connor>
<connor> working month of hours into one video </connor>
<connor> yeah it doesn't [ __ ] matter because i </connor>
<joey> got uploaded the week after anyway so </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah exactly but then maybe the </joey>
<connor> week after it'll be something that took </connor>
<connor> me two hours so it's it's it's kind of </connor>
<connor> you kind of have to juggle it but also </connor>
<garnt> not make it look </garnt>
<connor> like all these videos are like </connor>
<garnt> completely different quality yeah </garnt>
<connor> exactly which is why i kind of just </connor>
<connor> realized okay the only way i can make my </connor>
<connor> videos not seem drastically like </connor>
<connor> different in uh feeling uh theme </connor>
<connor> quality production is to just have i </connor>
<connor> guess </connor>
<connor> me being an idiot and me my personality </connor>
<garnt> being like the focal point yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> the video or at least the main aspect of </garnt>
<connor> the video yeah sorry so like so like i </connor>
<connor> had to break down for like let's say </connor>
<connor> like the fastest video you had to break </connor>
<connor> down yeah so had to break down like my </connor>
<connor> video making process like the fastest </connor>
<connor> video you can make is like say in like </connor>
<connor> two or three hours right let's say </connor>
<garnt> you're like you needed to get a video </garnt>
<garnt> out so i've had like a few times where i </garnt>
<garnt> just need to get a video out right so </garnt>
<connor> that's at the time on my end not doing </connor>
<garnt> editing yeah yeah yeah yeah so like for </garnt>
<garnt> me like i need to like pencil in let's </garnt>
<garnt> say let's say i'm doing a video about an </garnt>
<garnt> anime right so i have to pencil in hours </garnt>
<garnt> like around about a day to watch the </garnt>
<garnt> anime which like assuming it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> season of anime right and then let's say </garnt>
<garnt> two days for </garnt>
<garnt> two two days for scripting which is like </garnt>
<garnt> one day for the actual script one day to </garnt>
<garnt> like finish the script and actually make </garnt>
<garnt> it like a good script you know and uh </garnt>
<garnt> and so that's that's already three days </garnt>
<garnt> right and then i have to </garnt>
<garnt> have like you know two hours or so two </garnt>
<garnt> two hours for like the recording of the </garnt>
<joey> script and then nice and then i send </joey>
<joey> that off so that's like on my end </joey>
<joey> three and a half days already </joey>
<joey> um to be sent off to the editor now the </joey>
<joey> editor edits it and he has to send it </joey>
<joey> back to me and i have to do like the </joey>
<joey> finishing touches upload </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> um finishing touches upload thumbnail </joey>
<joey> and title which if i'm really lucky </joey>
<joey> would take half a day so that's like </joey>
<joey> four days basically </joey>
<joey> of workflow from beginning to end let's </joey>
<joey> say and that's if i'm fully productive </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> nothing goes wrong right that's the </joey>
<joey> fastest i can make a video of you to </joey>
<connor> assume i don't procrastinate now so </connor>
<connor> that's that's four days in a week right </connor>
<connor> trash taste is one day in a week yeah </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> i also want weekends as well </joey>
<joey> so now you just wish for thinking you </joey>
<connor> have that boy </connor>
<joey> i've realized like in my previous years </joey>
<joey> when i've been able to do three videos a </joey>
<joey> month i've been able to do three videos </joey>
<connor> a month and trash days because i've just </connor>
<connor> i've just worked on weekends and i've </connor>
<connor> just realized i kind of want weekends </connor>
<connor> and i kind of also want to do other </connor>
<connor> things like stream and </connor>
<connor> like maybe focus on some side projects </connor>
<connor> as well and i've just realized i'm </connor>
<connor> trying to put too much on myself and </connor>
<connor> there's like with the type of video i'm </connor>
<connor> making there is no way i can make this </connor>
<connor> video faster than the way i'm making it </connor>
<connor> and people will say well why don't you </connor>
<connor> become like a personality based channel </connor>
<connor> like you know you guys where you know </connor>
<connor> you know you can do different kinds of </connor>
<connor> content that is more focused on any </connor>
<connor> personality and i've played around with </connor>
<connor> that and then i've just realized no i </connor>
<connor> kind of i kind of like enjoy what i do i </connor>
<connor> kind of i i like scripting i've i am you </connor>
<connor> know i've already i've already got trash </connor>
<connor> taste i have a channel that is based </connor>
<connor> around my personality so called you know </connor>
<connor> and so i've i've just like i've just </connor>
<connor> realized that my main channel is always </connor>
<connor> going to be </connor>
<connor> a max cap two uploads a week uh two </connor>
<connor> uploads a month if i'm lucky three </connor>
<connor> uploads a month and i'm not going to </connor>
<connor> feel guilty if i don't make that if it's </connor>
<connor> one upload a month because i'm traveling </connor>
<connor> or because i'm on holiday that's what </connor>
<connor> you're getting and like i guess this is </connor>
<garnt> a message to you guys as well which is </garnt>
<garnt> i know i know like i know the image is </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like oh gods are late it goes </garnt>
<garnt> to lazy bum who doesn't upload that much </garnt>
<garnt> but uh trust me i am working at full </garnt>
<garnt> capacity and you guys are getting two </garnt>
<garnt> uploads uh you guys are getting two </garnt>
<garnt> uploads a month maybe one upload a month </garnt>
<garnt> if i'm busy that month but </garnt>
<garnt> that is me at max capacity and i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> going to try to pretend that anything </garnt>
<joey> else is that you know i honestly never </joey>
<joey> saw a problem like you know as much as i </joey>
<joey> like you know poking fun of it or </joey>
<connor> whatever you know in episodes and stuff </connor>
<connor> like that i honestly never saw a problem </connor>
<connor> with </connor>
<connor> your upload schedule um because again </connor>
<connor> like i know how much work goes into the </connor>
<connor> content that you make specifically like </connor>
<connor> you know you say you take two days to </connor>
<connor> make a script i sometimes take like a </connor>
<joey> week to make a script because i'm </joey>
<joey> nowhere near as good as making a script </joey>
<garnt> the two-day script happened this year oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah right before it would take like </joey>
<garnt> maybe like three days or four days </garnt>
<joey> before i can't script yeah but i feel </joey>
<joey> the more scripting you do the the better </joey>
<joey> you get at it because you understand you </joey>
<joey> know the basics of how to get a script </joey>
<joey> down right like you know i remember the </joey>
<joey> first script i wrote took me [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> forever because i was like how do you </joey>
<joey> write jokes i i've never written a joke </joey>
<joey> down in my life and performed it off the </joey>
<joey> script right so it's like </joey>
<joey> yeah so you know </joey>
<joey> i i would see like your upload schedule </joey>
<joey> and then i would see your videos and i </joey>
<joey> would think to myself all right if i </joey>
<garnt> were to make this video how long would </garnt>
<garnt> it take for me yeah and then i think to </garnt>
<garnt> myself yeah it'll probably take even </garnt>
<garnt> longer than it probably took gone yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right and that's why i've never really </garnt>
<garnt> seen a problem with your upload schedule </garnt>
<garnt> if anything i think like i'm i'm </garnt>
<garnt> honestly even thinking like for next </garnt>
<garnt> year i'm thinking to maybe go to like </garnt>
<garnt> something similar to your upload </garnt>
<garnt> schedule as well because i want to put </garnt>
<garnt> because i think this year the thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's changed with my channel is that </garnt>
<garnt> like i've definitely upped my quality of </garnt>
<garnt> content or like yeah i've upped the bar </garnt>
<garnt> of the minimum standard that a video </garnt>
<connor> should be yeah and that has resulted in </connor>
<connor> videos not only taking longer to make </connor>
<connor> yeah and to edit for mood on but also </connor>
<connor> it's taking longer to prepare just in </connor>
<connor> general yeah so it's like </connor>
<connor> right now especially these last couple </connor>
<joey> of months that i've been in like a </joey>
<joey> little bit of a burnout um i've noticed </joey>
<joey> that like </joey>
<joey> a week and one video a week is starting </joey>
<joey> to get tough i i actually forgot i had </joey>
<connor> to upload the other day </connor>
<joey> yeah right i was so busy i mean </joey>
<connor> especially legitimately i just forgot to </connor>
<connor> upload the video and then the day i was </connor>
<connor> like it was like midnight and i was like </connor>
<connor> oh i could upload it right now because </connor>
<connor> it was </connor>
<joey> supposed to go up in three hours but i </joey>
<connor> had to wake up at 4 am to do a call yeah </connor>
<connor> so i was like [ __ ] this i'm not i need </connor>
<connor> like these three hours of sleep i'm </connor>
<joey> getting yeah yeah right so but it's like </joey>
<connor> especially with us too now that we've </connor>
<connor> like put more effort into our second </connor>
<connor> channels as well right yeah and on top </connor>
<connor> of trash taste every week and then trash </connor>
<connor> days after dark every week right like </connor>
<connor> that's already so much [ __ ] on my plate </connor>
<connor> that i realized like oh if i continue </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> uh you know once a week schedule if i or </connor>
<connor> if i kind of lock myself into this once </connor>
<connor> a week schedule i'm either gonna </connor>
<connor> completely burn out yeah i'm either just </connor>
<connor> gonna be so [ __ ] exhausted that i </connor>
<connor> can't do anything or you know worst case </connor>
<joey> scenario both and the quality of my </joey>
<connor> videos is just naturally going to go </connor>
<connor> down yeah i've been toying with the idea </connor>
<connor> of uh just </connor>
<joey> not uploading all january doing the </joey>
<joey> classic youtuber move oh yeah i was like </joey>
<joey> i kind of want to like just do streaming </joey>
<joey> all month so and i thought january is </joey>
<connor> the best month because that's when you </connor>
<connor> get like </connor>
<connor> ad revenue you get a zero ad revenue and </connor>
<garnt> that's the youtube a month that everyone </garnt>
<connor> takes off because they don't get much </connor>
<connor> money yeah yeah yeah yeah but i was like </connor>
<connor> i do actually want to try doing like </connor>
<joey> streams uh full month see how it goes </joey>
<joey> and yeah have more of a consistent </joey>
<joey> schedule with that because i feel like </joey>
<joey> i've invested a lot in the streaming but </joey>
<garnt> i'm still like in compared to other </garnt>
<garnt> people who are full-time streamers i'm </garnt>
<garnt> nowhere near as consistent yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> think that's one thing that's like is a </garnt>
<connor> detriment to that because people always </connor>
<connor> complain like connor i never know when </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] you're gonna stream yeah and </connor>
<connor> i'm like yeah i know but that's what i </connor>
<connor> like about it </connor>
<connor> i like that i just turn up and i'm like </connor>
<connor> all right we're just gonna stream for 12 </connor>
<connor> hours now casually let's do it i think </connor>
<joey> yeah but i think like trash taste has </joey>
<joey> definitely done a good job with like you </joey>
<joey> know to varying levels uh or or varying </joey>
<joey> results like trust's kind of like gotten </joey>
<joey> us to kind of look at our main channel </joey>
<joey> stuff and being like i could probably </joey>
<garnt> change is it actually a main channel is </garnt>
<joey> it like i just say main channel for the </joey>
<joey> purpose of main channel i really don't </joey>
<garnt> think about like the only </garnt>
<garnt> it's weird now individually it's weird </garnt>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<joey> i didn't even think of any channel as </joey>
<joey> the main channel i'm just like i just </joey>
<joey> make [ __ ] some of it has priority over </joey>
<connor> the other ones yeah but it depends week </connor>
<garnt> by week which i'm prioritizing because </garnt>
<garnt> because like part of the reason why i've </garnt>
<garnt> been uh putting down the uh not not like </garnt>
<garnt> i've been putting the same amount of </garnt>
<garnt> videos on the main channel now which is </garnt>
<garnt> two videos a month and i'm not going to </garnt>
<connor> try to do more because i want to do two </connor>
<connor> videos a month huh i thought you did one </connor>
<connor> a month no i only did i only do one a </connor>
<joey> month when it's uh when it's like a </joey>
<connor> polygon </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah so yeah yes so right now i'm </joey>
<joey> doing two videos a month um and i'm </joey>
<joey> putting all my extra time into i do also </joey>
<joey> want to like make a second channel </joey>
<joey> because that seems fun you know </joey>
<joey> it's super fun i see you guys doing it </joey>
<connor> and i'm just like you know what maybe my </connor>
<connor> main channel doesn't need to be my top </connor>
<connor> priority you know i've got like the </connor>
<connor> formula down for my main channel and now </connor>
<joey> i just wanna i just want this extra time </joey>
<joey> to do other [ __ ] now because i was </joey>
<joey> thinking because i have like a lot of </joey>
<joey> ideas for like big projects that can go </joey>
<joey> to my main channel right which which i </joey>
<joey> am sitting on </joey>
<joey> um but my god they're going to take so </joey>
<joey> much [ __ ] time yeah um and i'm like </joey>
<joey> doing these big projects really takes a </joey>
<joey> lot out of you especially when you're </joey>
<joey> also trying to maintain your const </joey>
<garnt> consistent upload </garnt>
<garnt> schedule on your main channel anyway </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah so i've kind of come to </garnt>
<garnt> realize that you know when i really </garnt>
<garnt> really feel like i'm down on youtube and </garnt>
<garnt> i need to work on a video without that </garnt>
<garnt> i'm really passionate in then i'm going </garnt>
<garnt> to start doing those but for now </garnt>
<garnt> like i want like i want to do more more </garnt>
<garnt> small stuff i wanna i wanna i wanna do </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i think the thing for me was i there was </connor>
<connor> a you know because i </connor>
<connor> i'm not sitting here saying that my main </connor>
<connor> channel is quality by any means i think </connor>
<connor> there is some level of effort that goes </connor>
<connor> into it and uh i'm going to have to </connor>
<joey> harsh myself would that not be quality </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> i don't know if there is a certain point </joey>
<connor> there's a certain bar that i try to do </connor>
<connor> on the channel for most videos there are </connor>
<connor> sometimes like i did like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> which chris loves to joke about yeah my </connor>
<connor> monkey tls video which i just wanted to </connor>
<connor> do because i thought it was fun but it's </connor>
<connor> obviously you know it's not it's nothing </connor>
<connor> like exceptional yeah but you know in </connor>
<connor> general the videos that i have were </connor>
<connor> quite difficult but you know sometimes i </connor>
<connor> see someone doing like a you laugh you </connor>
<connor> lose challenge i'm like that seems fun </connor>
<connor> i'd like to do that yeah i'll do it live </connor>
<connor> instead i'll do it on the the other </connor>
<connor> channel because it works and so it kind </connor>
<connor> of came to a point where a lot of fun </connor>
<garnt> ideas that just weren't </garnt>
<garnt> big enough or weren't uh exciting enough </garnt>
<garnt> to like </garnt>
<garnt> warrant putting a lot of time and effort </garnt>
<garnt> into that yeah just kind of work really </garnt>
<connor> well on the other side </connor>
<garnt> because that's that's what i've noticed </garnt>
<garnt> well that's why i want that's why i want </garnt>
<garnt> a second channel because i feel like i </garnt>
<garnt> have set a bar of quality on my main </garnt>
<garnt> channel and i've like tested </garnt>
<garnt> uploading videos that maybe have not had </garnt>
<connor> as much time put into them and use you </connor>
<connor> do see it in the view numbers if um like </connor>
<connor> eventually so that's why i'm just like </connor>
<connor> okay let's just keep my main channel for </connor>
<connor> like the contents big boy videos for the </connor>
<connor> big boy videos for the videos that my </connor>
<garnt> audience expect to me but that doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> mean you can't do other things on the </garnt>
<joey> second channel yeah it's like you know </joey>
<joey> there's like so many like especially </joey>
<joey> timely things or you know like so many </joey>
<joey> things that perhaps have nothing to do </joey>
<connor> with the [ __ ] i'm known for right that i </connor>
<connor> want to talk about in the video like you </connor>
<connor> know when youtube brought out that news </connor>
<connor> that they were going to get rid of the </connor>
<connor> dislike button right i was like i want </connor>
<connor> to talk about this in a video but i </connor>
<garnt> can't just put up a 15-minute rant of me </garnt>
<garnt> on the channel </garnt>
<joey> so it's like perfect i have a perfect </joey>
<connor> outlet for random [ __ ] have you how many </connor>
<connor> do you get the comments of i don't watch </connor>
<joey> the anime anymore watch joey yeah a lot </joey>
<joey> i mean you know that's fine and </joey>
<connor> everything because it's like you know at </connor>
<connor> the end of the day it's still me right </connor>
<connor> so it's whatever and you know it's weird </connor>
<connor> right because especially this past like </connor>
<connor> two or three weeks uh i've been </connor>
<connor> uploading a lot more on the second </connor>
<connor> channel and i've just like i found </connor>
<connor> myself waking up and thinking to myself </connor>
<connor> all right what should the next channel </connor>
<garnt> on the second channel oh the next video </garnt>
<connor> on the second channel </connor>
<garnt> oh wait wait i have a main channel [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> i should probably think about that one </joey>
<garnt> as well right i think because another </garnt>
<garnt> big thing as well is um i i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> right now with my main channel it i've </garnt>
<garnt> definitely seen the plateau of just that </garnt>
<garnt> kind of anime content yeah like that </garnt>
<garnt> kind of amazing concept and you know i i </garnt>
<connor> do i do have like ideas about how you </connor>
<connor> know you can i could i could keep that </connor>
<connor> channel growing and grow past the </connor>
<connor> plateau but the the amount of time and </connor>
<connor> effort that would take </connor>
<connor> would to to me that would take too much </connor>
<connor> time and effort that i just don't have </connor>
<joey> right now that would take giving up </joey>
<connor> trash taste basically yeah to uh to make </connor>
<joey> content and rebrand my channel to a </joey>
<garnt> point where it can grow plus past the </garnt>
<garnt> plateau of that kind of vanity content </garnt>
<connor> right how do you feel about the growth </connor>
<garnt> on your channel your main channel uh i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i'm i'm fine with it because </garnt>
<connor> because i know like right now any tube </connor>
<connor> as it is has just plateaued like that's </connor>
<connor> you know we've seen the plateau if if </connor>
<garnt> there are any other antitubers who would </garnt>
<joey> like to prove me wrong please because </joey>
<joey> you know i'm i'm waiting for that one </joey>
<garnt> person to prove me wrong yeah i i'm </garnt>
<garnt> waiting as well because i need i need to </garnt>
<joey> kick up my ass to be like oh you can go </joey>
<joey> higher okay that's like my motivation </joey>
<joey> because like </joey>
<joey> i'm sure your you guys are the same way </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter how many subscribers </joey>
<connor> you have right what i find what what i </connor>
<connor> find happiness in is growing something </connor>
<connor> or like making making it feel like i </connor>
<connor> have made progress on something so like </connor>
<connor> i felt way more fulfilled seeing the </connor>
<connor> progress and growth on trash taste than </connor>
<connor> i did on my own channel for like last </connor>
<connor> year yeah and like that's why i'm the </connor>
<connor> thought of a second channel excites me </connor>
<connor> way more than even making big videos on </connor>
<garnt> my own channel because even if i make a </garnt>
<garnt> big video my own channel which i'm </garnt>
<garnt> really passionate in i know that there's </garnt>
<garnt> a certain cap for like the number of </garnt>
<joey> views that's going to get and i mean </joey>
<joey> it's already like you know especially </joey>
<joey> with like all of our main channels like </joey>
<joey> it's it's already at a size where we're </joey>
<garnt> pretty </garnt>
<garnt> happy with right and it's like it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> massive to a lot of people right so it's </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah yeah it's just it just makes </garnt>
<garnt> more sense that like you know obviously </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna have more excitement </garnt>
<connor> watering this tiny plant than watering a </connor>
<connor> giant tree right yeah obviously watching </connor>
<garnt> this tiny thing grow into something </garnt>
<garnt> bigger is going to be more fulfilling </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you're trying to do </garnt>
<garnt> something that you otherwise not really </garnt>
<garnt> known for perhaps it's like content that </garnt>
<garnt> you've never tried before and stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> that and i think that's why i've been </garnt>
<garnt> having so much fun with the second </garnt>
<garnt> channel but like yeah i don't know like </garnt>
<garnt> and so like my main channel grew as well </garnt>
<garnt> like i hit 3 million subs this year </garnt>
<joey> yeah right but like to me it's like i </joey>
<joey> don't know like i know definitely past </joey>
<connor> me would look at some months of my </connor>
<connor> channel's growth and being like oh man i </connor>
<connor> didn't really grow that much at all but </connor>
<connor> like i think i've just rewired my brain </connor>
<garnt> this year to be like if it ain't a </garnt>
<garnt> negative then it's all good dude like if </garnt>
<garnt> if every day i'm gaining at least one </garnt>
<garnt> sub i'm i'm completely okay with that </garnt>
<garnt> now because i haven't been canceled yet </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly it's like if if people are </garnt>
<garnt> still like looking at my [ __ ] and </garnt>
<garnt> wanting to come in </garnt>
<garnt> cool dude like my doors are open but </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm not i'm not at this point now </garnt>
<garnt> where i'm like oh [ __ ] i only made 20 </garnt>
<garnt> 000 subs this month i'm slowly dying you </garnt>
<connor> know it's like yeah the channel yeah i'm </connor>
<connor> like don't chance like oh no i'm just </connor>
<connor> past that point now like i'd much rather </connor>
<connor> put in the time to like be like oh i </connor>
<connor> have this tiny second channel that i </connor>
<connor> want to grow into something big so let's </connor>
<connor> let's focus on that kind of thing or you </connor>
<connor> know with like trash taste for instance </connor>
<connor> right yeah yeah like that that's way </connor>
<connor> more exciting for me and i think that's </connor>
<connor> why you know at least you and i have had </connor>
<garnt> a lot of fun doing the second stuff </garnt>
<connor> right because it's just like streaming </connor>
<garnt> it's just something new right it's fun </garnt>
<garnt> yeah did you start like properly </garnt>
<connor> streaming this year or did it start last </connor>
<garnt> year i can't remember it it almost feels </garnt>
<joey> like you've been streaming forever like </joey>
<joey> properly properly like consistently i </joey>
<joey> think it was this year right it's been </joey>
<connor> more this year than it was like well </connor>
<joey> last year it was 2009 no 2008. when was </joey>
<joey> the chess tournament the first one </joey>
<joey> uh early 2020 yeah 2020. okay well 2020 </joey>
<connor> was around when i started streaming okay </connor>
<garnt> and then i think yeah this year is </garnt>
<garnt> probably where it's growing the most </garnt>
<garnt> i've been a lot more consistent been </garnt>
<connor> doing a bunch of stuff with that yeah </connor>
<connor> it's interesting </connor>
<connor> i still occasionally get people coming </connor>
<connor> into the twitch being like i had no idea </connor>
<connor> you had a twitch channel yeah oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah i have that every time i stream </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> i guess it's a different platform right </connor>
<garnt> yeah it is a different platform yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah is there any changes you guys want </connor>
<garnt> to make going into the next year </garnt>
<garnt> uh i'm just continuing what you're doing </garnt>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> i guess just like i don't know for me </joey>
<garnt> new year's resolutions </garnt>
<joey> youtube youtuber new year's resolution i </joey>
<connor> will probably i'm gonna hit a million </connor>
<joey> subs on the second channel there's </joey>
<connor> probably gonna be a point uh because i </connor>
<connor> you know when the world does open up i </connor>
<connor> do want to travel a lot more yeah i </connor>
<connor> actually like have a bit more time to </connor>
<joey> relax so there'll probably be a point </joey>
<joey> where i'm uploading a little bit less so </joey>
<connor> i'm not i'm not really too bothered </connor>
<joey> about it all right i'm just gonna say it </joey>
<joey> now just exp expect less uploads on the </joey>
<joey> main channel i think just because yeah </joey>
<joey> for one i want to put more effort into </joey>
<joey> each video now i don't want to like be </joey>
<joey> confined to this once a week schedule </joey>
<connor> and like </connor>
<connor> you're not gonna talk about what anime </connor>
<joey> you're not gonna watch no probably not </joey>
<connor> if i do that'll be on the main on the </connor>
<connor> second channel where actual anime </connor>
<connor> content exists </connor>
<connor> subscribe </connor>
<connor> but uh yeah i don't know like at least </connor>
<connor> with the main channel like i think i </connor>
<connor> know what kind of content i want to like </connor>
<garnt> focus more on on the set on the main </garnt>
<garnt> channel from next year but that is </garnt>
<garnt> definitely going to force me to not </garnt>
<joey> upload every week yeah just because it's </joey>
<garnt> going to be impossible yeah i think last </garnt>
<garnt> year my new year's resolution was to be </garnt>
<garnt> more productive and to upload more and </garnt>
<garnt> then as i've just said this year i've </garnt>
<garnt> kind of realized yeah that i tried i </garnt>
<garnt> really did because i went i went like a </garnt>
<garnt> good like four months where i had like </garnt>
<garnt> three videos a month and i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> before we went to the uk it was like </garnt>
<joey> pretty consistent what's it really yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah [ __ ] you don't watch it right </garnt>
<connor> it was literally just before the office </connor>
<connor> move and then and then it took like all </connor>
<connor> right [ __ ] [ __ ] three weeks </connor>
<connor> it was around the same time so it was </connor>
<connor> like the first </connor>
<connor> the first half of the year um and then i </connor>
<connor> realized okay my my </connor>
<connor> resolution was just unsustainable and </connor>
<connor> i'm like i've accepted that yeah so my </connor>
<garnt> new year's resolution is i want to do </garnt>
<garnt> more collabs and it's not going to be on </garnt>
<garnt> the main channel which is why i want to </garnt>
<garnt> focus more on another channel </garnt>
<garnt> because i've kind of realized collabs </garnt>
<garnt> just don't work for the dynamic on my on </garnt>
<garnt> my main channel yeah yeah that's that's </garnt>
<connor> what would you mean what about our </connor>
<connor> collab on our collab remember that one </connor>
<garnt> that one the one collab that </garnt>
<connor> i mean because like i want to do less </connor>
<connor> something that's like not scripted and </connor>
<garnt> i'd feel like any anything i script and </garnt>
<garnt> collabs uh anything uh anything i do on </garnt>
<garnt> my main channel has to be scripted so </garnt>
<joey> that that video was obviously scripted </joey>
<joey> um i also just wanted like more time to </joey>
<joey> work on like side projects i want to do </joey>
<connor> a week-long live stream at least at some </connor>
<connor> point i'll do it at some point good </connor>
<connor> just double it </connor>
<garnt> it's just stubble yeah there's that one </garnt>
<connor> easy did i not like break you no </connor>
<connor> three days three days would like easily </connor>
<connor> break me off like three hours </connor>
<connor> i think i made a mistake of shouting </connor>
<connor> during one game too much getting angry </connor>
<garnt> yeah and it [ __ ] my throat for like </garnt>
<garnt> the next day and then obviously it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't having any time to heal because i </garnt>
<garnt> was just talking all day yeah and so </garnt>
<garnt> that was a rookie mistake but do it </garnt>
<garnt> again i'm not going to shout as much </garnt>
<connor> not as angrily </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<connor> actually the sleeping in that [ __ ] bed </connor>
<connor> was kind of uncomfortable i didn't </connor>
<connor> really get good sleep that was one thing </connor>
<joey> no yeah i i </joey>
<joey> wouldn't with the fact thousands of </joey>
<garnt> people yeah with the [ __ ] rave going </garnt>
<connor> on in the day it was the bed the bed </connor>
<joey> sucked </joey>
<joey> i'd probably just do one night where i'd </joey>
<joey> go and sleep in my nice bed and i'm like </joey>
<joey> oh i'm rested boys let's get it let's go </joey>
<connor> come on must keep streaming yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> don't know yeah no i i want to do that </connor>
<joey> at some point i don't know when though </joey>
<joey> yeah and i mean like i guess like in the </joey>
<joey> case with like trash days as well like </joey>
<garnt> because you know we're the world is </garnt>
<garnt> hopefully going to open up a little more </garnt>
<joey> next year yeah we're just going to be </joey>
<garnt> really busy with that [ __ ] as well like </garnt>
<garnt> the workload for trash taste has been </garnt>
<garnt> upped as well right because we don't we </garnt>
<joey> now we stream every week if you didn't </joey>
<joey> know um until at least until christmas </joey>
<joey> comes along which </joey>
<joey> around now but uh once the year rolls </joey>
<joey> along i i want to continue the weekly </joey>
<joey> streams yeah i just work right </joey>
<garnt> but like what that means is that we we </garnt>
<garnt> basically just recording another podcast </garnt>
<connor> every week we have two trash tastes at </connor>
<connor> this point yeah we have </connor>
<garnt> if there wasn't enough of my schedule </garnt>
<connor> already there's there's another thing to </connor>
<garnt> tick off the main channel </garnt>
<connor> it's another trash taste recording </connor>
<connor> somebody added up all the runtime of </connor>
<connor> trash station it was longer than like </connor>
<garnt> all of dbc or something </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that i believe that i </garnt>
<garnt> would still rather watch that </garnt>
<garnt> and uh </garnt>
<garnt> i've rewatched episodes there and all of </garnt>
<garnt> them oh my god regarding trash though um </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<garnt> we uh we figured out earlier that we've </garnt>
<garnt> only uploaded one special this year </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah which was the cycling special </joey>
<joey> back in february which we filmed the </joey>
<garnt> year prior </garnt>
<garnt> so uh wait will the figure episode count </garnt>
<connor> as a special </connor>
<garnt> just kind of it's like half a second </garnt>
<joey> it's like a mini special yeah yeah i </joey>
<connor> guess i guess it's special in nature </connor>
<connor> yeah not a name </connor>
<connor> because we're still in the office yeah i </connor>
<garnt> mean we had the cycling special and then </garnt>
<garnt> we've had like some mini specials like </garnt>
<connor> the figure special the pc build special </connor>
<connor> um but i guess i guess it truly is like </connor>
<connor> top gear now where we get like we get </connor>
<connor> like once once a year one big special </connor>
<garnt> yeah and every other week it's just like </garnt>
<connor> the normal day two specials a year right </connor>
<joey> yeah that's probably a healthy amount </joey>
<garnt> yeah i i think two special yeah well a </garnt>
<garnt> big portion of this remember remember </garnt>
<garnt> when we first started doing specials we </garnt>
<joey> were like </joey>
<joey> four a year let's do it all right that </joey>
<garnt> ain't happening </garnt>
<joey> well because we had we had like we are </joey>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> back then we had our main channel and </connor>
<connor> trash taste and that was it </connor>
<connor> now we have our main channel you guys </connor>
<connor> are doing your second channel streaming </connor>
<connor> trash taste after dark um and then we </connor>
<connor> gotta do our specials on top of that </connor>
<connor> easy </connor>
<garnt> moon on teach us how this is done </garnt>
<connor> and people wonder why we want assistance </connor>
<joey> yeah right </joey>
<connor> i really i'm like genuinely considering </connor>
<connor> it for next year i think i think it's </connor>
<connor> gotten to the point where i actually </connor>
<joey> will it's not a matter of if </joey>
<joey> i need one or if if i want one it's i </joey>
<joey> actually need one otherwise i think i'm </joey>
<garnt> gonna go insane no i've i've been trying </garnt>
<connor> to look for one as well but i want i </connor>
<connor> want an assistant who's in japan which </connor>
<connor> is very hard yeah otherwise i'd just </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] fly allen over or something </connor>

<joey> no </joey>
<garnt> me neither </garnt>
<connor> you don't have regrets i'm trying to </connor>
<garnt> think i just i just that question just </garnt>
<connor> came up from the top of my head not </connor>
<connor> going to </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> as we found out on the trash taster </connor>
<connor> stream </connor>
<connor> i actually regret not putting more time </connor>
<connor> into japanese because my japanese </connor>
<connor> studying has been like very spotty this </connor>
<connor> year i'd be like super into it and then </connor>
<connor> like something would happen and then </connor>
<connor> like i would take a day off and then </connor>
<connor> that would just like stack one to like </connor>
<connor> two days and three days and then </connor>
<connor> suddenly i'd find like a month had been </connor>
<connor> taken off of learning japanese and then </connor>
<connor> like the first </connor>
<connor> like the first few weeks of me getting </connor>
<connor> back into japanese is just like me </connor>
<connor> relearning the [ __ ] that i already knew </connor>
<connor> before right it's kind of like the gym </connor>
<connor> in that day right where in that way </connor>
<connor> where you make your gains and then you </connor>
<garnt> stop going and then when you go back to </garnt>
<garnt> the gym you got to like regain the gains </garnt>
<garnt> you already had yeah it just feels like </garnt>
<garnt> really demotivating it's like trying to </garnt>
<connor> push through it sucks i really wanna go </connor>
<connor> to the gym more </connor>
<garnt> but i'm just lazy </garnt>
<garnt> yeah are you are you just lazy or is it </garnt>
<garnt> just because you have </garnt>
<garnt> got so much going on in your life now </garnt>
<connor> that you just don't have the time </connor>
<connor> i mean if i really really really wanted </connor>
<connor> to go to the gym i could make time you </connor>
<connor> know what i mean like but but it's it's </connor>
<connor> not something that i enjoy as much as </connor>
<connor> other stuff but i really do want to go </connor>
<connor> more yeah also some days after i've like </connor>
<connor> after i've been and you know you're hurt </connor>
<connor> for the next day and </connor>
<connor> then the day after that i'm like i'm </connor>
<connor> like not not great feeling 100 but it's </connor>
<connor> the only time that week i have time but </connor>
<connor> i'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> maybe i'll go maybe i won't ah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's tough it's tough it's really </connor>
<connor> annoying i don't know my schedule is a </connor>
<connor> lot more unflexible now so </connor>
<connor> i think i have times to go it's just a </connor>
<connor> lot difficult a lot more difficult to to </connor>
<connor> get it in in the way i wanted it to yeah </connor>
<joey> because i think because you just have so </joey>
<connor> much more [ __ ] going on right so like </connor>
<connor> even if you are at the gym it's like oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you're just thinking of all the </connor>
<joey> stuff that you could be doing otherwise </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> it just feels better right i travel a </joey>
<connor> lot more for videos as well now so yeah </connor>
<garnt> that takes yeah it feels it feels weird </garnt>
<connor> that there was a point where the sea dog </connor>
<connor> channel was just you inside filming </connor>
<connor> videos yeah </connor>
<connor> video is not outside i'm just like kind </connor>
<connor> of slacking man kind of slacking what's </connor>
<garnt> going on </garnt>
<garnt> this is what i'm worried about because </garnt>
<connor> i'm like [ __ ] all right so let's say i </connor>
<connor> want to go back to the uk at some point </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] am i going to do on my </connor>
<connor> channel everyone's going to be like why </connor>
<connor> isn't he outside like what was there to </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] do in the uk </connor>
<connor> just try every pint in weather yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's not bad actually </connor>
<joey> i'd watch that try every meal deal at </joey>
<connor> tesco </connor>
<connor> i'd do that too </connor>
<connor> i've already tried them all but i'll </connor>
<connor> tell them yeah do it on video </connor>
<connor> i don't even know what i would do like </connor>
<connor> yeah i'd basically be like shitty tom </connor>
<connor> scott at that point </connor>
<connor> this is this is a house where they they </connor>
<connor> get water through a well it's really old </connor>
<connor> and stuff </connor>
<connor> that's like the uk we don't have </connor>
<connor> anything interesting </connor>
<connor> we only have like really old quirky </connor>
<connor> stuff in the uk we don't have anything </connor>
<connor> modern that's like [ __ ] insane </connor>
<garnt> yeah i guess that's why everyone travels </garnt>
<connor> outside </connor>
<connor> stuff right i legitimately don't know </connor>
<garnt> what i would do with my main channel </garnt>
<garnt> content if i ever move back to the uk </garnt>
<garnt> don't worry i don't have time uh plans </garnt>
<garnt> to it's not happening it's not happening </garnt>
<connor> anytime soon yeah just boys keep me </connor>
<joey> hostage uh </joey>
<connor> i don't know what i don't know i would </connor>
<joey> do i mean this check titled trash taste </joey>
<connor> keeps me hostage </connor>
<connor> yeah that's the thing that's weird </connor>
<connor> having like having a specific spot i </connor>
<connor> need to be in every week like a job and </connor>
<connor> when we have to take holidays now we </connor>
<connor> have to tell the boys and put in our </connor>
<connor> holiday time </connor>
<connor> to be like hey i'm going to be away for </connor>
<garnt> this week um so uh yeah i mean we could </garnt>
<connor> just put in the hours ahead of time </connor>
<connor> right yeah we could just like not have </connor>
<joey> trash taste some weeks but then also </joey>
<joey> it's like why why not we can easily just </joey>
<joey> make it every week yeah yeah exactly and </joey>
<connor> i i'm not a fan of like the whole uh not </connor>
<joey> uploading on holidays because i'm like i </joey>
<joey> only like some of my audience celebrates </joey>
<joey> said holidays so i i don't feel like </joey>
<joey> it's fair to just be like oh [ __ ] you </joey>
<connor> guys people who don't celebrate the same </connor>
<connor> holidays as me </connor>
<connor> i'm not giving you content i'm busy i </connor>
<connor> mean it's a valid excuse i think in some </connor>
<connor> ways when you're like you're busy but </connor>
<joey> you know i also like uploading and i i </joey>
<joey> like the trash taste uploads every every </joey>
<joey> every week no matter what yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> no matter how uh not what people are </joey>
<joey> doing it's like you can expect that </joey>
<joey> you're going to get a trash taste every </joey>
<joey> day it's kind of like comfort food </joey>
<joey> because i like that about channels i </joey>
<joey> watch that like no matter where i am </joey>
<joey> even because sometimes you know maybe </joey>
<connor> christmas i got some down time you know </connor>
<connor> for an hour or two i might watch a video </connor>
<connor> that's come out that i'm really excited </connor>
<garnt> for you know exactly i like it i like it </garnt>
<garnt> but the thing about christmas right it's </garnt>
<garnt> that okay so you have you have </garnt>
<garnt> you have the beginning right you wake up </garnt>
<garnt> early </garnt>
<garnt> with the family you open presents and </garnt>
<garnt> everyone opens their presents everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> all merry and happy </garnt>
<garnt> so what happens between like 11 o'clock </garnt>
<joey> to four o'clock food and alcohol </joey>
<joey> no food alcohol and check this [ __ ] out </joey>
<garnt> no because </garnt>
<garnt> food comes on at four right so what </garnt>
<joey> food comes out about well you don't you </joey>
<connor> don't have like a christmas lunch </connor>
<connor> i mean like </connor>
<joey> for christmas lunch whatever you want </joey>
<joey> what whatever you envision food a dinner </joey>
<garnt> to be dude i'm about to have like an </garnt>
<garnt> all-you-can-eat buffet for dinner you </garnt>
<garnt> bet you better know that i'm saving </garnt>
<garnt> space for that christmas dinner well no </garnt>
<joey> i have that buffet at lunch and then </joey>
<joey> don't have dinner i have both because </joey>
<connor> during dinner time i'm busy getting </connor>
<garnt> drunk no dinner dinner time christmas </garnt>
<garnt> dinner it's like it's like one of the </garnt>
<garnt> best meals we don't do that in australia </garnt>
<joey> what do you do in australia though in </joey>
<joey> australia we wake up we have we get the </joey>
<connor> you know open up all the presents or </connor>
<connor> whatever yeah uh and then you know by </connor>
<connor> that time it's right lunchtime yeah and </connor>
<connor> then all the family comes over you have </connor>
<connor> like you know kind of a late lunch maybe </connor>
<connor> like two three o'clock type of like big </connor>
<connor> big lunch </connor>
<joey> finish at like 5 p.m and then that's </joey>
<joey> when you get shit-faced with your family </joey>
<joey> and by the time dinner time rolls around </joey>
<joey> you're not hungry because you're still </joey>
<connor> full from the massive lunch i think i </connor>
<connor> have lunch and dinner christmas yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like a lunch industry yeah it's for </joey>
<connor> me it's like it's one big meal no it is </connor>
<joey> one big meal for me </joey>
<connor> how can your stomach handle yeah it's </connor>
<connor> christmas baby </connor>
<connor> that christmas spirit man like i i think </connor>
<connor> large is my stomach by four times like </connor>
<connor> the reason we don't have a christmas </connor>
<garnt> lunch or i've never heard of anyone </garnt>
<garnt> having a christmas lunch is because i'm </garnt>
<garnt> pretty sure during christmas dinner you </garnt>
<garnt> eat enough to like fill yourself up for </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] week well sometimes like you </connor>
<garnt> have friends who can't come to the </garnt>
<connor> dinner or something so i'll go i might </connor>
<garnt> go meet them for lunch or something </garnt>
<garnt> going out on christmas day yeah i'll go </garnt>
<connor> now blasphemy i'll like go to their </connor>
<joey> house </joey>
<joey> what you don't spend with your family no </joey>
<connor> no i'll spend the dinner with my family </connor>
<garnt> because maybe there's someone who i </garnt>
<garnt> don't spend all day with your family </garnt>
<connor> not all the time sometimes i do it </connor>
<connor> depends on like who i can see when and </connor>
<connor> when i can't you know some people they </connor>
<connor> have like they're having a christmas </connor>
<connor> thing and i'll go and say hi i'll turn </connor>
<connor> up and then i'll go back and spend the </connor>
<joey> evening okay so like last time i went </joey>
<joey> back to australia i did that like i i </joey>
<connor> spent like a christmas dinner with my my </connor>
<connor> friend at my friend's place like my uni </connor>
<connor> mate but i did that the day after the </connor>
<connor> actual christmas event as like a late </connor>
<connor> christmas kind of thing right right </connor>
<garnt> right but like on christmas day if i'm </garnt>
<joey> not at home with my family no then </joey>
<garnt> something's wrong if i'm if i'm not at </garnt>
<joey> home with the family or we're not going </joey>
<joey> to another one of our family's relatives </joey>
<connor> places yeah then there's there's some </connor>
<garnt> beef what's going on </garnt>
<joey> some of them are friends some of them </joey>
<connor> are family you know it's kind of a mix </connor>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> okay but like my justification for the </joey>
<joey> christmas lunch in australia is that you </joey>
<connor> have to understand that christmas day is </connor>
<connor> a very nice summer day </connor>
<connor> right so </connor>
<connor> going outside eating a massive thing by </connor>
<connor> a pool side is very normal in australia </connor>
<connor> yeah pass me the turkey i'm in the pool </connor>
<joey> right now yeah exactly so you don't have </joey>
<garnt> a roast no we do okay but outside </garnt>
<connor> it gets cooked with the sun because it's </connor>
<joey> so hot yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> we we pop off we just have a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> barbecue basically not even we just go </connor>
<connor> out onto the road and just pop a whole </connor>
<connor> chicken on the tarmac and then it just </connor>
<connor> cooks by itself </connor>
<connor> no but like it's it's like a usually </connor>
<connor> like you know mid like 34 35 degree like </connor>
<connor> nice summer day right and it's like </connor>
<connor> you're out on the balcony with your </connor>
<connor> family and you're having a you know a </connor>
<connor> nice roast or you know pork or whatever </connor>
<joey> it is that you eat yeah you know during </joey>
<joey> christmas and we have that during the </joey>
<joey> day because the sun's out and it feels </joey>
<joey> good you know that's that that's my </joey>
<joey> justification of why we have one meal at </joey>
<joey> like two o'clock </joey>
<joey> obviously if it was like that's so alien </joey>
<garnt> to me yeah obviously it feels like </garnt>
<garnt> winter time right yeah i'm not going to </garnt>
<joey> go out </joey>
<garnt> okay yeah i'm right okay okay so </garnt>
<garnt> so as as someone who obviously grew up </garnt>
<garnt> in australia celebrating christmas that </garnt>
<garnt> way yeah do you do you have like this </garnt>
<garnt> christmasy feeling like what what do you </garnt>
<garnt> have a christmassy feeling or do you </garnt>
<joey> have anything that gives you a </joey>
<joey> christmasy feeling yeah christmasy </joey>
<joey> feeling is when i'm having uh a beer at </joey>
<garnt> like 2 p.m in a pool </garnt>
<connor> that could be that's like any day for </connor>
<connor> australians joey like it's yeah </connor>
<joey> christmas </joey>
<joey> hell yeah </joey>
<joey> is it like weird watching christmas </joey>
<connor> movies </connor>
<joey> we don't watch christmas movies at all i </joey>
<garnt> don't know at least our family doesn't i </garnt>
<joey> mean australians do you have like a </joey>
<garnt> christmas spirit like uh like </garnt>
<joey> like they are like dead inside no no no </joey>
<connor> no no why are you sad joey tell us why </connor>
<garnt> you are sad because i remember because </garnt>
<garnt> uh when when i lived in thailand uh me </garnt>
<garnt> and sydney celebrated christmas there </garnt>
<garnt> for like two two or so years and every </garnt>
<garnt> every year she'd she tell me you know </garnt>
<garnt> what you know the trees up we got we got </garnt>
<connor> the christmas we got the christmas songs </connor>
<connor> on the roast is out but it just doesn't </connor>
<connor> feel like christmas she says as it is </connor>
<connor> like 35 degrees and like yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah you're outside no just listen </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't feel like it but it just just </garnt>
<connor> doesn't feel like christmas i mean you </connor>
<joey> know we put up a tree and everything and </joey>
<connor> you know we decorated it and put the </connor>
<connor> lights on it and stuff like that but </connor>

<connor> i i was the difficult one because i was </connor>
<connor> on the other side of the world but now </connor>
<connor> everyone's gonna be the difficult one </connor>
<connor> yeah so i hope hopefully i'll get to see </connor>
<garnt> because i didn't get to see my uh my </garnt>
<garnt> older brother when i went back to the uk </garnt>
<garnt> because he was busy doing stuff in </garnt>
<connor> scotland i think or something are you </connor>
<garnt> going back this year </garnt>

<garnt> not okay i don't want to deal with </garnt>
<garnt> travel again </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> i feel that i lost enough of my lifetime </garnt>
<garnt> once because you didn't go to america to </garnt>
<garnt> see sydney's family right yeah so i </garnt>
<connor> guess that's fair enough i i don't have </connor>
<connor> anything like that so i i saw my family </connor>
<joey> they got to see me i'll see you next </joey>
<joey> year </joey>
<connor> i'll probably go back at some point in </connor>
<connor> april or something and see them again </connor>
<joey> wait was it your parents that said that </joey>
<connor> they would probably never come to japan </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> why is that no no no no they they never </connor>
<joey> said that oh </joey>
<connor> well what why they want they want to get </connor>
<connor> super yeah well why not next time you </connor>
<connor> know when the country opens up they come </connor>
<connor> here oh yeah maybe that too because i </connor>
<joey> don't think they haven't come to japan </joey>
<joey> before either no no no my parents really </joey>
<connor> want to come to church yeah as well i </connor>
<joey> bought yeah my christmas present was </joey>
<joey> flights for them </joey>
<joey> like last year </joey>
<connor> do christmas presents roll over </connor>
<garnt> i'm like what oh yeah you haven't </garnt>
<connor> redeemed it yet so uh oh my oh man it's </connor>
<joey> sitting there waiting </joey>
<connor> yeah no they want to they really really </connor>
<joey> want to they've i've really sold them on </joey>
<connor> the idea when i first moved here they </connor>
<connor> weren't too hyped on it but yeah after </connor>
<connor> they've watched after i moved here they </connor>
<connor> kind of watched a lot more stuff about </connor>
<connor> it and they're really excited to go </connor>
<connor> which is great because i can't wait to </connor>
<garnt> see how utterly confused they are </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah i'm really excited for them </garnt>
<connor> to come over um </connor>
<connor> and yeah that'd be fun when the last </connor>
<garnt> time you did spend christmas with your </garnt>
<garnt> family then </garnt>
<connor> it must've been a while right uh the one </connor>
<connor> before japan so 2000 right 2019 i was in </connor>
<connor> japan right yes 2018 christmas then damn </connor>
<garnt> damn that's been a long time </garnt>
<joey> i guess so yeah that's three years right </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> uh yeah three yeah three years ago </connor>
<connor> because the first the first christmas i </connor>
<connor> just moved to japan in october and i was </connor>
<garnt> kind of settling in yeah so i was like i </garnt>
<connor> won't come back i'll come back next year </connor>
<connor> next christmas that didn't happen </connor>
<garnt> and then come out this christmas either </garnt>
<garnt> do you guys ever cook for christmas or </garnt>
<garnt> who does the cooking for christmas oh my </garnt>
<connor> dad my dad dad yeah because because like </connor>
<joey> it spent like 12 hours yeah the day </joey>
<garnt> before that's just like two days so like </garnt>
<garnt> what i've always wondered is when does </garnt>
<garnt> the torch get passed over right </garnt>
<connor> because when you have your own kid's gun </connor>
<joey> yeah because you have no choice </joey>
<joey> hopefully not for a while because i need </joey>

<connor> for the title also i don't know when in </connor>

<connor> event in the year right yeah </connor>
<connor> when you're like a teenager when you're </connor>
<connor> like a teenager you're just like why </connor>
<connor> would i need this thing this is just </connor>
<connor> taking up space right i hardly have any </connor>
<connor> space in my kitchen as it is but you </connor>
<connor> know now especially moving into my new </connor>
<connor> house i'm just like i remember going to </connor>
<connor> connor's house and i'm just like oh </connor>

<connor> this isn't daiso cutlery </connor>
<connor> i bought ikea's finest </connor>

<joey> when i helped uh aki last year for </joey>
<joey> thanksgiving and she she made like a </joey>
<connor> turkey </connor>
<joey> like a whole turkey thing because we </joey>
<connor> bought an oven finally and uh you know </connor>
<joey> the gratifying feeling of me going honey </joey>

<garnt> it was just like oh this is a special </garnt>
<garnt> day </garnt>
<joey> we never bring this thing out oh my god </joey>
<joey> oh it's a special event </joey>
<garnt> so i i am going to be like that i am i'm </garnt>

<garnt> you know because i've i've you know </garnt>
<garnt> slowly which what kind of tools like </garnt>
<garnt> like diy like you know like oh okay okay </garnt>
<joey> like hammers and like all that kind of </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] right because i still don't own a </garnt>
<joey> hammer yeah </joey>
<connor> not in japan wait what i don't own a </connor>
<joey> hammer hammers are quite useful yeah </joey>
<joey> they are quite useful a mallet maybe </joey>
<connor> like a rubber matter this is like pretty </connor>
<joey> good i have a rubber mallet yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but you need it </joey>
<joey> you never you never know you never know </joey>
<connor> but when you when you need it you're </connor>
<garnt> like thank god for [ __ ] yeah whenever </garnt>
<garnt> you needed one in japan like having to </garnt>
<connor> like knock some screws out of place or </connor>
<joey> something or nail nail some things down </joey>
<joey> to like prop maybe an artwork up or </joey>
<connor> something or you know whatever the ikea </connor>
<connor> table was being annoying with the screw </connor>
<joey> i needed a hammer to push it in making </joey>
<joey> like like tables and stuff like that you </joey>
<connor> just like kind of knock it in it's </connor>
<connor> coming a lot more i can't tell you every </connor>
<connor> use about for it but i remember i've had </connor>
<connor> multiple times i've been like thank god </connor>
<joey> i finally bought a hammer yeah now that </joey>
<joey> because like when we the our current </joey>
<connor> place that we're in because we have two </connor>
<connor> balconies right and like building those </connor>
<connor> balconies i was like oh i am missing </connor>
<garnt> like 90 of essential tools so i just </garnt>
<garnt> went out a day to like tokyo hands or </garnt>
<garnt> whatever and just like binged like blind </garnt>

<garnt> i just i just like splooshed on all </garnt>
<garnt> these tools it doesn't binge anime </garnt>
<garnt> anymore binges ninja's tools binges </garnt>
<garnt> hardware yeah </garnt>
<connor> and like not gonna lie that was probably </connor>
<connor> one of the most fun shopping experiences </connor>
<connor> i've had </connor>
<garnt> i sure do oh my god do you have a power </garnt>
<connor> wait what where can you use a power </connor>
<joey> drill in japan many places because like </joey>
<joey> because because after a while because </joey>
<joey> like especially when you're buying </joey>
<joey> furniture like when you first make so </joey>
<joey> when i was first building my my room i i </joey>
<connor> was like okay i have a much bigger room </connor>
<connor> now i'm just gonna replace all of like </connor>
<connor> the desks and like shelves and </connor>
<connor> everything with like much bigger nicer </connor>
<connor> places that fit the atmosphere right so </connor>
<connor> obviously when you buy stuff from like </connor>
<joey> ikea or amazon or whatever they don't </joey>
<joey> come in one piece you gotta [ __ ] diy </joey>
<garnt> that [ __ ] right yeah i've i've </garnt>
<garnt> definitely been feeling that for like </garnt>
<joey> the past </joey>
<joey> don't you hate it </joey>
<connor> twisting the [ __ ] screwdriver for 17 </connor>
<connor> hours in the week </connor>
<connor> and to the point where your wrists and </connor>
<connor> your thumb starts to get sore i do </connor>
<connor> regret not buying i guess yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> like furniture yeah i regret it so when </connor>
<connor> i bought like my new bookshelf i i still </connor>
<connor> had the screw right and i was like oh </connor>
<connor> good this bookshelf has 50 screws that i </connor>
<connor> have to screw in and they're hard as </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] as well by by the time i finish </joey>
<joey> like three hours later my hands were so </joey>
<joey> sore so i was like [ __ ] i'm buying a </joey>
<joey> power drill because though i had another </joey>
<joey> shelf coming in built that [ __ ] in like </joey>
<joey> 30 minutes because all i had to do was </joey>
<joey> go </joey>
<joey> and i was i was like </joey>
<garnt> technology is amazing it's incredible </garnt>
<connor> remember when ikea selling point was </connor>
<connor> like that you get to build your own </connor>
<connor> furniture and it's like all convenient </connor>
<connor> and stuff yeah and now i'm just like </connor>
<connor> i've ordered some furniture furniture of </connor>
<connor> amazon which doesn't need to be built </connor>
<garnt> and i'm just like this is a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> godsend </garnt>
<connor> they're ahead of the game man </connor>
<joey> some ikea products i'm i think you can </joey>
<joey> pay them to assemble in your house yeah </joey>
<joey> you can you can because sometimes ikea </joey>
<connor> furniture is actually like really good </connor>
<joey> yeah because they have some things that </joey>
<connor> you know ikea has great furniture it's </connor>
<joey> just you know like paying the ass to </joey>
<connor> make yeah like </connor>
<garnt> like especially moving into a new place </garnt>
<garnt> you know making making one or two things </garnt>
<garnt> that ain't too bad that's that's a fun </garnt>
<garnt> that's a fun afternoon when you're </garnt>
<garnt> making like 10 [ __ ] things in a day </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like </garnt>
<garnt> this thing just come pre-built and there </garnt>
<joey> are some like there are some ikea things </joey>
<joey> where like even the way that you have to </joey>
<joey> build it is like some kind of artistic </joey>
<joey> feat where it's like [ __ ] algebra one </joey>
<joey> to get like a [ __ ] piece in because </joey>
<joey> it just looks so weird on the </joey>
<connor> construction thing </connor>
<connor> my table kind of broke a little bit and </connor>
<joey> one of the screws is missing but i </joey>
<joey> should be fine </joey>
<garnt> yeah exactly it happens one of one of </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest things one of the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> things that annoys me is that i've now </garnt>
<garnt> that i've built so much furniture in the </garnt>
<garnt> past few weeks i i know what kind of </garnt>
<garnt> packaging is just like good and </garnt>
<garnt> optimized and what is awful right so </garnt>
<garnt> like i was building i was building a </garnt>
<connor> shelf yesterday and like every single </connor>
<connor> screw every single compartment every </connor>
<connor> single plank had like a number sticker </connor>
<connor> on it or like came in came in came in a </connor>
<connor> bag that was labeled as a certain number </connor>
<connor> yeah and that's great because you look </connor>
<connor> at the instruction manuals and you see </connor>
<connor> ah this number of screw goes into this </connor>
<connor> number plank yeah yeah i [ __ ] hate </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> the the furniture that gives you a bag </connor>
<connor> of screws and then you get the </connor>
<garnt> instruction manuals and it gives you </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 different kind of screws </garnt>
<garnt> it's so [ __ ] hard trying to </garnt>
<garnt> differentiate like a screw that's this </garnt>
<garnt> length and a screw that's this length on </garnt>
<garnt> the instruction manual and i just like </garnt>
<garnt> that could be one of ten screws which </garnt>
<joey> screw am i supposed to use no the one i </joey>
<joey> hate more than that is like when it </joey>
<joey> tells you like okay you have this many </joey>
<connor> screws right yeah you should have ten </connor>
<connor> screws and so i go to count and i'm like </connor>
<connor> why is there 11 screws </connor>
<connor> that's not the screw then i realized one </connor>
<connor> is just there for a spare right here but </connor>
<connor> they don't tell you it's a spare so you </connor>
<connor> just have to assume that one of them is </connor>
<connor> a spare so it's like okay because when </connor>
<joey> you finish building it and then you </joey>
<joey> realize and you look down and there's </joey>
<joey> like three screws left over you're like </joey>
<connor> yeah well i clearly [ __ ] up somewhere </connor>
<connor> some sometimes in japan they they give </connor>
<joey> you a pair of gloves with your furniture </joey>
<joey> yeah oh yeah yeah because for some </joey>
<joey> reason you need like they it's like to </joey>
<joey> not hurt your hands i guess when you </joey>
<joey> build it they give you like a pair of </joey>
<joey> white gloves it's really yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know it's cute yeah it's really cute i </joey>
<joey> never wear them because i'm like what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] would i wear gloves </joey>
<joey> i think but i actually i don't like they </joey>
<connor> give you these shitty screwdrivers and </connor>
<garnt> like allen keys oh yeah it's such a </garnt>
<garnt> waste yeah i buy like eight things and </garnt>
<connor> now i have eight [ __ ] screwdrivers that </connor>
<garnt> i have to get rid of i i have a cupboard </garnt>
<connor> of just the unused allen key yes </connor>
<garnt> like the shitty screwdrivers are less </garnt>
<garnt> common than the allen keys yeah well i i </garnt>
<garnt> bought my own set of allen keys yeah </garnt>
<garnt> same thing all like perfectly measured </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and they're great really good </garnt>
<connor> quality and it's so much better than </connor>
<connor> using these tiny ones where you like </connor>
<connor> destroy your palm trying to do that last </connor>
<connor> turn </connor>
<joey> they clearly don't understand the </joey>
<joey> concept of torque yeah </joey>
<connor> they're not like long enough </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah it's so easy just </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah and like the quality of for </garnt>
<garnt> some reason there are some furniture </garnt>
<garnt> that the quality of the screws it's just </garnt>
<connor> like all over the place [ __ ] there's </connor>
<connor> some that are just like perfectly </connor>
<connor> ingrained you can get yourself drivers </connor>
<connor> steel enhanced nails and then there are </connor>
<connor> some which i swear like pre-sheared so </connor>
<garnt> you so like you turn it it's like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a [ __ ] ice skate right it's </garnt>
<garnt> just slipping in and out and i'm just </garnt>
<connor> like how how am i supposed to get this </connor>
<connor> career the worst feeling is when you </connor>
<connor> like go for that like it's like it's </connor>
<joey> like this much of the screw is still out </joey>
<joey> and you turn it and you feel it sheer </joey>
<connor> yeah and you look at it and it's like </connor>
<joey> already sheared you're like </joey>
<joey> it makes like that horrible like </joey>
<connor> so </connor>
<garnt> you have to like fully like put your </garnt>
<garnt> full pressure on it yeah and not stop </garnt>
<connor> because if you let go it will shear it </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah you're like [ __ ] i gotta </connor>
<connor> give this in before before i [ __ ] the </connor>
<joey> shop </joey>
<joey> is everyone keeping up </joey>
<connor> you know what we're talking about right </connor>
<connor> just furniture things just middle-aged </connor>
<joey> guy things but yeah i've just noticed </joey>
<joey> that like since you know having the </joey>
<joey> balcony and having so many like new </joey>
<joey> things to build like that i i've really </joey>
<connor> enjoyed building furniture like on </connor>
<connor> ironically george llamas </connor>
<garnt> come to my house and build my furniture </garnt>
<joey> that's all i've been doing honestly dude </joey>
<joey> i'll happily do it it's actually so fun </joey>
<connor> i don't know it's it's like i bet he </connor>
<connor> won't if you actually were like joking </connor>
<garnt> around this time he says it's on camera </garnt>
<connor> camera turns off yeah yeah i'm busy i'm </connor>
<connor> busy that day </connor>
<connor> no honestly like you like buy me lunch </connor>
<joey> or something i'll do it all right okay </joey>
<connor> i'll like dead-ass help you out because </connor>
<connor> you ever like consider making your own </connor>
<garnt> financial like </garnt>
<garnt> pro going proper deals like buying the </garnt>
<connor> water yeah i have actually thought about </connor>
<connor> it but at the same time to make what i </connor>
<connor> don't know just something i don't know </connor>
<garnt> but like you know maybe like a table or </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] i don't know whatever but like </garnt>
<garnt> i have thought about it </garnt>
<connor> i have actually thought about it but </connor>
<connor> like yeah because i don't know like i i </connor>
<connor> took woodworking </connor>
<connor> uh like classes a little bit in like uni </connor>
<connor> yeah um because it was like a thing that </connor>
<connor> we had to do um but like i wasn't it's </connor>
<joey> weird because i i specifically remember </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] hated that course like i </joey>
<joey> really did not like doing like diy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah and it's not until </joey>
<joey> suddenly i've like moved and i've got </joey>
<joey> all this like i think you know what it </joey>
<joey> is it's not that i enjoy diy it's that i </joey>
<joey> like the feeling of getting new </joey>
<joey> furniture </joey>
<joey> so that that that just changed </joey>
<connor> drastically as a post </connor>
<joey> but it's like it's i think as well it's </joey>
<joey> like it's nice because i mean you guys </joey>
<connor> have seen </connor>
<connor> me in this like trance-like state when </connor>
<garnt> i'm building [ __ ] yeah where like i </garnt>
<connor> literally just turn on music yeah and i </connor>
<garnt> just am in my own world as i'm like </garnt>
<connor> making </connor>
<connor> furniture or like whatever it is like </connor>
<connor> when i'm making something it's like i </connor>
<joey> think i like that feeling because it's </joey>
<garnt> almost meditative to me no i i like the </garnt>
<garnt> feeling of buying furniture that's </garnt>
<connor> that's that's that's a good feeling </connor>
<connor> you're like i i knew i was eating on my </connor>
<garnt> furniture when it's done </garnt>
<garnt> like i knew i was old where you go </garnt>
<garnt> through the ikea catalog and you're just </garnt>
<garnt> like oh that that's a good that's a good </garnt>
<garnt> looking desk right there </garnt>
<connor> now you're gonna go there in person guys </connor>
<joey> gonna go to the ikea mega store you </joey>
<joey> gotta sit down you gotta feel the chat </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<garnt> buying furniture become fun dude [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> welcome to a dollhouse baby you know </connor>
<connor> what was the most annoying part of </connor>
<garnt> i bought that uh that ikea grass [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like generic grass that goes </garnt>
<garnt> on your yeah your uh </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the [ __ ] you want because i </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to have some grass so i could </garnt>
<garnt> like cause it feels nice yeah it's good </garnt>
<connor> feels good so i bought it turns out </connor>
<connor> though those ikea grasses like the one </connor>
<connor> thing that sucks about them is that like </connor>
<connor> you can't measure them </connor>
<connor> you can't like fit them in precisely </connor>
<connor> yeah all right like they either fit or </connor>
<connor> they don't yeah i can nearly have some </connor>
<connor> of your val patio covered or you won't </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> they're like squares they're like </connor>
<connor> they're like ah i think they're like </connor>
<joey> five by five i don't know oh you got the </joey>
<joey> you got the squared tiles yeah yeah oh i </joey>
<joey> got the ones because yeah i just got the </joey>
<joey> roll because my balcony is massive </joey>
<joey> because ikea does like square tiles of </joey>
<joey> fake grass yeah yeah yeah yeah and so i </joey>
<connor> didn't really consider how it would fit </connor>
<connor> but i roughly measured it i thought </connor>
<connor> hours </connor>
<garnt> yeah realized there i can't block the </garnt>
<garnt> the drain </garnt>
<connor> uh the water drain yeah otherwise no </connor>
<connor> water again obviously </connor>
<connor> so so then i was like okay well now i </connor>
<connor> either have like a big chunk of my patio </connor>
<connor> not covered and it looks weird yeah or i </connor>
<connor> have my drain cover which i can't do so </connor>
<garnt> why not cover it with like there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's because i know the tiles there's </garnt>
<garnt> like a wood tile which has holes in it </garnt>
<connor> can you just put that there i have some </connor>
<connor> wood towel on the other side okay well </connor>
<connor> what about if you get the square and you </connor>
<connor> cut a hole that perfect so here's the </connor>
<joey> drain and then you just pop it on top </joey>
<connor> because that's what i did at my place </connor>
<connor> okay so what i did it's not it's not </connor>
<connor> it's not it's not like um one big drain </connor>
<garnt> the drain's in the corner somewhere else </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like the thing that leads into </garnt>
<connor> the drain oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> stuff needs to be occurring in it yeah </connor>
<connor> so i was like okay [ __ ] i'll cut the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] in half yeah it's it's it's like </garnt>
<connor> rock-solid plastic oh </connor>
<garnt> know it is impossible to cut the shoe i </garnt>
<garnt> was like what tools did you use to cut </garnt>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> my willpower i literally like got this </connor>
<connor> piece of plastic </connor>
<connor> it's like this big right like this not </connor>
<connor> even a saw i literally just like spent </connor>
<connor> it together with my hands like this </connor>
<connor> right and then i just kept bending it </connor>
<connor> like that yeah and it weakened and then </connor>
<connor> i did it the other way but the other way </connor>
<connor> it's all plastic so it hurts your hands </connor>
<connor> to bend it because i'm [ __ ] bending </connor>
<connor> it so i bend it the other way and i just </connor>
<connor> kept doing this and it got loose enough </connor>
<connor> where i got some pliers and i was like </connor>
<connor> cutting the plastic along jesus christ </connor>
<connor> so goddamn long and then i had the </connor>
<connor> problem of okay because of how these </connor>
<joey> towers work there's only like there's </joey>
<joey> two sides like the one 90 corner right </joey>
<connor> 90 degree yeah this side and this side </connor>
<connor> are like the holes that you connect it </connor>
<connor> to and these sides have like the clips </connor>
<connor> that it clips into yeah so i have this </connor>
<connor> problem now where some of it clips in </connor>
<connor> well some of it doesn't so i'm like </connor>
<connor> don't step on that one people when </connor>
<connor> people go to the balcony because i'm </connor>
<connor> like uh yeah you're just all gonna like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] break and fall apart if you step </garnt>
<connor> by but it looks nice yeah we got it </connor>
<connor> perfect yeah it looks like i hurt my </connor>
<connor> hands and it took so goddamn long </connor>
<joey> that's why i like the roll variety </joey>
<joey> because it's it's designed to be cut but </joey>
<connor> but like i didn't have a big enough area </connor>
<joey> to warrant a whole roll yeah yeah it was </joey>
<garnt> a small area i just wanted grass i </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to see more green yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> because i i in my previous place i just </connor>
<connor> had like the wood things oh those are </connor>
<connor> the wood towels which look nice but also </connor>
<garnt> i just prefer the feel of fake even if </garnt>
<joey> it's fake </joey>
<connor> oh yeah it feels great yeah that's why i </connor>
<joey> got some parts wood just for to to have </joey>
<joey> that over there i was like oh </joey>
<joey> i got grass for where my feet go </joey>
<joey> there's something about with touching </joey>
<garnt> grass with your feet feels good </garnt>
<garnt> what can i say we touch grass yeah they </garnt>
<connor> touch grass every morning next time you </connor>
<connor> consider insulting me remember i have </connor>
<connor> grass and that i tell you whenever i see </connor>
<joey> even if it's fake wrong whenever i see a </joey>
<connor> comment that says touch grass i'm like </connor>
<joey> don't mind if i do it i go out to my </joey>
<connor> balcony </connor>
<joey> so much girl </joey>
<joey> do you wait do you have a garden in </joey>
<joey> australia when you were growing up did </joey>
<joey> you do a garden yeah my dad had a </joey>
<connor> massive garden oh yeah my smile my now </connor>
<connor> now that my dad's retired it's like all </connor>
<garnt> he does yeah yeah garden would you ever </garnt>
<connor> consider a garden </connor>
<connor> i know i want a garden i don't want to </connor>
<connor> look after said god that's the point </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> the idea of a garden is nice um because </connor>
<connor> we have a garden in our </connor>
<connor> english home as you know you've been </connor>
<connor> there um and there was a point in time </connor>
<connor> where my parents would just go to </connor>
<connor> thailand and there was a point in time </connor>
<connor> where i would work from home </connor>
<connor> at that house and then </connor>
<connor> in the months that they were away i was </connor>
<connor> just i noticed that the garden just </connor>
<joey> progressively looked like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and the grass would grow and that was </joey>
<joey> that at that point where i realized </joey>
<joey> oh someone's gonna take care of this </joey>
<joey> garden for it to look good </joey>
<garnt> i don't want to do that that's that's so </garnt>
<joey> much effort it's a big garbage plants </joey>
<joey> are alive </joey>
<connor> plants are living things </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> ever since you know ever since then i'm </connor>
<connor> just like the idea of a garden is nice </connor>
<garnt> but just i've seen a lot of people like </garnt>
<garnt> sydney's house has like a massive garden </garnt>
<garnt> and you can lose like half a day or </garnt>
<garnt> something just like taking care of it my </garnt>
<garnt> dad regularly spends multiple days </garnt>
<garnt> taking care of it multiple days i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like he loves it though it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> like his new child but it looks amazing </connor>
<connor> to be fair he does a really good job but </connor>
<joey> to me it's just like i i think i would </joey>
<joey> absolutely love it if i had the time to </joey>
<connor> take care we haven't got to that age yet </connor>
<joey> we can appreciate just being able to </joey>
<joey> like pull out the lawn </joey>
<connor> you know have your coffee or your beer </connor>
<joey> and just just go at it yes exactly just </joey>
<garnt> just grab a hose and just hose down is </garnt>
<connor> that a good thing i don't know like when </connor>
<garnt> you get older you'll probably enjoy </garnt>
<connor> those pleasures more yeah because </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember when i was a kid my </garnt>
<garnt> mom would be like go on go cut the grass </garnt>
<garnt> now it's it's your turn and i'm just </garnt>
<connor> like for [ __ ] they never made me do that </connor>
<garnt> did they have all the other choices oh </garnt>
<connor> they made me do that i [ __ ] hated it </connor>
<connor> because to me it was my dad's like he's </connor>
<connor> not i'm not letting him do it it's it's </connor>
<connor> my garden it's mine he's gonna [ __ ] it </connor>
<joey> up </joey>
<connor> my dad was like if you don't do it then </connor>
<connor> no dinner tonight and i was like okay </connor>
<connor> yes father </connor>
<connor> and i do it and i i i hated it i wanted </connor>
<joey> to do everything else </joey>
<joey> that's why i like the fake grass i'm </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i hated putting out the laundry that's </connor>
<garnt> what i hated i still hate putting on </garnt>
<connor> laundry well sydney does actually </connor>
<connor> certainly loves that [ __ ] but the way it </connor>
<connor> was in my house is that we had like just </connor>
<connor> a line and a big stick that props up the </connor>
<connor> line in the middle yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so it was always [ __ ] annoying </connor>
<connor> when it was windy doing this when i was </connor>
<connor> like like small as well and this pole is </connor>
<connor> massive so i hated doing it </connor>
<connor> press memories by the way i don't like </connor>
<connor> doing the laundry now that's because of </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<joey> childhood trauma they [ __ ] hate that </joey>
<connor> pole piece of [ __ ] they still use this </connor>
<connor> poll as well </connor>
<garnt> get a new poll get better i'll upgrade </garnt>
<garnt> your poll look at the new poll like i </garnt>
<garnt> remember i remember uh when i moved to </garnt>
<garnt> my new place and you know because one of </garnt>
<joey> the big thing about my new place that </joey>
<joey> we've added um </joey>
<joey> is a dishwasher which uh as you guys now </joey>
<joey> you guys have dishwashers now right </joey>
<joey> i sure do yeah completely changed my </joey>
<joey> life and my mum at the beginning my mom </joey>
<joey> was like my mum my entire life right has </joey>
<garnt> been like we don't need dishwasher our </garnt>
<garnt> family doesn't need dishwasher yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's just that's just what </garnt>
<garnt> that's just wasteful water that's just </garnt>
<garnt> like your water bill and your </garnt>
<connor> electricity to be always going to go the </connor>
<connor> moment i found out the dishwashers used </connor>
<connor> significantly less water i was like well </connor>
<garnt> that's my excuse for the rest of time </garnt>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<garnt> and ever since like i've moved into my </garnt>
<garnt> new place and like i've shown my mum the </garnt>
<garnt> dishwasher and just like how much less </garnt>
<garnt> effort it takes to you know wash dishes </garnt>
<connor> after you cook like a zoom call with </connor>
<connor> them like mom look </connor>
<connor> i press the go button </connor>
<garnt> she's like um </garnt>
<joey> i could be looking for a dishwasher for </joey>
<joey> christmas </joey>
<joey> conversion complete </joey>
<joey> i was like where where where was this my </joey>
<joey> entire life mom was i just your </joey>
<joey> dishwasher my your entire life and now </joey>
<joey> that i'm gone you you need an actual </joey>
<joey> dishwasher is that it is that it that's </joey>
<joey> pretty much i see how it is i see how it </joey>
<connor> is children are just cheap appliance </connor>
<connor> like conversions right this is like i </connor>
<connor> could spend a lot of money on uh you </connor>
<joey> know a lawn mower yeah or i could get my </joey>
<joey> son to do it with the shitty lawn mower </joey>
<garnt> honestly one when i have children you </garnt>
<connor> bet you're asking my children </connor>
<connor> you're describing why people had kids </connor>
<joey> like hundreds of years ago that's why </joey>
<connor> they had so many they're like well i </connor>
<connor> can't do it when you get married into a </connor>
<joey> house i was like all right how many </joey>
<joey> things do we need to do every day seven </joey>
<connor> all right prepare to have seven kids </connor>
<connor> paying for this i'm not paying for an </connor>
<joey> assistant i'm getting a kid </joey>
<connor> hiring a cleaner that's like privileged </connor>
<connor> rich people [ __ ] getting a kid </connor>
<joey> that's the real [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> that's a wife </joey>
<garnt> one thing sorry to go on a tangent i </garnt>
<garnt> just realized [ __ ] kids for a woman um </garnt>
<garnt> please don't please </garnt>
<garnt> not that kind don't play soundpoint </garnt>
<garnt> music </garnt>
<garnt> one thing that i hope </garnt>
<connor> i get less of next year </connor>
<connor> the only regret is that i haven't told </connor>
<connor> these [ __ ] nft companies that email </connor>
<connor> me every day to [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] off stop emailing me yeah we're not </connor>
<connor> making nft [ __ ] off yeah we all we all </connor>
<connor> get them and i just it's not just emails </connor>
<connor> it's tweets as well did you notice on </connor>
<connor> some of the tweets where </connor>
<connor> it's just like a bot that gets like </connor>
<garnt> retweeted it'll be like you can buy like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know how me tweeting about like </garnt>
<garnt> anime tvs or something has anything to </garnt>
<joey> do with [ __ ] nfts it's either it's </joey>
<joey> either this bot saying hey you can do </joey>
<joey> something with this nft or it's this one </joey>
<joey> guy who every tweet is consistently like </joey>
<connor> hey you should read this one i never i </connor>
<connor> never got visibly angry at an email </connor>
<connor> before but this one made me like i </connor>
<connor> shouted it was this one where it says </connor>
<garnt> business invitation from the most </garnt>
<garnt> anticipated nft game i've never wanted </garnt>
<garnt> to hear that string of words ever and </garnt>
<garnt> and the fact that i got that email maybe </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] is an nft game </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know i don't want it stop </garnt>
<connor> emailing me i hate this [ __ ] bro i i you </connor>
<connor> know if you if you're into it that's </connor>
<connor> fine i don't mind but why do they shove </connor>
<garnt> it down our throat because they won </garnt>
<joey> every call because it's next-gen dude </joey>
<joey> it's next-gen everyone needs to be </joey>
<garnt> up-to-date on that next-gen [ __ ] but no </garnt>
<garnt> because because what it feels like is </garnt>
<garnt> that this thing is this thing that i </garnt>
<joey> have like very little knowledge about </joey>
<garnt> it's just getting shoved down my throat </garnt>
<joey> right i understand it and i don't like </joey>
<joey> it i don't even understand and i hate </joey>
<connor> still hate it i just but it's because of </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] that they like the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> stuff they say on twitter it's like </connor>
<connor> mind-numbing </connor>
<connor> since nfts has become somewhat worse i </connor>
<connor> don't understand how twitter got worse </connor>
<connor> but like nfts made twitter so much more </connor>
<connor> annoying and then every goddamn youtuber </connor>
<connor> is like somehow using nfts for like </connor>
<connor> scams as well it's all they are so many </connor>
<joey> youtubers using nfs okay can you can you </joey>
<joey> explain to to me and perhaps audience </joey>
<joey> that doesn't know explain it like i'm </joey>
<joey> five </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] even is an nft so there's </joey>
<connor> there's a there's like a you're </connor>
<connor> basically buying the the proof that you </connor>
<connor> own a piece of artwork right but it's </connor>
<connor> digital right but it's a digital piece </connor>
<connor> of artwork so it's not a physical piece </connor>
<connor> but in the in the blockchain which is </connor>
<connor> kind of i don't i'm not going into that </connor>
<joey> yeah don't go into it explain the like </joey>
<connor> on five explaining </connor>
<connor> like in like proof to the world that </connor>
<connor> your ba but essentially you are paying </connor>
<connor> for the proof that you own something </connor>
<connor> okay right that's the most basic way i </connor>
<garnt> can explain it right so you get a token </garnt>
<garnt> that can't be replicated to say you own </garnt>
<joey> this thing right so it's like a </joey>
<joey> certificate of authenticity no that's </joey>
<garnt> exactly what it is right right that's </garnt>
<joey> that that's why </joey>
<joey> people are buying artwork digital </joey>
<joey> artwork for like ridiculous amounts of </joey>
<connor> money because yeah </connor>
<connor> in in a sense even though you can </connor>
<connor> right click and save as that </connor>
<connor> like like there there is a token yeah or </connor>
<connor> like a certificate that says you own the </connor>
<connor> original piece of the artwork </connor>
<garnt> even though even though it's like </garnt>
<connor> digital like that's dumb as [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> i have friends good friends who uh like </joey>
<connor> have made a lot of money from it and </connor>
<joey> yeah that's what they do and they </joey>
<connor> produce them themselves and they you </connor>
<connor> know it's all for them i don't mind them </connor>
<connor> doing it i'm not like you can't do it </connor>
<joey> it's like just this whole this whole </joey>
<joey> aspect of shoving it down everyone's </joey>
<joey> it's just the craze right because people </joey>
<joey> are trying to make money from it yeah so </joey>
<joey> so the only way to get money and make </joey>
<connor> money from a lot of the a lot of them </connor>
<connor> not all of them are scams but there are </connor>
<connor> a lot of scams as well there are so many </connor>
<connor> scams and there's like so many uh </connor>
<connor> scandals and stuff because there's no </connor>
<joey> regulation or anything so do people like </joey>
<joey> buy certain nfts and then resell them </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah okay so it's like an </connor>
<connor> investment so it's </connor>
<garnt> that's how that's how they freaking have </garnt>
<connor> a phrase </connor>
<joey> like there's been stuff like insider </joey>
<joey> trading where like websites that sell </joey>
<joey> nfts and showcase them they have like </joey>
<connor> things there was like one case where um </connor>
<connor> this thing where they basically promote </connor>
<connor> an nft every week and the guy one of the </connor>
<connor> like ceos or something knew which nft </connor>
<connor> was coming up so he would buy a bunch of </connor>
<connor> that that type of artwork and then when </connor>
<joey> it went up he would sell it and make a </joey>
<joey> ton of money but there's no laws against </joey>
<joey> it because it's not considered insider </joey>
<joey> trading because it's cryptocurrencies </joey>
<joey> yeah the cyberpunk so there's like this </joey>
<garnt> it's just the wild west right now and </garnt>
<garnt> for some people it's great they love </garnt>
<connor> that </connor>
<garnt> it's a place where because because </garnt>
<joey> there's no rules there's no regulation a </joey>
<joey> lot of people can get scammed a lot of </joey>
<joey> people can make a lot of money very very </joey>
<garnt> fast um and it's just kind of like a </garnt>
<garnt> toxic environment right that's really </garnt>
<connor> bad yeah it sounds like it's so many </connor>
<connor> scams and i hate the fact that youtubers </connor>
<garnt> have started promoting them and doing it </garnt>
<garnt> of course they have of course that is </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] awful oh i've released my nfg </joey>
<garnt> which is like a shame because i like </garnt>
<garnt> like i feel like the the idea and the </garnt>
<garnt> technology has like so much potential </garnt>
<garnt> and now it's just being used for like </garnt>
<garnt> really shitty things basically yeah and </garnt>
<joey> you know there's also the criticism that </joey>
<joey> it's terrible for the environment and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that and </joey>
<joey> uh what not how's it terrible for the </joey>
<joey> environment oh because the oh wow god so </joey>
<joey> do i have to go do my own research the </joey>
<joey> way that like though how the system </joey>
<joey> works it uses a [ __ ] ton of computing </joey>
<joey> power to </joey>
<joey> have the blockchain okay it's quite an </joey>
<joey> efficient all right yeah in general it </joey>
<connor> it wastes a lot of energy to run these </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] nonsense yeah basically like </garnt>
<garnt> some of these cryptocurrencies at the </garnt>
<garnt> moment </garnt>
<connor> have as much energy usage as some </connor>
<connor> countries to run right </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> genuinely it's insane like like the like </connor>
<garnt> the network that nfps run on which is </garnt>
<garnt> called ethereum i think uses as much </garnt>
<garnt> energy as like sweden or one of those </garnt>
<connor> countries you know i'm not like i'm not </connor>
<connor> like this boomer who's like </connor>
<connor> anti-progress and anti-technology i'm </connor>
<connor> all for like good technology but it just </connor>
<connor> feels like the way it's been going is so </connor>
<connor> such a [ __ ] mess well it's like it's </connor>
<garnt> just awful well because because it's </garnt>
<garnt> actually been shoved down my throat i </garnt>
<garnt> did actually do like my research and </garnt>
<garnt> reading into into this thing because </garnt>
<garnt> like if there's if there's this thing </garnt>
<connor> like i like to understand things and i </connor>
<connor> feel like the problem the problem now is </connor>
<connor> that it's just so [ __ ] new </connor>
<connor> that yeah nobody knows what the [ __ ] to </connor>
<connor> do yeah it's the wild west and i feel </connor>
<connor> like as </connor>
<connor> as like as the years progress and it </connor>
<connor> becomes more stable then this could </connor>
<connor> there is potential for this technology </connor>
<connor> to be used for something actual good </connor>
<connor> actually good and it will i i feel like </connor>
<garnt> it this technology will be more </garnt>
<garnt> sustainable in the future as well as </garnt>
<garnt> cryptocurrencies kind of figure out hey </garnt>
<garnt> let's let's build a system that doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> like burn the entire amazon rainforest </garnt>
<garnt> to get running right but i feel just </garnt>
<garnt> right now it is like i'm staying the </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] away from this oh yeah i'm not </connor>
<connor> touching it like the the knee </connor>
<connor> although that's the last thing they want </connor>
<connor> it does need some kind of regulation in </connor>
<connor> some sense to stop all these [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> scams and the reason why </connor>
<connor> i know how many scams there are is </connor>
<connor> because they always reach out to us to </connor>
<connor> ask us to promote them yeah there's so </connor>
<connor> many that ask us to promote them and </connor>
<connor> this is like this [ __ ] nonsense it'll </connor>
<connor> be like hey we're like a badger poop uh </connor>
<connor> nft uh we wanna and it's like [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> are you off forward to nfts being added </connor>
<connor> to your favorite video games </connor>
<connor> i like i i think if it gets to a point </connor>
<connor> where it's like it's not like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> burning the planet and it and it's chill </connor>
<connor> you know and and and </connor>
<connor> it's it's not so scummy because like </connor>
<garnt> like i i see this [ __ ] i'm just like the </garnt>
<garnt> cs go skin community is like salivating </garnt>
<joey> right now oh my god oh my god yeah nft </joey>
<connor> skins </connor>
<joey> came over but it'll probably get there </joey>
<joey> so yeah i can see it happening i can </joey>
<connor> easily see it happening if you're having </connor>
<joey> one of the kind of things i'm just like </joey>
<joey> so out of the loop with like that kind </joey>
<joey> of like honestly </joey>
<joey> like i feel like this is what my grandma </joey>
<joey> must have felt when vr was introduced </joey>
<connor> you know it's like where it's just like </connor>
<connor> i just can't </connor>
<connor> wrap my head around like i did ask like </connor>
<connor> i when you said ethereum like i was like </connor>
<connor> oh okay yeah i've heard of that because </connor>
<connor> when the first time i heard ethereum i </connor>
<joey> was like i'm pretty sure you can collect </joey>
<connor> that in starcraft right like </connor>
<joey> like that's what that's what it sounded </joey>
<connor> like to me and then i was like oh wait </connor>
<connor> no it's like a crypto thing okay never </connor>
<connor> mind i don't wanna </connor>
<joey> i feel very old right now i'm not bad </joey>
<joey> that's the only trend i hope changes or </joey>
<joey> dies down yeah yeah that's all i want i </joey>
<connor> don't care yeah </connor>
<garnt> i just i just i just want some actual </garnt>
<joey> cool applications that are not just </joey>
<joey> selling overly priced artwork which is </joey>
<joey> just the exact same [ __ ] artwork it's </joey>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> the amount of times i've seen that </joey>
<garnt> monkey nft like we're just different </garnt>
<garnt> skins i don't even know what that monkey </garnt>
<connor> nft is like oh well i've got the skin </connor>
<joey> boy he's wearing the pirate hat and it's </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] off i realize how stupid this </joey>
<joey> sounds </joey>
<joey> oh god at least if some guy spends </joey>
<joey> talking 200 on a monet he's got a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] monet but he's also i don't i </connor>
<joey> don't think he's good either but yeah at </joey>
<connor> least he's got the [ __ ] paintings </connor>
<joey> yeah exactly didn't burn down the </joey>
<joey> rainforest to get a [ __ ] token and it </joey>
<joey> was such a boomer i know i hate i hate </joey>
<garnt> all this stuff man it sucks i just yeah </garnt>
<garnt> scam suck too and yeah again i hope that </garnt>
<connor> it gets some kind of uh i hope that it </connor>
<garnt> regulates up its act yeah because it </garnt>
<garnt> stops being so [ __ ] yeah because like i </garnt>
<garnt> was reading about up about like the </garnt>
<garnt> possible applications nfts could have </garnt>
<garnt> and like you know you know you have a </garnt>
<garnt> non-fungible nft stands for non-fungible </garnt>
<garnt> token so of course right now it's been </garnt>
<garnt> used as a certificate to say you own </garnt>
<garnt> this stuff but it has like a lot more </garnt>
<garnt> applications above that you can think </garnt>
<connor> about hey sending over certification to </connor>
<connor> say hey this person let's say has a </connor>
<connor> driver's license or has like </connor>
<connor> has you know is certified has a master's </connor>
<connor> degree or something along those lines </connor>
<connor> where it's like one centralized unit </connor>
<connor> that anyone can check so we don't rely </connor>
<connor> on like some companies like </connor>
<connor> forging driver's license or </connor>
<joey> documentation or like having to go all </joey>
<joey> the way to like even thinking thinking </joey>
<connor> about house ownership or any kind of </connor>
<connor> ownership right yeah the amount of </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] paperwork or you know you think </joey>
<joey> think of think of how much it can </joey>
<joey> revolutionize japan if there was one </joey>
<joey> system that said this person owns this </joey>
<garnt> and this person owns that that's like </garnt>
<garnt> that's like that's got so much potential </garnt>
<garnt> to like like </garnt>
<garnt> like reduce the paperwork by tenfold </garnt>
<joey> yeah you got to give japan time they've </joey>
<garnt> just discovered databases so you know </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> china still uses the phone </connor>
<joey> yeah they've just discovered what excel </joey>
<garnt> is yeah like yeah maybe like 30 40 years </garnt>
<joey> time for that no i i think there is a </joey>
<garnt> lot of exciting things that it could be </garnt>
<garnt> useful yeah but right now it is that </garnt>
<joey> sounds cool yeah right like yeah that </joey>
<garnt> sounds like a real life use but you know </garnt>
<garnt> like i i remember like the only piece of </garnt>
<garnt> news i saw about nft is when it was </garnt>
<joey> first popping up was like the original </joey>
<joey> nyan cat gif got like sold as an nft for </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> some some stupid amount of money and i </joey>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<garnt> who what i want to know is who sold it </garnt>
<garnt> and how did they prove that they had </garnt>
<joey> ownership of it i think it might have </joey>
<joey> been the original creator </joey>
<joey> i don't know i don't even like the </joey>
<joey> original creator was like there's </joey>
<joey> actually a loophole for this we can't </joey>
<joey> actually like this concept is actually </joey>
<garnt> not applicable to what yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's that's the biggest leap </garnt>
<joey> so what we're saying is we can't </joey>
<joey> authenticate whether it's authentic or </joey>
<joey> not yeah that's what they said what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> yeah there's still a lot about this </garnt>
<garnt> place i don't understand so i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> gonna i'm gonna i'm only gonna comment </garnt>
<garnt> on things that i do know yeah yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> just want less </garnt>
<garnt> please less scams yeah so like for </garnt>
<garnt> example like a single ethereum </garnt>
<garnt> transaction consumes as much electricity </garnt>
<connor> as an average u.s u.s household uses in </connor>
<connor> a work week and has a carbon footprint </connor>
<connor> equivalent to 140 893 these are like for </connor>
<joey> example our visa credit card </joey>
<joey> transactions or 10 595 hours of watching </joey>
<connor> youtube </connor>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> that's like every nft transaction that's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] insane </connor>
<garnt> why yeah right now right now it is we </garnt>
<joey> truly live in a society </joey>
<connor> bro </connor>
<connor> bro </connor>
<connor> that's actually depressing that's so </connor>
