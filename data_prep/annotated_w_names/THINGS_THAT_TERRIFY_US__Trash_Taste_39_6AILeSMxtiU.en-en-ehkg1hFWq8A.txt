<garnt> - Man, I'm tired. </garnt>
<connor> - Gamers, gamers, gamers, you didn't even have class today </connor>
<connor> and you're like more dead than when you had class. </connor>
<connor> - You're doing the Skype? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What's wrong with you? </connor>
<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to this episode of "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> where I don't know what we're talking about today, </connor>
<connor> but I'm joined by the boys who also don't know </connor>
<garnt> what we're talking about today. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's good to have a normal episode. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we've had a few now where, God, </garnt>
<connor> I'm finding it hard to talk now, Jesus Christ, </connor>
<garnt> I need to like fire up my brain. </garnt>
<connor> - There're so many things that I wanted to talk about </connor>
<connor> like a week, two weeks ago, but I just couldn't </connor>
<connor> cause we had like themed episodes. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, okay, for example, I'm gonna just go </connor>
<garnt> right into the topics. </garnt>
<connor> - Sure. - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> I've had a few topics that I wanna talk about as well, </connor>
<connor> but we can just quick fire through every topic </connor>
<garnt> that we wanted to talk about. </garnt>
<connor> - Go for it. </connor>
<connor> - About three weeks ago, I was scrolling </connor>
<connor> on the YouTube.com app at like midnight, pretty late, </connor>
<garnt> I was getting ready for bed. </garnt>
<garnt> Some reason, this genre of video </garnt>
<garnt> is starting getting recommended to me, </garnt>
<garnt> which was about like dangerous caves. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Have you ever seen these videos? </joey>
<joey> - No. - Maybe I have. </joey>
<garnt> - Basically, it's just about caves that people go, </garnt>
<connor> I think it's literally called caving, </connor>
<connor> where they go and explore caves. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it like uncharted and unexplored caves or is it like- </garnt>
<connor> - There's sometimes uncharted ones, sometimes explored ones. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was just one of those things where I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I do not understand why people do this. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I could not fathom it. </garnt>
<garnt> So there was this one video, I can't remember </garnt>
<connor> what it was called, it was talking about a cave in the UK </connor>
<garnt> and this cave had a section in it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where the person has to crawl through the cave </garnt>
<joey> on there, like you cannot turn around, right? </joey>
<joey> So you are crawling like this, right? </joey>
<joey> For like a mile. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, I feel like I've seen that </joey>
<joey> and it's like just wide enough </joey>
<joey> to fit a single person, right? </joey>
<connor> - One person go in it and you can't turn around </connor>
<connor> until you get to the end of the part or the middle section, </connor>
<connor> where there's a part where you can stand up and turn around. </connor>
<connor> And it was like very-- - That sounds horrible. </connor>
<connor> - I could, to myself, I'm like, yo wow! </connor>
<joey> - That is a claustrophobe's worst nightmare. </joey>
<garnt> - I watch some of these videos and I get anxiety </garnt>
<joey> just from like, not even watching it, </joey>
<joey> but just from the idea, thinking about it </joey>
<joey> and some people do this with uncharted caves as well, </joey>
<garnt> which to me just blows my fucking mind </garnt>
<garnt> and I get, if we don't do it, </garnt>
<garnt> somebody is gonna have to be crazy enough to do it. </garnt>
<joey> - Like who dead ass looks at like a hole </joey>
<joey> but just goes on forever and is like, </joey>
<connor> "I'ma crawl through that." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so it's horrifying </connor>
<connor> cause there was like the thing about this video </connor>
<connor> and the cave is blocked off now, so you can't get into it. </connor>
<connor> Like you still can in different ways apparently, </connor>
<connor> but what ended up happening was there was a flood </connor>
<connor> while four people were inside the cave and yeah, </connor>
<connor> they obviously drowned </connor>
<connor> cause they were stuck in the part where you were crawling. </connor>
<joey> - This reminds me of that scene from "Japan Sinks." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's so horrible and I was like, I have seen, </connor>
<connor> I've watched documentaries about horrible stuff, </connor>
<connor> you watch some videos about horrible stuff, </connor>
<connor> like all kind of horrible stuff </connor>
<connor> and nothing got my anxiety going like this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it was just awful, I was like, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And yeah, there's YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> who their whole channel is that they just explore caves </connor>
<connor> that have never been explored. </connor>
<connor> Which is like simultaneously the coolest thing, </connor>
<connor> but also why the fuck would you, </connor>
<connor> why don't you just like review stuff? </connor>
<joey> I don't know, why don't you like react? </joey>
<connor> - You could've made your YouTube channel </connor>
<connor> around anything else. </connor>
<connor> - It's so cool though cause like you sit there </connor>
<connor> and there's someone was asking one of these YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> "Like why do you do it, why are you climbing caves?" </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, cause it's like the only place on Earth </connor>
<connor> where like no one can communicate to you </connor>
<connor> and no one knows anything about </connor>
<connor> and it's a secret to discover" </connor>
<connor> and then that way, I kind of-- </connor>
<connor> - Go to space. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Go to space, I don't know about that, Joey. </connor>
<connor> Oh yes, I'll get on my rocket ship, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - I feel it's a lot cooler. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe, but there was this one video </joey>
<connor> about this cave in, I think it was Utah. </connor>
<connor> It's called like the Nutty Putty Cave </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] All right. </connor>
<connor> - And that's because apparently, the soil is of a texture- </connor>
<garnt> - Nutty Putty. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was Nutty Putty. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so apparently, the cave was like putty. </joey>
<joey> - That just sounds like a euphemism. </joey>
<joey> - And there's like, so let me paint a picture of this cave. </joey>
<connor> So it's basically, this cave is essentially just one cave </connor>
<connor> that just goes down, deep </connor>
<connor> and it was a pretty well-explored cave, </connor>
<connor> so most of this cave was all really, </connor>
<connor> like really well-documented and mapped out. </connor>
<connor> So it wasn't a cave for like super, super experts, </connor>
<connor> it was like, oh, if you'd like caving, go in there, </connor>
<connor> it's fine and there's two paths points in this cave. </connor>
<connor> One were you supposed to go down </connor>
<connor> and one that is too thin to go down. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] All right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And the other part is called like the birth canal </connor>
<connor> in this cave, it's so tight, right? </connor>
<connor> That you have to grab, once you get your hands </connor>
<connor> through this cave, you have to pull yourself vertically down </connor>
<connor> cause it's too tight, so you have to pull yourself. </connor>
<connor> So what happened was, right? </connor>
<connor> The reason why this cave is now closed and why it's famous </connor>
<connor> is that there was a story where this guy </connor>
<connor> went down the wrong way and he thought, </connor>
<connor> because he it was getting really tight, </connor>
<connor> that, "Oh, I'm in the right point </connor>
<connor> "cause this is the birth canal, as it's called." </connor>
<connor> - Right. - All right. </connor>
<connor> - So instead of thinking, ah, maybe I should like stop, </connor>
<connor> wait for my mate, he's like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, I should keep going." </connor>
<garnt> So he keeps going down a point that's too small </garnt>
<garnt> and just get stuck headfirst down a cave. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we're talking like proper like tight, the whole thing </garnt>
<garnt> and it's really brutal, cause this guy's stuck there </garnt>
<garnt> for 12 hours and there's like tons of rescue attempts </garnt>
<connor> from like people and eventually just dies cause obviously, </connor>
<connor> he's upside down for 12 hours </connor>
<connor> and it's just horrible hearing this and also, </connor>
<connor> could you imagine being a rescue worker? </connor>
<connor> Like having to get someone out of a cave? </connor>
<garnt> - I felt like being a rescue worker in that sense, </garnt>
<garnt> you're as likely to die rescuing the person-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - At one point, one of the rescue worker get stuck with him </garnt>
<connor> because he tries to go down the same way just </connor>
<connor> to pull him out and gets stuck, but luckily, </connor>
<connor> they get the rescue worker out, </connor>
<connor> but then I was thinking like, is this just a bunch of people </connor>
<joey> who are rescue workers? </joey>
<connor> Who are trained in like cave rescue? </connor>
<connor> Cause that seems like harder than the actual caving. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like you already have to be good </joey>
<connor> at exploring a cave, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, how can you even be properly trained </garnt>
<garnt> for an environment like this? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, because surely, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like that's such a specialized job. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Cause you have to set up a bunch of winches in a cave </connor>
<connor> that's not set up for any kind of-- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, also, like what life choices make you decide, yeah, </joey>
<joey> you know what? </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna do something that's even more dangerous </joey>
<joey> than cave diving </joey>
<joey> and that's helping people who get stuck cave diving. </joey>
<garnt> - At least people who skydive or do risky stuff like that, </garnt>
<joey> at least you get a quick death if you fuck up, </joey>
<connor> but with like caving-- </connor>
<connor> - That's the part that fucked me up, </connor>
<connor> is that if you're stuck, you're stuck. </connor>
<connor> - It's a slow death. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just a slow death and you're in a tight space. </garnt>
<connor> Ooh, I'm getting anxiety just talking about this. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not even claustrophobic and that makes me-- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was like exploring caves, </garnt>
<connor> that sounds kind of cool, I'm down for that. </connor>
<joey> Exploring caves where, I once I go in, I can't turn around, </joey>
<connor> that scares the shit out of me. </connor>
<connor> That sounds terrifying. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna turn, I wanna be like fuck, go back. </connor>
<connor> Because if also, more often than not, </connor>
<connor> it's recommended obviously not to go alone. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What happens if the guy in front of you starts panicking? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And you're the one behind him. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause there's nothing you can do. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - You're like, </connor>
<connor> cause then you're gonna start panicking cause you're like, </connor>
<connor> fuck, I'm stuck, the guy in front of me is stuck </connor>
<connor> cause he's freaking out, should I be freaking out? </connor>
<connor> He told me this was a good idea, fuck! </connor>
<garnt> - Like in the horror movies where you're in a group, </garnt>
<joey> there's a group and then someone says, "Oh, let's split up, </joey>
<joey> "that's the smart thing to do" and you think, </joey>
<joey> who in real life would actually do that? </joey>
<joey> And I feel like these are the people </joey>
<joey> who are just like making the decisions </joey>
<joey> where you're just questioning, </joey>
<garnt> why the are you making this decision right now? </garnt>
<joey> This seems like a really stupid decision. </joey>
<joey> - That's why I hate most like modern horror movies </joey>
<joey> because they always throw in that trope, </joey>
<joey> as if people watching this in the cinemas are like, </joey>
<joey> "Finally, someone made a good choice </joey>
<joey> "in a horror movie, to split up." </joey>
<connor> - Also, another scary thing about being stuck underground, </connor>
<joey> no signal, so you can't call for help. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, fuck! </joey>
<joey> - The only reason in that Nutty Putty thing </joey>
<joey> is why someone got help because his brother was with him </joey>
<connor> and was like, "Oh, he's stuck" and went up to get help. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But that's brutal, imagine watching </connor>
<garnt> just your family member just die. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just slowly die. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's horrible, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I can't fucking imagine it. </connor>
<joey> - Sorry to start this podcast on a morbid note. </joey>
<garnt> - And to top it off, </garnt>
<connor> it's not even like a cool sounding place </connor>
<connor> to die either, it's like-- </connor>
<joey> - Is that cool? </joey>
<joey> What are you like, bro, at least die cool bro, </joey>
<garnt> what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - My brother got stuck in a cave. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I know, </joey>
<joey> it's like there's like a difference between like, </joey>
<joey> Oh yeah, my friend got stranded in death valley and died </joey>
<connor> versus my brother got stuck in the Nutty Putty and died. </connor>
<joey> It's like, it's a little unfortunate. </joey>
<joey> - This sad as well, cause in the part of the story as well, </joey>
<connor> it's like he just had like two newborn kids or something. </connor>
<connor> - Ooh! - Ooh! </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, why? </connor>
<connor> It's like the video starts. </connor>
<connor> He had a kid, he decided to celebrate by going caving </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, no, why? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, It's funny cause I've been recommended </garnt>
<garnt> like I would say not like a similar genre of YouTube videos, </garnt>
<connor> but just like in the opposite sense, which is just YouTube </connor>
<connor> was who just climbed really high places. </connor>
<connor> - Oh! - Oh, the over climbers. </connor>
<connor> - And to like-- </connor>
<joey> - I kind of get that, I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - I don't. </joey>
<joey> - I don't like similarly how watching these cave divers, </joey>
<joey> you get like a claustrophobic. </joey>
<joey> I get vertigo watching these people </joey>
<garnt> just climb really high places. </garnt>
<joey> - I also have a fear of heights, so just watching it. </joey>
<connor> - I guess I can understand Max I'm like, all right. </connor>
<joey> One, normally climbing is like </joey>
<joey> arguably climbing a tall skyscrapers, </joey>
<connor> probably safer than going down a cave that's unexplored. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's a difference </connor>
<garnt> between the feeling of being trapped </garnt>
<joey> and just falling from a very high place. </joey>
<joey> I can see why you get that sense of freedom </joey>
<connor> which is exactly the opposite of what you're getting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I can understand that. </connor>
<garnt> We get the view and it's pretty cool, </garnt>
<connor> I kind of get it even though I know it's in the same. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And normally, I'm not going to lie either way, </joey>
<garnt> fin apostle-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, because like I go recommend this video </garnt>
<garnt> and the title of this video was, </garnt>
<garnt> "Reflecting On The Day I Almost Died" </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> oh man, this is getting a bit too real here </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just this guy who is climbing up </garnt>
<garnt> this really tall building in Hong Kong, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like this POV shot and it's just </garnt>
<joey> him doing commentary over it. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] All right. - And so he climbs up </garnt>
<joey> this really tall building </joey>
<garnt> in the middle of a, like from kind of like dawn. </garnt>
<garnt> So before the sun rises and by the time he gets to the top </garnt>
<joey> the sun starts rising </joey>
<garnt> and so you have this really tall skyscraper </garnt>
<joey> and on top of this skyscraper, </joey>
<garnt> there's just like this really rickety scaffolding </garnt>
<connor> that goes like off like another mile or something. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And so he starts climbing up this when it's like dark </connor>
<connor> and then by the time he gets to the top, the sun has risen </connor>
<connor> and he can see the view and then it starts raining </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. </connor>
<connor> - And he's up there by himself and in the commentary, </connor>
<connor> he says that, "I had two choices, </connor>
<connor> "either I could wait up there, wait out the rain </connor>
<connor> "and just kind of risk. </connor>
<connor> "Someone would see me and getting a rescue attempt </connor>
<connor> "and I'd probably get arrested </connor>
<connor> "or I could just attempt to climb down </connor>
<connor> "even though I would be more likely to slip off and die." </connor>
<connor> So of course-- </connor>
<connor> - I'd climb down. </connor>
<connor> - He decides to climb down. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Like getting arrested and being rescued. </garnt>
<joey> - This is literally the horror movie split up </joey>
<garnt> or stay together. </garnt>
<joey> - No, that's what I'm saying, right? </joey>
<joey> These people make the decisions </joey>
<garnt> to do what we see as like the dammer decision. </garnt>
<connor> - But I feel like if you're the type of person </connor>
<connor> who's gonna climb a skyscraper, </connor>
<joey> you're gonna be the type of guy </joey>
<joey> who climbs down a skyscraper. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I guess in his head he was like either way </joey>
<joey> I have to climb down, so I might as well just do it now. </joey>
<connor> - I think there also is a fair amount of people </connor>
<garnt> who would rather die than be arrested. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe, probably. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe. </connor>
<connor> - No, I genuinely believe </connor>
<connor> there's a sacks of people like that. </connor>
<joey> I don't want a criminal record so bad, I'd rather not exist. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna die here it before I turn to all of you. </joey>
<connor> - I think there's people </connor>
<connor> who would rather take that risk, honestly. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, probably. </connor>
<connor> - Cause there's some countries, </connor>
<connor> especially where you get that shit, oh your life's ruined. </connor>
<connor> - True, true. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - America. </garnt>
<garnt> America they don't, </garnt>
<connor> I mean, most of most developed countries, bigs up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like it's, I mean, I find it interesting </garnt>
<garnt> to watch people go through this stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, I mean, I could never do it myself. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the most I would wanna do is skydive </garnt>
<garnt> and maybe bungee jump, </garnt>
<garnt> but the more I hear about bungee jumping, </garnt>
<garnt> the less I wanna go through it. </garnt>
<joey> - For me bungee jumping is a hard pass. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I think it's bungee jumping, </connor>
<garnt> it very much depends on where you're doing it </garnt>
<connor> and what company you're doing it with </connor>
<connor> or is it some dude and his mate with a truck and bungee. </connor>
<connor> - Are you in a country with health and safety regulations? </connor>
<garnt> That's the biggest thing I think about. </garnt>
<connor> - I hear people would like doing it </connor>
<connor> in like places where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I don't think you be bungee jumping there. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen and heard more bungee jumping accidents happen </joey>
<joey> than skydiving accidents, </joey>
<joey> so just like weighing out the ratio, </joey>
<joey> I find that skydiving might be slightly better. </joey>
<connor> - More so bungee jump over like water more often than not </connor>
<garnt> and you don't wanna slap that water. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. - No, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And bye-bye skin. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Water fucking hurts when you slap it at that stage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - That's speed, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it hurts when you're like belly float </joey>
<joey> from like two meters up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Let alone like 30 meters. </joey>
<connor> - I do wonder, I'm like what causes, </connor>
<connor> like what happens in your, </connor>
<connor> are you born wanting to do extremes like explore caves </connor>
<connor> or go to extreme heights? </connor>
<connor> Is that like something you're born with? </connor>
<connor> Or is that something you like? </connor>
<joey> - It has to be something you're born with? </joey>
<connor> All right? - Or is that something </connor>
<connor> that like over your life, </connor>
<connor> something happens when you're a kid and it just. </connor>
<joey> - No, because like I feel that from a young age, </joey>
<joey> there's always like the kids who are going to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I'm gonna climb this really tall tree. </joey>
<connor> "Watch me do it." - I was like that as a kid. </connor>
<joey> I would climb anything and then I don't know what, </joey>
<connor> I think maybe the first time you fall over badly </connor>
<connor> and you're like, fuck, this shit actually hurts if you fall. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's a difference between </connor>
<joey> when you fall off that tree and you hurt yourself, </joey>
<connor> it's the difference between, </connor>
<joey> fuck, I'm never doing that again or fuck, that was worth it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, can you pinpoint the moment </connor>
<connor> at any point in your life where you've like, </connor>
<connor> you know exactly where your fear came from for something. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, your B, right? </garnt>
<connor> - My B one. </connor>
<garnt> I still have that memory to this day. </garnt>
<joey> - For me, well, I'm afraid of heights, </joey>
<connor> but like not to bad, like it depends on-- </connor>
<connor> - I think like this, </connor>
<joey> there was a little experiment on kids, right? </joey>
<joey> There're some kids are born, like people are born </joey>
<connor> with naturally a fear of heights. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right, but I feel that my fear of heights </joey>
<joey> came from the fact that at my parents' place, </joey>
<connor> we have this kind of spiral staircase that goes down. </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit, did you fall? - And I fell down that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. - Oh no. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah and luckily I didn't like break any bones </connor>
<connor> or like hurt myself that badly, </connor>
<connor> but I think I was only maybe like two or three years old </connor>
<connor> when I did and it's the earliest memory I have </connor>
<connor> of me just falling down and I'm pretty sure </connor>
<joey> that caused a slight, </joey>
<joey> maybe like fear of heights or something. </joey>
<connor> - Doesn't it scare you that like little things </connor>
<connor> happen to you as a kid could just like, fuck you up? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It makes me scared to have kids, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> whoa, what if I like accidentally give him </connor>
<connor> like too much broccoli? </connor>
<connor> And he won't have chicken and broccoli ever again. </connor>
<connor> Man, like I traumatized him, right? </connor>
<connor> How do I know what's gonna traumatize the kid? </connor>
<joey> - Hold on, that's the first thing you come up with. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Getting traumatized with chicken and broccoli. </connor>
<connor> - If my kid, right? </connor>
<connor> Doesn't eat the fucking cross, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna be sitting down the table </joey>
<joey> with like the bottle of whiskey being like, </joey>
<joey> why do they all go wrong? </joey>
<joey> - Where's the fuck go that one? </joey>
<joey> - I used to be really claustrophobic. </joey>
<connor> I don't really get that anymore, </connor>
<connor> but I used to be really much the kid. </connor>
<connor> I know exactly why and it took me like years </connor>
<connor> to realize like, oh, that probably was traumatizing. </connor>
<connor> So one time our parents were out </connor>
<connor> and it was me and my brothers messing around </connor>
<connor> and we though, bro, that's just a suitcase. </connor>
<connor> We can do so much fun stuff with a suitcase for some reason. </connor>
<connor> So for some reason I think me and my brothers </connor>
<connor> decided we're gonna take turns locking each other </connor>
<joey> in the suitcase, right? </joey>
<joey> So, I don't know why we decided to do this, </joey>
<joey> again we were like fall four or five, </joey>
<joey> I forgot how old we were. </joey>
<joey> So I got locked in the suitcase, bear in mind, </joey>
<joey> for some reason I thought I should eat my Coco Puffs </joey>
<joey> in the suitcase. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt giggling) </joey>
<joey> So I was in the suitcase just eating Cocoa Puffs, right? </joey>
<garnt> My brothers-- </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the point of this. </garnt>
<garnt> What what'd you get out of this? </garnt>
<garnt> - I legitimately don't know why we did this. </garnt>
<joey> I just have this memory and then they started-- </joey>
<joey> - It's just a kid thing to do, right? </joey>
<joey> - And then my older brother thought it'd be funny </joey>
<joey> to start flipping the suitcase with Cocoa Puffs </joey>
<joey> and then that was where I drew the line, </joey>
<joey> I was like, get me out, get me out of here </joey>
<connor> that he wouldn't let me out for like 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> and I was like-- </connor>
<joey> - I feel as well with that kind of like childhood trauma, </joey>
<joey> it really depends on like what your siblings did to you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I'm very glad that I had siblings </connor>
<connor> cause I feel like man, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I learned a lot of valuable lessons. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's because me and my sister </joey>
<joey> we kind of like think the same way in a lot of things, </joey>
<joey> so like we wouldn't do something to the other person </joey>
<joey> that we would hate to do. </joey>
<garnt> - See this is is if you have-- </garnt>
<connor> - Only child, whoa! </connor>
<connor> - When you have like three brothers, like I said man, </connor>
<joey> it's like fucking "Wrestle Mania." </joey>
<joey> It's like we would like genuinely have like full </joey>
<garnt> fist fights, we'd like punch each other in the face, </garnt>
<garnt> all that stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I hear brothers would like Sydney and Russell </garnt>
<garnt> had a similar thing where like, </garnt>
<connor> apparently they would just like punch the out of each other </connor>
<connor> and that's just like sibling love, I guess </connor>
<garnt> - But we didn't do it often, </garnt>
<connor> but if like if stuff got really like bad, </connor>
<connor> like we had a really bad argument, </connor>
<connor> like we pretty end up fighting. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt giggling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, going back to, with a fear thing, </garnt>
<garnt> do you know what fear like fascinates me? </garnt>
<connor> I forgot what the name is, like Tyraphobia or something. </connor>
<connor> - I had that. - The one with like the holes. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Trypophobia? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Trypophobia. </connor>
<connor> The one where you like see like a lot of small holes-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that one makes me feel disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - Cause like I didn't have a fear of this </connor>
<joey> and I think that literally was a fear that got garnered </joey>
<joey> because of the internet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because we had like the lily pond plants in Thailand </joey>
<joey> and I grew up with them, so the little seeds. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </joey>
<joey> - So I was used to seeing this site everywhere. </joey>
<joey> So I had no fear of it </joey>
<joey> and then watching enough fucking YouTube videos about it, </joey>
<garnt> about this fear, I slowly gained it over time </garnt>
<garnt> because I just saw these different like fucking-- </garnt>
<joey> - Disgusting, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Disgusting Photoshop edits. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me it wasn't even like a YouTube video. </garnt>
<connor> It was literally just typing Trypophobia onto Google images </connor>
<connor> and just the first thing you see </connor>
<connor> is just this row and row. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, don't fucking show any pictures. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't show it, don't show it in the video, </garnt>
<connor> but you guys if you want to </connor>
<joey> then go for it, I'm warning you though. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking gross. </joey>
<connor> - I'm kind of glad that I had that though </connor>
<connor> cause that made me like understand. </connor>
<connor> Cause when I was growing up, I didn't really have, again, </connor>
<connor> even though I was claustrophobic, I'm not really anymore, </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit now. </connor>
<connor> Like I feel that that helped me understand </connor>
<connor> when people have fears that don't make sense. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because before that I didn't really get it. </connor>
<connor> Like if someone was scared of like falling, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh it's just a fall and you'll be fine. </connor>
<connor> That's a little bit of height, it's safe, </connor>
<connor> but now I get it, cause from that, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> this makes no sense why a bunch of little circles </connor>
<connor> make me feel gross, but now I get it. </connor>
<joey> - My fear of heights is really weird </joey>
<joey> because it's only like certain levels of heights </joey>
<joey> that get me queasy. </joey>
<connor> - Cause like if you go up to like the Tokyo Tower. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </joey>
<joey> - There's parts of it where the floor is made out of glass. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </joey>
<connor> - So you can see that. - I'm totally okay with that, </connor>
<connor> but you take me onto the balcony of like a 10 story building </connor>
<connor> and make me look down, that fucks me up. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, I think it's because it might be because </garnt>
<connor> like say with like Tokyo Tower, like the glass thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, that is safe. </connor>
<joey> Like you could stand on that, you can jump on that. </joey>
<garnt> - Like you trust the engineering. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I do. </connor>
<connor> It's like they wouldn't, </connor>
<connor> this is Japanese standards of engineering. </connor>
<connor> They wouldn't put this here if there was a fear </connor>
<connor> that somebody could jump on this </connor>
<connor> and you could break through it, right? </connor>
<connor> So I know I can stand on that, look down on it </connor>
<joey> and fuck around with it because I know that's safe </joey>
<connor> - Fuck around with it, what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> Getting your chisel out. </connor>
<joey> - No, I could like fucking stamp on it </joey>
<joey> and jump around the stuff just to like freak out </joey>
<connor> whoever I'm with and I'm fine with that. </connor>
<garnt> That doesn't scare me at all cause I know that's safe, </garnt>
<garnt> but you put me onto like a balcony </garnt>
<garnt> and I know nobody won't do it, </garnt>
<joey> but the fear of somebody could come behind me right now </joey>
<garnt> and just push me over the edge. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I have-- - That scares me. </garnt>
<connor> - I have that fear whenever I stand on the platform edge </connor>
<connor> in Japanese... </connor>
<connor> Trains. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because I've seen enough anime </connor>
<joey> where the main character gets shoved off </joey>
<joey> and there's nothing they can do and I feel that, </joey>
<joey> so whenever I'm like standing on the edge of a platform, </joey>
<joey> I literally have to stand at a 90 degree angle </joey>
<joey> because otherwise, I just feel uncomfortable. </joey>
<joey> I feel like someone could push me-- </joey>
<joey> - Cause it's harder to push this way, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> At least if someone tries to push me on the side </connor>
<garnt> I can like try to stop the momentum, </garnt>
<connor> but that's literally nothing I can do. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't walk </garnt>
<connor> cause like normally the platform is so full, right? </connor>
<connor> And people don't stand on the yellow part </connor>
<connor> which is like the danger zone, </connor>
<connor> but like, if I need to get to the other side, </connor>
<connor> I'll walk on the danger zone, </connor>
<connor> but I won't walk there if the train's coming. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I'm like, I'm not risking being nudged </connor>
<connor> or something, but if there's no train, </connor>
<joey> if I get pushed on the tracks, I'll just get back up. </joey>
<joey> Someone will grab me around. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know man. </connor>
<connor> I've seen someone get, like falling onto the tracks before. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What happened, did people help him? </connor>
<connor> - I mean obviously like, </connor>
<connor> they have those like emergency buttons </connor>
<joey> that alerts everybody, so like I think it was obviously </joey>
<joey> like some drunk dude </joey>
<joey> just out of his mind trying to like get on. </joey>
<connor> - I think there's posters all around the Japanese stations </connor>
<connor> being like, oh don't get drunk, don't fall-- </connor>
<joey> - I think it's something like 60 to 70% </joey>
<connor> of people who fall into the tracks </connor>
<connor> usually because they're drunk. </connor>
<connor> Which makes sense, but yeah, I saw some dude </connor>
<connor> like kind of stumble around and I was like, oh God, </connor>
<joey> this guy is getting pretty close to the edge </joey>
<joey> and then sure enough, he just went. </joey>
<connor> - Oh wait, there was someone at our station one time. </connor>
<joey> I remember seeing that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, cause there was a bunch of stretchers and stuff, </joey>
<joey> unfortunately, they fell and hit their head pretty bad. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - All right. </joey>
<joey> - Well, that's the thing, right? </joey>
<connor> It's like-- - The gap is big. </connor>
<connor> - It's really deep. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, so if you're not careful, you can hurt yourself </connor>
<joey> even if there's no train coming, but yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Do you guys have this like a unfounded, like feeling </garnt>
<joey> or fear or whatever, </joey>
<joey> whenever you see like a big red emergency button </joey>
<connor> that you shouldn't press and your mind's like, </connor>
<connor> what if I press that? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - What? No, I don't get that. </joey>
<garnt> - I totally get that, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like every time like you would go through </garnt>
<connor> the school hallways, there'd be like the fire alarm button. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Every time I would just stop and look at and be like, </joey>
<joey> God, I wanna press this. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I've never gotten this urge. </connor>
<joey> - Because it's like I feel that's an experience </joey>
<joey> that only like the 0.1% of kids you knew </joey>
<connor> ever got to experience it, like-- </connor>
<connor> - Well, you just wanna press the button? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, why you wanna press the button? </connor>
<connor> - That was almost a bragging right as a kid, </connor>
<connor> I feel being like, yeah, I've pressed this button before. </connor>
<joey> We like, well, how was it? </joey>
<joey> It's like, of course it's like pressing any button. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause I don't know what the emergency buttons </garnt>
<garnt> or the fire alarm buttons you had in your school, </garnt>
<garnt> but in like British School or my school, </garnt>
<joey> we had like this, it wasn't a button, </joey>
<joey> it was like a very thin piece of glass </joey>
<joey> that you have to break and I always wondered, </joey>
<joey> what does it feel like to break that piece of glass? </joey>
<joey> Like I just wanna know. </joey>
<joey> I just wanna know what happens to that </joey>
<joey> if I break that piece of glass. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, it's like what does it feel like? </joey>
<joey> Like it does it hurt? </joey>
<joey> Is it hard? </joey>
<joey> - Like how thin is it? </joey>
<garnt> How much force would it take to press this button? </garnt>
<connor> - I do think, when you're on a bus sometimes, </connor>
<connor> you see that little puny little hammer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There'll be like this giant window, </connor>
<connor> there'll be this tiny little like, </connor>
<connor> it looks like an ice pick and a tiny-- </connor>
<joey> - That's another one. </joey>
<joey> Every time I came back from school </joey>
<joey> and I saw that little hammer, I was like, I wanna use that. </joey>
<connor> - I think what happens </connor>
<connor> is when you literally that thing like touches your thing, </connor>
<joey> it just shutters. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was on a bus one time when the windows exploded. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so what happened was, I was near the back of the bus </joey>
<connor> and it was our university and it was a varsity event, </connor>
<connor> so they drove the bus to the like one hour university over </connor>
<connor> from Sandy to Cardiff. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And when we were on our way back, </connor>
<connor> the bus driver went down the wrong road. </connor>
<connor> Now, as you put it, you are aware, roads in the UK. </connor>
<connor> If you don't go on the right one with a bus, </connor>
<connor> it's way too narrow. </connor>
<connor> - All right, right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So what happened was, is that he went down the wrong road </connor>
<connor> and he had to turn around, </connor>
<connor> but it was like the road was like this, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like a three-point, like-- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So we went down this way and so he backed it up the hill </connor>
<connor> to try and turn around and as he was trying to swing the bus </connor>
<joey> back round, the house that was in like the end of this road </joey>
<joey> had like a pointing out, </joey>
<joey> like a thing on the edge of that property. </joey>
<joey> Like a tile and so as the bus is turning, </joey>
<connor> you could see, I saw, cause I was sitting here </connor>
<connor> like on this side and that was the side </connor>
<connor> where the window was, you could just see this thing coming </connor>
<connor> and I think they were like started screaming </connor>
<joey> when they saw it cause he was getting real close </joey>
<joey> and it just went and just exploded the window. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah and then the guy </joey>
<joey> obviously heard the fucking shutter and was like, "Oh!" </joey>
<connor> So he backed up, goes to try it again, boom! </connor>
<connor> Other window goes and there's glass everywhere, but-- </connor>
<joey> - Wait, was that like near any of the students or? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but they all ran to the other side. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - So like it was like, it was terrifying </connor>
<connor> and then the bus driver didn't stop or anything. </connor>
<connor> He just like-- </connor>
<connor> - I'ma try this again. </connor>
<connor> - He smashed I think in total three of the big ass windows </connor>
<connor> on the side of the bus and then just drove back like normal. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. - I'm sitting here, </connor>
<connor> like glass everywhere, like what do I do? </connor>
<connor> - Did the glass explode on someone? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but the thing is right on the windows, </connor>
<joey> it's common as you know this as well. </joey>
<joey> When they smash them into their like the way they made, </joey>
<joey> the window smashed into like non sharp-- </joey>
<joey> - They're like blunt, little-- </joey>
<joey> - Then they're a little like bolts, </joey>
<joey> so they don't like cut anyone. </joey>
<joey> - Still, that's scary. </joey>
<connor> - It was fucking terrifying. </connor>
<connor> - So what happened afterwards? </connor>
<connor> - What happened was is that we just drove </connor>
<connor> the last 20 minutes with no windows on the side </connor>
<connor> and then we got off and everyone was like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> And we all went and was like, what the fuck just happened? </connor>
<joey> And I'm sure that guy lost his job. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, probably. </joey>
<joey> - No idea what happened. </joey>
<garnt> University never said anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - How old were you guys? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like 20. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - This like a university bus. </garnt>
<connor> - This is my third year of university </connor>
<connor> and I was like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> And I just went on with my day. </connor>
<joey> I was like, that was weird. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, never heard anything about that. </joey>
<joey> Felt like I deserved an apology for having glass </joey>
<connor> flash on my face. </connor>
<connor> - Was it loud? </connor>
<connor> - Dude, yes! </connor>
<connor> You ever had glass explode? </connor>
<connor> - No I haven't. </connor>
<connor> (all giggling) </connor>
<joey> - I have had like probably the loudest sound I ever heard </joey>
<joey> was, have you guys ever had like lightning strikes </joey>
<garnt> like hit really close? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - To were you are? </garnt>
<joey> - No, actually, no. </joey>
<garnt> - Like you could feel the shockwave at that point. </garnt>
<joey> - So I had one moment where like, </joey>
<joey> I legitimately thought I was gonna die, </joey>
<joey> but it was in high school and like L, </joey>
<garnt> the front part of our school has this like big courtyard </garnt>
<garnt> looking thing and it's kind of on an uphill climb, </garnt>
<garnt> so if you're standing like right at the top of the hill </garnt>
<connor> and look up, you can basically look across </connor>
<connor> the entirety of the school, which is kind of cool. </connor>
<connor> So then me and my couple of my friends were there </connor>
<connor> and it was like very lightly raining </connor>
<connor> and you can hear thunder off in the distance, </connor>
<connor> but it wasn't like a thunderstorm, right? </connor>
<connor> So everybody was outside just kind of chilling </connor>
<connor> and we had this like one really massive pine tree. </connor>
<connor> I wanna say it's maybe like 15, 20-meter tall pine tree. </connor>
<connor> It's huge, just like on the other side of the school. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And I was looking at it for some reason, </connor>
<connor> just kind of like waiting for the bus, just like-- </connor>
<connor> - What a beautiful pine tree. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no, no, because it's so massive </connor>
<connor> that it basically just fills up your entire view </connor>
<connor> and then all of a sudden it was just this like flash </connor>
<garnt> of white and this the largest fucking crashing sound </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever fucking heard and what turned out </garnt>
<garnt> was a lightning bolt had struck that pine tree </garnt>
<garnt> and that pine tree was probably only about like 20 meters </garnt>
<garnt> away from me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it was fucking massive and it was crazy as well </garnt>
<joey> because like we're at the top of the hill, </joey>
<joey> so you can see all the other students across the courtyard </joey>
<connor> and everybody simultaneously was like, like that. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously, I think I'd shit myself. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it was so weird because that entire crash happened </connor>
<connor> and for like 20 seconds the entire courtyard </connor>
<connor> was just silent and we're kind of just like standing </connor>
<connor> and then fucking seventh grader, </connor>
<connor> like kids whose balls haven't dropped, </connor>
<garnt> you all over sudden like, "Aaah!" </garnt>
<garnt> - This girl fucking shell shocked and PTST? </garnt>
<garnt> - And there was just this fucking panic across the school. </garnt>
<garnt> All the teachers like shitting themselves. </garnt>
<garnt> The tree was on fire. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So like straight up, it was just like a fire, </connor>
<connor> like this 20-meter tall pine tree was just on fire. </connor>
<connor> - That was satanic shit. </connor>
<connor> - But it was crazy because it was like it from, I'd say </connor>
<connor> between a five minute span, no, sorry, five seconds span, </connor>
<joey> it went from beautiful large pine tree to just a burning </joey>
<joey> 20-meter log. </joey>
<joey> - Darn, bro. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking crazy. - Darn </joey>

<connor> - Back to the episode. </connor>
<joey> - It really was scary. </joey>
<joey> I mean, again like that was probably, </joey>
<joey> I thought I was gonna go deaf </joey>
<joey> cause it was so fucking loud. </joey>
<connor> It was insanely the other loudest sound </connor>
<connor> I've ever heard was-- </connor>
<connor> - Clap my ass chick. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's it, of course you can't escape from me snake, </connor>
<joey> but the other one was, we were playing cricket. </joey>
<garnt> - Of course, as the-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just give me some anime shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - We were playing cricket and have you ever felt </garnt>
<garnt> like how hard a cricket ball is? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think I do. - Yes, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That thing is fucking hard, it's like a rock basically. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it is a solid piece of whatever it is, </connor>
<connor> but we were playing cricket in school </connor>
<connor> and I was in the outfield and one of the kids </connor>
<connor> like kind of smacked it really, really high up into the air </connor>
<garnt> and it was going towards one of my friends </garnt>
<garnt> and he was underneath, he was ready to catch it. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "Come on, catch it, catch it, catch it," </garnt>
<garnt> but I think he miss timed it because the sun was in his eyes </garnt>
<garnt> or something, so the cricket ball </garnt>
<garnt> landed right in his forehead. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ooh, God! </garnt>
<garnt> - And the only way I can describe the sound </garnt>
<garnt> was as if someone in the distance </garnt>
<garnt> had slapped two pieces of wood together. </garnt>
<joey> It was just like this clack sound </joey>
<joey> and the kid just dropped to the floor. </joey>
<joey> We straight up thought he died. </joey>
<joey> Cause he just-- </joey>
<joey> - That shit is hard bro. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was that like the Mortal Kombat moment where. </garnt>
<joey> (all murmuring) </joey>
<garnt> It's like a fucking fatality. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, honestly, because it went crack on his forehead </garnt>
<connor> and he literally just dropped to the floor. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Was he okay? </connor>
<connor> - He was fine, like he had like a massive bruise </connor>
<garnt> on his head, but he-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Man, this man's got a dummy thick skull. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> We straight up thought he had died, we were like, </garnt>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - The hardest I've ever hit my head, </connor>
<connor> this is gonna be a strange story. </connor>
<connor> So I was in sex ed. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Let me tell the story all, right? </connor>
<garnt> It was I think second </garnt>
<garnt> or third class of sex education, right? </garnt>
<connor> So you know how it is, teachers wanna seem cool. </connor>
<joey> - How old are you at this point? </joey>
<connor> - Like 13. - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - So teachers like that, we wanna seem cool. </joey>
<connor> This one, yes, he's sitting at the table </connor>
<garnt> some watching the video. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, is it a universal rule </garnt>
<garnt> where the tables in the science class </garnt>
<garnt> are taller than the ones in the other classes? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You have that as well? </connor>
<connor> - Cause you have like stools. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like stools, like marge, right? </connor>
<connor> So it's a pretty large table and we're sitting on it </connor>
<connor> and so we were watching this </connor>
<connor> and when we were all on the table, all sitting together </connor>
<connor> with the boys watching the sex ed and the girls obviously. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And on this day I decided </connor>
<connor> that I was going to forego breakfast. </connor>
<connor> I thought I don't need a breakfast, I'm a king, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna go to my sex education mother </joey>
<joey> and I'm gonna watch it and I don't need no breakfast. </joey>
<joey> So I was feeling a little queasy, </joey>
<joey> but I was like it's okay, it's okay. </joey>
<joey> - You're feeling queasy watching the video? </joey>
<connor> - I was feeling queasy before </connor>
<connor> and then I felt even more queasy hearing about this stuff </connor>
<connor> because I was 13, they were like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, so goo comes out of the woman's thing </connor>
<connor> and I'm like. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt giggling) </connor>
<connor> All right, so I'm sitting there and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> all right, okay, okay and then I'm suddenly like, </connor>
<joey> I just started feeling like, oh, whoa, </joey>
<joey> stuff's getting blurry and then I fall on my friend </joey>
<connor> next to me, right? </connor>
<joey> And my friend thinks classic Connor, </joey>
<connor> classic Connor fucking around, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> So he just shrugs me off. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And so I go from this like pretty high tall table, </connor>
<connor> like fell on my friend. </connor>
<connor> I just dunk my head on this like pure like concrete floor. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I wake up and I come to and I just hit like screaming </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> And I look around and all the kids have like ran </connor>
<connor> to the other side of the room </connor>
<connor> and I'm just waiting here like, what the fuck's going on? </connor>
<connor> I can't see shit, cause like my eyes are so blurry, </connor>
<connor> so I hit my head so hard and I'm like, oh, what's going on? </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm literally, I remember I sit up </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, what's happening? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you initially fainted from a sex ed. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I got so much shit for it as well obviously. </connor>
<garnt> - That's such an anime moment. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, right? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah and obviously in school I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Ah, Connor fainted cause he saw a dick." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's when I started fighting. </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding though and so I couldn't see for like two hours. </connor>
<connor> Vision was blurry and I was like, fuck, am I blind? </connor>
<joey> But then luckily it came through </joey>
<joey> and I think I was just very heavily concussed. </joey>
<joey> - You're blinded by the dick. </joey>
<connor> - Blinded by, they was showing Johnny sins his first wo-- </connor>
<connor> - It's like, oh God. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, that's like a death sentence in school man. </garnt>
<connor> - It was okay. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So now you know, not to skip breakfast. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that was my bad cause yeah, </connor>
<connor> I often felt pretty fucking sick all the time. </connor>
<garnt> So yeah it was my bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, they just didn't help. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, just hearing all this stuff at that age, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like fuck, that sounds disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> I hate like slime and goo so much, </garnt>
<connor> so hearing it come out of like body parts </connor>
<connor> makes me feel so gross... </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's the way they phrase it too, right? </connor>
<connor> Because the only thing I remember </connor>
<connor> from my sex education thing, cause I think I was like 11 </connor>
<connor> or 12 when I do the first sex education thing. </connor>
<connor> So already it's like, argh, for a lot of kids, right? </connor>
<connor> But like the only thing I remember they told us </connor>
<connor> which is the only reason I remember </connor>
<connor> is cause it's so fucking weird to this day, </connor>
<connor> but it was dead ass the first thing </connor>
<connor> the sex education teacher said she was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay everybody, get your index finger </connor>
<connor> "and put it on the inside of your mouth </connor>
<connor> "and feel your cheeks" </connor>
<joey> and I was like, okay, then that's like </joey>
<joey> "That's what the inside of the vagina feels." </joey>
<joey> - Oh! - Oh! </joey>
<joey> That's so cruel. </joey>
<joey> - And all the girls are like, "Oh!" </joey>
<joey> And all the guys are like," Oh, hell yeah!" </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Well you were to it, you went to an all guys school. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, this is in elementary school. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. - Elementary school, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Darn, that's the only thing I remember. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't remember what it was that like set me off </joey>
<connor> and it was like, I don't know why the fuck they showed this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - All right. </connor>
<connor> - But they were talking about, </connor>
<connor> I this is way too much information. </connor>
<connor> So here's a timestamp on screen </connor>
<connor> where we skipped talking about this stuff, </connor>
<connor> so go and sketch it, maybe it's kind of likely </connor>
<connor> to leave the room, so they were talking about discharge. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - For girls, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it wasn't enough to just talk about it. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They had this like reenactment of this girl </connor>
<connor> who goes to the toilet </connor>
<connor> and they dead asked to do a closeup shot of like white shit </connor>
<connor> on her pants and I'm like, that's disgusting. </connor>
<connor> Why would you show that? </connor>
<connor> We're like 13. </connor>
<connor> That's what like made me feel gross. </connor>
<joey> - Did you have to watch the obligatory, </joey>
<joey> like woman giving birth? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was gonna talk about that </garnt>
<garnt> cause I swear to God, whoever was like editing-- </garnt>
<connor> - That was like on a British TV there as well. </connor>
<garnt> They showed births. </garnt>
<garnt> - You serious? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a whole TV show. </connor>
<joey> - Well, you had like specialists videos </joey>
<connor> that schools like bought to show us like-- </connor>
<connor> - It's fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> That's so graphic. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah and I mean, the person who edited like our video, </connor>
<connor> they must have known what they were doing, right? </connor>
<connor> Okay, so this guy, </connor>
<connor> this old British guy was basically describing </connor>
<connor> the process of a baby coming out of a vagina, right? </connor>
<connor> And so what they use to describe what happens, </connor>
<connor> the process of this happening, </connor>
<connor> is they take a rubber band, right? </connor>
<connor> He takes a rubber band and just like, he just goes, </connor>
<joey> imagine this is the hole in the vagina, right? </joey>
<joey> This is what happened when a baby comes out </joey>
<joey> and he literally stretches it like that </joey>
<joey> and then the class goes, "Oh," </joey>
<connor> and shit you know, they then hard cut to like a baby </connor>
<connor> that's just like crowning and just like coming out </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, thinking back to that moment </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, I think like in the moment, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like the fucking editor </connor>
<garnt> knew what he was doing there. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not even like a cross dissolve, it's just a hard cut. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a straight up hard guy. </joey>
<garnt> He knew exactly what he was doing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like one of those like, whooshes in like that, </garnt>
<connor> just a fucking baby's head. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> God, they were so disgusting. </connor>
<connor> I mean, obviously I'm glad that I was taught this stuff, </connor>
<connor> but at the same time did they gotta go in so goddamn hard </connor>
<joey> on that shit, that like eases in. </joey>
<connor> - It was brutal. </connor>
<connor> - No one enjoyed it. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] No, no. </connor>
<connor> - No one was like, "Oh, this is interesting." </connor>
<joey> Everyone's like, "No, oh fuck!" </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like it's a thing </garnt>
<connor> that does need to happen though cause-- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, obviously I'm glad that I taught </garnt>
<connor> cause I speak to Americans and sometimes they're like, </connor>
<connor> "I have no sex education at all." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, like Sydney learned her sex education </garnt>
<garnt> through her toy and I mean-- </garnt>
<connor> - That's boring. </connor>
<garnt> - That is boring. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like, what is it like? </garnt>
<connor> A lot of the States they just say, "Oh, abstinent. </connor>
<garnt> Wait until marriage." </garnt>
<connor> That's legitimately like I think many of the States-- </connor>
<garnt> - And I think it depends on the States. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not mandatory or something? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. - Oh , really, wow! </joey>
<connor> - In many States, the only certification is abstinence. </connor>
<connor> Promote abstinence. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<connor> - So like Christian school, so it's not like. </connor>
<garnt> I think in England you have to do it, </garnt>
<garnt> but you have to teach it by law, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so in every, I think like in age 13 gets taught, </connor>
<connor> like how to put on a condom, how to do all that shit. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did you get towards, </garnt>
<garnt> did you get like the fucking banana? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - No, it was so embarrassing. </connor>
<connor> This woman, right? </connor>
<connor> She was like, have you seen "Matilda" that movie? </connor>
<connor> Like what's that woman called? </connor>
<connor> Like the devil teacher in that, </connor>
<connor> literally the woman looked like that, dead ass. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Took out this like fucking 12-inch dildo, </connor>
<connor> smacked it on the table and she was like, </connor>
<connor> who wants to put a condom on this? </connor>
<connor> Who wants to try? </connor>
<connor> And then everyone was like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> Why is it so big? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - A fucking dead ass dildo. </joey>
<joey> - It was massive. </joey>
<connor> It was huge. </connor>
<connor> - So, I got this from my own collection. </connor>
<connor> - That was why like, I remember, I went home that day </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, what is average dick size? </joey>
<connor> Cause I was like, that cannot be normal. </connor>
<connor> That is like, that is 12 inches. </connor>
<connor> The girth of it was ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> That was clearly her own personal one that she brought in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, had to there and there. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I have to do the banana. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I thought that was just industry standard. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, she put it, maybe there was a banana and she was like, </connor>
<garnt> "No, I'm gonna bring my own." </garnt>
<connor> - Let me just bring my Aunt Summer's </connor>
<connor> like fucking pussy pleasure. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Dragon dildo. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I think what happened was they ended up teaching it, </connor>
<connor> like we had so much of it cause where I grew up </connor>
<joey> was like the worst place in the UK for teen pregnancies. </joey>
<joey> There's so many, there's so many that happened </joey>
<joey> where I grew up and it was, yeah, </joey>
<joey> obviously the government was like, </joey>
<connor> "Hey guys, we know you're gonna do it. </connor>
<connor> "Just please, please don't have babies." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Just do it properly. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - At the right time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Remember like a few weeks ago </garnt>
<garnt> when I was talking about how my mum told me </garnt>
<joey> that babies came out of the belly button? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So like she watched the episode and she messages me </connor>
<garnt> the day afterwards reminding me </garnt>
<garnt> that actually my very first sex ed class, </garnt>
<garnt> which was in primary school. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember how old I was, I think I was-- </garnt>
<connor> - I'd have sex in primary, I don't think so. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I had like a very early sex ed. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah </connor>
<connor> - I had two or three during my entire childhood, I think </connor>
<connor> and it just like every sex </connor>
<connor> I'd got like progressively more graphic </connor>
<joey> Like the older you get which is how it should be, </joey>
<connor> but she reminded me that the first time </connor>
<connor> I learned that babies didn't come out of the belly button </connor>
<garnt> and came out of the vagina. </garnt>
<garnt> I dead ass didn't believe them. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I came home and I remember this so vividly </connor>
<joey> because I remember the very first time I tried lying </joey>
<joey> to my mum and it was like such an innocent little kid lie </joey>
<joey> where I went to the toilet and I didn't wash my hands </joey>
<joey> and she asked me if I wash my hands and I said, yes. </joey>
<joey> That was the first time I attempted a lie in my life. </joey>
<joey> It was like the most vanilla lie and she was like, </joey>
<connor> "Let me smell your hands. </connor>
<connor> "Let me smell your hands." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, oh shit. </connor>
<connor> But the first time I tried lying, I got caught, </connor>
<connor> so that was embedded in me from like a very early age </connor>
<joey> just like people don't lie cause people get caught </joey>
<connor> when they lie. </connor>
<connor> - Let me smell your hands. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, so you believed your mum. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so my mum's like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, I won't punish you this time, </connor>
<connor> "but let's just make a promise </connor>
<connor> "that we're just not going to lie to each other ever." </connor>
<connor> And I like me, bright-eyed like, five-year-old, </connor>
<connor> I believed her until like I hit teenage hood. </connor>
<connor> So I go to this class and people and their teachers </connor>
<connor> were telling us how babies came out of the vagina </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, actually. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Actually miss, I believe </connor>
<connor> that they actually come out of the belly button. </connor>
<connor> I know this, my mom taught me </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. </connor>
<connor> - And she was trying to console me, </connor>
<joey> "No, they come out down there, your mom--" </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry your mother is a liar. </joey>
<joey> - "I'm sorry your mom is wrong," </joey>
<joey> so me being like the eight or 10-year-old, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, okay, there're two adults in my life </joey>
<joey> that have said two different pieces of information. </joey>
<joey> I go back to my home. </joey>
<joey> I go back and I tell my mom, </joey>
<joey> mom, the teacher taught me this. </joey>
<joey> She said, "You are a liar," but you know what? </joey>
<joey> You promise me that we wouldn't lie to each other. </joey>
<joey> So I believe you. </joey>
<connor> I believe you, mother. </connor>
<garnt> I know that babies come out of the belly button </garnt>
<connor> and it's just like. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yaiks! </connor>
<garnt> - And yeah, she just reminded me that, that was a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't actually remember when I realized </garnt>
<connor> that babies didn't come out of the belly button. </connor>
<connor> Message, just blanked that out. </connor>
<connor> Oh yes, thank you mother for lying to me from a young age, </connor>
<garnt> I know you're a liar now. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I remember one time I had like a bit of hair sticking up </connor>
<connor> and for some reason when I put like water in it, </connor>
<connor> it didn't go down. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] All right. </connor>
<connor> - That's like, fuck, that's real annoying </connor>
<connor> and I'm like 10 years old and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna cut it. </connor>
<connor> It's in the way, because it wouldn't go down. </connor>
<connor> So I cut like a chunk of my hair out </connor>
<connor> and then my mom's like, "Connor, did you cut your hair?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, no, no mother, of course I didn't cut my hair. </connor>
<connor> She was like, "There's a piece missing." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I think it got trapped in the door. </connor>
<connor> It was all I said. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> She's like, "So you're telling me that it got stuck </connor>
<connor> "in the door with enough force </connor>
<connor> "that it pulled your hair out?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, of course, as if she's like, </connor>
<connor> "Let's try it again." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, God, no. </connor>
<connor> I've never prayed for more of my life </connor>
<connor> that my hair gets ripped out. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> So you go to the door, the hinge, first of all, she's like, </connor>
<connor> "How did you get your head in the hinge at the end" </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I have no idea about that. </connor>
<connor> So I put my hair in the door and I close it </connor>
<connor> and of course, no hair falls out and she's like, </connor>
<connor> "What happened Connor?" </connor>
<connor> And then she's like, okay, mom, I cut it </connor>
<connor> cause it was annoying me. </connor>
<connor> She's like, "Why did you do that?" </connor>
<connor> I don't know, it didn't go down with water. </connor>
<connor> That's what I normally do and she's like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, you didn't need to do that" </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, oh, okay, okay, shit! </connor>
<joey> - Mine started earlier when I was like stolen, like nappies </joey>
<connor> and stuff like that, all right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, like cause I had this really, </connor>
<connor> for some reason I had the fear of sitting on the toilet. </connor>
<connor> For some reason. </connor>
<connor> Like, because I think it was like two </connor>
<connor> or three years old, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like the last stage </connor>
<connor> of you still wearing nappies, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And like, I really hated taking a shit. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like I was really scared and I think it's because, </joey>
<joey> I think my mom explained it to me later, </joey>
<connor> she was like, "I think you were scared </connor>
<connor> "not to like actually sit on the toilet, </connor>
<connor> "but to like flush the toilet </connor>
<connor> "because you thought </connor>
<joey> "you were gonna get sucked in as well." </joey>
<connor> - I mean, not gonna lie, there's those airplanes toilets. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh shit, oh my-- </joey>
<joey> - It's the airplane toilet fear </joey>
<joey> and I thought that same force was in my home toilet as well. </joey>
<garnt> - I had the same fear. </garnt>
<joey> I just fucking remembered this and it came from an airplane. </joey>
<connor> Cause when you flush the airplane, </connor>
<garnt> it feels like you're gonna get like sucked </garnt>
<connor> into oblivion now. </connor>
<connor> - When I was like 10, what I would do </connor>
<connor> is I would like, fucking close the door, </connor>
<connor> cause you had like two seconds, you pressed the button </connor>
<connor> and it goes two seconds. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, so you have like two seconds to get out. </connor>
<connor> - So, I thought I had that in my home toilet. </connor>
<connor> So at that point, so two, three-year-old me </connor>
<connor> was just like I figured out of resolution, just don't shit. </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm wearing nappies. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't that like a South Park plot? </connor>
<connor> - It's like I'm wearing nappies, just don't shit, </connor>
<connor> but like at that stage as well, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I was too embarrassed to admit to my parents </connor>
<connor> that I literally just shat in my nappies. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So what I would do is like I would hide behind the couch </connor>
<connor> and kind of just like subtly do it behind the couch. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> While my parents weren't looking. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck! </connor>
<connor> - And my mom would like walk into the living room </connor>
<joey> and be like, "Joey, what are you doing?" </joey>
<connor> - I would try and get a refund on the kid </connor>
<joey> if they were doing that. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, "Joey, what are you doing?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like nothing and she's like, </connor>
<connor> "You're pooping, aren't you?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, no. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Me while my face is straining like. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> And my mom's like, </joey>
<joey> "I could literally smell the shit from here." </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> What are you talking about? </joey>
<connor> "Go to the fucking toilet." </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - And I would literally </connor>
<connor> do that for like the longest time until like finally, </connor>
<connor> you get to the stage </connor>
<connor> where you have to get out of nappies, right? </connor>
<connor> And so I'm just like for the first like-- </connor>
<garnt> - You prolonged as much as you could. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, for the first, like two or three months </garnt>
<connor> out of nappies, I dreaded having to take a shit. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh, I have to like psych myself up </connor>
<connor> and be like all right, I'm not gonna get sucked in today. </connor>
<joey> You can do it. </joey>
<joey> (all giggling) </joey>
<joey> It was horrible. - Man. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, I still have, like, I still have a fear </garnt>
<garnt> of going to the toilet on airplanes, </garnt>
<garnt> just because of that noise. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if, if I need to-- </garnt>
<connor> - But don't mind, shit's not pleasant. </connor>
<connor> - It's not pleasant, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, I just get like a small flashback </garnt>
<connor> every time I hear that noise. </connor>
<garnt> I need to wear like fucking thick headphones </garnt>
<garnt> every time I go, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm turning that music. </garnt>
<joey> - Bro, that's what noise canceling headphones </joey>
<joey> weren't built to feel like. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like, cause you were saying </connor>
<connor> that you didn't you'd never like lie, </connor>
<connor> we've never like lying like your whole life </connor>
<connor> up to like 14, whatever? </connor>
<connor> Like when did you realize you could lie? </connor>
<connor> - I think it was when I realized my parents lied to me </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, I can't believe </connor>
<garnt> they've bamboozled me like this </garnt>
<connor> - I just realized it and I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh, I pretty started to like lie </connor>
<joey> a lot more for a younger age because I had brothers. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Because like you can't lie to your parents </joey>
<joey> cause they're your parents, right? </joey>
<garnt> They own you. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You don't get to like talk back. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, cause I didn't lie to my fucking parents. </connor>
<connor> Like I said, like I got caught </connor>
<joey> the first time I attempted this, so after that I was like, </joey>
<joey> this is a loser's game. </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna lose when I try. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me, it was like, when you'd like go visit a friend </garnt>
<garnt> or something and you'd like, the friend would be like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, I'm just gonna say to my parents that we're here </connor>
<connor> "to do homework or whatever, but we'll just go to my room </connor>
<connor> "and play games" and I was like, no, that's not gonna work. </connor>
<connor> My parents would immediately see through that shit </connor>
<connor> and I would see my friend, Dwayne being like, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, we're just gonna do homework" </joey>
<joey> and the parents like, "Okay." </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, you can do that? </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna do that from now on. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think cause you only have like siblings. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I feel like you end up having to lie </connor>
<connor> cause you're always fighting and arguing-- </connor>
<connor> - Right and but like I was such a terrible thing </connor>
<connor> cause you have older brothers, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, cause I was the oldest </connor>
<connor> in the family, so I had to like teach my sister </connor>
<connor> to be like, listen, you can lie to the parents. </connor>
<connor> I've seen it happen, I've done it before, she's like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh my God, thank you brother." </joey>
<joey> - Parents hate this one trick, but people know it. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I didn't like to me learning I could lie </connor>
<connor> or learning that people was like watching that like, </connor>
<joey> one life hack, YouTube video </joey>
<joey> that was literally an actual life. </joey>
<joey> That was actually a literal high-life act. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - But no, I feel like that's why some people </garnt>
<garnt> were just like so bad at lying </garnt>
<garnt> because sometimes you play a game of Among Us. </garnt>
<garnt> You can tell who the good lies from the bad lies are. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I've always had this fear, like ingrains me </garnt>
<garnt> from a kid that I shouldn't lie and even as an adult </garnt>
<garnt> I have a harder time lying than some other people. </garnt>
<joey> - That's right, that's why I hate playing games </joey>
<joey> like Among Us and like Werewolf or shit like that, </joey>
<joey> cause I just can't lie. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but it isn't fun place to just like, </connor>
<connor> just have like a safe space </connor>
<joey> where you can all just fucking lie </joey>
<connor> and like laugh at each other-- </connor>
<joey> - No, because I'm like, </joey>
<connor> I can't trust any of you motherfuckers-- </connor>
<connor> - Why? What, no! </connor>
<connor> - Like after this game is over, </connor>
<joey> I don't think I'll be able to believe anything you say. </joey>
<connor> - Cause it's fun, right? </connor>
<connor> Cause it's like you get to experience </connor>
<connor> what it'd be like being interrogated </connor>
<connor> if you committed like murderer or something. </connor>
<connor> - Why was that fun? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, it's fun seeing if you can lie, </joey>
<joey> if you can bullshit your way out of it, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - But you can never bullshit your way out of it. </joey>
<connor> We should know this. - Sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - That's why it's fun to watch interrogation videos. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Well, they are naturally be-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad I'm not that guy right now. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the reason why I watch Leaguey Sports </joey>
<connor> rather than actually wanting to play League myself. </connor>
<connor> It's funny to watch other people go through pain </connor>
<connor> rather than to have it hit myself. </connor>
<connor> That's a really weird tangent, </connor>
<connor> but that's the closest person I could think of. </connor>
<connor> - I like seeing people suffer, not me. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty much. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, who doesn't. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I think the reason why mangas did so good </connor>
<connor> is cause it did give like a thing where you can be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey man, there's not many games out there </connor>
<connor> "where you can just like lie" and that's the whole game. </connor>
<connor> It's like lying and deceiving and that's fun </connor>
<connor> to get to do that and like blow off some steam doing it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I definitely do enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> I've played like plenty of games of Werewolf </garnt>
<garnt> where I really enjoyed that. </garnt>
<garnt> Among Us, I just didn't get to play enough games </garnt>
<garnt> to really get used to it cause I was still at the stage </garnt>
<garnt> where they'd ask me what I was doing, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, I don't know what else I was doing. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm following the map. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck is going on. </connor>
<joey> - I like those games, it was fun when you would like realize </joey>
<garnt> after like one or two rounds, you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> I know who the gut liar is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Gotta take em' out. </garnt>
<connor> So they don't get to lie. </connor>
<joey> - I'd say I never got to that stage because in my head </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, how am I gonna bullshit my way out of this? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, by the time I had started playing Among Us, </garnt>
<garnt> there was already a fucking meteor. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, what task were you doing? </garnt>
<joey> And so-and-so okay, I know your innocent. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I just, I was getting smirked on. </garnt>
<connor> - I really enjoyed it, </connor>
<connor> but I think after like the first two weeks </connor>
<connor> the novelty really walled off on me, </connor>
<connor> but obviously it didn't on YouTube </connor>
<joey> cause it was like, it had like, </joey>
<connor> well, like four, five months? </connor>
<joey> - Entire career is what created from that game. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I haven't seen anything blow up that much </connor>
<garnt> in a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> It's got crazy. - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like I started watching Twitch contents </garnt>
<joey> way more after Among Us and four guys </joey>
<joey> really took off last year </joey>
<joey> and before that I had I'd hardly had watched </joey>
<joey> any Twitch streamers at all and the only live streams </joey>
<joey> I watch was like VTubers back then, </joey>
<joey> but I was mostly on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> So it kind of really, I feel like, </joey>
<connor> I don't know if it's just me, </connor>
<connor> but I like Twitch streamers is like way bigger personalities </connor>
<connor> than they were in 2019. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if that's just my perspective, </connor>
<connor> but I definitely see a lot more Twitch people now. </connor>
<connor> - I think at least, pretty cause were on YouTube, right? </connor>
<connor> And I think what has happened is that Twitch Streamers, </connor>
<connor> their content that's being put on YouTube </connor>
<connor> is doing much better than before. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's before the biggest channels would get </connor>
<connor> maybe 100,000, 200,000 views if they air that videos, </connor>
<connor> they upload it, but now the Among Us clips </connor>
<garnt> are getting like five, six, seven, 12, million views </garnt>
<connor> and it's like wow, that is nuts. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I think it's because I still don't watch </garnt>
<garnt> as much Twitch, but I see so many clips on my recommended </garnt>
<garnt> and on my YouTube feed. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't not see it now </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm way more aware of what's going on </garnt>
<garnt> even though I hardly actually watched Twitch. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know, I'm really enjoying it right now. </connor>
<connor> I'm really enjoying streaming so much. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you've been playing like Apex every day. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm gonna take Apex man, so much. </connor>
<connor> - You found your new addiction? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, I have. </connor>
<joey> - You're just gonna end up being like an Apex streamer. </joey>
<connor> - Probably-- - Full time, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I feel like, cause right now what it is </connor>
<connor> is that I just wanna play this game and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> all right, I just happened to put the stream on as well. </connor>
<joey> - You see, like I can't do that </joey>
<joey> because like my not stream gaming mode </joey>
<connor> and my stream gaming mode is like completely different. </connor>
<connor> - I agree, same thing here. </connor>
<garnt> - In my head I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm not constantly commentating while I'm streaming, </garnt>
<garnt> then I'm gonna look boring whereas if I'm off stream, </garnt>
<connor> I am fucking silent for six hours. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, me too, me too. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I mean like, when you're getting filmed, </garnt>
<garnt> I had to like really force like comments out of myself, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's how I feel with Twitch as well </garnt>
<garnt> where sometimes I'm playing a game in Twitch mode, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I feel like I have to force myself </garnt>
<garnt> to say something. </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't like my natural default self. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think that's normal though. </connor>
<connor> Like no one normally just talks </connor>
<garnt> while they're playing video games themselves. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's say that you actively learn to-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I feel like sometimes you think at least, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Or you, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually, in some video games, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't verbalize any of my thoughts, </garnt>
<connor> even it might mentally </connor>
<garnt> cause you can like mentally verbalize your thoughts, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't even do that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, I'm playing the game, </garnt>
<connor> and it's just all like instincts. </connor>
<joey> - I only got used to it </joey>
<joey> because I used to do let's plays on my channel, </joey>
<connor> but like before that, like my first couple-- </connor>
<connor> - Why did you do the let's plays? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my first couple lets plays, I was boring as hell </connor>
<connor> just cause I was at that stage where I was like, </connor>
<connor> okay I have to say something. </connor>
<connor> I can't just like keep advancing with the game silently </connor>
<connor> because I'm on camera, </connor>
<connor> but as I did it for like fucking three years </connor>
<connor> or however long it was, I just kind of learned to be like, </connor>
<connor> here's something that I can say, here's something I can say </connor>
<joey> to the point where I found myself sometimes </joey>
<joey> in my non-recording gaming sessions, commenting to myself </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, oh no, this is a problem. </joey>
<joey> It's like 2:00 a.m and I'm playing Final Fantasy 13 </joey>
<connor> and I'm commenting to myself. </connor>
<joey> - Commentating to yourself? </joey>
<joey> - Are you streaming sharing? </joey>
<joey> No, Why? </joey>
<joey> - No, cause I was still living in my parents </joey>
<connor> back in the time </connor>
<connor> and so my parents would come in being like, </connor>
<connor> "Who are you talking to?" </connor>
<joey> And I'm just like, oh my God, who am I talking to? </joey>
<joey> There's no camera rolling. </joey>
<connor> I'm not recording this. </connor>
<connor> - My parents thought I was, </connor>
<connor> cause I was always on X-Box voice chat talking to people, </connor>
<connor> they thought when I started voice acting they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh Connor's just talking to his friends on X-Box." </connor>
<connor> So they didn't know what I was doing. </connor>
<joey> - He's just talking in funny voices. </joey>
<connor> - I said, "Why is he saying the same thing </connor>
<connor> "over and over again, huh? </connor>
<connor> "Doing different inflections. </connor>
<connor> "That's really fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> "Nevermind, he's probably playing X-Box, </connor>
<connor> "Connor's a weird one." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You got some weird hobbies, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think my parents definitely when I was kid, </garnt>
<connor> they saw me as like the weird kid </connor>
<connor> of like the four, they were like, </connor>
<connor> "He's the strange one, </connor>
<connor> "but normally things work out in the end." </connor>
<joey> - He'll find his way. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's normally the way it was. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, like growing up, sometimes I do wish </connor>
<connor> that I did have brothers and sisters </connor>
<garnt> cause I feel like, I dunno how you guys feel </garnt>
<garnt> about your siblings, but I feel like there's nothing-- </garnt>
<connor> - I wouldn't wanna be raised without brothers or sisters, </connor>
<garnt> I think now that I've had them, </garnt>
<connor> I just couldn't imagine not being raised with siblings. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, same. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - I can't imagine just having to share everything though. </joey>
<connor> That's-- - Well, you don't have to. </connor>
<connor> - That's how you learn to lie, right? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Although I did have to share my X-Box and that was horrible. </connor>
<connor> We have to like swap every hour and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I can't even get a good gaming session in here for now, </connor>
<connor> are you kidding me? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's why I'm glad </joey>
<joey> like the first like game console we got </joey>
<joey> was Game Boy Advances </joey>
<joey> cause we had one each. </joey>
<garnt> - That was the first console you got? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Well yeah, like any console </garnt>
<connor> that we could actually share, right? </connor>
<connor> Or wasn't like a, two-play thing </connor>
<connor> cause we had like the N64, I used to like that too, </connor>
<connor> but if you have two controllers you can play together, </connor>
<connor> but can't quite do that on a on a handheld console, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] True, true. </connor>
<connor> - So it was fucking fun. </connor>
<connor> Like sometimes I'd wanna get on the N64, </connor>
<connor> play a one-player game, like fucking Donkey Kong 64 </connor>
<connor> or Super Mario 64 or something. </connor>
<connor> You can't play that with my sister. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - So I was like fuck, </connor>
<connor> what do we do? </connor>
<connor> Let's get a handheld console </connor>
<joey> and just play whatever fuck the games we want together. </joey>
<connor> Problem solved. </connor>
<connor> - Man, I miss being stupid as a kid and I do because-- </connor>
<garnt> - I had this thought the other day, I miss how simple it was </garnt>
<connor> just to like find happiness in something. </connor>
<connor> - Right, so my first game-- </connor>
<connor> - Getting real deep here. </connor>
<garnt> - Sorry, my first game console or game device </garnt>
<garnt> was a Game Boy Color. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. - Right? </garnt>
<connor> And my parents bought it for me in France </connor>
<connor> and they were like, "What games do you want?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like Pokemon. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - I didn't know at the time. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it says that the game is in French obviously </connor>
<connor> cause we're in France, </connor>
<connor> but somehow still managed to complete the whole thing. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Wow! - When I was like eight </connor>
<garnt> or something and I'm like, I would not have the patience </garnt>
<garnt> to fucking do that now. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I don't know what the fuck was going on. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what any of the moves did, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think like eight-year-old me had just understood </garnt>
<connor> that this set of letters did this funny thing </connor>
<connor> that did a lot of damage </connor>
<connor> cause I had just been playing it so much. </connor>
<connor> So I think by the time I got to the elite four, </connor>
<joey> I think nearly all my Pokemon were level a 100. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - That was literally just trial by fire, right? </joey>
<joey> - It was literally just grinding and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> how the fuck did I do that? </joey>
<connor> I'm so dumb or at least being that dumb </connor>
<connor> where I could just throw myself at something like that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like I remember cause I also, </joey>
<connor> I mean I got the Game Boy Advance, </connor>
<connor> but the first couple of games </connor>
<garnt> I got were Game Boy Color games </garnt>
<garnt> because you could play the Game Boy Color games </garnt>
<connor> in the Game Boy Advance which I was like, </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, technology, </connor>
<connor> but I remember like the part where I think about it now </connor>
<connor> where it's like, I definitely had too much time as a kid </connor>
<connor> that I could not sink into my adulthood </connor>
<connor> was when I managed to on my Pokemon Sapphire cartridge. </connor>
<garnt> I played it so much that I maxed out the in time clock. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like I found out that on Pokemon Sapphire </garnt>
<connor> on Game Boy Advance. </connor>
<connor> - Is it 1,000 hours or-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 999 hours and 99 minutes </connor>
<joey> is the furthest it will go. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you just leave this thing on 24/7? </garnt>
<joey> - No, that's how much I played it. </joey>
<connor> - I see it, man. </connor>
<connor> When you're a kid, you just get obsessed. </connor>
<connor> - Like every moment, </connor>
<connor> because especially the Game Boy Advance, </connor>
<connor> like looking back on it now, this thing's fucking tiny. </connor>
<connor> Well, you can put that in like jeans pocket </connor>
<connor> or like a jacket pocket, take it everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - The best one </connor>
<connor> cause I think it was literally when we were kids </connor>
<joey> was that Game Boy Advance SP. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yes, oh! - Oh! </joey>
<joey> That was so good. </joey>
<joey> - Only the cool rich kids had a-- </joey>
<joey> - Wow, the SP was like the best one </joey>
<joey> cause that like just it would literally fit </joey>
<joey> in your tiny child jeans. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It was amazing. </connor>
<connor> - I remember one of my Japanese friends brought it to school </connor>
<connor> once and he was like, "Boys, check this out." </connor>
<connor> I was like, whoa and it was like, </connor>
<garnt> "And it's got a backlight on it" and I was like, whoa! </garnt>
<connor> You can play that at night. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, the backlight. </garnt>
<connor> I completely forgot that was the massive thing. </connor>
<connor> - The SP was the first one that had a backlight </connor>
<garnt> and before then you had to attach </garnt>
<joey> like those like fucking reading lamp. </joey>
<garnt> - The fucking reading lights, like the awful glare. </garnt>
<connor> - I think actually the first model of the SP </connor>
<connor> didn't have a backlight. </connor>
<connor> It was like the second model </connor>
<connor> which is the more popular model I think. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I had an SP and I got one cause my friend got one </connor>
<connor> and I saw him playing it and for like Christmas I was like, </connor>
<connor> mom I want nothing more than the Game Boy Advance SP. </connor>
<connor> You know what game I played the most on it? </connor>
<connor> - What? - What? </connor>
<connor> - Fucking GBA game. </connor>
<connor> I played Pokemon Trading Card Game. </connor>
<garnt> Have you played that game on Game Boy? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was so good. - It was fucking great. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember like, oh go ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, sorry, sorry, I had a finalization to this story. </garnt>
<joey> One time I thought, I was so addicted to this thing, right? </joey>
<joey> I would literally walk around the house with it. </joey>
<joey> I would sleep with it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, of course, of course, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If I was walking down the stairs </joey>
<joey> I would play Game Boy walking down the stairs. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If I was down at the table, that'd be there, </connor>
<connor> if It was going to bed, I'd play it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I would even if I went to pee, I would play with it. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay. - So I would pee with it. </connor>
<connor> One time I dropped it down the toilet. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Not sure how it happened, I was playing, </connor>
<joey> I was just playing Pokemon Trading Card Game </joey>
<joey> and that was the cartridge that was there, </joey>
<joey> I was playing it while I was peeing. </joey>
<joey> You're like 12, your little dick's out, you're like. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how I dropped it, I dropped it </joey>
<joey> and I was like, how do I explain this to my mom? </joey>
<garnt> How do I tell her that I don't have a Game Boy SP anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, it didn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you lie? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, cause it smelled of piss as well. </garnt>
<connor> For some reason I checked </connor>
<connor> if the Pokemon Trading Card Game still worked. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. - But of course. </connor>
<garnt> - So I plugged it into the old Game Boy Color I had. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, so I had to go to my mom, I was like mom, </garnt>
<garnt> so this is kind of like embarrassing. </garnt>
<connor> I dropped my Game Boy down the toilet and she was like, </connor>
<connor> "How did you drop your Game Boy down the fucking toilet?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I just really enjoy playing it </connor>
<connor> and my family fucking rinsed me for like five years. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, if that was my kid, I'd fucking rinse him too. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know how expensive a Game Boy Advance SP </connor>
<connor> is at that age? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but they loved it purely for the comedic purposes. </connor>
<connor> Every time we'd meet someone, they're like this is Callum. </connor>
<connor> He's very successful, very smart. </connor>
<garnt> This is Connor, he dropped his Game Boy </garnt>
<joey> down the fucking toilet. </joey>
<joey> (all giggling) </joey>
<joey> And I was so sad for like four months. </joey>
<joey> I was just like this on every window, I was like </joey>
<joey> what do I do? </joey>
<connor> - Did you ever get another one? </connor>
<garnt> - I did six months later for my birthday. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, - Wow, really? </garnt>
<connor> Yean and literally I remember like for six months </connor>
<connor> I was like playing Game Boy Color again, </connor>
<connor> just playing Pokemon Trading Card Game </connor>
<connor> with other shitty Game Boy-- </connor>
<joey> - Your parents are nice man. </joey>
<joey> If I did that, my parents would never buy me </joey>
<joey> a game cartridge. </joey>
<connor> - I think they felt so bad for me </connor>
<connor> because of how like distraught I was </connor>
<joey> and I think they thought I was gonna get over it, </joey>
<joey> but I was sad for like half a year. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, it's like dropping a laptop down the toilet. </joey>
<joey> - I could not get over it </joey>
<connor> and I think my parents at some point were like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, I think we should get him another one </connor>
<connor> "or maybe like he's not gonna recover. </connor>
<garnt> "Maybe he's never gonna let this go" and I wouldn't have, </garnt>
<connor> I wouldn't have let this go. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like for me Game Boys </garnt>
<garnt> were the only game console or like handheld consoles </garnt>
<connor> that I could actually get every game I wanted </connor>
<connor> and that's because every year we'd visit our family </connor>
<connor> in Thailand and there's always like that one store </connor>
<connor> that my parents would take me to </connor>
<connor> and it wasn't a legit Nintendo store. </connor>
<connor> - Really? Really don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if you could tell, </connor>
<connor> but you basically go in the store </connor>
<connor> and they didn't have the game cartridges. </connor>
<connor> They would just have just the book </connor>
<connor> and you'd go for this book and you tell these people </connor>
<connor> which games you wanted. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So like my entire life, </connor>
<connor> I would have to wait like a fucking one year </connor>
<connor> to get two games. </connor>
<connor> One was for Christmas and one's for my birthday </connor>
<connor> and that was like the N64. </connor>
<connor> Game Boy was like, this was like the early steam sale. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I would just like the humble bumble. </joey>
<joey> - Was free will instead. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I would just go, I would just go and come in </joey>
<joey> every year and be like, motherfucker, </joey>
<garnt> I'm about to buy 15 games for like 10 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I felt good. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't like the Chad like fucking like, </joey>
<joey> "I'll take everything from here to here please." </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, it was such a good childhood experience. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like to sit down </garnt>
<garnt> and just I would be there for about two hours </garnt>
<garnt> and they would like, every game would have a different code. </garnt>
<joey> I would fill up like A4 piece of paper with just codes. </joey>
<joey> I'm like mother, give me all these games </joey>
<joey> and I wouldn't even play all them games, </joey>
<joey> but it just felt good buying them. </joey>
<garnt> I felt rich for once. </garnt>
<joey> - It's because there was so many. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it was about the Game Boy Advance </joey>
<joey> where it was like didn't know there was a game with that, </joey>
<joey> but there is on the Game Boy Advance. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Well, I used to trade games with the other kids. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I did that too. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just the games that I was done with </joey>
<connor> like Scooby-Doo Adventure, I'm pretty okay </connor>
<connor> knowing I won't play this again. </connor>
<connor> - If we go back to the lying thing, </connor>
<connor> I've lied to one of my friends-- </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What did you lie? </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<connor> - So, I had this fucking like Mickey Mouse game </connor>
<connor> on Game Boy Advance which I fucking hated. </connor>
<connor> I don't know where I got it. </connor>
<connor> - Did you hustle some kid? </connor>
<connor> Did you hustle some 12-year-old? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know where I got it from, </connor>
<connor> I think I got it from like a cousin's hand me down </connor>
<connor> or something, right? </connor>
<connor> But it was like, it was in that bundle of like two or three, </connor>
<connor> like shitty, like not known IP, </connor>
<connor> get why does this exist type of Game Boy Advance games </connor>
<connor> that you get and one of them was this Mickey Mouse </connor>
<connor> like fucking platform a game. </connor>
<connor> I don't even remember what the fuck it was, but yeah, </connor>
<connor> I was in school and my friend was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh I got the new," this is when Emerald came out. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - But side Ruby and Sapphire at the time, right? </garnt>
<connor> But I didn't have Emerald and I was like, </connor>
<connor> I really wanna play it. </connor>
<connor> - No, no! </connor>
<garnt> - So I was like and his friend, </garnt>
<garnt> my friend wanted like to play this other like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't remember if it was a Pokemon game or Mario game </connor>
<connor> or something, like one of the main line games. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "I really wanna play this" and I said, </connor>
<connor> y'all got that game. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - So what I did was I had, the thing is I did have the game, </connor>
<connor> but I didn't wanna give it to him. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I had the box for it. </connor>
<connor> - No! - No! </connor>
<connor> - So I did it. </connor>
<connor> - Mickey Mouse. </connor>
<connor> I fucking gebated him </connor>
<connor> and I slipped the Mickey Mouse game into the Mario box </connor>
<joey> and I was like, here you go mate, inbox. </joey>
<joey> Don't have to check it, now you can check it </joey>
<joey> when you get home, right? </joey>
<joey> And I took Emerald from him </joey>
<joey> and I still have that Emerald cartridge to this day. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, did his mom not call you out your mama who like, </connor>
<connor> be like, "What the fuck, your kids scammed my kid." </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, maybe he really liked the Mickey Mouse game. </joey>
<connor> - Cause in the UK, there was these like </connor>
<connor> you'd have like footballer cards. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right? </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> Like Fantasy Football? </connor>
<connor> (Connor murmuring) </connor>
<joey> - I don't know who was good. </joey>
<joey> I didn't care about football. </joey>
<joey> I just wanted the best stuff cause I was like, it's a game, </joey>
<connor> I want the best and I was a real hustler, man. </connor>
<connor> I would do deals, I'd be like that stockbroker being like, </connor>
<connor> "I can give you this, I can give you that." </connor>
<connor> "Maybe, I don't know" and one time I remember, </connor>
<connor> I was really annoyed cause this one kid, </connor>
<connor> he did a really stupid trade with me and I was like, </connor>
<connor> sucks to be human. </connor>
<connor> He gave me like one whole DTO for like some two players </connor>
<connor> that were terrible and I was like profit, stocks </connor>
<connor> and I went home, right? </connor>
<connor> I thought, great. </connor>
<connor> I'm looking at my collection of cards. </connor>
<connor> This is amazing, I've done such great business today. </connor>
<connor> I was literally like Trump out of the deal at school. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, making good trades </connor>
<connor> and I'm just chilling at home, admiring my collection </connor>
<connor> and my mum comes in being like, </connor>
<connor> "Connor, what have you done?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what have I done? </connor>
<connor> She's like, "Tim's mom has called up. </connor>
<connor> "She's furious. </connor>
<connor> "You apparently you stole a card from him." </connor>
<connor> I'm like I didn't steal a car from Tim. </connor>
<connor> Tim's a fucking liar. </connor>
<connor> Tim gave me Ronaldinho for two of these shitty players. </connor>
<connor> She's like, "Really?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, yeah, yeah, get him on the phone. </connor>
<connor> I'll tell him what happened. </connor>
<connor> And so I'm arguing with him </connor>
<connor> and he's like crying on the phone, being like, </connor>
<connor> "That wasn't a fair trade, you scammed me." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I didn't scam you, I don't know who's good. </connor>
<connor> I just saw that this game was shiny and you gave it to me </connor>
<connor> and then I got fucking, I had to apologize and give it back </connor>
<connor> cause he made a dumb trade. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, that kid got lucky. </joey>
<joey> - That doesn't happen in the real world kid. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I'm like in the real world </joey>
<connor> that guy never would've got his money back. </connor>
<connor> He deserved to take the other guy. </connor>
<connor> I was so pissed, I was like, mom, </connor>
<connor> you interfered in my negotiations. </connor>
<connor> Do you know how irresponsible that is? </connor>
<connor> That kid should have learned the hard way, </connor>
<joey> that he made a bad trade. </joey>
<joey> - Your mom literally did like a CIA drug bust. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was like-- </connor>
<connor> - Doom, doom, doom, open the door! </connor>
<connor> - Even like 12-year-old me is like, </connor>
<connor> I think he should deal with the consequences. </connor>
<connor> It was a bad deal. </connor>
<connor> - He agreed to it. </connor>
<connor> - He should learn now that this shit hurts </connor>
<connor> when you make a bad deal. </connor>
<garnt> - He needs to learn a valuable lesson. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> He learned the hard way. </connor>
<connor> - Clearly, his mom is cuddling him too much and helping him. </connor>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> Like the fucking Melvin capital? </connor>
<connor> Like the fucking the stock trade? </connor>
<connor> What's the American stock trade, </connor>
<connor> like people who watch the things being-- </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. - I don't fucking know that. </connor>
<connor> - Game stops getting out of hand. </connor>
<connor> We have to stop this, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> They literally did that to me. </connor>
<connor> This is fucked up, terrible. </connor>
<garnt> I was furious. </garnt>
<garnt> - I kind of like talking about this </garnt>
<garnt> is bringing back memories for me as well </garnt>
<joey> cause the only time I've ever liked tried to hustle people </joey>
<joey> was during like the Pokemon card era. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - Yeah, I do. </joey>
<joey> - There was so much, I think he just got normalized </joey>
<garnt> that just kids would just try to hustle each other. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll give you a 100 energies for Ho-ho. </connor>
<connor> Please, please. </connor>
<joey> - I swear like around the world, </joey>
<joey> like we had the fucking like, the big like cocaine thing </joey>
<garnt> in the 80s, but like the 2,000 was like the Pokemon card </garnt>
<garnt> equivalent and like everyone was like, </garnt>
<joey> "I'm gonna fucking scam everybody for this." </joey>
<connor> - You don't know real hustle man until you've been in school </connor>
<connor> trading Pokemon or pugs or whatever the it is like. </connor>
<connor> I said, that's like, that's where the real negotiations </connor>
<connor> happen, I'll tell you what? </connor>
<connor> That's where I learned the art of the deal. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Cause like away from the streets. </connor>
<connor> - I lived the hard way. </connor>
<connor> - Cause like I remember when I first getting into Pokemon, </connor>
<joey> I just had like the worst "Gacha" luck. </joey>
<connor> I was buying so many expansion packs that I got nothing. </connor>
<connor> So I had like no value that I could trade with. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just like, what can I scrounge up </connor>
<connor> that I could sell to people with value. </connor>
<connor> So going back to the the old game game cartridges </connor>
<connor> that I would always buy. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So I knew, right? </connor>
<garnt> Even as a kid, I knew like those game cartridges </garnt>
<garnt> that you get that says 400 games in one game cartridge, </garnt>
<garnt> I would always buy them and I'd tried playing them, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, they would have like the shitest games. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's normally 30 games or like 30 games that repeat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was like 30 games </garnt>
<joey> from like a game that was like a Chinese rip off </joey>
<joey> from like the older generation cartridge. </joey>
<joey> - And there's like eight different versions </joey>
<garnt> of Tetris on that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I'm just like, I don't need these in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> I'ma try to sell them. </garnt>
<connor> I'ma try to hustle these for Pokemon cards. </connor>
<connor> So, because I got these in like Southeast Asia, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it was like in your town, </connor>
<connor> but like you couldn't really get like knockoff </connor>
<garnt> game card cartridges or knockoff game as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I only ever like saw them once and my mind was blown. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, how the fuck did you get this? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So I would go up to kids on the playground </connor>
<garnt> and be like, yo, you gotta Chinese Charles OD, </garnt>
<connor> lemme let me introduce to you to my game cartridges. </connor>
<connor> Yo, this game cartridge says 30 games on it. </connor>
<connor> - Going as the recommended retail price of one game. </connor>
<connor> That could be up to $10,000. </connor>
<connor> - So I basically pawned off these cartridges </connor>
<joey> that I wasn't gonna play for shiny Pokemon cards </joey>
<joey> and that's how I got like at one point </joey>
<joey> the most like shiny Pokemon cards on the playground </joey>
<garnt> and then I left three of them in my life fucking jean pocket </garnt>
<joey> in the wash and they were just gone. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no! </joey>
<garnt> - Lost. </garnt>
<connor> - I used to do something similar to that, </connor>
<connor> but with Yu-Gi-Oh cards, cause Pokemon cards </connor>
<connor> got very quickly banned from my school </connor>
<connor> cause like all the kids would just like, even during class </connor>
<connor> would just be fucking playing around with it, right? </connor>
<joey> So we were like, all right, </joey>
<joey> well, the teachers already know what a Charaza looks like. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Shit, they're in it on the inside. </connor>
<connor> - But they don't know what blue eyes, </connor>
<connor> white dragon looks like. </connor>
<connor> - What part of greed looks like. </connor>
<connor> - So let's move on to Yu-Gi-Oh cards </connor>
<connor> and I got so into like the hustling of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, </connor>
<connor> like to the point where like it was the peak </connor>
<garnt> of fucking Obelisk? </garnt>
<garnt> The fucking like, you collect the five pieces of Obelisk </garnt>
<garnt> in your hand and you're like automatically win </garnt>
<garnt> the game like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. - Xodia. </connor>
<connor> - Xodia, Xodia, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Obelisk. - Obelisk is a different one. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, Xodia, yeah. </connor>
<joey> So it was the five pieces of Xodia, right? </joey>
<connor> - Well, you could, that was like a starter deck </connor>
<connor> that you could buy, everyone had Xodia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right, but not everyone </connor>
<connor> had all the pieces, right? </connor>
<joey> Because the Xodia, cause you usually in those starter packs, </joey>
<joey> you'd get one piece of Xodia. </joey>
<connor> - I remember in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I just did remember this? </connor>
<joey> They literally sold a deck that had all the five </joey>
<joey> Xodia that you could do buy for like 20 bucks. </joey>
<connor> - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Because for us, it was like the old the booster pack </joey>
<joey> was like you'd maybe get one piece of equipment. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there was booster pack, </joey>
<connor> there was like starter packs, I had all of them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Okay, okay, so we didn't have that luxury in Australia, </joey>
<joey> so the only way someone could physically get all pieces </joey>
<joey> of the Xodia, was to do a bunch of hustling and trading </joey>
<joey> and get all the pieces and so as like a 10-year-old, </joey>
<connor> I had like one Xodia thing, but I was like, </connor>
<connor> I love this guy so much, I wanna collect all of them. </connor>
<connor> All my friends have all these other pieces, </connor>
<garnt> but they're not gonna trade it to me </garnt>
<connor> because they realize the value of Xodia </connor>
<garnt> on this market right now. </garnt>
<connor> So I did ask, went up to my dad and I was like, </connor>
<connor> father you work for a printing company, don't you? </connor>
<joey> You have a high quality printers at your work. </joey>
<joey> Here's some P and Gs of Xodia. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Could you print them out onto card paper </joey>
<connor> and give them to me? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Any full-on like printed out </connor>
<connor> these like pirated fucking Xodia </connor>
<connor> and they were like shitty, </connor>
<connor> like 240P qualities of Xodia, right? </connor>
<joey> But as a 10-year-old, you don't know the fucking difference. </joey>
<connor> - Oh shit, I just got mad flashbacks. </connor>
<connor> Holy fuck! </connor>
<joey> - So I would come to school and I'd be like boys, </joey>
<connor> I have all my pieces of Xodia. </connor>
<connor> - On terrible, like printed ink stained. </connor>
<connor> - One of them is in like 1080 P </connor>
<connor> and the other is like three pixels. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Kids are like, "Wow!" </connor>
<joey> It's like, I can trade them off to you as well, if you want. </joey>
<connor> - Man, I remember that like, I really, really wanted like, </connor>
<connor> I think there was like element heroes or something </connor>
<connor> and there's like Yu-Gi-Oh XD collection or something. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And my friend had them all, </connor>
<connor> but I wish I looked a little closer </connor>
<connor> because he traded me them and I was like I want them </connor>
<connor> pretty badly and then I got them and I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh wait. </connor>
<connor> They're like the descriptions really weird </connor>
<connor> and it was all just like gibberish, </connor>
<connor> like fake Chinese sounding stuff and then I realized, </connor>
<connor> when I looked a little closer, it was like printed </connor>
<connor> all like fucked and I was like, wait, I just got hustled. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it was all fucking and I was like, so sad. </connor>
<joey> I was like, where the fuck did you get this. </joey>
<joey> - You literally got scammed into a Chinese knockoff. </joey>
<connor> - But like you feel them, they look good. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't look bad. </connor>
<connor> Then when you look at the quality a little more </connor>
<connor> and you're like, oh wait. </connor>
<connor> - Enhance. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah and then you see like the text </connor>
<connor> and you're like why is it weird </connor>
<connor> fucking like Chinese sounding ass thing. </connor>
<garnt> - If you wanna see something like anxiety-inducing right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember I talked about rhystic studies before </garnt>
<garnt> about how he makes magic videos. </garnt>
<joey> So in his Black Lotus videos, </joey>
<joey> so like black load is a thing, like one of the rarest cards </joey>
<joey> or expensive magic. </joey>
<joey> Most expensive cards, </joey>
<joey> so he talks about how you would like figure out </joey>
<connor> what a fake one is to a real one </connor>
<connor> and apparently one of the ways they used to test this </connor>
<connor> is called the bend test where you will take this card </connor>
<connor> and you will literally have to bend it. </connor>
<connor> Like, imagine this is the card, </connor>
<connor> so you literally have to bend it there </connor>
<connor> and if it's a real card, it won't crease at all, </connor>
<garnt> but seeing this like $2,000 card being bent like that, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter if it bends or not, </garnt>
<garnt> I get anxiety and I have zero knowledge about magic </garnt>
<garnt> or any investment in magic at all. </garnt>
<connor> - All I know is there's a video where a guy </connor>
<connor> just casually talking and he's opening packs </connor>
<connor> and then he opens it and he gets a Black Lotus </connor>
<connor> and he starts. </connor>
<connor> (Connor screaming) </connor>
<connor> Like that, it's so funny. </connor>
<connor> He's like casually talking </connor>
<connor> and then just starts freaking out. </connor>
<connor> I gotta find the link to that clip, it's so weird. </connor>
<joey> - [Narrator] And then the other on is boo! </joey>
<joey> Holy boosh! </joey>
<joey> (Narrator giggling) </joey>
<garnt> That's a fucking Black Lotus. </garnt>
<joey> Holy God. </joey>
<joey> - That's like the one thing I've been enjoying </joey>
<garnt> about like this resurgence of like opening Pokemon cards. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like people just like casually talking </garnt>
<joey> and then just pulling something really and be like. </joey>
<joey> - People turn it into gambling. </joey>
<joey> That's flat return. - Pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - Cause if you turn anything into gambling, </joey>
<connor> it's 10 times more fun. </connor>
<garnt> - Is this how people feel when they watch us roll </garnt>
<connor> for fucking "Gacha" you on this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the exactly. </connor>
<joey> This is why I went on a rant. </joey>
<connor> - This is why "Gacha" streamed for a long time. </connor>
<joey> Did so fucking well cause people love it when. </joey>
<joey> Like that dude who fucking, that Japanese, </joey>
<joey> like streamer, who was, what was he fucking doing? </joey>
<connor> He was doing Arknights rolling. </connor>
<joey> - There was a guy rolling in Arknights, </joey>
<connor> he was dressed up as a Yogi. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, that's right and he had life? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, every time he did a "Gacha" poll, </joey>
<connor> like his life points would go down and the Yogi was like. </connor>
<connor> And he was like screaming </connor>
<joey> - He did like a fool, voice acting. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, he was voice acting and then he was like </connor>
<joey> and when he pulled every time he would make it sound </joey>
<joey> like he was like summoning. </joey>
<joey> - He would like draw. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, he was like draw and then-- </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It fun really fucking good clip. </garnt>
<joey> It's so funny. </joey>
<joey> Hopefully we can play it for like one second. </joey>
<joey> It's really funny. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, God, that's way too much act. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I can't be bothered to like come up </joey>
<joey> with like exciting things like that for streams </joey>
<joey> which is why I'm always impressed with like </joey>
<joey> how recently you've been doing. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like at that point </garnt>
<garnt> you have to treat streams the ways the same way </garnt>
<garnt> you treat YouTube videos. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I kinda I do sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, right now when I'm just playing Apex </garnt>
<garnt> over and over again, I'd already say it that way, </garnt>
<garnt> but like when I'm doing certain things, </garnt>
<connor> I do think of it as like, </connor>
<connor> oh, just think of it as if you're making a video. </connor>
<connor> - All right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then just talk to the audience </connor>
<connor> that happened to also be watching you made this video. </connor>
<connor> That's the way I see it </connor>
<connor> and I think that when you think of it like that </connor>
<connor> it's a lot easier to actually make good content </connor>
<connor> live streaming, </connor>
<connor> but if you don't have that frame of reference </connor>
<connor> of how does it feel to make a video? </connor>
<connor> Cause obviously we have like five years of experience </connor>
<connor> of talking to the camera, making a video, </connor>
<connor> but if you'd never had any of those, </connor>
<connor> it's like, how do I explain how you should behave? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Good content, but then again, </connor>
<connor> I think I've still like a lot that I can improve on, </connor>
<garnt> so I'm getting there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it's a different field, </garnt>
<garnt> but the way I see it is that, I think either of us </garnt>
<garnt> can become successful streamers. </garnt>
<garnt> I just think I don't have the energy to put into it </garnt>
<garnt> because I would have to use the energy </garnt>
<connor> that I put into making YouTube videos </connor>
<connor> into making Twitch streams. </connor>
<garnt> They come like whole and-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, there's, there's so many YouTubers here </garnt>
<connor> end up just stopping YouTube and gotta be a Twitch streamer </connor>
<connor> or vice versa, </connor>
<connor> it's normally YouTube has become too expensive. </connor>
<joey> - For me, the thing that is just stopping me </joey>
<joey> from making that transition is the fact </joey>
<joey> that I wouldn't be able to take a vacation. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's like YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Before I moved to Japan, people didn't know </connor>
<joey> that I didn't do any work for a month </joey>
<joey> cause I was busy doing stuff, </joey>
<joey> but I prepared enough videos in advance </joey>
<joey> like everything was running perfectly smooth. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - But I was able to take a month off. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Which is like, oh my God, that's nuts. </connor>
<connor> - You take a month off as a streamer, </connor>
<garnt> like basically your fucked. </garnt>
<joey> - People would know. </joey>
<garnt> You just disappear off the face of the earth. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty much. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, which is why, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> Right now it's just like a fun little side hobby right now, </connor>
<connor> but I've noticed that I tend to, I use still, </connor>
<connor> when I would do YouTube videos, </connor>
<connor> once I finished with the video, </connor>
<connor> I would think about, alright, what's the next YouTube </connor>
<connor> video I'm gonna make? </connor>
<connor> And I would think about that all day. </connor>
<connor> What am I gonna make? </connor>
<connor> What am I gonna do? </connor>
<connor> Oh, I can make this, I can make that, </connor>
<connor> but like now I don't really think that way. </connor>
<connor> I think like, I plan what videos I'm going to do </connor>
<connor> and then I don't really think about them. </connor>
<connor> I just kind of, until the day comes where I'm making it </connor>
<connor> I'm like, all right, trying to make a YouTube video </connor>
<connor> which I feel is more healthier in some ways, </connor>
<garnt> but it feels weird. </garnt>
<connor> It feels like I care less, but I think it's a good thing. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I've had to try and change my mentality </connor>
<connor> towards that as well, </connor>
<connor> where especially hanging out with you guys </connor>
<connor> and just all constantly compared to you guys </connor>
<connor> feeling like I'm behind schedule </connor>
<connor> and that's because I'm very like, </connor>
<connor> my content is very like inspiration based. </connor>
<connor> I find it so hard to work on a video </connor>
<connor> if I don't feel like working on the video. </connor>
<connor> I can't just like force the video out, </connor>
<connor> so I have to basically try and schedule enough ideas </connor>
<garnt> ahead of videos I wanna work on </garnt>
<garnt> in order for me to be able to meet that like schedule. </garnt>
<connor> - See, I think inspiration is a little bullshit. </connor>
<joey> I think, I think you can't rely on inspiration at all. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<garnt> - I think if you did what you did for the BBC. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't have a choice if inspiration or not. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's a different career path, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's comparing like a office job to a creative path. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but I think for any creative field </connor>
<garnt> it's important to discipline yourself to-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's something you have to learn, but it's just-- </connor>
<connor> - If I get inspiration, it's fantastic, I love it, </connor>
<garnt> but it's so fleeting and motivation is so fleeting as well, </garnt>
<joey> it's like, you just have to discipline yourself to work. </joey>
<joey> - I'm kind of like halfway in between I think. </joey>
<joey> Like, yeah, of course if I have to, if time is crunching </joey>
<joey> and I have to record something in order to make the deadline </joey>
<joey> then obviously, regardless of if I'm feeling inspired </joey>
<joey> or not I'll have to do it, but for the most part, </joey>
<joey> it's like, I wake up in the morning and I think, </joey>
<joey> okay, do I have to record today? </joey>
<joey> Then okay, I'll record, but if I don't have to </joey>
<joey> and I don't feel like it, I'm not gonna fucking force myself </joey>
<connor> to do it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean there's some days where my mood is so bad </connor>
<garnt> that I'm clear it's gonna come off in the video, </garnt>
<garnt> so I just don't wanna do it, but then it also in that time, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, if I was gonna make a video, </garnt>
<joey> well, I can't do that today, </joey>
<joey> I'll do something else that's productive </joey>
<connor> that can force me to keep on top of things. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - But like recently I feel like </connor>
<joey> I haven't really had that choice because I think the past </joey>
<connor> like four videos I've recorded this week </connor>
<joey> have all been pre-scheduled on like certain days </joey>
<joey> and certain times, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean that's what I try and do. </joey>
<joey> I try and leave a lot of videos that are in the works, </joey>
<joey> a lot of videos that are ahead, </joey>
<joey> so there's always something I can work on. </joey>
<joey> I don't like to just finish a video and be like, </joey>
<joey> I got nothing, what am I doing? </joey>
<joey> What's next? </joey>
<joey> Huh? </joey>
<connor> I think it's good to have multiple things your working on. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, you have to plan for the next one </joey>
<connor> as your making the previous one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is also a thing </connor>
<connor> that's quite difficult for the way I used to work. </connor>
<joey> Cause I used to like, I had to do one thing at a time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, same, same. - But now yeah, I've got-- </joey>
<connor> - Now I'm juggling like seven different videos. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, something like that, I've got quite a lot. </joey>
<connor> - For me, I'm either working on seven </connor>
<connor> or I have no idea what I'm working on. </connor>
<connor> No in-between and I need to change that, </connor>
<connor> but that's why I feel like I find it so scary </connor>
<connor> if I was a Twitch streamer, cause the Twitch streamer, </connor>
<connor> you have to start streaming no matter what mood you're in </connor>
<connor> and I feel like that it's so much harder to hide that </connor>
<joey> on a Twitch stream rather than a YouTube channel, </joey>
<garnt> where you can just-- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because it's constantly on camera. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - It's true. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I think the one thing that's even worse </garnt>
<garnt> than starting the stream when you're in a bad mood </garnt>
<joey> is when your mood sours midstream. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. - You totally shit God. </joey>
<connor> - I can call that. </connor>
<joey> - When you'll start, liken whole happy-- </joey>
<connor> - You'll start in like an hour </connor>
<connor> and then maybe you'll get like a text from someone </connor>
<garnt> that's like telling you like bad news </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe someone will say something </garnt>
<connor> that's like real fucking mood or maybe something happened, </connor>
<connor> like the stream starts to go wrong. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like when stuff starts going wrong </connor>
<connor> whilst you're streaming, it is so much more mentally taxing </connor>
<joey> than when if then starting the stream in a bad mood </joey>
<joey> cause you're like, it can't get worse. </joey>
<connor> I'm already in a bad mood. </connor>
<connor> - It's like fucking up on stage </connor>
<connor> in front of an audience, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Versus just up in a recording booth. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's big difference. </joey>
<joey> - Like some fucking clown. </joey>
<joey> This actually didn't bother me that much, </joey>
<joey> but this is like an example of something </joey>
<connor> that could happen, so like whilst I was streaming one time </connor>
<joey> something happened on my discord server, </joey>
<joey> where one of the mods made someone else a mod </joey>
<joey> who was pretending to be a mod. </joey>
<joey> So someone joined my discord server saying, "Hi." </joey>
<joey> For some reason, I'm not a moderate anymore </joey>
<joey> and they have the same profile picture </joey>
<joey> and the same name as a moderator </joey>
<joey> and someone else on my server thought, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, that checks out. </joey>
<joey> "That makes total sense." </joey>
<joey> Gave the moderator and then they just start injecting </joey>
<connor> a bunch of bots into my server and started like spamming it, </connor>
<joey> so my discord server completely got raided </joey>
<joey> whilst I was streaming </joey>
<joey> and the whole purpose of this person doing this </joey>
<joey> was to do it to people who are streaming live, </joey>
<joey> so they could get a reaction. </joey>
<connor> So I'm there, it's happening and all my chat is like, </connor>
<connor> "Connor, Connor, your fucking discord's on fire" </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it'll get dealed with. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Who cares. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's something you can deal with later. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's like that, but it's frustrating </connor>
<connor> when everyone was like, "Bro, bro, you need to look at this. </connor>
<connor> "Look at this thing." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I don't really give a shit, </connor>
<garnt> like I'll deal with it later. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I was good cause that guy was going around </garnt>
<joey> trying to film TikToK reactions of streamers getting angry </joey>
<joey> and I was like glad I didn't know that at the time, </joey>
<connor> but I was like, I'm glad I didn't fucking react </connor>
<connor> cause I was like, oh, okay, cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Sounds like an asshole, dick thing to move. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, don't do that. - Who does this shit? </garnt>
<garnt> People want attention, right? </garnt>
<connor> It is what it is, nothing new. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, nothing new you in the world. </garnt>
<connor> - You just gotta deal with people </connor>
<connor> who always look in to attack you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, I get that sometimes. </joey>
<joey> I get every now and then these like obviously people </joey>
<connor> who are just coming into Twitch chat </connor>
<connor> just to fucking get a reaction out of you, </connor>
<connor> just spam bullshit and the best thing I do that just works </connor>
<garnt> is like, I respond to them, but in the most dead pan </garnt>
<connor> fucking voice ever where it's like-- </connor>
<connor> - Your normal-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, literally just my normal like talking voice </connor>
<connor> as if I'm like responding to chat and sure enough </connor>
<connor> they eventually just go away </connor>
<connor> because that's what they want in the end. </connor>
<joey> In the end they want you to be like, how fucking dare you </joey>
<connor> say something like that. </connor>
<connor> You're such an asshole. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I already worry too much about it. </connor>
<joey> I just stare at them, do what they wanna do. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but like a lot of streamers </connor>
<joey> who are just starting off can't really process that, right? </joey>
<joey> You're just buying into the bait. </joey>
<connor> - It's hard to wrap your head around </connor>
<garnt> that people are just gonna do mean things to you </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's nothing personal. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's nothing personal, people just do this. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's sad that, that's part of the job, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I could like, there's someone out there who I have no idea </garnt>
<connor> who they are, I have no interaction with them ever, </connor>
<connor> I've never spoken to them and for some reason </connor>
<connor> they just wanna see bad shit happen to me. </connor>
<connor> I'm like that's really difficult to accept that, </connor>
<garnt> that's a reality. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause it takes you a few years </garnt>
<connor> I think to like actually accept that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Absolutely. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know when I started </connor>
<connor> just kind of like getting over it and just being like, </connor>
<connor> all right, you know what? </connor>
<connor> It's gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it was like two, three years ago, </connor>
<garnt> I was just like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably when it happened enough times </garnt>
<garnt> and you just kind of get used to it and it's sad enough-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you can't do anything about it. </garnt>
<connor> You just gotta not let it ruin your day. </connor>
<joey> - You think about a logically, right? </joey>
<joey> Your being like, well I've never interacted </joey>
<connor> with this person, I don't know what this person looks like </connor>
<connor> or what they're like as a person. </connor>
<garnt> They don't know what they look like, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I've never interacted with them. </garnt>
<garnt> So they're obviously not saying all this shit </garnt>
<joey> out of any logical basis. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So why would I take any logical basis </joey>
<connor> out of what they're saying? </connor>
<joey> - No, it's true, it's true. </joey>
<connor> I guess it was always to be sad as long as I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> man if they actually just spoke to me, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure they'd pretty see that I'm a nice guy </garnt>
<connor> and they wouldn't wanna do this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah, that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> - Speaking of assholes online. </joey>
<joey> I wanna quick rant. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, go for it. - Because I know we've talked </joey>
<connor> about "Attack On Titan," like plenty. </connor>
<connor> - All right, all right, here we go. </connor>
<connor> - Great start. - Is it the weekly </connor>
<connor> "Attack On Titan". </connor>
<connor> - The weekly "Attack On Titan" rant segment. </connor>
<connor> I'm getting so fucking tired of spoilers. </connor>
<connor> It's gotten to the point now where my enjoyment of this </connor>
<connor> is getting fucking ruined because of spoilers online. </connor>
<connor> Like logging on to Twitter now, </connor>
<connor> especially on a Monday, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like I'm trying not to be spoiled </connor>
<connor> on the "Attack On Titan." </connor>
<connor> It's like trying to go to like a crowded hospital </connor>
<connor> without a face mask and expecting not to get Covid. </connor>
<connor> That's like it's, I've been spoiled now </connor>
<connor> on so many plot points of "Attack On Titan" </connor>
<connor> that I feel like as someone who likes to binge shows </connor>
<connor> and as someone who doesn't wanna, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna keep up with it like weekly, right? </connor>
<connor> But I feel like I'm being held at gunpoint </connor>
<garnt> just to keep up with this weekly. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel you on that. </joey>
<connor> - You should go through the Wiki </connor>
<garnt> and get every character name </garnt>
<garnt> and you should mute them on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I've done. </garnt>
<garnt> I've done that and yet still I would be on a run for it. </garnt>
<joey> - It sips through the cracks. </joey>
<garnt> - There's no way to stop the cracks </garnt>
<garnt> and what I don't understand is why is it that </garnt>
<garnt> when we talk about spoiler culture, </garnt>
<garnt> why is it that with a show like "Attack On Titan" </garnt>
<garnt> it's fine to talk about it as soon as it airs? </garnt>
<joey> - It's because everyone, all the "Attack On Titan" fans </joey>
<joey> expect that everyone is watching it </joey>
<joey> as the episode comes out. </joey>
<garnt> - Because we have something like the "Avengers." </garnt>
<connor> - So wait, so wait, you think it's not okay to talk about it </connor>
<connor> after it airs? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I think there should be a buffer period. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we have this for the "Avengers." </garnt>
<garnt> Why can we not have this for "Attack On Titan" </garnt>
<garnt> or any other TV show? </garnt>
<connor> - What's your buffer period? </connor>
<garnt> I don't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, there was a massive fucking buffer period </garnt>
<garnt> where like the directors and everyone was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Please do not talk about the "Avengers End Game" </garnt>
<garnt> "for like a good two, three weeks." </garnt>
<garnt> And there is just no buffer period for like TV shows </garnt>
<garnt> and like, we're living in an age where it's like on demand. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's not even the same as it was before </garnt>
<garnt> where things are airing on TV </garnt>
<garnt> and people are watching at the same time. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's watching at different times. </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally an on demand service. </garnt>
<garnt> This episode is sponsored by BookWalker. </garnt>
<garnt> Gentlemen, have you ever heard of BookWalker before? </garnt>
<joey> - No, explain it to me. </joey>
<connor> - It is an official ebook store and app for digital manga </connor>
<connor> and light novels. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - This is Maylene's collection right here. </connor>
<connor> You've well, my God you've normally did this out. </connor>
<connor> That is not. </connor>
<garnt> Actually "Attack On Titan" front row, yeah Maylene. </garnt>
<connor> - So this is the list Maylene list I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> - Okay Maylene. - Okay Maylene. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, go back to it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, okay. </joey>
<joey> Why don't you get the app on your Android iOS device. </joey>
<garnt> You can view your purchases and read them offline </garnt>
<joey> if you download them. </joey>
<joey> - And the best of all you can customize the bookshelf </joey>
<connor> like Maylene has. </connor>
<joey> She just put the "Trash Taste" logo on it </joey>
<connor> like the true fan she is. </connor>
<connor> - Most importantly, they are simultaneously releasing </connor>
<garnt> the "Attack On Titan" manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that a good manga? </garnt>
<garnt> I've never heard it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Guys, guys, stop talking. </garnt>
<garnt> There's only two chapters left, </garnt>
<connor> so if you don't wanna get spoiled, </connor>
<connor> read it right now on global.bookwalker.jp </connor>
<garnt> - The second to last chapter was just released </garnt>
<garnt> three days ago. - What? </garnt>
<connor> - So check it out right now. </connor>
<connor> - I'm going there right now. </connor>
<connor> - Link's in the description. - Sorry guys. </connor>
<connor> I'm going right now. </connor>
<garnt> - "Attack On Titan" is a good manga. </garnt>
<connor> - I just came back to confirm I'm reading the new chapter, </connor>
<connor> it is amazing, it's amazing gone. </connor>
<connor> It's not good, it's amazing. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Go and read it on global.bookwalk.jp right now. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> I really like the community aspect of when an episode airs, </connor>
<connor> everyone talks about it, I kind of like that </connor>
<joey> - No, but there're ways to talk about it </joey>
<garnt> in ways that are not spoiling and there're places </garnt>
<joey> there're like open forums that you have to physically go </joey>
<joey> and look up, right? </joey>
<connor> - When I talk about the show on Twitter, </connor>
<joey> I try not to mention spoilers. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Every tweet you've tweeted about "Attack On Titan" </joey>
<connor> it's fine because you're not spoiling it, </connor>
<garnt> but you still leave open for discussion, right? </garnt>
<connor> - But there're some-- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I still mute it right away. </connor>
<connor> - There're some fucking kids who just do not understand that </connor>
<connor> and they're just like, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, of course everyone is watching it." </joey>
<connor> - (indistinct) 4K picture, </connor>
<connor> I can't believe this character died. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It is like, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - It is like there's like some motherfuckers </joey>
<joey> who will literally like put a full spoiler </joey>
<joey> and then like put a spoiler warning </joey>
<joey> five minutes after they just spoiled with the fucking thing </joey>
<joey> they talked about man. </joey>
<garnt> Right now, social media is like setting a minefield. </garnt>
<joey> - I've understood the whole like spoiler warning </joey>
<joey> at the beginning of a tweet. </joey>
<joey> It was like, how about you just don't tweet it </joey>
<connor> - Actually it's I honestly not gonna lie, </connor>
<connor> it saved me a few times. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Really? </connor>
<connor> - Cause I'll read the top of it about a show </connor>
<connor> and I'll see a picture and I'll quickly scroll </connor>
<connor> cause I'm like, all right, sick. </connor>
<connor> That's for the warning actually saved me. </connor>
<joey> - All right, to me, it's just the most pointless </joey>
<joey> fucking warning. </joey>
<joey> - It's better than nothing, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, I would rather just you not spoiling it to be honest. </joey>
<connor> - But I understand, right? </connor>
<connor> Cause "Attack On Titan," </connor>
<garnt> I wish I could tweet about like the details of the show </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit more, but I know that </garnt>
<connor> because I've like quite a large following </connor>
<joey> that I'm gonna have spoil it up for someone, </joey>
<joey> so I don't wanna do that. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I literally like every time I-- </joey>
<garnt> - But I do think that if you go on Twitter on a Monday </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan and you haven't watched the newest episode, </garnt>
<connor> honestly, that's kind of on you. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, thanks for the victim blame right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - So if you guys don't know "Attack On Titan" airs </garnt>
<connor> I think in the evening in America, but it airs like 5:00 a.m </connor>
<connor> on a Monday for us. </connor>
<connor> So first thing I do every Monday when I wake up </connor>
<connor> is I watch the episode, I don't open Twitter, </connor>
<connor> I don't do any cause I'm not being funny. </connor>
<connor> I know the internet, they're gonna spoil it. </connor>
<connor> There's nothing you can say here or ever do </connor>
<connor> that will stop them from doing that, </connor>
<joey> so why not just watch it? </joey>
<joey> - I feel though that this "Attack On Titan" incident </joey>
<joey> is like almost unprecedented. </joey>
<joey> Like I don't think there's ever been an anime </joey>
<joey> that has been where the amount of spoilers on Twitter </joey>
<joey> has been this prelevant. </joey>
<garnt> - There's been none and I remember </garnt>
<garnt> because "Attack On Titan" season three, part two, </garnt>
<joey> I thought, I got spoiled on some like minor things, but-- </joey>
<garnt> - Is it that bad? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't see that many spoilers online. </garnt>
<connor> - I see so many. </connor>
<connor> - I see it on Twitter trending page. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah! - Oh! </garnt>
<connor> - Like that's how you know it's getting bad. </connor>
<connor> When literally when you go to Twitter trending some weeks </connor>
<garnt> and I've seen it some weeks, it's it shows you the tagline </garnt>
<garnt> or the hashtag or whatever word is trending </garnt>
<garnt> and then underneath gives the spoiler and I'm like what? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, that is a little scammy. </joey>
<connor> Okay, I can understand. </connor>
<garnt> - That's never happened to any anime series. </garnt>
<joey> - That has never happened. </joey>
<garnt> Like recently I got, or like I knew like, </garnt>
<connor> it's the equivalent of being like, </connor>
<connor> yo, something's gonna happen with this character. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Nine times out of 10, it's probably a death. </connor>
<connor> It's probably gonna be about death </connor>
<connor> and the problem is that "Attack On Titans" </connor>
<garnt> is one of the easiest like shows to spoil out there </garnt>
<garnt> cause it only takes like one sentence or one word. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure I've seen pictures of stuff, </connor>
<connor> of like where the current manga is at </connor>
<connor> and that like I'm sure that I have seen very glimpse vicks </connor>
<connor> and when I see it and I recognize a character, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I skip, but I've seen it </connor>
<connor> and I don't know what it is, so I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> well, if they have no context this picture, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what's going on, I'm not gonna be spoiled </garnt>
<garnt> until the moment I see that frame. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, I actually disagree about that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I disagree too. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's still like spoils your experience a bit </joey>
<joey> cause there's been like for example, </joey>
<joey> there's been so many, like, let's say anime or manga </joey>
<joey> or where you see like a meme panel, right? </joey>
<joey> And this meme gets passed around and you don't know </joey>
<joey> the context it, but then you finally read </joey>
<joey> or watch whatever shows everyone's memed about </joey>
<joey> and then it could be like this read, </joey>
<joey> some of the most serious moments in like media </joey>
<joey> has been like, just ruined for me </joey>
<joey> because I've seen the meme of it and so the moment happens </joey>
<joey> and it takes you out and be like, </joey>
<joey> oh, that was, that was the moment they got memed. </joey>
<joey> Like, right now I'm reading "Tokyo Ghoul" </joey>
<joey> because I wanna see if the "Tokyo Ghoul" </joey>
<joey> manga readers are right? </joey>
<joey> And I know when that fucking Carnegie final comes up, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna laugh. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know what the context of it is. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't that fun though? </joey>
<joey> That's fun? - No, it is not fun. </joey>
<connor> - That's fun, that's fun, I had fun. </connor>
<connor> - Biggest to me, like I've had this happen where I-- </connor>
<connor> - I'm not saying that it's okay to post pictures </connor>
<connor> from the manga, I don't think anyone </connor>
<connor> should be fucking posting pictures in the manga. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, but what I'm saying-- </garnt>
<garnt> - People are still posting pictures from the anime, </garnt>
<garnt> fresh after the anime just airs. </garnt>
<joey> - What I'm saying though is that people should just avoid </joey>
<joey> posting it entirely because even if, right? </joey>
<connor> You like read the spoiler warning and you see the picture </connor>
<connor> for like a fraction of a second, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like, wait, just like no, I'm not gonna watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> Somewhere in the back of your head, </garnt>
<joey> that image is subconsciously planted. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, it is, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But here's what I've realized, right? </connor>
<connor> When you see an image of a show, right? </connor>
<connor> That you're really into and it's like it could be ages away, </connor>
<connor> you're making your own theory in your head </connor>
<connor> of why that image is happening. </connor>
<connor> - All right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you've seen it, right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so most of the time you're gonna be wrong, right? </connor>
<connor> It's not gonna be accurate. </connor>
<connor> So are you technically spoiled? </connor>
<garnt> Because you've sort of seen something </garnt>
<garnt> that's given you a vague idea of what you think </garnt>
<garnt> could be happening, but you could be totally wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you spoiled that? </garnt>
<connor> - I honestly want to come into a show </connor>
<connor> with as least </connor>
<garnt> a zero expectations as I can. - Me too, me too. </garnt>
<garnt> But what I'm saying is that like, if seeing one frame </garnt>
<connor> of a panel of a manga and anime, </connor>
<connor> obviously if it's literally a character dead on the floor, </connor>
<garnt> yeah, okay, that's very obvious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's being heavily posted around, </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, but if there's a shot of something happening </connor>
<connor> that I can't quite make out, I don't look at it long enough. </connor>
<connor> I just have some kind of vague feeling </connor>
<connor> in the back of my head. </connor>
<connor> I don't really think that's a spoiler </connor>
<joey> - Because something like that happened when </joey>
<connor> I decided to finally watch "Demon Slayer." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And like the first example we ever had at that </connor>
<garnt> was when episode 19 was trending on Twitter, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone was posting pictures and gifts of that scene. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> And of course, because I knew immediately </garnt>
<garnt> on the trending page, it says "Demons Slayer" episode 19 </garnt>
<connor> and at that point I hadn't started here, right? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, wow, eventually I wanna get to it. </connor>
<connor> So obviously I'm not gonna look at it. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna try and avoid all pictures, </connor>
<connor> but obviously when you're on Twitter </connor>
<connor> or your on the internet, </connor>
<connor> you're gonna see like fraction of a frame </connor>
<connor> or a fraction of an image, right? </connor>
<connor> And not gonna lie, when I finally caught up </connor>
<connor> to "Demon Slayer" and I got to that scene in episode 19, </connor>
<connor> I was like, this is impressive, </connor>
<connor> but I feel I would have been even more impressed </connor>
<connor> if I had no idea that this was coming up, </connor>
<connor> like everybody else, if I'd not experienced it. </connor>
<joey> - Does it take away? </joey>
<connor> - A little bit. </connor>
<joey> - It does take away. - To be honest. </joey>
<connor> I feel like it does absolutely take away. </connor>
<garnt> - I can understand that, but I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like this is epic, </garnt>
<joey> but this could have been fucking mind blowing </joey>
<joey> like it was for everybody else. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I mean, like I said, </garnt>
<garnt> we we've thought about spoiler culture </garnt>
<garnt> when something as big as the "Avengers" </garnt>
<connor> was aired in cinemas. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, like "Game of Thrones." </garnt>
<garnt> - Hope to put that, but you can argue </garnt>
<connor> that when it is such a big moment </connor>
<connor> in any media that obviously it deserves to be talked </connor>
<connor> about the moment it happens that you're like, oh my God </connor>
<connor> please tell me someone else has watched this, </connor>
<garnt> this is insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it hasn't caught up with the culture right now </garnt>
<garnt> because I could understand that for example, </garnt>
<garnt> when things were airing on TV, you had one run of it </garnt>
<garnt> and people would go around the water cooler </garnt>
<garnt> and discuss what just happens, but now, we're in a time </garnt>
<connor> when it's on demand. </connor>
<garnt> People watch things when they want to </garnt>
<garnt> and yet we still have the same like idea </garnt>
<garnt> around spoiling things as if people were watching things </garnt>
<garnt> on TV because I don't wanna watch things </garnt>
<connor> as soon as they are. </connor>
<garnt> I like binging it, hat's just how I enjoy it. </garnt>
<connor> - You should adapt to the way that you can't on Twitter. </connor>
<garnt> - This is why I missed like dedicated forums </garnt>
<garnt> because with a dedicated forum on a show, right? </garnt>
<joey> You won't know anything about the spoils of the show </joey>
<joey> unless you decide to click on the forum. </joey>
<garnt> - No, cause the way to adapt is just like I said-- </garnt>
<garnt> - How do you solve this problem on Twitter? </garnt>
<garnt> - There is no. </garnt>
<joey> - This is never gonna go away, </joey>
<joey> so why not just adapt to what's happening </joey>
<joey> cause you can't change it all the time, </joey>
<connor> change with the time bro. </connor>
<joey> - Because I don't wanna fucking wait an entire week </joey>
<garnt> for the next episode, I wanna binge it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, cause like-- </garnt>
<joey> - I hate watching shit weekly. </joey>
<garnt> - The reason I said it was because when this idea came up </garnt>
<garnt> for the "Avengers," everyone was like, yes, good, finally, </garnt>
<connor> someone said it. - That is bullshit. </connor>
<connor> I saw people swirling it on Twitter. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but probably not nearly as much as without them. </joey>
<joey> - But the thing is-- - I don't think it mattered. </joey>
<garnt> - And like everyone got shamed for doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone was just like, "Yo, you did a bad thing. </garnt>
<joey> "Don't fucking do this." </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, when we talk about TV shows </garnt>
<garnt> and especially now with the "Attack On Titan" </garnt>
<garnt> it's just everyone's just doing it willy nilly </garnt>
<garnt> and the mentality is, well, everyone's doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> So I guess that's okay and that's just acceptable. </garnt>
<connor> - This is such a hard topic to discuss. </connor>
<garnt> I wish I had like more time to prepare </garnt>
<connor> like an actual rebuttal, </connor>
<connor> but I mean, I understand where you're coming from. </connor>
<connor> I just think that in the age that we live in </connor>
<connor> now, it's always gonna be like that, </connor>
<connor> so why not just adapt to what's happening. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I like for me, I grew up watching anime </garnt>
<garnt> and manga, I mean, I've gotten used to just watching it </garnt>
<connor> in a bubble, I like enjoying like my entertainment </connor>
<connor> in a bubble and it's only recently </connor>
<connor> that I've gotten a different kind of enjoyment to see, </connor>
<connor> like to discussing it with friends and everything like that, </connor>
<garnt> but when it's something that's, I mean-- </garnt>
<connor> - In a perfect world, right? </connor>
<connor> You'd go in a coma and you would wake up </connor>
<connor> and the doctor's like, </connor>
<connor> "Bro, here's your crunchy roll account. </connor>
<connor> "Here's "Attack On Titan." </connor>
<connor> "Don't get up yet, just pretend you're still asleep. </connor>
<connor> "Watch the rest of the episodes and then leave </connor>
<connor> "and then go on Twitter." </connor>
<connor> That's the perfect world, right? </connor>
<connor> Where you can experience it, full run, no breaks, no weeks, </connor>
<connor> no bullshit on Twitter, but that's just not how it works. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know it's not how it works. </garnt>
<garnt> All I'm trying to argue is that, why is it this? </garnt>
<garnt> Why is it like, why do people not have a problem with this? </garnt>
<joey> - I think people do have a problem with it. </joey>
<joey> They're just kind of like-- </joey>
<joey> - I think especially in time like-- </joey>
<joey> - Can't do anything about it. </joey>
<joey> - In times like now, right? </joey>
<connor> Where everyone's also at home all the time, </connor>
<connor> who you're gonna talk to? </connor>
<connor> Your mom about "Attack On Titan?" </connor>
<joey> No, you're gonna go on Twitter </joey>
<connor> and talk about with your friends cause everyone's at home. </connor>
<joey> - But there's other venues to do that in. </joey>
<joey> Like isn't that the whole reason </joey>
<joey> why fucking discord was invented? </joey>
<joey> Just so you can create a private room </joey>
<joey> where you know the people you're discussing it with. </joey>
<connor> - There are some people who, </connor>
<connor> not me personally. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They don't really talk about stuff with their friends, </connor>
<connor> they just like to throw it into a void, which is okay. </connor>
<joey> - Right. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But people like that need to understand </joey>
<joey> that no one gives a shit about what you say. </joey>
<joey> - Like what I'm trying to say is if you want to discuss it, </joey>
<connor> why not discuss it on like the relevant subs vitus </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - Probably where it belongs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, there's a difference between </connor>
<connor> discussing spoilers in a dedicated here are the episode, </connor>
<garnt> here's the episode, let's just go on a thread versus </garnt>
<garnt> let's just post screenshots and stuff publicly on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> that anyone can see. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the whole assumption that, yes, </joey>
<joey> everybody who was a fan of "Attack On Titan" </joey>
<joey> and anyone who had ever search the "Attack On Titan" </joey>
<joey> is searching it because they're watching it weekly </joey>
<joey> and it's that whole missed assumption where it's like </joey>
<joey> and that's why, again, like if you wanna discuss </joey>
<joey> the fucking episode that just happened, </joey>
<connor> do it on a private discord server, </connor>
<connor> do it on a fucking subreddit </connor>
<connor> do it on a fucking closed forum. </connor>
<garnt> - What we need is spoiler etiquette. </garnt>
<garnt> We need a system in place where everyone just agrees, </garnt>
<connor> "Hey, this is how you're gonna spoil it." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, that's all I was talking about. </garnt>
<joey> I was talking about-- - That's never gonna happen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's never gonna happen. </joey>
<joey> - What I was trying to say is, </joey>
<joey> it's never gonna get to a point where everyone </joey>
<joey> follows this etiquette and everyone like, </joey>
<joey> this is like a hard and fast rule that everyone will follow. </joey>
<garnt> No, all I'm saying is like, why is there no ethicacy </garnt>
<connor> around this where people were just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, that would be--" </connor>
<garnt> - There should be common sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's all also you gotta think to the fact that okay, </garnt>
<garnt> 90% of people who were posting stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> aren't intending it so they ruin your day, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's 10% of people who are hoping </garnt>
<connor> that they get people who they spoil. </connor>
<connor> They get enjoyment knowing ruin someone's-- </connor>
<connor> - What I'm saying is like, </connor>
<connor> what it seemed around the "Avengers" </connor>
<connor> is that it was that 10% of people </connor>
<connor> that the only spoilers you got </connor>
<garnt> were people who are really looking to ruin </garnt>
<garnt> other people's day, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But at least we can all point to them and say, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, they were an asshole. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So you wanted us to become more of a normalized </connor>
<connor> asshole thing to put any-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The fact that 90% of people who were posting spoilers </connor>
<joey> on Twitter about a "Tap On Time" </joey>
<joey> aren't being called out for it, I think it's the problem. </joey>
<connor> - Do you think it's, I mean cause the anime </connor>
<connor> is arguably more popular than the manga. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right? </connor>
<connor> I think it's a little dickish people to post panels </connor>
<connor> from the manga when you can just talk about them, </connor>
<connor> not post them to Twitter when, you know that the majority </connor>
<connor> of the people are anime only. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right? </connor>
<connor> That kind of annoys me cause that makes sense to me. </connor>
<joey> - But even still just, just keep it privately bro. </joey>
<joey> - I get it posting the anime cause I'm like, </joey>
<connor> all right, everyone's watching the anime-- </connor>
<joey> - I found it a real problem where the last time I stream, </joey>
<connor> literally the first thing I had to say was, </connor>
<connor> don't ask me questions about that "Tap One Time" </connor>
<connor> because of the fact that people will like type to me </connor>
<garnt> in the chat immediately, like five minutes </garnt>
<connor> into me streaming binge, </connor>
<connor> "Hey Joey, what are your thoughts on the "Tap One Time?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I'm not gonna fucking talk about it </connor>
<connor> cause why would you assume that I've caught up to it? </connor>
<connor> Why would you assume everyone in this chat </connor>
<connor> has caught up to it? </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna do that. </connor>
<garnt> So to avoid spoilers, </garnt>
<joey> let's just not fucking talk about it at all. </joey>
<joey> That's the best way to do it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You wanna talk about it, do it in your own </garnt>
<joey> fucking DMs. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean like it's a different conversation to say, </garnt>
<connor> how much spoilers do ruin a show or ruin something? </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's a different conversation. </connor>
<connor> - That's a good conversation going. </connor>
<garnt> - I just wish there was some basic etiquette. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what I mentioned earlier about the picture, </connor>
<connor> that when you see a picture or a frame or an image </connor>
<connor> from an anime, you're like, oh man, </connor>
<connor> I wonder what that's all about. </connor>
<connor> Why has Conoci thrown his head back? </connor>
<connor> Why he been doing that? </connor>
<connor> I kind of think it's pretty cool when you have an idea </connor>
<connor> of why this is happening and that it's totally wrong. </connor>
<connor> You're like, oh, that's how it happened. </connor>
<connor> I thought this was gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> I kind of liked that. </connor>
<connor> That's kind of cool. </connor>
<connor> Not that I want, please don't do this, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes when it happens, you don't feel too spoiled </connor>
<connor> and you're like-- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but I feel it's a bit of a different story </joey>
<joey> with the Conoci thing, right? </joey>
<connor> Because it's like in the manga that's a really serious scene </connor>
<connor> and all I can imagine is (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> That's all that is playing in the back of my head, right? </joey>
<garnt> But like in the funny way, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So it really does kind of like, it's not so much a spoiler, </garnt>
<joey> it's just kind of like the gap between what you expected </joey>
<joey> and what actually happened is like a disappointment, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Cause I feel like it really much depends on the show. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think it's physically possible to spoil with Jojo. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not, you can post a panel, </connor>
<garnt> you can fully explain what's happening in the scene </garnt>
<garnt> and it won't prepare you for it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah yeah, exactly. - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember that time that limp dick fought biscuit soup </garnt>
<connor> and they kissed each other to death and you're like, </connor>
<joey> oh, is that spoiler? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I mean, yeah (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, to her I know. </joey>
<connor> That is how the fight ends. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like something like Jojo, </garnt>
<connor> it doesn't hurt your enjoyment of the series. </connor>
<connor> Part of that is the enjoyment of the series. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, it pretty makes it better </connor>
<joey> if someone explains what's happening to you-- </joey>
<connor> - You totally understand it, right? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you're like, oh. </connor>
<connor> - But a character dying in "Attack On Titan," </connor>
<joey> anyone can understand that and it ruins it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's a minefield right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanted to go on a quick first world problem rant. </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't actually an important problem. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanted to go in an off Titan rant. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah and the spoiler culture is pretty fun to talk about. </connor>
<garnt> Just discuss it, what's going on with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like, have you ever been spoiled </garnt>
<garnt> in like any big plot points that has kind of ruined </garnt>
<garnt> your enjoyment of every, any show </garnt>
<connor> or you think you would like-- </connor>
<connor> - I'm amazed at some shows that I didn't get spoiled, </connor>
<connor> like with certain plot points in "Attack On Titan," </connor>
<connor> I am like, how the fuck did I not get spoiled on this? </connor>
<connor> This shit was so goddamn obvious </connor>
<connor> that everyone was pretty talking about it </connor>
<connor> and I'm the only idiot that didn't know. </connor>
<connor> I mean, obviously I won't say it. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - But there're moments. </connor>
<connor> In recent memory, I can't remember last time I got spoiled. </connor>
<joey> - I got spoiled on the "Code Geass" ending. </joey>
<joey> - Oh! - Oh no! </joey>
<joey> - Which is why I'm so fucking passionate about this, </joey>
<garnt> - My condolences man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why I'm so fucking passionate about it </garnt>
<garnt> cause I didn't even finish season one </garnt>
<garnt> when I got spoiled on that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did you get spoiled? </garnt>
<joey> What happened? </joey>
<joey> - Because I was on some forum where they were talking </joey>
<joey> about "Code Geass" </joey>
<joey> and I didn't realize that, oh there's a second season </joey>
<joey> of "Code Geass" and people were talking about, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, so the last three episodes of season two </joey>
<joey> "was like, that was a crazy ending." </joey>
<joey> Was it? I was like, </joey>
<joey> Is there's two seasons. </joey>
<connor> - You can talk about the "Code Geass" ending now, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's like Bruce Willis at the end of, everyone knows it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think my buffer is like 10 years. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like everyone has seen it, right? </connor>
<connor> You can spoil it, it's common knowledge, right? </connor>
<joey> - Maybe we shouldn't be </joey>
<connor> cause otherwise it will sound really fucking hypocritical. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Once enough time has passed and a show is iconic enough, </connor>
<connor> I think it is totally fair game to talk about </connor>
<connor> cause it's part of pop culture at that point, </connor>
<connor> but the cookie you're sending is universally loved </connor>
<connor> and often cited as one of the best endings in anime. </connor>
<connor> You should know how it ends. </connor>
<joey> - To me though, like that buffer is still too small, right? </joey>
<joey> Like I can go ahead </joey>
<joey> and spoil like something like, "Soylent Green" </joey>
<joey> cause that's like a 60-year-old movie, right? </joey>
<connor> But like, I feel "Code Geass" </connor>
<connor> is like they're still kids today coming in, </connor>
<connor> probably having no idea what the show is about, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I don't want, look, I've been through the pain, </connor>
<joey> especially with "Code Geass," </joey>
<joey> so I'm not gonna say shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, like I got spoiled on something </garnt>
<garnt> of a similar capacity I'd say. </garnt>
<joey> I got spoiled on like the halfway point of "Death Note" </joey>
<joey> where saw something big happens. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, I was a manga spoiler as well. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the worst. </joey>
<garnt> That's the worst. </garnt>
<joey> I feel that's worse than getting spoiled on the ending </joey>
<garnt> of "Death Note." </garnt>
<garnt> - That is worse than getting spoiled </garnt>
<joey> on the ending of "Death Note." </joey>
<joey> - I think it's worse than getting spoiled for in the end. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause that was the ending of "Death Note" for me. </garnt>
<connor> - So that's, you talk about that, right? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's so iconic, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like there's some things in anime like-- </connor>
<joey> - I feel like I need to like make a survey of this </joey>
<connor> and like, depending on the survey results </connor>
<connor> is whether I can spoil it or not, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like dude 90% of people who know me know </connor>
<connor> the halfway point of "Death Note?" </connor>
<connor> - It's like saying like fucking Walter White makes meth. </connor>
<joey> Like yeah, that's universally no. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's not. </joey>
<connor> - Come on. - It's not even close. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I just think that after a certain point </connor>
<connor> where something is so well loved and so well-known </connor>
<connor> and so universally like watched by everyone </connor>
<connor> instead of community, </connor>
<connor> that it is fair to just openly discuss it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - By the way, please don't spoil "Code Geass" </joey>
<joey> and "Death Note" in the comments of this episode </joey>
<connor> - It's been how many years since "Death Note," </connor>
<joey> is like what? </joey>
<joey> 13? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, played early 2000s, right? </joey>
<garnt> - 2006. - Right? </garnt>
<connor> - "Code Geass" was 2007, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So it's been a lot of time. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not gonna do it just in case, </connor>
<garnt> but I think that it should be. </garnt>
<connor> - What's your buffer? </connor>
<joey> What's your buffer? </joey>
<connor> - If I'm an anime fan, I would be like, </connor>
<connor> the first thing I'd be like, what do you think of that? </connor>
<connor> Think of that? </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Wow, you really just said that. </joey>
<connor> - There're some things, if you say you are like a fan </connor>
<connor> of egg genre that you should know. </connor>
<connor> Like if you're like, I love Bruce Willis movies </connor>
<connor> you should know that he's dead in "The Sixth Sense," right? </connor>
<connor> Everyone knows, that's like the meme spoiler. </connor>
<connor> - Let's just spoil all the B plot twist of like, </connor>
<connor> but no, no, I get it, I get it. </connor>
<connor> That's that's like-- </connor>
<connor> - Making me out to be the fucking bad guy. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, I mean, I get it </connor>
<garnt> cause that's become like part of pop culture </garnt>
<garnt> now I would say. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, it's not the show anymore. </connor>
<connor> The twist is so iconic that the twist-- </connor>
<connor> - Has become part of pop culture itself </connor>
<connor> rather than watching the shows. </connor>
<connor> - I've never seen "The Sixth Sense," but I know the twist </connor>
<connor> because everyone's like, </connor>
<connor> cause it's always used as like anecdotally like, </connor>
<connor> oh it's like the ending. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, I haven't watched it. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna watch it now. </connor>
<joey> - Are you really not gonna watch it? </joey>
<connor> It's still a really good movie. </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty gonna watch it at some point. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, it's a little good movie. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like, I feel like right now, </garnt>
<connor> how would you feel </connor>
<garnt> if someone's spoiled "Attack On Titan" for you? </garnt>
<connor> - I think I'd be crushed and I'd get over it. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> - Would you get over it? </connor>
<joey> Cause I was not over when I got spoiled for "Code Geass." </joey>
<connor> - It depends, what, how bad of a spoiler </connor>
<connor> we're talking, right? </connor>
<joey> - I'm talking like ending of "Code Geass" </joey>
<joey> levels of spoilers. </joey>
<garnt> - And the ending of "Attack On Titan." </garnt>
<garnt> Someone spoiled the ending of "Attack On Titan" for you. </garnt>
<connor> - It depends what it was, right. </connor>
<connor> Cause if I already feel like </connor>
<connor> it's going in a certain direction right now </connor>
<connor> and if the film was like confirmed that it was going there, </connor>
<joey> I'd be like, kind of sucks that you confirmed my suspicion, </joey>
<joey> but I'll get over it. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> - Would you though? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, cause I've been spoiled on stuff before </connor>
<connor> and I've been like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> At the end of the day, the experience is still a banger </connor>
<connor> and this ain't gonna ruin it. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<joey> I mean, look, yeah, like granted, </joey>
<joey> like I finished "Code Geaas" </joey>
<joey> and even after knowing that spoiler. </joey>
<connor> - It doesn't spoil it, it doesn't ruin it, right? </connor>
<joey> The scene's so goddamn good. </joey>
<connor> - It didn't ruin it, </connor>
<connor> but I'm thinking of like the what if scenario </connor>
<connor> of if I wasn't spoiled, like how much of a mind factor-- </connor>
<connor> - If the scene is so reliant on the fact that you </connor>
<connor> like don't need to know this plot point </connor>
<connor> that like the emotions, </connor>
<connor> the voice act in the music, the animation, </connor>
<connor> but all of that can't bring in like an emotional reaction </connor>
<connor> out of you, then I don't think it deserves </connor>
<connor> to be like guarded in the first place. </connor>
<garnt> - But at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like it took something away from you. </garnt>
<garnt> It took that fresh experience from you </garnt>
<garnt> because they're like, there are shows </garnt>
<garnt> like I've re-watched "Code Geass," right? </garnt>
<connor> Fucking the ending is excellent every time out of none, </connor>
<connor> but the like by far, the most unique experience I had </connor>
<connor> was that first time that holy shit moment </connor>
<connor> where I experienced it for the first time. </connor>
<connor> - Absolutely. </connor>
<garnt> - And you can only get that once. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm just trying to be positive here. </connor>
<connor> Should I say if it gets spoiled man, </connor>
<garnt> don't watch at the end of the world, you gonna be okay. </garnt>
<garnt> The scene's still good, it holds up, don't worry. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, there are even shows where you enjoy more </connor>
<connor> the second time you watch it, </connor>
<garnt> but I still value having that first fresh experience </garnt>
<garnt> when I don't know what's gonna happen. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's that first moment that's so strong </joey>
<joey> that you look back on it years later </joey>
<joey> and be like it's that obligatory like, </joey>
<garnt> I wish I could erase my mind about X show, </garnt>
<garnt> so I could experience it all over again. </garnt>
<connor> Like that, to me, that was "Code Geass." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I was like-- </joey>
<joey> - Probably because you don't re-watch shows </joey>
<joey> which is why you don't care. </joey>
<joey> Your taking one, you've put in a zip folder </joey>
<joey> and you file it away. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Compress that shit. </garnt>
<joey> - You compress that shit and then you throw it in the trash. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm not really (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> and I think that I'm in like the middle of like, I care, </connor>
<connor> but I don't really care. </connor>
<connor> Like it's not gonna take away my, if the show's good, </connor>
<connor> I'm still gonna enjoy it, </connor>
<connor> but I definitely feel that most people are on the end of </connor>
<connor> I don't want anything spoiled for me, </connor>
<connor> don't tell me anything. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I want like the full on experience. </connor>
<connor> I don't want someone. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I'd rather fall on the experience </connor>
<garnt> than someone just paraphrasing it to me in a shit way. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I'm tired as fuck, </connor>
<connor> so we're gonna end this episode right now. </connor>
