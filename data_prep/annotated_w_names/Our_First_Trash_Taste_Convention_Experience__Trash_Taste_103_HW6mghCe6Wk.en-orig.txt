<joey> ax i think it is for all of us yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah so that was the last </joey>
<joey> convention we all went to and i believe </joey>
<joey> the last comic con or the last mcm i </joey>
<joey> went to was probably </joey>
<connor> 2018 i think no maybe even 2017 because </connor>
<connor> i went to momocon like one of the few </connor>
<connor> years and i was like it's the same </connor>
<connor> weekend as mcm so it's been a very very </connor>
<connor> long time since i've been to mcmahon </connor>
<garnt> well irregardless it was a very </garnt>
<joey> different experience yeah because not </joey>
<joey> only it was our first con in three years </joey>
<connor> but it was also our first con as trash </connor>
<garnt> taste yeah so we had no idea what to </garnt>
<connor> expect and uh </connor>
<joey> i mean a lot of [ __ ] happened yeah sure </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's it kind of put things </garnt>
<garnt> into perspective just one like how long </garnt>
<joey> it's been since trash has started yeah </joey>
<joey> two how long it's been since the world </joey>
<joey> has moved on since trash taser started </joey>
<joey> yeah because yeah i remember like this </joey>

<connor> was a first mcn for me um i'd only heard </connor>
<connor> of mcn from these guys yeah yeah and you </connor>
<joey> know i was like okay it's it's like what </joey>
<connor> the biggest con in the uk probably yeah </connor>

<garnt> it's definitely the biggest yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm sorry i'm not the biggest con </garnt>
<garnt> in europe though right like no no that's </garnt>
<garnt> not japan i believe </garnt>
<connor> yes oh anime japan no isn't it no it's </connor>
<garnt> gamescon isn't it in germany i i i i i </garnt>
<joey> was talking about anime let's let's see </joey>
<garnt> whose [ __ ] is the best here i think </garnt>
<garnt> i think it might be </garnt>
<connor> an anime </connor>
<connor> i know there's a japan expo in paris </connor>
<joey> that's gigantic yeah i don't know i know </joey>
<garnt> japan something is japanese something </garnt>
<garnt> with like </garnt>
<garnt> it's got the [ __ ] rotary of like </garnt>
<connor> anime expo japan it's like it's like mix </connor>
<connor> and match bro it's one of them i don't </connor>
<connor> know which one it is we're all talking </connor>
<connor> about the same convention </connor>
<joey> japan expo yeah i think i think now that </joey>
<joey> you say japan expo </joey>
<joey> it's huge i don't know anyone who's gone </joey>
<joey> to it but i mean that's because british </joey>
<joey> people i don't know yeah you're like </joey>
<joey> friends oh god yeah yeah yeah and then </joey>
<joey> there's gamescon in germany right which </joey>
<connor> is awesome i've been the gamescom </connor>
<joey> gamescon is </joey>
<joey> massive yeah yeah i remember i went to </joey>
<joey> gamescon and like i was like yeah man i </joey>
<joey> kind of this is this is when the switch </joey>
<joey> uh was about to come out right right and </joey>
<joey> um i remember that uh nintendo had a </joey>
<connor> booth to play super mario odyssey for </connor>
<connor> like 10 minutes right and the line was </connor>
<connor> like eight hours </connor>
<connor> and it was ridiculous there was like a a </connor>
<joey> japanese woman just standing outside </joey>
<joey> with like a thing that said like oh the </joey>
<joey> wait time is like 600 minutes or </joey>
<joey> something right i was like i was like i </joey>
<connor> was like what and people were like yo </connor>
<connor> joining in this cure you know the thing </connor>
<connor> closes before this this is done what do </connor>
<connor> you what what what is this math right </connor>
<connor> yeah but like gamescom is like so big </connor>
<connor> that also i feel like you can't really </connor>
<connor> do anything like it gets to a point </connor>
<connor> where it's almost you know it's like </connor>
<connor> this has reached a capacity where i can </connor>
<connor> no longer do anything i think i played </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i i the only games you could actually </connor>
<connor> get on in a reasonable amount of times </connor>
<connor> were like the games that were like </connor>
<connor> destined to [ __ ] fail the moment they </connor>
<joey> came out yeah games that nobody gave a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] about is it kind of like e3 in a </connor>
<connor> sense yeah it's it's e3 but for europe </connor>
<connor> but it's right it's i it's open to the </connor>
<garnt> public i think all days bar won and it </garnt>
<garnt> was just like it was insane i i don't </garnt>
<garnt> really want to go back i think if i were </garnt>
<garnt> to go back it would be </garnt>
<garnt> under </garnt>
<joey> like a press pass or something where you </joey>
<joey> can just be like see it loses i'm going </joey>
<joey> in la i'm gonna go to the front yeah </joey>
<joey> it's just like i cut the entire line i'm </joey>
<joey> hyped for like i was hyped for super </joey>
<joey> mario odyssey but i'm not waiting over </joey>
<joey> an hour hyped like an hour was pretty </joey>
<garnt> much my yeah </garnt>
<connor> anything is worth me waiting an hour in </connor>
<connor> terms like games for me like i can't </connor>
<connor> think of a single game where i'm just </connor>
<connor> like yo okay two hour light with two </connor>
<garnt> hour wait time for like a for like a </garnt>
<garnt> five minute demo or something yo let's </garnt>
<joey> go let's go i think the longest i ever </joey>
<garnt> waited was like an hour and a half aaron </garnt>
<joey> 40 at tgs to play persona 5. right was </joey>
<garnt> it worth it there were 40. i mean yeah </garnt>
<joey> but you know you know how long that game </joey>
<joey> is yeah five minutes is not a lot of </joey>
<connor> time so you know like you can't do </connor>
<joey> anything you can't sink your teeth into </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<connor> you know what i mean like you're just </connor>
<joey> teasing and it's like i knew i was gonna </joey>
<connor> buy it anyway so i was just like at the </connor>
<joey> end of the iron 40 i got to the front of </joey>
<joey> the line i was like wow that was </joey>
<joey> a bike </joey>
<joey> definitely not as quiet as our studio </joey>
<joey> yeah like you know i was waiting for </joey>
<joey> like an hour and 30 hour and 40 minutes </joey>
<joey> and then i got to the front of line i </joey>
<joey> was just like wow i don't know if this </joey>
<joey> was even worth it or not oh bro you know </joey>
<connor> what i actually play a game i played at </connor>
<connor> gamescon and that was like no line four </connor>
<connor> this is before cuphead came out and i </connor>
<joey> was like so [ __ ] hyped to play </joey>
<joey> cuphead yeah right it was only like a </joey>
<joey> ten minute wait i like cuphead and i was </joey>
<connor> like [ __ ] yes this game is awesome </connor>
<joey> i can't wait to buy it and it was good </joey>
<garnt> that was good but uh yeah so uh we went </garnt>
<joey> to mcm for three days oh i mean connor </joey>
<garnt> and i were there for three days </garnt>
<connor> one day just because i had some things </connor>
<joey> to do in and out here and there so i </joey>
<connor> only wanted to commit to one day </connor>
<joey> um but yeah how was your first uk con </joey>
<joey> experience joey it was uh i mean we'll </joey>
<joey> get into the details later but it was a </joey>
<connor> lot of ups and a lot of downs that's for </connor>
<connor> sure it's very much a roller coaster i </connor>
<joey> mean like you know </joey>
<joey> like i expected like you know british </joey>
<joey> fans to be super chill and they were for </joey>
<joey> the most part um but of course you know </joey>
<connor> at the same time it's like this is our </connor>
<connor> first con as trash tastes right so it's </connor>
<connor> like i knew that like </connor>
<connor> my </connor>
<connor> you know my fans like the anime man fans </connor>
<connor> like british fans would like chill as </connor>
<connor> they usually blaming trash technically </connor>
<connor> i mean like </connor>
<connor> could you say that it was like a hundred </connor>
<joey> percent chill </joey>
<joey> i mean i i think it was for the most </joey>
<garnt> part it was like okay so here's the </garnt>
<joey> thing it was like 99.9 </joey>
<joey> chill yeah you know but then you um </joey>
<joey> there were like those one or two people </joey>
<joey> that obviously really really stood out </joey>
<joey> and some of them even made waves uh you </joey>
<connor> might have even seen some clips online </connor>
<connor> about some of the people we've had to </connor>
<connor> deal with over the weekend yeah um </connor>
<connor> because it just like the intensity </connor>
<connor> was just like way more intense than </connor>
<garnt> anything that i've ever experienced in </garnt>
<connor> my life before oh like saying yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> we enjoy we walked around on um so it's </connor>
<connor> a three-day con right friday saturday </connor>
<connor> sunday </connor>
<connor> and they have this odd ticket system </connor>
<connor> that i've never seen in any other con </connor>
<connor> where like every single day they have </connor>
<connor> like a priority ticket which means you </connor>
<connor> can come in from nine right and then a </connor>
<joey> general ticket which means you can come </joey>
<joey> in from i think 11 or twelve something </joey>
<joey> like that yeah confused about that i </joey>
<joey> didn't quite get it it's just cheaper i </joey>
<joey> i don't really understand it but um we </joey>
<joey> walked around on like friday at like 10 </joey>
<joey> a.m before everyone got in and like we </joey>
<garnt> could walk around it's pretty chill like </garnt>
<joey> we got stopped a lot but i stopped </joey>
<connor> 10 a.m which is literally </connor>
<connor> the deadest time of the entire year </connor>
<joey> you're not gonna get a deader time yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly in that time so at least </joey>
<connor> like you know i got to actually like </connor>
<connor> walk around even for a little bit to </connor>
<connor> like actually see what the con was like </connor>
<joey> in all the other places because it's </joey>
<joey> freaking massive isn't it yeah that's </joey>
<connor> really big it's just like there's like </connor>
<connor> 20 warehouses just attached to each </connor>
<joey> other yeah yeah exactly but um yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean that was cool but then you know </joey>
<garnt> it's very yeah once the actual like </garnt>
<garnt> general admission started to come in </garnt>
<joey> around like 11 12-ish yeah yeah it got </joey>
<garnt> very heated very quickly very powerful </garnt>
<garnt> so what was your guys's expectation </garnt>
<joey> going into this convention </joey>
<joey> i was expecting like okay obviously more </joey>
<garnt> people are gonna know us now not just </garnt>
<garnt> for individual stuff but for trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> if anything there's probably going to be </garnt>
<garnt> more people who know us for trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah but i wasn't expecting it to </garnt>
<joey> be like </joey>
<garnt> 10 times as much no you know like i mean </garnt>
<garnt> i had some expectations obviously i </garnt>
<garnt> expected more like uh to be more </garnt>
<garnt> recognized and everything like that now </garnt>
<garnt> that i've shown my face more i've got an </garnt>
<garnt> extra channel now </garnt>
<garnt> just talk [ __ ] with the boys you know </garnt>
<garnt> um but this was definitely like an </garnt>
<garnt> eye-opening weekend for me because we've </garnt>
<garnt> like speculated before about what what </garnt>
<garnt> an anime convention is going to be like </garnt>
<garnt> now since trash chases started i think </garnt>
<garnt> this weekend has definitely cemented </garnt>
<joey> that anime conventions will never be the </joey>
<joey> same again </joey>
<joey> for us and it's like it was like a </joey>
<joey> bittersweet realization because i </joey>
<joey> remember we were all it was it was a sad </joey>
<joey> day when we all realized this i think </joey>
<joey> yeah and it was </joey>
<joey> right after our panel uh so we had our </joey>
<joey> first </joey>
<joey> trash taste panel ever ever uh and </joey>
<joey> for the most part you know i i thought </joey>
<joey> you were it was good but then there was </joey>
<joey> some really really stand out things that </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<garnt> hard to forget about our first trash </garnt>
<joey> chase experience so if you've been </joey>
<joey> living under a rock there's probably </joey>
<joey> about 30 different perspectives of uh </joey>
<connor> some dude running up onto the stage </connor>
<joey> and uh </joey>
<joey> 30 different perspectives of me [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> my pants </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean we weren't really like uh we </connor>
<connor> didn't really prepare anything that's </connor>
<joey> kind of announced like we could have </joey>
<connor> prepared something </connor>
<connor> like we're going to do a q a we're just </connor>
<joey> going to just keep it simple like how </joey>
<garnt> we've always done it right because we've </garnt>
<garnt> always done panels where it's just okay </garnt>
<garnt> q a easy we don't need to think too much </garnt>
<garnt> about it you know people are normally </garnt>
<garnt> chill we don't it's it's like it's a q a </garnt>
<garnt> you know what i mean it's like how how </garnt>
<garnt> riled up can fans get most of the times </garnt>
<connor> but i mean the thing is with the q and a </connor>
<garnt> it's it's completely made by how good of </garnt>
<garnt> the questions people ask yeah and you </garnt>
<joey> know i think it's just like </joey>
<joey> roll of the dice sometimes that some </joey>
<joey> people just asked questions that were </joey>
<connor> either just like cringy or yeah um would </connor>
<connor> ask questions that didn't really </connor>
<connor> actually make us talk about anything </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like what's your favorite </connor>
<connor> anime and it's like all right is this </connor>
<joey> okay it was kind of like there was also </joey>
<joey> like a lot of like very loaded questions </joey>
<connor> where it's like everyone knew the answer </connor>
<connor> to it yeah yeah it was asked and it's </connor>
<joey> like why would you ask a question that </joey>
<garnt> everyone already knows yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> i mean i'd say like for the most part we </joey>
<connor> had some we had good questions there's </connor>
<joey> some good ones yeah yeah i think like </joey>
<connor> okay i'm going to say this now i'm going </connor>
<joey> to say this now right if you ask connor </joey>
<joey> about his relationship status just just </joey>
<joey> just stop just just </joey>

<connor> like you know it just </connor>
<connor> i've i felt my bro man </connor>
<garnt> because i i would feel uncomfortable </garnt>
<connor> like i mean it's happened so many times </connor>
<connor> now where it's kind of like all right i </connor>
<connor> just have the routine of dealing with it </connor>
<connor> of like ha ha but that well that's the </connor>
<joey> one thing </joey>
<joey> that's another one that i've kind of </joey>
<joey> figured out like going to this </joey>
<garnt> convention doing the panel is that like </garnt>
<garnt> it you know because we've talked about </garnt>
<garnt> parasocial relationships so many </garnt>
<garnt> freaking times on the show yeah and it's </garnt>
<garnt> like you'd think that like after the </garnt>
<joey> amount of times we've talked about it </joey>
<joey> people start to be like okay yeah i get </joey>
<connor> the boys perspectives on it but there's </connor>
<connor> also the fact where if you talk about </connor>
<connor> parasocial relationships it makes it </connor>
<connor> seem like okay the person listening </connor>
<connor> isn't a parasocial relationship they're </connor>
<connor> listening they're hearing but then it's </connor>
<connor> like okay but it doesn't always like </connor>
<connor> translate well yeah but also i </connor>
<connor> understand how like on the day you know </connor>
<joey> sometimes people get weird moods and </joey>
<garnt> something so i get it yeah i i will say </garnt>
<joey> that it was like like i said like 99 </joey>
<joey> like i met like a lot of people there </joey>
<joey> and like the people i can respect was </joey>
<joey> just like look i know you could you've </joey>
<joey> talked about it plenty of times you know </joey>
<joey> i know you more than you know me i just </joey>
<joey> want to say i get that and </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> and i still like love your stuff you </joey>
<joey> know i still respect everything you've </joey>
<joey> done and that's that was like just a </joey>
<joey> genuine okay i met like a few people </joey>
<connor> like at the bar at the hotel who i just </connor>
<connor> had like a genuine conversation with </connor>
<connor> from like from like that starting point </connor>
<connor> where yeah where you know we acknowledge </connor>
<connor> this but i still want to get to know </connor>
<connor> this person because we're in a </connor>
<connor> environment where i can get to have a </connor>
<connor> more chilled conversation about it right </connor>
<connor> but then you </connor>
<connor> you do just get these you know one or </connor>
<connor> two maybe fans who just don't watch </connor>
<connor> trash taste as often as other people you </connor>
<connor> know right no because like especially </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> reading the subreddit and reading how </connor>
<connor> much people have like called this out </connor>
<connor> i'm just like that's that's that's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] great yeah unfortunately not </connor>
<connor> every one of our viewers is on the </connor>
<connor> subreddit for example you know not every </connor>
<connor> viewer watches every episode uh so you </connor>
<garnt> will get that casual viewer who just </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't know more and like doesn't know </garnt>
<garnt> about the boundaries much like other </garnt>
<connor> viewers i think i don't know i mean to </connor>
<connor> me it was like this was just all a </connor>
<connor> learning experience </connor>
<connor> like this is no way made me not want to </connor>
<connor> go to cons or anything no no no no no </connor>
<connor> like i i just you know like like we've </connor>
<connor> said this a million times but yeah </connor>
<connor> everyone was super [ __ ] nice </connor>
<connor> the signings were great yeah everyone </connor>
<connor> was really respectful except you got </connor>
<joey> shot by a nerf gun yeah yeah yeah that </joey>
<joey> was helpful i i wasn't there to say yeah </joey>
<joey> so it was because it's like open right </joey>
<joey> yeah it was over so we had like a table </joey>
<joey> and there's three of us i was in the </joey>
<joey> middle joey's on the end and then </joey>
<connor> there's gone on this end yeah and this </connor>
<joey> end is completely open yeah so any </joey>
<connor> anyone could have walked up and like </connor>
<connor> thrown anything at guns yeah which is </connor>
<connor> just an oversight they should have had </connor>
<garnt> someone there who is like stopping like </garnt>
<garnt> i i think i think it was like </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's a learning experience not just </garnt>
<garnt> for us but for the convention itself </garnt>
<connor> for for the convention as well so </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i remember remember the conversation </connor>
<connor> where we talked about we don't know if </connor>
<connor> we need security for future conventions </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah uh this taught us that we </connor>
<connor> definitely yeah </connor>
<connor> we definitely do need security like that </connor>
<garnt> that was like a very much a big </garnt>
<connor> eye-opener for us i mean uh obviously we </connor>
<connor> had uh the incident happened where </connor>
<connor> someone came on the stage who i </connor>
<connor> apparently okay so this is a whole </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] thing right you said it was a </connor>
<connor> learning curve look you said it was a </connor>
<connor> learning experience for the convention i </connor>
<connor> feel like i don't know they should know </connor>
<connor> that it was it would have been better </connor>
<connor> and to be fair they stepped it up but i </connor>
<connor> feel like it should have been there </connor>
<connor> anyway like we </connor>
<connor> practically had like </connor>
<connor> no security really for like the first </connor>
<garnt> two days yeah yeah like i i think they </garnt>
<garnt> definitely should have had security for </garnt>
<garnt> the panel but i i talked to some people </garnt>
<connor> afterwards uh who working there and they </connor>
<connor> said </connor>
<connor> this is like there's never been this </connor>
<joey> this has never happened before this has </joey>
<connor> never even come close to happening yeah </connor>
<joey> there was never like a president a </joey>
<connor> precedent </connor>
<connor> of this like ever happening at mcm right </connor>
<connor> so it was also it wasn't oversight but </connor>
<connor> also </connor>
<garnt> we just like a lot of people just didn't </garnt>
<garnt> expect it because it's just never </garnt>
<garnt> happened before right um i mean i i yeah </garnt>
<connor> i agree and i don't want to go too hard </connor>
<garnt> because obviously like we want to go to </garnt>
<garnt> cons again </garnt>
<garnt> but like </garnt>
<joey> it blows my mind that you would have a </joey>
<joey> main stage event and not have like at </joey>
<connor> least one scary dude in the front yeah </connor>
<joey> just start like you know cause it's like </joey>
<connor> like it was anyone could have come up </connor>
<joey> everyone could have come up </joey>
<garnt> like you know mcn haven't had like </garnt>
<joey> insanely large guests in the past yeah </joey>
<connor> so i'm thinking like what do they do </connor>
<connor> well they had like tom hiddleston yeah </connor>
<joey> and it's like there's no way like tom </joey>
<joey> hiddleston could do a panel on stage and </joey>
<joey> there wouldn't be a single [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> bodyguard anyway </connor>
<connor> maybe it's just like a thing of their </connor>
<connor> like all right well we have some guests </connor>
<garnt> this year none of them are super high </garnt>
<garnt> profile i guess we can scale it back </garnt>
<connor> save some money yeah but obviously </connor>
<garnt> you know yeah but and also a lot of </garnt>
<connor> these cons they they know youtubers are </connor>
<joey> big they know it but they don't like </joey>
<garnt> they don't know it yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> they understand oh he has three million </joey>
<joey> subs but they're like yeah but we have </joey>
<joey> the guy who voices in like fairy odd </joey>
<joey> parents here and i know what that is </joey>
<joey> right and i don't know who this trash </joey>
<joey> guy is yeah who's these rubbish </joey>
<joey> lads yeah who's these rubbish lads what </joey>
<joey> are they right so there's this complete </joey>
<joey> like a lot of cons do have this kind of </joey>
<joey> like disconnect between like because </joey>
<joey> that a lot of the cons are very are ran </joey>
<joey> by people who understand like older </joey>
<joey> media yeah traditional media they don't </joey>
<joey> really understand like youtubers that </joey>
<joey> well </joey>
<joey> they should buy now but they don't and </joey>
<joey> so i feel like there's a lot of </joey>
<garnt> oversight that happened there and then </garnt>
<garnt> getting to this guy in particular who </garnt>
<garnt> came on the stage which was which was a </garnt>
<joey> weird thing because this guy didn't do </joey>
<connor> anything for the first 20 minutes yeah </connor>
<joey> and then started shouting he was like </joey>
<joey> everyone thought he was like just a </joey>
<garnt> heckler yeah yeah i thought he was a </garnt>
<joey> heckler yeah because i was just like you </joey>
<joey> know we've all dealt with hecklers as </joey>
<joey> well of course uh so you know uh someone </joey>
<joey> asked the question and then we just i </joey>
<joey> just like heard someone shouting </joey>
<joey> something in like the [ __ ] background </joey>
<joey> or something i'm just like oh okay it's </joey>
<joey> just ignore him passionate anime fans </joey>
<joey> i've heard it all before you know um and </joey>
<joey> then suddenly i see some guy just </joey>
<connor> walking up to the stage and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like is this happening </connor>
<connor> yeah is this is this happening i heard </connor>
<connor> like a gadget no no i'm coming on yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like what and then someone's like </connor>
<connor> stood up and i was like yeah yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> someone's coming out yeah yeah and i was </connor>
<connor> like oh no worries security will deal </connor>
<joey> with it yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> there'll be someone there yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> i was just like okay he'll get he'll get </garnt>
<garnt> to the stage oh no he's on the stage </garnt>
<garnt> well he'll get near the sofa oh no he's </garnt>
<connor> near the sofa oh oh he's sitting next to </connor>
<joey> joey and then i remember just like just </joey>
<garnt> waiting because you i i i yeah yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> assumed that there would be someone who </garnt>
<garnt> would have come on and i'd be like </garnt>
<joey> someone's coming from backstage yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah that was like i was like i was like </garnt>
<garnt> backstage no i was like no no one on the </garnt>
<garnt> side yeah um </garnt>
<connor> oh and </connor>
<connor> a good like 30 40 seconds passed where </connor>
<connor> like nothing happened like even the </connor>
<joey> crowd was like uh like is this a bit </joey>
<garnt> like what's happening yeah it was so </garnt>
<garnt> like out of left field that i i talked </garnt>
<joey> to some people and originally they </joey>
<joey> thought that it was just a special guest </joey>
<joey> a special guest </joey>
<connor> just just a bit in like the in like our </connor>
<connor> show or something and uh and we were </connor>
<garnt> just like i think the best way to </garnt>
<garnt> describe it is just we were just </garnt>
<garnt> shell-shocked </garnt>
<joey> uh yeah i mean you know it was </joey>
<joey> definitely traumatizing that's for sure </joey>
<connor> like that's like nev yeah as i said it </connor>
<connor> was like it was like unprecedented like </connor>
<connor> that's never happened at like any </connor>
<joey> probably never any of our panels right </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't know how calm we looked on </garnt>
<garnt> camera but i'm pretty sure internally we </garnt>
<joey> were freaking out i was [ __ ] myself </joey>
<joey> because i was like this dude like sat </joey>
<connor> right next to me like he kind of like </connor>
<connor> shoved me out of the way yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like kind of in the middle of the couch </connor>
<connor> yeah and he like shoved me out of the </connor>
<connor> way and then he like you know i mean </connor>
<connor> everyone who was there saw it but like </connor>
<connor> he tried to like grab the mic off my </connor>
<connor> head yeah because he wanted to say </connor>
<connor> something and i was like uh no dude like </connor>
<connor> yeah what the [ __ ] are you doing yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and then yeah he just like starts </connor>
<connor> rambling off about something i don't </connor>
<connor> know he wasn't even like being coherent </connor>
<connor> yeah but it was just like coming into </connor>
<garnt> one ear and out the other because i was </garnt>
<joey> just like [ __ ] looking around like uh </joey>
<garnt> is anyone gonna do anything about this </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah like i remember like what he </garnt>
<connor> was talking about was nothing to do with </connor>
<connor> what the question was asked yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> completely out he was just rambling on </connor>
<garnt> about something completely incoherent </garnt>
<garnt> um and meanwhile joey is frantically </garnt>
<garnt> looking around </garnt>
<joey> trying to find it </joey>
<connor> felt really bad for you yeah you're like </connor>
<joey> anyone </joey>
<joey> i was like help because like i didn't </joey>
<connor> want to like </connor>
<connor> you know be the one to like instigate </connor>
<connor> something right because like i don't </connor>
<connor> know the dude might have a knife you </connor>
<connor> know yeah yeah the dude might [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> suddenly swing at me right i was like i </connor>
<connor> don't know what to do like i didn't like </connor>
<joey> push him off or anything </joey>
<connor> yeah this guy was big </connor>
<connor> i mean like you know </connor>
<connor> i'm not not saying that i would punch it </connor>
<connor> if like a [ __ ] two-foot man came on </connor>
<connor> the stage but like i'd be a lot more </connor>
<connor> likely just to be like to try and </connor>
<garnt> leverage my own position </garnt>
<garnt> if they were if a child comes on to </garnt>
<joey> stage you're like okay </joey>
<joey> for the drop kick </joey>
<connor> you're in the situation right someone </connor>
<connor> comes up and like they're they're you </connor>
<connor> you look at him and you're like </connor>
<connor> if this guy really wanted a swing for </connor>
<garnt> any of us odds are it's gonna [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like really [ __ ] hurt yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> probably won't be able to punch like he </garnt>
<garnt> he was really tall yeah and big right so </garnt>
<connor> it's just like it's you just sit there </connor>
<connor> and you're like weighing your odds </connor>
<connor> you're like what do i need to do like </connor>
<connor> what's the best way to handle this like </connor>
<garnt> i'm processing processing processing </garnt>
<connor> because like you've rarely find yourself </connor>
<connor> in a situation like this where you don't </connor>
<connor> know what the outcome is going to be so </connor>
<connor> in your head you're just like what's the </connor>
<garnt> worst outcome this could possibly be and </garnt>
<garnt> how could i prepare for it because </garnt>
<garnt> you're kind of in like fight or flight </garnt>
<garnt> mode at that point at that point yeah </garnt>
<joey> and also it's like you know there was </joey>
<joey> that like side of me as well that was </joey>
<joey> like okay say for example like if i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] tripped him up as he was like </joey>
<joey> trying to flee and he like smashes his </joey>
<joey> head in and he's gonna [ __ ] abby </joey>
<joey> heard me and like try and like sue me </joey>
<connor> for defamation and damages right i don't </connor>
<connor> want that either so it's like i </connor>
<connor> literally couldn't do anything and i </connor>
<joey> just had to sit there and be like </joey>
<connor> just just praj </connor>
<connor> would help me i was just like just </connor>
<joey> hoping i was like okay you know like </joey>
<joey> obviously a lot of people like man you </joey>
<connor> should have just like punched him or </connor>
<joey> something and it's like well it's like </joey>
<connor> do i do i don't want to be the one to </connor>
<connor> escalate it you know at the end of the </connor>
<connor> day we're still on stage and we're </connor>
<garnt> trying to create create a clash was like </garnt>
<connor> a month yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's that's not what they paid the </garnt>
<garnt> amount of the money for man </garnt>
<connor> it's just like you're sitting there you </connor>
<garnt> have to like go through it i'm like all </garnt>
<joey> right well what does this guy want like </joey>
<garnt> why is he on stage right and so </garnt>
<joey> initially i was just like okay maybe he </joey>
<joey> just wants to be funny and i was like </joey>
<joey> well this is great because </joey>
<joey> i'm i can handle cringe like my half of </joey>
<joey> my videos on my channel are like try not </joey>
<joey> to cringe challenges and like i'm fine </joey>
<joey> dealing with a guy trying to be funny on </joey>
<joey> stage i'll just out out wait him and </joey>
<joey> cringe like i know that i can sit here </joey>
<joey> and if this guy was trying to be funny </joey>
<joey> which we he wasn't but if he was i was </joey>
<joey> like it's fine i'll just wait until he </joey>
<connor> feels so unbearably awkward that he'll </connor>
<connor> just leave yeah and then i'll be like </connor>
<connor> all right good which is what i think </connor>
<connor> happened eventually but this guy was </connor>
<connor> completely you know he was not in the </connor>
<joey> right state of mind like this guy was </joey>
<joey> clearly unwrapped and he was also doing </joey>
<connor> it to a bunch of other panels as well so </connor>
<connor> he clearly wasn't like a targeted thing </connor>
<joey> he was just like going around just </joey>
<joey> wreaking as much havoc as possible so </joey>
<connor> yeah what i heard was i don't know how </connor>
<joey> okay this is this is not 100 confirmed </joey>
<garnt> but this is the story that i was told </garnt>
<connor> apparently he did this to another stage </connor>
<garnt> after after hours after hours oh [ __ ] i </garnt>
<joey> thought it was before no no after ours </joey>
<connor> and then they try to get him removed but </connor>
<connor> at the time they didn't right yeah just </connor>
<connor> because for some reason they didn't </connor>
<connor> listen to the person who was trying to </connor>
<connor> get him removed or something it was like </connor>
<connor> a whole thing </connor>
<connor> and then uh yeah we were told the next </connor>
<joey> day that uh yeah he was arrested </joey>
<joey> afterwards and uh i think charged i </joey>
<joey> don't know what with uh but apparently </joey>
<joey> when they asked him why </joey>
<joey> yeah why why he did it yeah </joey>
<joey> sentenced </joey>
<joey> and sent us the children </joey>
<garnt> eyes of cringe </garnt>
<garnt> i sentence you for being cringy </garnt>
<connor> so what are you in for i was cringing </connor>
<connor> i don't know maybe like trespassing or </connor>
<joey> something yeah i i either way i mean you </joey>
<joey> know glad that something happened yeah </joey>
<joey> um you know they they caught him in it </joey>
<joey> when they asked him why he did it he </joey>
<joey> said something along the lines of uh </joey>
<garnt> yeah he apparently just wanted to go up </garnt>
<garnt> on stage like he didn't really know who </garnt>
<connor> we were yeah yeah he was just there </connor>
<garnt> trying to get on stage to things yeah so </garnt>
<connor> it was just unfortunate timing that it </connor>
<connor> was a guy at our panel who just wanted </connor>
<connor> to jump on stage yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> i like i mean yeah it could have been </garnt>
<garnt> anyone you know at the end of the day </garnt>
<connor> we're lucky it turned out well like you </connor>
<connor> know if that guy really wanted to do </connor>
<connor> something this could be a really </connor>
<garnt> different story i mean i see it as a </garnt>
<connor> positive experience because it really </connor>
<connor> it's really easy </connor>
<joey> you want to be in my scene say that </joey>
<joey> okay okay </joey>
<joey> i see it because i see it as an event </joey>
<connor> like this where something this big </connor>
<connor> happened and nothing bad came out of it </connor>
<connor> right it really put things into </connor>
<connor> perspective for us </connor>
<connor> oh yeah it made it so it made it </connor>
<connor> guaranteed that something like this </connor>
<connor> isn't gonna happen again because now we </connor>
<connor> are more aware of it now we're gonna </connor>
<connor> convey this to wherever we go to so i i </connor>
<connor> think you know </connor>
<connor> it's obviously not a good thing that </connor>
<connor> happened and maybe we should have been </connor>
<connor> more prepared for it but it did happen </connor>
<connor> nothing too bad came out of it outside </connor>
<connor> of aside from just a lot of cringe a lot </connor>
<connor> of cringe </connor>
<connor> and just like getting you getting his </connor>
<joey> ass flashed like in front of our face </joey>
<connor> because like he's just yeah </connor>
<joey> his trousers was like </joey>
<garnt> like it wasn't even like a half crack </garnt>
<garnt> like he might as well have not been </garnt>
<connor> wearing pants it was like the full ass </connor>
<garnt> crack and i was like oh god </garnt>
<connor> why </connor>
<connor> why also he stank like he really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> stank </connor>
<joey> like i was like holy [ __ ] that you like </joey>
<joey> you smell you definitely smell like a </joey>
<connor> girl that's not a shot i just [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> hope that guy gets the help he needs </joey>
<joey> because he's really [ __ ] unwell yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah definitely yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't know it was just [ __ ] you know </joey>
<joey> and it sucked as well because you know </joey>
<joey> halfway through the panel we have to </joey>
<joey> like the panel was it was going okay at </joey>
<joey> that point i'd say yeah and then we were </joey>
<connor> already kind of like [ __ ] dude you got </connor>
<connor> to do this panel now after that happened </connor>
<joey> like pretend like nothing happened at </joey>
<joey> least if it was like you know near the </joey>
<connor> beginning or near the end then you know </connor>
<connor> they'd be like it'd be a little bit </connor>
<connor> easier to kind of just like clean it up </connor>
<connor> and get over it but it was like dead set </connor>
<connor> in the middle of the panel yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so it was like the hardest to kind </connor>
<joey> of recruit recuperating like get back </joey>
<garnt> onto the floor of things you know </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember i tried to like i </garnt>
<garnt> tried to like continue the panel and all </garnt>
<garnt> like like the only image that was in my </garnt>
<garnt> mind was just that that ask that bare </garnt>
<garnt> ass crack like that that bare ass crack </garnt>
<garnt> just like hypnotized me to be like oh </garnt>
<joey> where am i right now for me it was that </joey>
<joey> and also just like in the back of my </joey>
<connor> head being like what if someone else </connor>
<connor> also does this yeah like what if like </connor>
<connor> another person is just like well they </connor>
<connor> didn't [ __ ] do anything or now it's </connor>
<connor> my time to get 15 minutes of fame you </connor>
<connor> know i was like i was like so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> scared for that yeah it's like and also </connor>
<joey> it was just like oh good i'm gonna see </joey>
<joey> this all over the subreddit and the </joey>
<joey> twitter feed in like 17 different </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] angles yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> but yeah it was whatever i mean yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah no like again as like the silver </connor>
<connor> lining is that </connor>
<garnt> now we know now we're going to be a </garnt>
<garnt> little more prepared for future cons and </garnt>
<garnt> future events and stuff like that and um </garnt>
<joey> just a lot of trauma and a lot of cringe </joey>
<joey> just just </joey>
<garnt> just a lot of emotional damage trauma by </garnt>
<joey> cringe basically emotional damage but no </joey>
<joey> physical damage so that's good </joey>
<connor> yeah aside from the panel how how else </connor>
<connor> was your guys's con experience yeah i </connor>
<connor> did yeah it was good yeah i mean the </connor>
<connor> signing was freaking awesome yeah like </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> that was a good thing you know at least </connor>
<connor> like everyone who came to the signing </connor>
<connor> was super nice super respectful you know </connor>
<joey> lots of like really cool artists and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that i just like kind of wish </joey>
<connor> i had enough time to like go to the </connor>
<connor> artist alley because i feel </connor>
<connor> mcn's artist ally was like really </connor>
<connor> freaking good compared to like other </connor>
<connor> cons that i've been to because like you </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> naturally when you're at a signing a lot </connor>
<garnt> of people bring up stuff that they </garnt>
<connor> bought oh yeah </connor>
<connor> some of the stuff i was genuinely like </connor>
<connor> where the hell did you get that yeah </connor>
<connor> because i want to get it but </connor>
<garnt> unfortunately we didn't have enough time </garnt>
<joey> to go to the artist alley this year so </joey>
<garnt> that was a little disappointing but yeah </garnt>
<connor> you know well it's kind of hard to walk </connor>
<garnt> around in general this year i feel like </garnt>
<connor> because i feel like the last convention </connor>
<connor> we went to we was like ax 2019 and we've </connor>
<connor> said that you know we could still walk </connor>
<connor> around the convention right yeah like we </connor>
<connor> could you know we'd get stopped every </connor>
<connor> now and again you know especially at </connor>
<connor> a you know at a event like ax but it was </connor>
<connor> it wasn't to the point where it </connor>
<connor> completely stopped your movement and </connor>
<joey> like made it so you couldn't walk around </joey>
<garnt> and i felt like that was </garnt>
<joey> very very different this year yeah like </joey>
<connor> i i didn't even bother trying especially </connor>
<joey> after i heard what connor tried to do oh </joey>
<connor> my god </connor>
<connor> i knew you're going to [ __ ] tell me </connor>
<garnt> oh we got it we got it </garnt>
<joey> so funny it's so funny so like </joey>
<connor> after the panel and after our signing </connor>
<joey> was it after the signing that was after </joey>
<connor> the signing okay so after like our day </connor>
<joey> was free and we had like a good two </joey>
<joey> three hours to enjoy the convention we </joey>
<joey> were like up in the green room right now </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah we're we're so we're up </joey>
<joey> in the green room normally at this point </joey>
<joey> we're just like great we've got two </joey>
<joey> three hours to enjoy the convention </joey>
<joey> let's just walk around and stuff like </joey>
<joey> that but like seeing how many people </joey>
<garnt> were at our signing and seeing how many </garnt>
<garnt> people couldn't even make it to our </garnt>
<garnt> signing because the signing got cut off </garnt>
<garnt> uh the line was like full capacity like </garnt>
<garnt> an hour or two even before we even </garnt>
<garnt> started the sliding i'm like yeah i </garnt>
<connor> thought about everyone who wanted the </connor>
<connor> signature uh yeah yeah sorry </connor>
<garnt> we would have done it if we could have </garnt>
<joey> yeah we would have done it if there was </joey>
<joey> enough time yeah yeah i think we were </joey>
<joey> signing for like two and a half hours </joey>
<joey> and we </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> and that was like capping the line two </joey>
<joey> hours before </joey>
<connor> the line even opened yeah um but yeah so </connor>
<connor> i i got the feeling that probably not a </connor>
<connor> good idea to walk around especially </connor>
<connor> without security and uh conor was just </connor>
<connor> like guys i got this i got the perfect </connor>
<connor> disguise </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> so let me tell you what connor's </connor>
<connor> disguise was his disguise was a to wear </connor>
<connor> a face mask like a normal covert like a </connor>
<connor> surgical face mask and some sunglasses </connor>
<connor> and a hat </connor>
<connor> so first things first wearing a sun </connor>
<connor> wearing sunglasses inside totally </connor>
<joey> inconspicuous no one's going to look at </joey>
<joey> you at all why would you we weren't we </joey>
<joey> wearing sunglasses inside </joey>
<joey> second thing he forgot that the shirt he </joey>
<joey> was wearing was a trash taste shirt that </joey>
<joey> hasn't been released yet no yeah it was </joey>
<garnt> a trash taste shirt that the general </garnt>
<garnt> that hasn't been shipped out to the </garnt>
<connor> general public yet </connor>
<garnt> also it's the trash taster that you see </garnt>
<garnt> him wear in almost every video and every </garnt>
<joey> episode so it's like it's like that </joey>
<joey> shirt has just been like synonymous with </joey>
<connor> like yep that's kind of [ __ ] i you know </connor>
<connor> i just uh </connor>
<connor> i wanted to say hi to some of my friends </connor>
<connor> so i was like hey i'll just come quickly </connor>
<joey> and say hi i was i wasn't gonna stay out </joey>
<joey> long i'm just gonna go say hi and yeah </joey>
<joey> obviously i knew it wasn't a foolproof </joey>
<joey> disguise i was i wasn't [ __ ] going to </joey>
<connor> film any any movie scenes fooling </connor>
<connor> anybody right like i was just like maybe </connor>
<connor> it'll just buy me enough time where </connor>
<connor> people will double glance and then i can </connor>
<joey> just walk away yeah right right </joey>
<joey> okay and so and how far did you get well </joey>
<connor> no so i went to meet my friend who i </connor>
<connor> told to come meet me uh at this like at </connor>
<connor> the gate so it was like i literally </connor>
<connor> walked out like two meters and then my </connor>
<connor> friend was problem was that at this area </connor>
<connor> that was really convenient for me uh </connor>
<connor> like people were waiting for sydney yeah </connor>
<connor> science sydney stuff and obviously </connor>
<connor> people like were waiting around there </connor>
<connor> and recognized so </connor>
<connor> yeah people just started coming up to </connor>
<connor> you right away but i was trying to talk </connor>
<connor> to my friends and it was really [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> annoying because i was just like hold on </joey>
<joey> a second i'm just talking to my friend </joey>
<joey> give me a moment and then they were like </joey>
<joey> just asking for photos and then the </joey>
<joey> moment i turned around to like go back </joey>
<joey> there was like felt like five people </joey>
<connor> this side and then because my friend </connor>
<connor> left who i was talking to yeah people </connor>
<connor> just filled the void and i was like oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm getting surrounded </connor>
<connor> so so the people in front of me i just </connor>
<connor> quickly took a picture with them and i </connor>
<connor> was like make this fast please please </connor>
<connor> and then the people behind me i could </connor>
<connor> just feel them be like comment and i was </connor>
<joey> like i've gotta go i gotta go i'm so </joey>
<joey> sorry i gotta because i because if i </joey>
<joey> start doing all of them i i i won't yeah </joey>
<joey> i won't i don't stop and it sucks it's </joey>
<connor> like i have to go yeah like i'm sorry </connor>
<joey> that i wasn't able to give you a picture </joey>
<joey> that is the most like suffering from </joey>
<joey> success story </joey>
<connor> but it sucks right because it's like </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> people friends would be like oh come </connor>
<connor> hang out i'm over here i'm like i'm i'm </connor>
<joey> sorry like i can't i can't walk there </joey>
<connor> yeah and they're like oh wow okay you're </connor>
<connor> too big </connor>
<connor> i'm like literally yes like </connor>
<connor> i actually can't walk to you like </connor>
<connor> this will be a miserable experience </connor>
<joey> like it's literally not even us trying </joey>
<joey> to like humble brag it's just like no no </joey>
<joey> no it was just like this was like the </joey>
<joey> eye-opening weekend for us to be </joey>
<joey> to for us to see like oh okay now we we </joey>
<garnt> have to consider things that we've never </garnt>
<joey> had to consider don't get me wrong we're </joey>
<joey> greatly appreciative </joey>
<garnt> very grateful we [ __ ] love it but </garnt>
<joey> yeah you know i mean like because uh </joey>
<connor> after our signing i really really wanted </connor>
<joey> to go to sydney's panel right because </joey>
<connor> her panel wasn't on the main stage it </connor>
<garnt> was on like one of like the side stages </garnt>
<garnt> that was like in the middle of the </garnt>
<joey> convention it was like it was kind of </joey>
<joey> like a two or three minute walk yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah so it was like a two three </garnt>
<garnt> minute walk through like this crowd and </garnt>
<joey> i remember asking one of the handlers </joey>
<joey> like can i go see sydney's panel because </joey>
<joey> yes it was our first panel i'm like i </joey>
<connor> wanna i wanna see my girl man where's my </connor>
<joey> girl where's my girl and they were like </joey>
<connor> i don't think that's a good idea you </connor>
<connor> should not be walking through that crowd </connor>
<connor> right like they literally were just like </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> after what has happened on stage we </connor>
<connor> cannot stop you but we highly highly and </connor>
<joey> they're not like begging me please don't </joey>
<joey> go because i could see like the sweat </joey>
<joey> drop on her face like being like oh i </joey>
<joey> don't like if he says yes i can't deny </joey>
<joey> him but yeah i don't want to deal with </joey>
<joey> like the consequence of it right right </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> actually like so on the second day right </joey>
<joey> so on on the sunday uh we were hanging </joey>
<joey> out at uh like that one of the bars it </joey>
<connor> was like the nov hotel which is like far </connor>
<connor> enough from the convention that you know </connor>
<connor> it's like not too many people there but </connor>
<connor> close enough that you could walk to and </connor>
<connor> from the convention right right so i was </connor>
<connor> hanging out there with a few of my mates </connor>
<connor> on like the sunday and it was like </connor>
<connor> everyone was still in the convention so </connor>
<connor> it was like pretty dead and so you guys </connor>
<connor> had your signings so i wanted to meet </connor>
<connor> you guys in like the green room or </connor>
<connor> whatever </connor>
<connor> and so </connor>
<connor> once the con ends your guys are signing </connor>
<connor> in so i'm like great let's go meet up </connor>
<connor> and i said okay i'll go to i'll go to </connor>
<connor> the hotel that we were staying at which </connor>
<connor> is on the like which we had to go to the </connor>
<connor> other side of the convention and i </connor>
<connor> remember going out with my mate to see </connor>
<connor> the optimal path right to walk to the </connor>
<connor> hotel that we're going to and what it </connor>
<connor> felt like i walk outside and everyone </connor>
<garnt> started to go outside to like the big </garnt>
<garnt> grassy area because the convention is </garnt>
<garnt> over now so you just see like this </garnt>
<garnt> massive crowd and what it felt like is </garnt>
<garnt> you know like in that [ __ ] zombie </garnt>
<garnt> movie where they're on the like the roof </garnt>
<garnt> where they're on like the roof of the </garnt>
<garnt> mall and they have to get like the food </garnt>
<garnt> and they see like the crowd of zombies </garnt>
<joey> that i have to walk through it's </joey>
<joey> literally like the opening scene to </joey>
<garnt> death right </garnt>
<garnt> that's what it felt like because i'm </garnt>
<connor> just like okay let me let me plan on my </connor>
<connor> route what's like the most optimal route </connor>
<connor> i can uh i can i can walk without like </connor>
<connor> what's the least possibility i can grab </connor>
<connor> the bench </connor>
<joey> stop swinging </joey>
<connor> out of the way i get my food i get my </connor>
<connor> baseball bats out it's just </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] short of the dead or </connor>
<joey> something </joey>
<joey> oh my god yeah i mean you know like a </joey>
<joey> lot of things happened this weekend but </joey>
<joey> uh i think all in all it was a positive </joey>
<joey> experience i'd say this episode is </joey>
<joey> sponsored by expressvpn guys how much </joey>
<garnt> time do you spend on your phone nowadays </garnt>
<garnt> all the time and what'd you guys do on </garnt>
<garnt> your phone just browse on the web the </garnt>
<garnt> scary part is that your phone carrier </garnt>
<garnt> collects all the data on whatever you're </garnt>
<garnt> doing verizon even admitted it </garnt>
<garnt> they say it's so that you can get a </garnt>
<garnt> better understanding of your interest </garnt>
<garnt> but really all they want to do is sell </garnt>
<garnt> your activities to advertisers the more </garnt>
<garnt> they can get on you the larger their </garnt>
<garnt> paycheck becomes which is why i use </garnt>
<connor> expressvpn expressvpn is the app that </connor>
<connor> prevents your phone carrier from being </connor>
<connor> able to see the sites you visit and sell </connor>
<connor> it off to third parties all it takes is </connor>
<connor> one tap of a button and all of your </connor>
<connor> network data gets encrypted and rerouted </connor>
<connor> through expressvpn's secure servers for </connor>
<connor> ultimate privacy not only does it shield </connor>
<connor> your web browsing expressvpn protects </connor>
<connor> all of your network data so you can stay </connor>
<connor> private even when using your favorite </connor>
<connor> apps and the best part is one </connor>
<connor> subscription can be used for up to five </connor>
<connor> devices at the same time i have my whole </connor>
<connor> family using expressvpn i don't have a </connor>
<connor> family but if i did they would all be on </connor>
<joey> expressvpn take back your online privacy </joey>
<joey> today ladies and gentlemen by using </joey>
<joey> expressvpn.com trash taste that's </joey>

<garnt> overbearing having someone like behind </garnt>
<garnt> you yeah yeah but he was really nice he </garnt>

<connor> that they didn't like you didn't get </connor>
<connor> stopped immediately </connor>
<connor> but i could see like on like every like </connor>
<connor> fifth person i walked past they they did </connor>
<connor> like the double take they did like the </connor>
<connor> double right they would walk past and </connor>
<joey> then like something would click and then </joey>
<connor> they just like is that yeah yeah yeah or </connor>
<joey> like yeah who was that guy i i felt i </joey>
<joey> felt a disturbance in the force for a </joey>
<connor> second there but like that bought me </connor>
<connor> enough time to be like okay they've </connor>
<connor> looked around and i'm already like </connor>
<connor> like enough the world yeah yeah so it it </connor>
<connor> definitely didn't hide my identity but </connor>
<joey> it made people wouldn't like </joey>
<joey> not immediately not like immediately </joey>
<joey> like not run up from a distance yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah and i i think like </garnt>
<garnt> as long as you don't stop in one place </garnt>
<joey> for too long then then it's useful but </joey>
<joey> but the problem with that is that like </joey>
<garnt> you know if you if you have that </garnt>
<garnt> particular mask on for instance then the </garnt>
<garnt> word is going to spread so yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah so the guy in that mask yeah </connor>
<joey> that's gone right and then it just </joey>
<joey> doesn't work anymore right because it's </joey>
<joey> like now they're just looking for the </joey>
<joey> guy in that mode </joey>
<garnt> right it's a one trick pony yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly you got to get like a new </garnt>
<garnt> mask for like every day or like every </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] convention or something </garnt>
<joey> yeah because because i did see like a </joey>
<garnt> couple of like people i knew like </garnt>
<garnt> youtubes and stuff who were like going </garnt>
<garnt> it like like cosplay yeah and stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> that and i'm like okay like that's smart </garnt>
<connor> because you're like you're in a full </connor>
<connor> cosplay time exactly so it's not just </connor>
<connor> like covering the head type of thing so </connor>
<connor> like but like in saying that am i </connor>
<garnt> bothered to get like a full on like full </garnt>
<joey> body cosplay to like walk around no i'm </joey>
<garnt> so hot yeah it is </garnt>
<garnt> speaking of cosplay though my god </garnt>
<garnt> gention has like taken over this year </garnt>
<joey> yeah oh my god like every third </joey>
<joey> cosplayer i saw was against yeah like </joey>
<garnt> because because normally like i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like the anime con experiences like one </garnt>
<garnt> or two characters would completely take </garnt>
<joey> over now it was just like the entire </joey>
<joey> cast of genshin you know there was a lot </joey>
<connor> of genji i didn't realize yeah it was </connor>
<joey> that popular yeah because i remember in </joey>
<joey> like 2018 2019 i think the the big thing </joey>
<joey> at least for people who came up to my </joey>
<joey> signing was like nekopara characters and </joey>
<joey> i think i saw like two nickel power </joey>
<joey> characters today and i was like oh okay </joey>
<connor> make a power is that big yeah i mean </connor>
<joey> there was a lot i mean because you know </joey>
<connor> it's so easy to cosplay right yeah and </connor>
<connor> there's so many variations so like it's </connor>
<connor> it's very easy for a lot of people to </connor>
<connor> cosplay it but yeah like </connor>
<connor> now it's just like genshin or demon </connor>
<connor> slayer or i saw a lot of demons </connor>
<garnt> yeah but like i i like my mates are </garnt>
<garnt> telling me that like the gentian line or </garnt>
<connor> the line to buy genji merch was like by </connor>
<connor> far like the longest line i don't even </connor>
<connor> know they're not selling yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly and i'm just like well this is </connor>
<garnt> the closest any [ __ ] genji fan is </garnt>
<garnt> going to get to buying actual feel real </garnt>
<joey> merch </joey>
<joey> but there was one part of me that was </joey>
<garnt> like oh man there's like so many like </garnt>
<garnt> genji characters you know being </garnt>
<connor> cosplaying and it's like oh yeah this is </connor>
<garnt> like a new era of like cosplaying in at </garnt>
<connor> cons but yeah the one thing where i was </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah this will never change is </connor>
<connor> people coming up to me making me sign </connor>
<garnt> death notes </garnt>
<garnt> like oh my god i was like that that is a </garnt>
<garnt> piece of con culture that will probably </garnt>
<garnt> never go away that will never that will </garnt>
<joey> never go away and i'm like all right </joey>
<garnt> that's familiar right there yeah </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] i just remembered that happened to </garnt>
<joey> me as well i probably signed like 10 or </joey>
<connor> 20 death notes like during this week and </connor>
<garnt> i was like all right that's that's one </garnt>
<garnt> piece of like con culture i'm glad we'll </garnt>
<garnt> never go away it's like it's going to </garnt>
<garnt> the point where like i i know the </garnt>
<connor> notebook now when i get when i get given </connor>
<connor> it right because because they they make </connor>
<connor> it like you always get like the death </connor>
<connor> note and then they make you sign it and </connor>
<connor> then they're like close the cover and </connor>
<connor> they're like they're like staring at you </connor>
<garnt> you know they're like ha what do you </garnt>
<joey> think and i'm just like haha you got me </joey>
<joey> yeah the pages are very noticeable yeah </joey>
<connor> exactly </connor>
<joey> it's like i don't know like i don't even </joey>
<joey> have to like flip the cover anymore to </joey>
<connor> see what i'm saying i'm just like yeah </connor>
<connor> that's definitely are you superstitious </connor>
<connor> about it i know some people don't sign </connor>
<connor> death notes because they're like oh what </connor>
<connor> if i actually what who i've met some </connor>
<joey> people who don't sign them really yeah </joey>
<joey> oh ah because are you wishing me to die </joey>
<connor> or something that's [ __ ] up </connor>
<garnt> no i don't care </garnt>
<garnt> i mean like i s also another thing is </garnt>

<joey> mcm i would say like the signing </joey>
<joey> experience was like the smoothest </joey>
<connor> signing experience i've ever had yeah </connor>
<connor> definitely at any convention like they </connor>
<connor> had this [ __ ] on lockdown like it was </connor>
<connor> like in and out in and out you know take </connor>
<connor> your stuff they gave us like a post note </connor>
<joey> of like what they wanted us to sign what </joey>
<joey> the what the person's name was it was </joey>
<joey> like excellent it was so streamlined </joey>
<joey> yeah it was so streamlined uh i remember </joey>
<joey> the first one the first sus one that i </joey>
<garnt> got was uh it was a manga called like i </garnt>
<garnt> think like dick fight island or </garnt>
<connor> something yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah i think i remember that yeah </garnt>
<joey> it was dick fight island and i was just </joey>
<joey> like oh what's this and he goes he was </joey>
<joey> like oh sydney recommended it and i was </joey>
<joey> just like that sounds like sydney nation </joey>
<joey> and he just goes off on like he just </joey>
<joey> starts going off on like the entire </joey>
<joey> synopsis right of dick fight island </joey>
<joey> which is apparently just a bunch of </joey>
<joey> dudes on an island and they fight with </joey>
<joey> their dicks that's what i'm guessing is </joey>
<joey> but he goes into it in like such graphic </joey>
<garnt> detail right and so i'm like yeah that </garnt>
<garnt> sounds like a really really interesting </garnt>
<garnt> story i signed it he goes away we had </garnt>
<garnt> like a little five minute breather and </garnt>
<garnt> my handler goes to me </garnt>
<garnt> so what do you do </garnt>

<garnt> sydney by saying one line that i am not </garnt>
<garnt> sid snap and then like so my friend gets </garnt>
<garnt> sydney and the first thing he she says </garnt>
<garnt> is you stupid [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> japanese debated </joey>

<connor> like took a candid shot i've kind of </connor>
<connor> just been like </connor>
<joey> in front of the side that said see dogs </joey>
<garnt> v8 because it just looked like </garnt>
<garnt> your face just looked like you just you </garnt>
<garnt> have just like gone through like like </garnt>
<connor> you're not you're like the end of the </connor>
<connor> universe you want to explain what's </connor>
<joey> happening because i explained about this </joey>
<joey> okay so at the signing right we had like </joey>
<joey> a dedicated section for our signing you </joey>
<joey> know there was a picture of all three of </joey>
<joey> us that said trash taste and then there </joey>
<joey> was individual photos of like yeah man </joey>
<joey> gig and then next to that there was a </joey>
<joey> picture of connor </joey>
<joey> but it's instead of saying c dog va it </joey>
<joey> said see dogs with a z yeah va </joey>
<joey> and i i remember i like you know i was </joey>
<joey> admiring you know the posters being like </joey>
<joey> oh yeah you know we look sick in these </joey>
<joey> and then i did a double take with </joey>
<joey> connor's like </joey>
<connor> see what he said </connor>
<connor> i don't know i see dogs </connor>
<connor> me neither and i was just like i was </connor>
<connor> just like you should change your name to </connor>
<connor> see dogs va it looks so sick </connor>
<garnt> it was that and they were coming the </garnt>
<garnt> next day and it's just like like black </garnt>
<garnt> that would make and i laughed even </garnt>
<joey> it was the most like inconspicuous like </joey>
<connor> i just kind of felt like i was like i </connor>
<connor> don't care everything everyone kept </connor>
<connor> coming out to me like wow you must be so </connor>
<connor> offended i'm like why would i give a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah i mean i've had that happen </joey>
<connor> before yeah yeah yeah i've had it </connor>
<joey> yeah i was just like i don't really care </joey>
<joey> it's not like it's i'm suddenly now like </joey>
<connor> a different person it's like a file </connor>
<joey> location where if you type in the wrong </joey>
<joey> thing it's like dot c-dog dot exe is </joey>
<connor> missing it's like </connor>
<joey> i'm still here like at least like at </joey>
<joey> least you know the large majority of </joey>
<connor> your name was still there and intact </connor>
<joey> like i've had i've been to a convention </joey>
<joey> where they had a sign up and it said the </joey>
<joey> anime guy yeah so i'm just like i'm like </joey>
<joey> that's just a completely different </joey>
<connor> person </connor>
<connor> they must've done that on purpose to </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] with it no no they weren't they </joey>
<joey> were genuine they genuinely thought i </joey>
<connor> was the anime guy and i was and i didn't </connor>
<connor> have the heart to tell them yeah at the </connor>
<connor> time another timeline i was just like </connor>
<joey> all right you know what i'm it's good </joey>
<garnt> enough [ __ ] it yeah for me like every </garnt>
<garnt> convention i go to it's like a 50 chance </garnt>
<joey> of whether it be giggup or gig uk that </joey>
<joey> is that is like i swear half the </joey>
<joey> conventions i go to is just gig uk </joey>
<joey> unfortunately i guess i guess it's </joey>
<joey> helpful for having kids </joey>
<joey> in london it should have been gig uk </joey>
<joey> yeah it makes sense right yeah it's uh </joey>
<joey> when we go to like australia it'll be </joey>
<connor> gig aus right yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> or just geek us in like us </connor>
<joey> in america </joey>
<joey> but yeah like another thing like i </joey>
<joey> noticed is just like </joey>
<joey> every time you like you hang out with </joey>
<joey> your mates or with somewhere where you </joey>
<connor> think you're private it's just like if </connor>
<connor> if someone mentions that wouldn't this </connor>
<connor> be a funny time for you to get noticed </connor>
<connor> it is like the worst [ __ ] it is it is </connor>
<connor> all it's like summoning the devil you </connor>
<connor> know it is going to happen so that </connor>
<connor> because that happened to me uh well it </connor>
<connor> happened to me indirectly right because </connor>
<connor> so we were outside a hotel and we were </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> you know chilling out there was pretty </connor>
<connor> late at night it was about 1am uh and we </connor>
<connor> see this guy just stumble over to like </connor>
<connor> the tree </connor>
<connor> and he just starts throwing up right and </connor>
<connor> he and we're just like [ __ ] who is is he </connor>
<connor> all right he's uh he's obviously not in </connor>
<connor> the right state of mind i don't know </connor>
<connor> where his mates are um so we go over to </connor>
<connor> him and he's obviously had too many </connor>
<connor> drinks uh that night yeah uh and </connor>
<connor> unfortunately he didn't know where his </connor>
<connor> mates were which if you're watching this </connor>
<connor> guy if you're watching this and you uh </connor>
<joey> happen to be a trash taste watcher get </joey>
<connor> better mates </connor>
<joey> you don't leave your mates down you </joey>
<joey> don't leave your mates out like that </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<connor> oh that's quite [ __ ] up yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so it's by the tree uh luckily you </connor>
<connor> know luckily some some some guys uh some </connor>
<connor> like a father had uh had found him and </connor>
<joey> was trying to make sure that he was okay </joey>
<joey> and so we went over and started to help </joey>
<joey> out as well just to make sure that he </joey>
<joey> was kosher and everything uh making sure </joey>
<joey> that uh </joey>
<joey> he was all right he was all right he's </joey>
<connor> going to get home uh so we managed to </connor>
<connor> contact his sister </connor>
<connor> and keep in mind it's like one </connor>
<connor> 1am 2am you know like he's just out here </connor>
<connor> in the middle of london and she was like </connor>
<connor> i believe like on the other side of </connor>
<connor> london or something and we were just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> can you come pick your brother up and uh </connor>
<connor> you know being being the giga chad </connor>
<connor> sister that she was she's like yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> just tell me where she is let me get </connor>
<connor> there now i'll i'll come bring him home </connor>
<connor> right so we were with him for like a </connor>
<connor> good like you know half hour to 45 </connor>
<connor> minutes making sure he was okay making </connor>
<connor> sure he was warm you know make sure he </connor>
<connor> wasn't too passed out um and just </connor>
<connor> being hopefully being a good samaritan </connor>
<connor> while waiting for this </connor>
<garnt> waiting for this mythical sister to come </garnt>
<joey> being a good replacement for the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> mates yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right </joey>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> um and so we're with him for half an </garnt>
<garnt> hour of 245 minutes and then i go i go </garnt>
<connor> into the toilet </connor>
<connor> uh quickly and then as i come outside </connor>
<connor> apparently when i was in the toilet this </connor>

<connor> and there was only like maybe like six </connor>
<connor> of us left we were chilling yeah and uh </connor>
<connor> there was like there was like two </connor>
<connor> couches and there's like an empty space </connor>
<connor> because obviously you know you guys can </connor>
<connor> bed and stuff </connor>
<connor> and they came over and they were like </connor>
<connor> hey uh do you mind if i like take that </connor>
<connor> seat it was like 1am so it's kind of </connor>
<connor> winding down yeah and i was like yeah i </connor>
<connor> mean i don't really think that's like </connor>
<connor> appropriate because like no one really </connor>
<connor> knows you you only know me you know it's </connor>
<connor> kind of it's kind of weird and stuff and </connor>
<connor> they were like oh </connor>

<joey> myself to everyone then and i was like i </joey>

<joey> think that's like the best i think you </joey>
<joey> know it's you know i i appreciate it but </joey>
<connor> like no i i it makes this a bit more </connor>
<joey> like the intention is there but clearly </joey>
<connor> i didn't quite read them yeah i was i </connor>
<joey> was trying to be like as like polite but </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> no as possible right because like you </joey>
<joey> know at the end of the day like there's </joey>
<joey> still somebody who </joey>
<joey> even though i guess some people would be </joey>
<joey> like no you have the permission to be </joey>
<connor> like [ __ ] off at that point yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> people just people say that i'm like i </joey>
<joey> still don't want to do that like to me </joey>
<connor> it's like they're still a person i don't </connor>
<connor> want to be that guy they shoot at their </connor>
<connor> shot and it didn't work and they should </connor>
<joey> have just given up at that point but </joey>
<connor> then after after i said that again i was </connor>
<connor> like no i don't think that's come on man </connor>
<connor> like no i just kind of like stood there </connor>
<connor> awkwardly just like looking at us </connor>
<connor> and then it was just kind of like </connor>
<connor> all my friends are just looking at me </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> and i was like yeah like yeah please do </connor>
<joey> something i'm like okay all right man </joey>
<connor> bye yeah </connor>
<joey> wouldn't leave and then </joey>
<joey> one of our friends just goes </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] did he say </joey>
<connor> he was like just please leave us alone </connor>
<connor> like he's begging like in like a </connor>
<connor> pleading way was like please just leave </connor>
<garnt> us alone please please </garnt>
<garnt> i think i know who i think yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> it was in such a like desperate way that </joey>
<connor> the person was like yeah oh yeah sorry </connor>
<joey> sorry sorry yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like just like like oh no but that </connor>
<garnt> was really funny the way he said that </garnt>
<garnt> that was really please </garnt>
<garnt> please leave us alone </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean i mean </connor>
<connor> you know when you when you hang out at </connor>
<connor> the bar at the convention in the </connor>
<connor> convention hotel this shit's gonna </connor>
<connor> happen like if we really wanted to go </connor>
<connor> somewhere else and like avoid this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> we could have right but like we just </connor>
<connor> wanted the convenience we were all </connor>
<connor> staying in that hotel </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so like i when people do [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like that i know people get like really </connor>
<connor> like that's [ __ ] up that they did that </connor>
<connor> i'm like yeah it's not ideal but i'm </connor>
<connor> also like you know people get excited </connor>
<connor> they shoot their shot they didn't do </connor>
<connor> anything they they asked yeah they </connor>
<joey> didn't just sit down because people have </joey>
<joey> done that before yeah people just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] pulled up yeah like on the panel </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah like i'm glad it's like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm glad people can now know that we </garnt>
<connor> aren't bullshitting no yeah </connor>
<connor> you can </connor>
<connor> you have the right anyone has the right </connor>
<joey> to be like hey can i join you and i have </joey>
<joey> the right to say no yeah and [ __ ] off </joey>
<connor> like exactly </connor>
<garnt> i'm not gonna get pissed at someone for </garnt>
<connor> trying to shoot their shot yeah if you </connor>
<garnt> want to whatever yeah is it is it kind </garnt>
<connor> of rude and insensitive to do it yeah it </connor>
<joey> is but at the same time but at the same </joey>
<joey> time like respect my privacy yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> if you did it respectfully i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> give you the respect to be like explain </connor>
<joey> it nicely like that's not appropriate no </joey>
<connor> and if you don't get it </connor>
<connor> then maybe one of my friends won't be so </connor>
<connor> nice but i'll still be nice but </connor>
<connor> i don't know please just leave the phone </connor>
<connor> you know i i i we i don't know i just </connor>
<connor> say these stories because it's like it's </connor>
<connor> on my mind i wanted to talk about it but </connor>
<connor> i i know it's gonna happen again it's </connor>
<connor> gonna be the last time uh yeah if you </connor>
<connor> ever see me around and you ask to sit </connor>
<joey> next to me i'm probably gonna say no 99 </joey>
<connor> no no [ __ ] i'm going to say no uh </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm gonna say i'm gonna say no </connor>
<connor> probably because i don't know you and </connor>
<connor> it's weird you know and uh yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> like it's not organic yeah yeah i think </garnt>
<connor> in a convention setting it's hard to </connor>
<connor> like draw </connor>
<connor> like a comfortable line you know whereas </connor>
<connor> maybe if you meet someone at a bar and </connor>
<joey> you're not with like a massive group of </joey>
<joey> friends it's different it's different </joey>
<connor> it's difficult definitely it's very it's </connor>
<connor> very different it's like it's you kind </connor>
<connor> of do have to like read the room </connor>
<connor> sometimes which i know some people </connor>
<connor> aren't as in tune with that as other </connor>
<connor> people but you know you try not to hold </connor>
<connor> things against people unless they like </connor>
<connor> seriously do cross like a social </connor>
<connor> boundary yeah you know </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> in which case maybe i should listen to </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] die this morning just be like </garnt>
<connor> sorry man yeah man </connor>
<connor> did you use the man did you use the man </connor>
<connor> i don't know i think i just waffled </connor>
<connor> for 10 minutes just being like no no </connor>
<connor> here's another here's another reason why </connor>
<connor> no here's another reason why no if you </connor>
<joey> would have just said sorry man then that </joey>
<garnt> would be like all right man i respect </garnt>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> that's what we should have said to that </joey>
<garnt> guy who came on stage [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> he was right all along just turned and </joey>
<joey> being like sorry man </joey>
<garnt> sorry man let's just say the place now </garnt>
<connor> man </connor>
<connor> there was this one dude that i i like </connor>
<connor> she doesn't like know what his deal was </connor>
<connor> i was like we were at the bar with john </connor>
<connor> and john was talking to me and i was </connor>
<connor> like man yeah it sucks dude like you </connor>
<connor> know i was like yeah it kind of started </connor>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<joey> i'm sorry </joey>
<joey> i i did it </joey>
<connor> but we've said john like a million times </connor>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> so many other jobs </joey>
<joey> literally such a common name i was in my </joey>
<connor> own head i'm sorry yeah okay that's my </connor>
<joey> bad i suck dude </joey>
<connor> oh yeah i was telling super eye patch </connor>
<connor> fool if i was like yeah man sucks dude </connor>
<connor> like you know i don't feel like i can't </connor>
<connor> really like experience a con the way i </connor>
<connor> used to and then </connor>
<connor> while i'm telling this story to john </connor>
<connor> this guy who must have been like 40 or </connor>
<connor> 50 just shouts full on from across the </connor>
<connor> bar he's like hey connor </connor>
<connor> connor you want a drink you want a drink </connor>
<connor> and i'm like nah i'm good man </connor>
<connor> and john was like you know that guy i'm </connor>
<connor> like not a [ __ ] clown </connor>
<garnt> that was it that was it that was like </garnt>
<garnt> because like they they shout your name </garnt>
<garnt> in such familiarity that even i'm even i </garnt>
<joey> have to double take to be like do i know </joey>
<joey> this yeah did you know what i mean </joey>
<garnt> like a few times when i hang out with </garnt>
<garnt> mates like over here like go on hey gone </garnt>
<garnt> gone and i'm just like oh it's uh i </garnt>
<garnt> wait i i i don't i've never met this man </garnt>
<joey> in my life </joey>
<joey> it's my friend of a friend no </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> don't you don't offer me a drink i'm </connor>
<connor> privileged as you all say so don't [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> i had one time i was in london last time </joey>
<joey> i never told this there's like someone </joey>
<joey> um like a mexican restaurant </joey>
<joey> it was like the thing in the movie it </joey>
<connor> was like the person over there wants to </connor>
<garnt> buy you a drink </garnt>
<garnt> this is [ __ ] cool yeah yeah i'll have </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<garnt> and you bought me like the strongest </garnt>
<joey> drink on the [ __ ] menu and i was like </joey>
<connor> it's like trying to spike so yeah so </connor>
<joey> then i realized i was like yeah i'm not </joey>
<connor> doing this again </connor>
<joey> i'm not letting them choose the drink </joey>
<joey> though the weirder one for me is like </joey>
<connor> the ones where it's like just in passing </connor>
<connor> but you're also like not too sure either </connor>
<connor> because of the lack of information like </connor>
<connor> it's the ones where you're like when </connor>
<connor> you're in the hotel lobby and you're </connor>
<joey> trying to get to the toilet or something </joey>
<joey> and then a person is walking past you </joey>
<joey> and you just very briefly </joey>
<joey> have eye contact and they just go </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> and then they walk off and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> do i know </joey>
<joey> and it's not until i turn around and </joey>
<connor> sometimes they'll turn around be like </connor>
<connor> you know like hey love your stuff and i </connor>
<connor> was like hope you're having a good night </connor>
<joey> and stuff like that you know maybe </joey>
<joey> they're just being friendly i don't know </joey>
<joey> but it's like it's just the silent knot </joey>
<joey> like what is this code for something </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> but uh that's cool though sorry it's </joey>
<connor> cool like that's the one thing i i guess </connor>
<garnt> as well that i've just been like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> getting back used to again because yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know because i personally have been </garnt>
<garnt> stuck in japan for the past three years </garnt>
<connor> now and it's like yeah stranger </connor>
<garnt> friendliness is not as big of a thing as </garnt>
<garnt> it is saying like the uk yeah especially </garnt>
<connor> in a con setting so it's like i'm just </connor>
<joey> getting used to just random people just </joey>
<joey> being like hey yeah we've gone through </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> i feel like it has been like just us </connor>
<connor> readjusting and reacclimating to con </connor>
<connor> culture because it's been like such a </connor>
<connor> we've gone from like zero to like two </connor>
<connor> hundred percent you know and like in </connor>
<connor> like the span in like the span of a day </connor>
<connor> and it's just like i've forgotten one </connor>
<connor> how intense it was before like before </connor>
<connor> covert and everything and now it's like </connor>
<connor> even more intense because one covers </connor>
<connor> happen everyone's even more excited and </connor>
<connor> enthusiastic um and also we are way more </connor>
<garnt> recognizable so it's just kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> all culminated into this massive </garnt>
<joey> stirring pot i i know like for me it was </joey>
<joey> i know like i caught myself being like </joey>
<joey> oh man it's been such a long time since </joey>
<joey> i've been to a con because there's so </joey>
<joey> many times during the signing where like </joey>
<joey> you know because you're meeting so many </joey>
<joey> people right you start to get into like </joey>
<connor> a pattern of things to say yeah right </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like you start off with </connor>
<joey> the hello like how's your con experience </joey>

<connor> uh because everyone like that i've hung </connor>
<garnt> out with can't stop talking about this </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] elizabeth line that's just </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] opened up yeah i like heard </joey>
<joey> about it and it's like some like fancy </joey>
<joey> new line that's like recently opened up </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah so apparently it's this it's </garnt>
<garnt> this line that's been planned for like </garnt>
<garnt> that was meant to open i believe in like </garnt>
<garnt> oh many years ago yeah yeah like like </garnt>
<garnt> 2020 i believe nothing that's open </garnt>
<connor> nothing in the uk yeah never gets done </connor>
<garnt> on time yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then it got it got delayed it got </garnt>
<garnt> delayed but like the hype was real </garnt>
<garnt> i thought like i come into london coming </garnt>
<garnt> to a convention people be like oh have </garnt>
<connor> you started watching spike's family are </connor>
<connor> you watching any new anime no everyone's </connor>

<joey> like have given birth the day before i'd </joey>
<joey> be like baby nah bruh elizabeth line </joey>
<joey> that's the real hype man i gotta try my </joey>
<joey> i gotta try real stuff yeah yeah but </joey>
<joey> like from what i heard it's just like </joey>
<connor> it's a air-conditioned line and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like isn't that just every train in </connor>
<connor> japan </connor>
<joey> it's like the the series of questions we </joey>
<connor> got were very different to how the the </connor>
<connor> the list of questions i would normally </connor>
<connor> get at a signing right because like </connor>
<connor> before trash days it was always like </connor>
<connor> what do you think about this anime what </connor>
<garnt> do you think about this manga and there </garnt>
<garnt> was like definitely like you know some </garnt>
<garnt> amounts of those yeah but i think the </garnt>
<connor> top three questions i received </connor>
<joey> during that entire weekend was yeah </joey>
<connor> number one was have you had a tesco meal </connor>
<joey> deal yet number two was have you been to </joey>
<joey> greggs yet yes and number three was have </joey>
<joey> you been to spoons yet </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> nothing to do with anime it was all just </joey>
<connor> like have you had these things yeah have </connor>
<joey> you had any of them well yeah you took </joey>
<joey> me to a spoon the last time i was here </joey>
<connor> but apparently you took me to like the </connor>
<connor> worst it was the </connor>
<joey> yeah but no i i still haven't had the </joey>
<connor> tesco meal doing i really wanted greg's </connor>
<garnt> i haven't had a grapes yet at all so uh </garnt>
<garnt> i mean yeah we're here for a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> i've forgotten how passionate people are </garnt>
<joey> about greg's yeah that's very good </joey>
<joey> greg's is the bakery yes the bakery yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah so much more than that though yeah </connor>
<connor> it is it's it's an experience </connor>
<connor> you know i'm just a bakery yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like i feel like you have to go there at </connor>
<joey> least once to get your british passport </joey>
<joey> you know that's that's the last test </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> because it's it's really weird because i </joey>
<joey> didn't realize how </joey>
<joey> unknown greg's was to people outside of </joey>
<joey> england right uh because you know we a </joey>
<joey> lot of people british people we speak </joey>
<joey> about nando's we speak about spoons but </joey>
<connor> like not a lot of people speak about </connor>
<connor> greg's abroad and it's just one of these </connor>
<connor> british things that if you're in england </connor>
<connor> you you would have been to a greg's at </connor>
<connor> least once in your life you might not </connor>
<connor> always talk about it but it's part of </connor>
<connor> being british right right and i didn't </connor>
<connor> realize this until i came back to </connor>
<connor> england and uh and you know everyone </connor>
<garnt> started asking me if i'd gone to like if </garnt>
<connor> i'd gone back to greg's yet </connor>
<joey> it's important greg's important thing i </joey>
<joey> feel yeah from from what i heard from </joey>
<joey> people like i feel </joey>
<joey> being british person and not going to </joey>
<joey> greg's is like being a japanese person </joey>
<joey> and not going to family mod </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like that level of like </joey>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> you know to me like family it's he's </garnt>
<garnt> even more than family mart because you </garnt>
<garnt> can find family mart all over asia it's </garnt>
<connor> it's it's like it's like all over asia </connor>
<connor> so greg that yeah yeah there's like </connor>
<connor> family marts in thailand actually </connor>
<connor> like i don't know either but this is </connor>
<connor> news to me yeah yeah yeah exactly so </connor>
<connor> it's it's not like a specific it's it's </connor>
<connor> obviously very japanese like i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> assume it started in japan but it's like </connor>
<joey> expanded but like i believe greg's is </joey>
<joey> only available in the uk right and it's </joey>
<joey> it's nothing </joey>
<joey> so there's like a real like british </joey>
<joey> prize yeah yeah so it's cheap it tastes </joey>
<connor> amazing um </connor>
<garnt> yeah what's next sausage rolls man why </garnt>
<connor> aren't you guys taking me there i want </connor>
<connor> to go i actually haven't seen any it's </connor>
<joey> like the hype is so real in my yeah like </joey>
<joey> not only have you guys like hyped it up </joey>
<joey> but like literally every second british </joey>
<joey> person i met this weekend is like greg's </joey>
<connor> though </connor>
<joey> the nearest greg's yeah real [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah get get your boy some greg and then </joey>
<connor> there were people being like yo so like </connor>
<connor> have you been at tesco's yet like have </connor>
<connor> you had the tesco meal deal yeah not yet </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> i knew like it was like real [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> because like people were like all right </connor>
<connor> here's my recommendation </connor>
<connor> these are the ones to avoid these are </connor>
<connor> the ones that you should go for and i i </connor>
<connor> didn't realize there were so many </connor>
<connor> different meal deals and like there were </connor>
<connor> people like in the signing right there </connor>
<connor> would be like a person in front of me </connor>
<connor> being like all right so here's the meal </connor>
<joey> deal i recommend and i knew it was real </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] when like the person behind them </joey>
<connor> would like interject and be like </connor>
<joey> don't don't don't don't give me don't </joey>
<joey> spread misinformation yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> this is the real [ __ ] and i was just </joey>
<joey> like guys chill out </joey>
<connor> though there's greg's ten minutes away </connor>
<joey> from him [ __ ] yeah what's going on </joey>
<connor> but yeah i mean like i mean like we talk </connor>
<connor> about tesco meal deals but a meal deal </connor>
<garnt> is like a lot of choice so you need to </garnt>
<garnt> like have the optimal order right yeah i </garnt>
<connor> mean there's just like there's like it's </connor>
<connor> it's like blackjack that's the perfect </connor>
<connor> way to play it you know that's what a </connor>
<connor> meal deal is right so you need to you </connor>
<connor> need to learn how to count cards okay </connor>
<connor> pick the right meal deal because you </connor>
<connor> know there's certain items in the meal </connor>
<connor> deal that you can get where if you were </connor>
<connor> to buy them individually it would cost </connor>
<connor> like two pound fifty right so you can </connor>
<connor> kind of min max the price options right </connor>
<connor> yeah so don't be buying water don't get </connor>
<connor> like you know uh [ __ ] little fruit </connor>
<connor> thing get maximize your your cost </connor>
<garnt> performance yeah you don't wanna go for </garnt>
<connor> walkers crisps mccoy's crisps the big </connor>
<connor> boys as well </connor>
<garnt> or walkers max walker's man you can't </garnt>
<garnt> just go like the little [ __ ] basic </garnt>
<garnt> ass vanilla get like an innocent </garnt>
<connor> smoothie as well then i'm like two </connor>
<joey> pounds </joey>
<joey> every person at the same time it's </joey>
<joey> i knew it was real [ __ ] as well because </joey>
<joey> there was like a bunch of people also </joey>
<joey> like when they mentioned the tesco meal </joey>
<joey> deal they were like they came up to me </joey>
<connor> and they were like yeah you know tesco </connor>
<connor> meal deals are amazing but they opted by </connor>
<connor> 50p and it's an absolute [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> travesty and i'm just like i wish i </connor>
<joey> could feel your anger right now because </joey>
<connor> it seems very real right there's one </connor>
<connor> like one minute walk not even one minute </connor>
<joey> like it's literally opposite our hotel </joey>
<joey> oh [ __ ] yeah so yeah yeah there's </joey>
<joey> usually there was this article in the uk </joey>
<joey> uh that some doctor was calling for meal </joey>
<joey> deals to be banned because they're too </joey>
<joey> unhealthy </joey>
<joey> really and they're too like </joey>
<joey> appealing yeah because they're still </joey>
<garnt> feeling because people people just buy </garnt>
<garnt> these like every day for lunch because </garnt>
<garnt> it's such good value for money and they </garnt>
<garnt> taste [ __ ] amazing but they're really </garnt>
<connor> bad for you because the sandwiches are </connor>
<connor> like absolutely like </connor>
<connor> just stuffed with awful stuff yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> but it's like a mcdonald's burger it's </connor>
<connor> like you don't want to know what goes in </connor>
<connor> but you know it tastes so bad it tastes </connor>
<connor> good right yeah why does it taste so </connor>
<joey> damn good what does ronald put in those </joey>
<joey> are exactly the same as all right oh </joey>
<connor> yeah they're like like you know the </connor>
<joey> sandwiches are like not fresh at all but </joey>
<joey> like yeah but they still taste good they </joey>
<garnt> taste really funny yeah i mean i guess </garnt>
<garnt> it's like talking going back to like why </garnt>
<garnt> people are recommending you what to </garnt>
<joey> order it's kind of like going to like </joey>
<joey> you know a chinese dress from here </joey>
<connor> ordering like kung pao chicken or </connor>
<joey> something like i've had chinese food and </joey>
<connor> then you know everyone would be like no </connor>
<joey> you have not had chinese food you know </joey>
<joey> and i mean it's like you know </joey>
<joey> expressive yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<garnt> yeah no you like i'm not even the meal </garnt>
<garnt> deal guy but if you go if you're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> try one out joey at least try like the </garnt>
<connor> optimal meal deal </connor>
<connor> and then we can have a real experience </connor>
<garnt> and then we can argue about it you know </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> some of the sandwiches come with an </connor>
<joey> additional slice oh just for free like </joey>
<connor> just out of the general it's not like a </connor>
<joey> secret menu or anything no no no no no </joey>
<connor> there's like because normally it's like </connor>
<joey> you don't have to say like a code word </joey>
<joey> normally it's like two slices but some </joey>
<joey> of them for some reason they have like </joey>
<connor> one sandwich and a half in it and no one </connor>
<connor> knows why </connor>
<joey> it's one of the great mysteries of the </joey>
<joey> world it's like they're like just trying </joey>
<joey> to figure it out if you've like truly </joey>
<joey> optimized them yeah like if you're if </joey>
<joey> you're a real player yeah i don't know </joey>
<joey> that's how you go through like </joey>
<garnt> everything in the menu you know so you </garnt>
<joey> so you you know the good [ __ ] i've had </joey>
<connor> i've had a pot noodle yet [ __ ] i want to </connor>
<joey> have a bombay bad boy partner is that </joey>
<joey> like the </joey>
<connor> cup noodle there yeah </connor>
<connor> dude the spicy one is so good it smells </connor>
<joey> so good well i'd see i want to </joey>
<joey> experience this all right all right yeah </joey>
<connor> i guess i guess i guess </connor>
<connor> i'm just scared that you might not like </connor>
<connor> the stuff and i'll be like this is </connor>
<connor> literally my entire existence is waiting </connor>
<connor> on this like if you don't if you don't </connor>
<joey> if you don't like this i'm gonna die </joey>
<joey> i mean look there's a lot of food that </joey>
<joey> is considered awful that i absolutely </joey>
<joey> enjoy so i mean how bad are you going </joey>
<garnt> famous last words how bad could it be </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta be honest joey you gotta be </garnt>
<garnt> honest you know we wouldn't be the trash </garnt>
<connor> taste podcast if we weren't honest i </connor>
<connor> keep forgetting how [ __ ] mayo is as well </connor>
<garnt> huh i keep forgetting how bad yeah i've </garnt>
<connor> i've gone back to not eating mayo i i i </connor>
<connor> had one sandwich because like japan has </connor>
<connor> conditioned me to be like mayo tastes </connor>
<connor> good </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> i always forget i'm just like i just </connor>
<connor> assume everywhere it has cupid </connor>
<connor> mayonnaise yeah it's like oh no that </connor>
<garnt> that was like a delicacy </garnt>
<connor> should have brought your own that's like </connor>
<garnt> some real [ __ ] yeah yeah i i've kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like come to this realization because i </garnt>
<garnt> did like i i did it's a small tangent </garnt>
<connor> but before the boys came here i did go </connor>
<connor> on like uh </connor>
<connor> go on like a </connor>
<connor> quick trip to like belgium </connor>

<connor> spending money in england is way too </connor>
<joey> easy </joey>
<connor> bro yeah just tapping that card yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like monopoly so like i know the us </joey>
<joey> has contactless japan has contactless </joey>
<joey> but like </joey>
<joey> in the form of suica no no one you can't </joey>
<joey> use that like restaurants and stuff </joey>
<joey> right it's it's for like other places </joey>
<connor> yeah it is getting better though too </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah because like a lot of i i did </connor>
<connor> notice that a lot of places because like </connor>
<joey> in australia as well now it's like </joey>
<connor> everything is just like yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> dude i mean like in the uk now it just </connor>
<garnt> seems to be that like the default is now </garnt>
<garnt> the tapping the credit card yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's way too easy to spend a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> money yeah yeah just something pops up </garnt>
<connor> you're like i don't even know how much </connor>
<connor> it is [ __ ] tap and then you're like </connor>
<joey> i'm broke now [ __ ] because like i </joey>
<joey> remember like the the first time like </joey>
<joey> they they bring that out right and they </joey>
<joey> just kind of like hand it to you it's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> i was because i'm so used to doing it in </connor>
<connor> japan right so i pulled my phone out to </connor>
<joey> like get my suitca ready right and i was </joey>
<joey> just like nope that's not it that's it's </joey>
<connor> credit card it's credit card i think you </connor>
<connor> could do with your phone now if you had </connor>
<joey> the right things yeah right and it's </joey>
<joey> like and and because you know i'm so </joey>
<connor> used to like even in japan when you do </connor>
<connor> like the whole tapping thing yeah like </connor>
<connor> not only can you see how much money </connor>
<connor> you've spent but it's also like there's </connor>
<connor> a little bit of a process right yeah </connor>
<connor> like you know kind of get it going but </connor>
<joey> yeah in the uk it's literally just </joey>
<garnt> and you're done yeah yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> because a lot a lot of the times uh </garnt>
<garnt> because with contactless here they like </garnt>
<joey> it's they have like a specific device </joey>
<joey> for contact lists or they'll like show </joey>
<joey> you the side with the contactless on </joey>
<joey> yeah uh and it's not decided with the </joey>
<joey> price on so you don't even know how much </joey>
<connor> is that yeah exactly exactly like i i've </connor>
<connor> realized after coming back this time </connor>
<connor> they've increased the limit again yeah </connor>
<connor> so when first contactless started coming </connor>
<connor> out i believe the limit was like 20 when </connor>
<connor> when i was at 20. </connor>
<connor> and then it got really increased to 30 </connor>
<connor> and then i believe 40. and i was like </connor>
<connor> 80. we we just [ __ ] doubled the </connor>
<connor> amount with a single tap of your card </connor>
<connor> you can spend 100 bucks you know that's </connor>
<connor> so scary like </connor>
<connor> i realized how dangerous this was </connor>
<connor> because at the convention uh i was like </connor>
<connor> buying i was like buying a round of </connor>
<connor> drinks um </connor>
<connor> and uh i didn't like i normally in japan </connor>
<connor> they at least they tell you the price </connor>
<connor> right they tell you the price of how </connor>
<connor> much you're spending and here they don't </connor>
<connor> even tell you the price they just assume </connor>
<connor> you know the price and they they they </connor>
<connor> give you the contact thing and you beep </connor>
<connor> it so i i bring back i bring back the </connor>
<connor> drinks and i remember one of my friends </connor>
<connor> asked me oh was uh are the drinks </connor>
<connor> expensive here and i would just go </connor>
<connor> yeah i didn't know </connor>
<connor> maybe </connor>
<connor> so i feel like yes is the answer but i </connor>
<connor> don't know yeah and then and they're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i say i think it's probably expensive </connor>
<connor> and they'll and they're like no no is it </connor>
<connor> london expensive or is it london hotel </connor>
<connor> expensive and i was just like </connor>
<joey> yes yes </joey>
<connor> yes either one of those yeah </connor>
<garnt> i probably have to ask how much drinks </garnt>
<garnt> are but right now i literally have no </garnt>
<garnt> idea i just tapped my wallet away i </garnt>
<joey> literally don't know how much i've spent </joey>
<connor> while i've been here just because again </connor>
<connor> they don't tell you yeah it's so easy </connor>
<connor> it's literally just like throwing </connor>
<connor> monopoly money out true true being like </connor>
<connor> yeah cool okay that was easy sweet and </connor>
<joey> then it's only when you get back to the </joey>
<garnt> hotel and you're like oh [ __ ] i wish it </garnt>
<garnt> was monopoly money because at least with </garnt>
<garnt> monopoly money you kind of like know how </garnt>
<garnt> much you're spending you're like you </garnt>
<connor> know i keep tracking my monopoly money </connor>
<connor> i spend it very carefully </connor>
<connor> yeah because it's scary i remember like </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> because we went to we </connor>
<connor> we we had a night and we ended up just </connor>
<connor> like quickly just like as a group mates </connor>
<connor> in the casino right and so </connor>
<connor> uh we didn't you know we didn't play </connor>
<connor> that much but you know i played a little </connor>
<connor> bit and i ended up with some some like </connor>
<connor> physical money on me at the end of the </connor>
<connor> night right and i remember like cashing </connor>
<connor> out getting this physical money in my </connor>
<connor> wallet and i was like this is useless </connor>
<connor> when am i ever going to spend this when </connor>
<connor> am i ever going to spend this physical </connor>
<connor> money that they've given me right and </connor>
<joey> because you don't ever need to spend </joey>
<joey> like cash at all yeah i noticed yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah so now it's just like a paperweight </garnt>
<connor> in my [ __ ] wallet </connor>
<garnt> suffering from </garnt>
<joey> success it's not even it's like what am </joey>
<garnt> i going to do with all this money this </garnt>
<garnt> is just suffering from convenience </garnt>
<joey> it is suffering from convenience that </joey>
