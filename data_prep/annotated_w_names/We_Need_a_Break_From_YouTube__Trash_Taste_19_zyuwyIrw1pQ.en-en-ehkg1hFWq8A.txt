<garnt> - Let me, may be a second. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me just. (screams) </garnt>
<garnt> (screams) </garnt>
<garnt> - Now I'm scared. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like a dragon bull fan now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm ready to talk about that one. </connor>
<joey> - No, you haven't done your steroids yet. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - What's up simps? </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> I'm in, simp lord number one. </joey>
<joey> And I'm with simp lord number two and three. </joey>
<joey> We're tired, have you guessed? </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> I hope I hope Mudan left that fucking shouting thing in </joey>
<garnt> at the beginning. </garnt>
<joey> Cause that is like, that's not an act. </joey>
<joey> We sometimes do that just to wake ourselves up </joey>
<joey> for the show. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm taking a page from corners book. </garnt>
<garnt> I was about to say taking a book from Connor's page. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait a minute. </garnt>
<garnt> That doesn't sound right. </garnt>
<joey> - So what have you guys been up to this week? </joey>
<connor> I know Connor you went on a trip, right? </connor>
<joey> - I did, but before that. </joey>
<connor> I got this sick new shirt. </connor>
<garnt> - Where'd you get that sick shirt? </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably the same place you got your sick shirt. </garnt>
<joey> - And Joey got his. </joey>
<joey> - What? when was this? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that's right. </joey>
<joey> We're finally releasing merch. </joey>
<joey> After all this time. </joey>
<joey> We've seen it on the subreddit, we've seen it on the Twitter </joey>
<joey> and we're like, where's the merch guys? </joey>

<garnt> So yeah, if you want to Simplus you can go to... </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the store again? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so this is a special deal that we're doing right now </joey>
<joey> with our friend, Bakuretsu, </joey>
<joey> who, if you guys can see the logo, </joey>
<garnt> he's the guy who designed the logo. </garnt>
<garnt> And he decided to, this is official collaboration merch </garnt>
<garnt> for a limited time, only two weeks. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have until I believe October 24th, 12:00 PM </garnt>
<garnt> Eastern time to pre-order these shirts. </garnt>

<joey> you guys will be able to get these shirts. </joey>
<joey> You can get it in either white or black. </joey>
<joey> - So buy them, buy them now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, go buy them now. </garnt>
<connor> - This is more like, kind of like an experiment for us. </connor>
<connor> We always talking about merch. </connor>
<garnt> So we didn't know how many of you would be interested. </garnt>
<garnt> This is just like a first release. </garnt>
<garnt> So, if you like this then we might do more merch </garnt>
<garnt> in the future, who knows? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a very simple design, </connor>
<connor> but we just wanted to start simple. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just start simple, you know, easy to know. </joey>
<connor> - Materials are amazing, I got to say boys. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, this is much better quality </joey>
<joey> than what you'll get at regular T-shirt sites. </joey>
<joey> But so, if you're interested in that </joey>
<joey> go to bakuretsu.co/trashtaste </joey>
<joey> link's in the description as well. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, hopefully you guys will simp for us </joey>
<joey> with these beautiful new shirts. </joey>
<connor> - But yes, Joey, I did go on a trip. </connor>
<joey> - Where'd you go? </joey>
<joey> - I went to Niigata, which is Northern North. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like directly North of Japan, not Japan. </joey>
<joey> Directly, North of Tokyo is what I was trying to say, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I had a friend, Kenta, from university. </connor>
<connor> Who actually loved the story parts from our university. </connor>
<joey> Cause he was like correcting some of the details to me </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really </joey>
<joey> - in my mind. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And how like the Neo Nazi guy made like phosphorus </joey>
<connor> chemical substance (Garnt laughing) in the building. </connor>
<joey> - Were your fucking roommates like Walter White </joey>
<connor> or something? </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, this guy was insane, man. </joey>
<joey> But anyway. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It was nice meeting him again. </joey>
<joey> I haven't seen him in ages and he lives in Northern Japan </joey>
<joey> and he's a teacher there and a pastor. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, he's chill. </joey>
<joey> Just went up to see him. </joey>
<connor> - A pastor? </connor>
<connor> - Pastor, yeah. He's a pastor. </connor>
<joey> So in japan... </joey>
<joey> - Like P-A-S-T-O-R not P-A-S-T-A. </joey>
<joey> - NOT pasta. </joey>
<joey> - He's a pasta, linguine. </joey>
<connor> - I can't say it right, a pastor. </connor>
<joey> It's a pasta. </joey>
<joey> If I want to eat pasta, I would have that, </joey>
<connor> but he's a pastor. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Did you eat pasta with the pastor? </connor>
<joey> - I did, yeah, I did that. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, because in Japan there's a... </joey>
<joey> This is kind of so damn and condescending. </joey>
<joey> There's a job for like foreigners. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't even look that foreign. </joey>
<joey> He still looks Japanese. </joey>
<joey> He's half, like we. </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> - He's, half Wales, half Japanese. </joey>
<joey> And his job is to basically repeat a script </joey>
<joey> that a real pastor might. </joey>
<joey> Like it's all for show. </joey>
<joey> So they just want a foreign looking guy </joey>
<joey> to like say the words. </joey>
<joey> - So he's not even like a legit pastor? </joey>
<joey> - No, none of them are. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's like a fake service. </joey>
<joey> So you pay a guy and he just says the lines </joey>
<joey> and does all the moves and looks (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> the real part. </garnt>
<garnt> Feel like he's seen a pastor, like that's his job. </garnt>
<connor> He marries people </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait, how is that a job? </connor>
<garnt> In what job sector is it needed? </garnt>
<connor> - I think there's a huge market in Japan </connor>
<connor> for wanting a foreign experience wedding. </connor>
<connor> It's like a really like. </connor>
<joey> - Could I find this on Craigslist? </joey>
<connor> like looking for fake pastor. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's interesting, it's expensive as well. </connor>
<connor> He was telling me the price, it's premium. </connor>
<joey> It's for like rich people. </joey>
<joey> - Rich and dumb people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, to us that's dumb as fuck, </joey>
<joey> but to them it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> So that's his job and yeah, he was basically like, </joey>
<connor> you want to hang out in Niigata and I was like, sure. </connor>
<joey> I want to leave Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> I'm just sick of Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - How long were you there for? </joey>
<joey> like three or four days, right? </joey>
<connor> - Three days, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So the first day didn't really do... </connor>
<connor> Oh, the first day I went out with him that night </connor>
<joey> and he took me to a bunch of girl bars, </joey>
<joey> which are not like hostess bars. </joey>
<joey> Cause hostess bars they sit next to you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like a bar where the girls </joey>
<joey> are on the other side. </joey>
<joey> Normally it's like 40 year old, 50 year old men. </joey>
<joey> Just like older men </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, from what I understand is a girl bar's just </garnt>
<joey> where the bartender, whoever's like your waitress, </joey>
<joey> is just obligated to talk to you. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Is that right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, we went to a bunch though. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a really expensive call center. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> It's like one on one. </connor>
<connor> - Some of the prices weren't bad. </connor>
<connor> Like the first bar we went into, </connor>
<connor> the girls like only spoke to the other girls. </connor>
<connor> Not like, I'm like fucking pay me attention. </connor>
<connor> I just, I'd never been to one. </connor>
<connor> He was like, do you want to go to one? </connor>
<connor> He was like, do you want to see you at them all? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, sure, why not? </connor>
<connor> This will be a fun story to tell in Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> which is worth more than money. </connor>
<joey> So, the first one was like 900 yen for 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - That's cheap. </joey>
<joey> - So you can drink as much as you want in that 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> And it went very slowly </joey>
<joey> because the people were no fun there. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> But yeah, </joey>
<joey> - Clearly that, that explains the price. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You just like banter with them. </joey>
<joey> Like one of them was saying that they can't understand </joey>
<joey> English characters and in Japanese I asked them like, </joey>
<joey> can you read Kanji? </joey>
<joey> And they were like, yes. </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, I rest my case. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Why? as if like they can't read the alphabet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they've been studying it for like five years </connor>
<connor> and couldn't read the English alphabet. </connor>
<connor> - What? how? </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, so you can read Kanji, right? in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> She's like, yes. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, hmm. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt speaks foreign language) </joey>
<joey> - Yes, I said (Connor speaks foreign language) </joey>
<connor> all the old dudes in the bar laugh. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, hell yeah, dude. </connor>
<joey> And everyone clapped and stood up there. </joey>
<joey> - He saved the boys there. </joey>
<joey> - So then we left that bar </joey>
<joey> and immediately like four people were like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, oh nice, you know these guys? </connor>
<connor> And he's like, no. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, oh, we're following them? </connor>
<joey> He said, yeah, why not? </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, okay, cool. </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<connor> - So we're following them and they take us to a bunny bar. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, like everyone's in a bunny costume. </joey>
<joey> - Is that what I think it is? </joey>
<connor> Everyone's just sitting in a bunny suit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but due to COVID they weren't in the bunny suits. </connor>
<connor> They were in bunny school girl outfits. </connor>
<joey> And I thought this is a cop-out </joey>
<joey> because they're wearing school outfits. </joey>
<joey> - But with the bunny ears. </joey>
<connor> - (mumbles) bunny ears. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like every cosplay who says they cosplay </garnt>
<garnt> and they just wear headbands. </garnt>
<connor> - We walked in there and it was exactly </connor>
<garnt> like what you think. </garnt>
<joey> It looked like, to quote Joey, a bunch of ugly bastards. </joey>
<joey> It was like 50 year old men who looked like really, </joey>
<joey> really like... </joey>
<joey> - Just craving for attention, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and we sat down and we looked at the prices </joey>
<joey> and it was like 50 bucks for 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - So we were like, so we're leaving, right? </joey>
<joey> Like we're not staying. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then the here he looked at me like, yep. </joey>
<joey> Yep, all right, cool. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just going to go now, then you follow me. </joey>
<joey> So we just did that. </joey>
<joey> - So, leave before the dudes saw us, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so we ditched the guys who took us there </joey>
<joey> and they were like, whoa, where are you going? </joey>
<joey> We be like, bye, bye, bye, went to another bar. </joey>
<joey> That was a lot of fun. </joey>
<joey> We just spent all night, and then somehow </joey>
<connor> some sketchy dude was like come to another bar I know. </connor>
<garnt> No, we never met this guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - At what time of the night was this? </garnt>
<connor> - Was like 2:00 AM. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - We got to take it to another bar. </garnt>
<joey> And we get in there and it's like a drag queen bar. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like how? like proper gay bar. </joey>
<joey> And it was a lot of fun and yeah. </joey>
<joey> Sung Bohemian Rhapsody, and I was butchering it. </joey>
<joey> And I knew the guy next to me was like, </joey>
<joey> you know, playing very nice. </joey>
<joey> Cause he was saying I was singing great. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, no, no I'm not. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, are you alive, this is just. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it doesn't matter who you're with, right? </joey>
<connor> No one can sing 'queen' well. </connor>
<joey> Everyone butchers 'queen'. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, you're a very attractive guy </joey>
<connor> but you don't need to lie to me. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - I know I'm butchering it. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I know I'm shit at this too. </connor>
<connor> You can't make this more obvious. </connor>
<connor> Then we just went to another bar </connor>
<connor> and just chat shit with people. </connor>
<connor> I feel like my Japanese got way better when I was drinking. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I dunno why, but it's the same as my Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> as my Thai, where when I get like a few drinks down me </garnt>
<garnt> somehow your language skill was just improved </garnt>
<connor> by like five folds. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<garnt> - You stop doubting yourself. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You just say shit. </connor>
<joey> - It's really weird though because that works </joey>
<joey> for every language except English. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so funny, like I forget how to speak English. </garnt>
<garnt> So sometimes I just like run, like when I get super drunk. </garnt>
<joey> I noticed last time you got drunk at the onsen, </joey>
<joey> you just like start speaking Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, I totally get that. </joey>
<garnt> Cause when I get drunk, I just start speaking Thai as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> So many people have told me like when I get blind drunk, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter if no one around me can speak Japanese. </joey>
<joey> I only speak Japanese. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like really fucking proficient. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm reciting like fucking, </joey>
<joey> like MLK speech in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> And meanwhile if I go back to English </joey>
<joey> I'd just be like more drink here. </joey>
<joey> I just go cave man when I go English, for some reason. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> - I brought a souvenir. </connor>
<joey> - Souvenirs? </joey>
<connor> - Little green being things. </connor>
<joey> - Kind of want to bring gifts. </joey>
<connor> - Well, just cause Joey brought. </connor>
<connor> - After I applied pressure to him. </connor>
<connor> All right, don't worry folks, we found them. </connor>
<joey> They were just behind us the entire time. </joey>
<connor> - So, I'm guessing because Joey started this. </connor>
<joey> Now we have to bring things back when we go somewhere. </joey>
<joey> I was told this is a famous Niigata thing. </joey>
<connor> What is this Joey? </connor>
<joey> - It is sasa dango. </joey>
<connor> - Of course, I mean, I can read that but... </connor>
<garnt> - That's my favorite. </garnt>
<joey> - But what is it Joey? tell us. </joey>
<joey> - I know of it. </joey>
<joey> I've heard of it before, but I'd never actually... </joey>
<joey> - So, we dig in. </joey>
<joey> - So basically, this is banana leaves. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just like a dango which is like a, </connor>
<connor> not a dumpling, what's the word for it? </connor>
<connor> - A red bean paste. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, kind of like a red bean paste. </connor>
<connor> It's got red bean in it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but basically you just crack this open. </connor>
<connor> I've never actually had one before. </connor>
<connor> I know what these are because I've seen them around </connor>
<joey> because all sorts of different... </joey>
<joey> Cause I think there's different types of sasa dango </joey>
<joey> for different areas of Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Wow, that's wow. </joey>
<joey> - That's (Joey speaks foreign language) right there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, also for Joey's birthday, </joey>
<joey> I got him a bottle of wine. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, thank you. </joey>
<joey> - Which I don't know which one you want Joey. </joey>
<connor> Then I bought one for the Trash Taste boys. </connor>
<connor> These are both Niigata wines. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, cause you stayed in a onsen that had a winery </garnt>
<garnt> in it or something, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I went to visit, I didn't stay in it, </connor>
<connor> cause it was like $800 a night and yeah, </connor>
<joey> Trash Taste ain't doing that well yet. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> But yeah, no. </joey>
<joey> So, I did try a lot of the local wines while I was there </joey>
<connor> and I thought they were actually pretty good. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, why not bring back a wine for the boys? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I noticed with Japanese wine. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I remember when I went to, I can't remember, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's Koshi Valley, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's kind of like the Napa Valley of Japan. </garnt>
<joey> And I tried a lot of the local wines there </joey>
<joey> and I find that Japanese wines are either really good </joey>
<joey> or not so great. </joey>
<garnt> I've never tried a Japanese wine and I've just been like, </garnt>
<garnt> Hmm, this is like, this is okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I love that this is considered Japanese wine. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh yes, my favorite Japanese wine. </joey>
<joey> (Joey speaks foreign language) </joey>
<garnt> I probably butchered that German. </garnt>
<garnt> It says Japan at the front though so... </garnt>
<garnt> - This is good, this is like the weirdest unboxing </garnt>
<connor> I've ever done. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, we are unboxing banana leafs. </garnt>
<joey> - So you have to you, because this thing is thick </joey>
<joey> you have to kind of take it in small chunks. </joey>
<joey> Don't don't eat the whole thing because you will choke on it </joey>
<joey> and possibly die. </joey>
<joey> - Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, you know it's like really common way </joey>
<garnt> that people die here, a lot of old people die </garnt>
<garnt> from choking on dango and mochi. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Health hazard. </connor>
<garnt> - So I just bite into this thing? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> This reminds me of a Thai dish. </garnt>
<garnt> There's there's a Thai dish of something similar. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Just take small chunks, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, It's like, in Thailand we have like banana leaves </garnt>
<garnt> that have like sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves. </garnt>
<connor> - It's actually pretty nice. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, can I have the banana. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna eat it all at once. </connor>
<connor> - That does taste like a banana leaf. </connor>
<joey> - I like this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - I just like the flavor though. </joey>
<joey> I mean, other than the red bean, </joey>
<joey> - I mean like, okay. </joey>
<garnt> For anyone who hasn't tried red bean paste. </garnt>
<garnt> It's, how do you describe to someone </garnt>
<garnt> who hasn't tried red bean paste before? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh dude, it's weird. </connor>
<joey> I don't. </joey>
<joey> It's hard. </joey>
<connor> - But you guys like it, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I like it, but it's.. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's grown on me, red bean paste is that one thing </garnt>
<garnt> where as like, I dunno, somebody grew up in the West. </garnt>
<connor> My idea of my idea of... </connor>
<connor> - Sweets. </connor>
<connor> - My idea of my idea of like desserts or sweets, </connor>
<joey> basically just boiled down to chocolate and ice cream. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, if I'm feeling like super fancy or something, </joey>
<joey> something like a tiramisu or cake or something like that, </joey>
<garnt> having like red bean paste and like mochi and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, man, this tastes really good. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I've always been fascinated </joey>
<joey> in the whole Japanese sweets, like culture I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - It gets weird man, they go crazy with sweets. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's called wagashi, for those of you want to know. </garnt>
<garnt> But like dango, mochi, that kind of stuff is like, </garnt>
<joey> it's weird because a lot of wagashi, </joey>
<joey> a lot of Japanese sweets can either be sweet </joey>
<joey> or depending on what you put with it, </joey>
<joey> they can also be savory. </joey>
<joey> So it's like a weird, cause like this for example, </joey>
<joey> it's sweet, but it's not like a chocolate sweet </joey>
<joey> or like a tiramisu sweet. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's almost a savory sweet, if that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, like my dad, for instance, </joey>
<joey> can't eat red bean paste just because, it's weird, </joey>
<joey> he likes the flavor, but he doesn't like the texture. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's super, super thick. </garnt>
<joey> It's just basically </joey>
<joey> - It's like grainy, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Almost. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like sludgy. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - We're throwing a lot of different adjectives </joey>
<garnt> out and then none of them are matching </garnt>
<joey> - It's because like there's nothing I can point </joey>
<joey> to in like that people can just ground that texture with </joey>
<joey> in like the West or something. </joey>
<joey> It's just something, it's thicker than ice cream </joey>
<joey> but it's a bit like pasty as well. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> I'm just doing it. </joey>
<joey> I'm doing an awful job. </joey>
<joey> - Just try it out. </joey>
<joey> - Like, the one dessert I haven't enjoyed as much </joey>
<joey> as I thought I would have, like based on the hype </joey>
<joey> that everyone talks about it, is a shaved ice. </joey>
<joey> Japanese shaved ice. </joey>
<joey> - Is shit. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It's basically just like a Japanese version </connor>
<joey> of a snow cone. </joey>
<joey> Essentially. </joey>
<connor> - People fucking love it here and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> just get an ice cream. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes you don't want ice cream, </connor>
<joey> sometimes you want something a little more refreshing </joey>
<garnt> than an ice cream. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, cause here there are some shaved ice places </garnt>
<garnt> that people will line up to for fucking an hour. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, I don't get that shit. </joey>
<connor> Like I'll just fucking make it at home. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I'm not going to like, cause there are some </garnt>
<garnt> shaved ice places that are like, </garnt>
<joey> there's stores that specialize in shave ice. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, what's the difference </joey>
<garnt> between making it at home? making it here? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like Meilyne fucking </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Of course. </garnt>
<joey> - Cause she's a food critic, right? our producer. </joey>
<joey> She's like, I found this like amazing shaved ice place </joey>
<joey> but there's like a two hour line every day. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, why are people lining up for it? </joey>
<joey> And she's like, oh, it's like fluffy. </joey>
<joey> That's not what I look for in a shave </joey>
<connor> - After like two minutes, after you've been given, </connor>
<garnt> it all just starts melting to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where it just doesn't taste good. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just slush. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's having a slush puppie with extra sugar on it. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't like it, the places when they just have </connor>
<connor> like chocolate sauce squirted on shit. </connor>
<garnt> Like how can you sit there and tell me something is worth </garnt>
<garnt> two hours wait, when you've just got a bottle </garnt>
<garnt> of like chocolate squeeze shit on it. </garnt>
<connor> - Like how does squeeze chocolate take long. </connor>
<connor> - You literally have to put chocolate sauce on water </connor>
<connor> and people lining up two hours for this shit. </connor>
<joey> Are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> Like gelato, that shit is amazing, man. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I love that shit, so fresh. </joey>
<joey> - I like gelato. </joey>
<connor> - Gelato gang rice. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, I absolutely love, </connor>
<connor> I had like proper authentic gelato. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean it's all right. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck do you mean it's all right </connor>
<garnt> - I had to stop my thoughts and I'm like, excuse me. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just thick ice cream. </joey>
<joey> Let's be honest guys. </joey>
<joey> Let's not build this up. </joey>
<joey> - That's the best part. </joey>
<joey> - You have one fucking bite, you're like, man, </joey>
<garnt> I'll just have three course meal and I'm good. </garnt>
<joey> - I had legit, like, I don't wanna say, we'd say home grown. </joey>
<joey> - In Italian? </joey>
<joey> - I had a legit gelato in Florence in Italy </joey>
<connor> and that shit was the fucking bomb. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, it's the best. </connor>
<joey> - I thought gelato here and like in Australia was good. </joey>
<joey> But then I had it in Florence I'm like, </joey>
<joey> damn this hits different. </joey>
<connor> - Italians, man, they know how to make fucking gelato. </connor>
<connor> - They know how to make good gelato. </connor>
<connor> - I love you, just keep it gelato. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Florence just keep making gelato. </connor>
<connor> - Never change, never change. </connor>
<joey> - Never change, never change. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but I dunno like, are there any other, </joey>
<connor> like Japanese sweets that you guys like. </connor>
<connor> - Melon pan scrape. </connor>
<joey> - Melon pan? </joey>
<garnt> Is that considered a sweet? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that just goes back to the bread conversations </connor>
<joey> where like a lot of things just happen to be sweet sweets. </joey>
<connor> But are they really sweets? </connor>
<connor> - It's more of a sweet than bread, I'd say. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Well, things like melon pan and like chocolate coronets </joey>
<connor> are considered like cush bang which is sweet bread </connor>
<connor> or like a confectionary bread. </connor>
<connor> That's what it's called. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, chocolate coronets. </joey>
<connor> Like the eye corneas? </connor>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I thought as well. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Chocolate coronets are like the ones that the fucking </garnt>
<joey> cornets eat in 'lucky star'. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, those ones? </joey>
<joey> - Like the little like swirly with the chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - The poopy ones? </joey>
<joey> - The poopy ones, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing.) </joey>
<joey> - They look like poop. </joey>
<joey> - It's the poopy bread, right? </joey>
<garnt> - You bite it and then the black shit comes out </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll show you, but you've definitely seen it. </joey>
<joey> It's got like the big hole at the bottom </joey>
<joey> where they squeeze the chocolate into </joey>
<joey> and the entire debate, like 'Lucky Star' </joey>
<joey> started this entire debate of like which side </joey>
<joey> do you eat the chocolate cornet from, the fat end </joey>
<joey> or the thick end. </joey>
<joey> The entire first episode of lucky star is that </joey>
<joey> That's how an anime opens. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's great. </joey>
<joey> There's lots of those kinds of bread in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And then there's like the savory bread, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But for some reason they also make the savory bread </joey>
<joey> sweet in a sense. </joey>
<garnt> So, I just don't... </garnt>
<garnt> - There's just nothing that's savory in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - There's just nothing savory. </joey>
<joey> And when it comes to bread, there's nothing savory. </joey>
<joey> It's Weird enough like this kind of shit </joey>
<joey> is more savory sometimes. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Than the bread that you get. </joey>
<joey> - What'd you want? something savory. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so just a little bit of sugar. </joey>
<joey> It's like, no, no, no, no sugar. </joey>
<joey> So just one teaspoon of sugar. </joey>
<garnt> Is that what you're talking about? </garnt>
<joey> - It goes back to the whole like Thai dish no spice, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, what do you mean no spice in a Thai dish? </joey>
<garnt> - That's not an option. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, one chili, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - But like I noticed with Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many different types of sweets. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like it's because of the gift giving culture </garnt>
<connor> here, because there seems to be like a gift </connor>
<connor> for every occasion and every kind of relationship you have. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So dumb, so dumb </garnt>
<joey> - There's, my favorite example of just </joey>
<garnt> the gift giving culture that is just way too intense </garnt>
<garnt> is a Valentine's day in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, well, I mean there's, there's the whole concept </garnt>
<garnt> of like Valentine's day, which is on the usual, </garnt>
<garnt> February 14th and then there's White day, </garnt>
<joey> which is March 14th. </joey>
<joey> - See, the only reason I know this is because of anime </joey>
<joey> because there's the one episode in every romance </joey>
<joey> or harem anime where like the girl or the guy </joey>
<garnt> is just rushing to get some fucking chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> for the other guy. </garnt>
<joey> - The girl is always like she's just making the chocolate, </joey>
<joey> has to stay up all night and the chocolate sucks </joey>
<joey> but the main protagonist is like, no, it's still good. </joey>
<garnt> It doesn't matter because she poured her heart </garnt>
<connor> and soul into this. </connor>
<connor> - It's one week before, right? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> - White day? </joey>
<joey> - No white day is March 14th. </joey>
<connor> It's a month after. </connor>
<connor> So what it is is... </connor>
<joey> - It's after? Oh, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so Valentine's day traditionally, </joey>
<connor> in every other country, is guys give chocolates </connor>
<connor> to the girls, girls give chocolates to the guys, right? </connor>
<connor> All that kind of shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the traditional way. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> But in Japan, Valentine's day is specifically </garnt>
<joey> a day where the girls give chocolates to the guys. </joey>
<connor> - Now this is right, because I remember this. </connor>
<joey> I was like six, you get like a month to analyze that gift. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like all right, how much am I going to spend? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and then white day. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Connor gets out his spreadsheet and he's just like, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - You have a month to optimize. </garnt>
<connor> - What's the worst thing about having you're both going </connor>
<connor> to buy a gift for each other at the exact same time. </connor>
<garnt> - This is why I hate Christmas. </garnt>
<connor> - No, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - This is why I fucking hate Christmas. </connor>
<connor> - Because, right, you have to like either mind read </connor>
<connor> each other like, how much is he going to spend? </connor>
<connor> Or you got to just straight it, be like max 20 quids. </connor>
<connor> You're saying max 20 quid? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that's great because... </connor>
<joey> - I hate having the conversation before Christmas. </joey>
<joey> She's like, yeah, we're setting a budget on this. </joey>
<connor> - What budget? </connor>
<garnt> - This is our budget. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that's great, I remember this. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause then I got a gift and I was like sick. </garnt>
<connor> So I can just either not give you a gift back </connor>
<connor> if I don't see you again in the moment. </connor>
<connor> Or I can plan it out, what I'm gonna give you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, usually it's the whole idea of like, </joey>
<connor> the guy has to give an equal amount </connor>
<connor> or because Japan is always like this... </connor>
<connor> - One up. </connor>
<joey> - The guys have to one up the girls. </joey>
<connor> - Or just say psych and don't date her anymore. </connor>
<joey> - True, but here's the thing right? </joey>
<joey> In Japanese Valentine's day. </joey>
<joey> I know it cause I made a whole video on this. </joey>
<joey> There's three different types of chocolates you can give. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So there's okay. </joey>
<joey> So there's honmei choco, which is the chocolate </joey>
<connor> that a girl gives to a guy who the girl like really likes, </connor>
<connor> it's like the one basically. </connor>
<connor> And then there's giri choco, which is a chocolate </connor>
<connor> that a girl gives to a guy that she has had some kind </connor>
<joey> of like, non platonic relationship with. </joey>
<connor> - Someone literally just saw the Apple pricing </connor>
<connor> for the phone. </connor>
<connor> Let's do that with chocolate. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<joey> So basically giri choco is like, say like, </joey>
<joey> if like, Meilyne, for example, right. </joey>
<joey> She's out producer. </joey>
<joey> Like we, aren't together. </joey>
<connor> So, she would give us giri choco, because we work together. </connor>
<connor> We're involved in her life in some way. </connor>
<connor> - Is there ever a point where you're like, stop? </connor>
<joey> I can't eat this chocolate, this is giri choco. </joey>
<joey> We need to go above this. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, I can't believe you thought about me like this. </connor>
<garnt> I thought we were closer than this. </garnt>
<joey> - Like yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then there's that right? </joey>
<joey> And traditionally that's where it ended. </joey>
<joey> But recently, there's a third type of chocolate called </joey>
<joey> tomo choco, which is where girls will give chocolates </joey>
<joey> to other girls who they're friends with. </joey>
<connor> - I hate this. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - So Japan is somehow just fucking. </joey>
<joey> - They've spreadsheet chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - They've spreadsheet advances. </joey>
<joey> - It's spread sheeting gifts. </joey>
<joey> Because I had a conversation last week </joey>
<joey> with someone who is like the manager of Teddy Lloyd, </joey>
<joey> one of Meilyne's friend. </joey>
<joey> And she was telling me about how she, </joey>
<joey> like every time she has a new clients or someone she has </joey>
<joey> to manage, she, Japanese culture is that they have to </joey>
<joey> give a gift. </joey>
<joey> So she goes to this department store to like, </joey>
<joey> get this gift for this new band or something. </joey>
<joey> And then the department clerk literally asks them, </joey>
<joey> Okay, how well do you know them? </joey>
<joey> What's your relationship with them? </joey>
<joey> And then she answers that. </joey>
<joey> And then the next question was, </joey>
<joey> so where are you giving it to them? </joey>
<joey> Are you giving it to the dressing room (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> or are you giving it in the office? </joey>
<joey> - Who cares. </joey>
<joey> Like she literally had to had a fucking spreadsheet, </joey>
<joey> apparently, she pulls out a catalog depending </joey>
<connor> on what answers she was given to give the perfect gift. </connor>
<connor> - This is extreme floaters, Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - And I mean, it's just like, dude, it's just some fucking, </connor>
<garnt> at the end of the day, it's just a bunch of sweets. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - You know what this is the equivalent of? </garnt>
<joey> This is equivalent to like doing those </joey>
<joey> personality questionnaires at the start of RPGs </joey>
<joey> to see like which partner you get. </joey>
<joey> But then after you fill it out, you have all the options </joey>
<joey> open to you anyway. </joey>
<joey> That's exactly what it is. </joey>
<joey> - It's the fucking Facebook quiz. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Which character are you? </joey>
<joey> - Which Valentine's day gift are you? </joey>
<joey> Japan has not only done this with Valentine's day. </joey>
<joey> They've done it for like Christmas, </joey>
<connor> they've done it for like Halloween. </connor>
<joey> They've done it for everything. </joey>
<joey> They've just completely somehow made everything </joey>
<joey> like a million times more complicated than it should be. </joey>
<joey> - It's as if life here isn't stressful enough. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </joey>
<connor> - With all the paperwork you gotta fill out for everything. </connor>
<connor> - And then you got shit like oseibo and ochugen, </connor>
<connor> which is like giving gifts at like certain times of the year </connor>
<joey> and shit to people. </joey>
<garnt> - This is why I'm glad that we don't work </garnt>
<joey> exactly in an office environment. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. </joey>
<joey> - Like we work with people who understand foreign culture </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<connor> So I don't have to... </connor>
<connor> Because if I'm working in a Japanese company </connor>
<connor> I'd be so fucking stressed out. </connor>
<connor> - I'm doing my work, not fucking up with gifts. </connor>
<joey> - Imagine going to a company party </joey>
<connor> - Oh, fuck. </connor>
<joey> - or going to like a company drinking session. </joey>
<joey> And you just don't know how to act. </joey>
<joey> Cause that's me, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like only in Japan will you go to the office </garnt>
<joey> and you're more stressed out about your like social status </joey>
<joey> than you are the actual work that you're involved in. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I'm stressed enough thinking am I giving them </garnt>
<joey> my business card the right way? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - There's rules to that as well. </joey>
<joey> - There's rules to that. </joey>
<joey> I just want to like swap business cards, but no, it's like, </joey>
<garnt> is it pointed the right way? </garnt>
<garnt> we have to give it at the same time. </garnt>
<connor> - I had the situation where I had to give </connor>
<garnt> my business cards recently and I had a mailing mix up. </garnt>
<connor> So I had like a 1,000 IQ move. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, no, no, no, my manager will do it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> I'm not. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I'm not giving my business card. </joey>
<joey> My manager will give you a business card. </joey>
<connor> - I do that some of the time. </connor>
<connor> Every time we're in the business meeting </connor>
<joey> I'm like Meilyne take it, swap contact. </joey>
<joey> Do the thing manager. </joey>
<joey> - It's the opposite for me because she knows </joey>
<joey> that I can speak Japanese. </joey>
<connor> So she waits for me to go first. </connor>
<garnt> - But in reality, I've just forgotten my business cards. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't carry them with me, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I don't want to carry them with me all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you have to have a separate business card holder. </garnt>
<joey> And I've not gotten to the point </joey>
<joey> where I have enough business meetings </joey>
<connor> where I could be networking at any point all the time. </connor>
<joey> And it just looks tacky. </joey>
<joey> If you just put out your business card </joey>
<joey> and it's in your beaten ass wallet </joey>
<joey> with 20 other million cards in it, </joey>
<garnt> that just doesn't look cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know one bullshit rule </garnt>
<connor> I found out the other day in Japan. </connor>
<connor> If I want to leave my apartment building </connor>
<connor> for more than two weeks, I need to get permission. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Is it more than two weeks for you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For us it's a month. </joey>
<joey> - More than two weeks. </joey>
<connor> I got to get like permission to leave my house. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that is. </joey>
<garnt> - You didn't know why that's the case though, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is that the case? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's because there's a lot of cases in Japan </garnt>
<connor> of people running away. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - They leave the house space, </connor>
<connor> they basically escape from their lives. </connor>
<joey> - Supposed to have a guarantor or something. </joey>
<joey> - Well, no, it's the guarantor who can't chase you up. </joey>
<connor> - Then the guarantor has to pay, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that the whole point? </connor>
<joey> - No, no, you, you, you send the money to the guarantor </joey>
<joey> and then the guarantor has to pay. </joey>
<joey> But if you're not sending any money to the guarantor </joey>
<joey> then the guarantor can't do anything. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I thought the whole point was the guarantor pays </connor>
<connor> if you can't pay. </connor>
<joey> - That's if the guarantor is nice enough. </joey>
<connor> - I guess I can understand if they're worried about that. </connor>
<connor> But then also, I don't know, </connor>
<joey> it's just weird living in the UK. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, It just seems like I'd never want </joey>
<joey> to have to ask if I can leave. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sure. </joey>
<garnt> - That's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to ask permission to do everything. </garnt>
<connor> - Two weeks? </connor>
<joey> That seems like a little, a month I can kind of understand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So yeah, so like every time Aki and I go to the US, </joey>
<connor> for example, like last year, </connor>
<joey> before the whole pandemic thing, when we were in America </joey>
<joey> for like three months at a time or something. </joey>
<joey> I have to call them up. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's super easy. </joey>
<connor> - I can imagine though. </connor>
<connor> They never say no. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - But it's just weird though that they might say like, </connor>
<connor> no, you can't go. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, for us it's easy, because I just say, </joey>
<connor> oh, it's for work. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, okay. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They don't question it. </joey>
<joey> But if it's like, I have to attend an animate convention, </joey>
<joey> then maybe they'll be like, hmm. </joey>
<connor> - If they were like grilling you I'd be like, </connor>
<joey> mind your own fucking business, I pay you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, oh my gosh. </joey>
<joey> I remember I saw a few comments that are like, </joey>
<joey> man kind of hates Japan. </joey>
<joey> Why is he even there. </joey>
<joey> He's so ungrateful man. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, nah, I want to... </joey>
<joey> - Privileged. </joey>
<joey> - I guess we do often point out the things </joey>
<joey> that we don't like about Japan a lot. </joey>
<joey> But that's because I think a lot of people </joey>
<joey> in my mind view Japan as this like utopian country. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And at the end of the day </joey>
<connor> it's like any other country that has issues. </connor>
<joey> - And also because, I think that we've experienced </joey>
<joey> living here as opposed to just listening here. </joey>
<joey> You can't get a scope of a country just from visiting it. </joey>
<garnt> - But, I mean, we have complaints about any country. </garnt>
<connor> - We're British, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> I'm going to complain about anything. </garnt>
<connor> I'll find a complaint about something I love. </connor>
<joey> - I love it, but fuck, I hate it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<garnt> When I lived in Thailand there were like so many things </garnt>
<joey> that I didn't like about living there. </joey>
<joey> But there's things I fucking loved as well. </joey>
<joey> So it's all like a give and take wherever you live. </joey>
<joey> It's funny, right? </joey>
<joey> Cause when I was a kid, I was like I want to live in A. </joey>
<joey> I want to live in X. </joey>
<joey> It'd be cool if I lived there. </joey>
<joey> But like the more you move around and the more I travel, </joey>
<joey> the less I know where I want to settle down. </joey>
<joey> Cause like the more I travel, the more I'm like, man, </joey>
<joey> I really love this one thing about that one place. </joey>
<joey> But man, I really hate that one thing about that one place, </joey>
<connor> so really wants me to like, I dunno, this COVID situation </connor>
<connor> has just made me feel trapped in this country. </connor>
<connor> - For sure, for sure. </connor>
<joey> - This has probably been like one of the longest </joey>
<joey> I've gone through in my entire life </joey>
<joey> without flying somewhere. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno like for me as well, like this is the longest </garnt>
<joey> I've been in Japan for like an extended period of time </joey>
<joey> without going anywhere. </joey>
<joey> And I've definitely, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I haven't noticed anything new about or new about </joey>
<joey> you know, like any of the good parts about living here </joey>
<joey> or any of the bad parts. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's made me appreciate the things that I really like </joey>
<joey> and fucking despise the things that I hate. </joey>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<joey> - It's like to another level. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I wake up every day and I walk past my router </joey>
<connor> and I just smile, I'm like damn. </connor>
<connor> Damn, I have a gigabyte download and upload. </connor>
<connor> That's just beautiful, I love to see it, dude. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why I heard you say Naruto. </joey>
<joey> - I sit by and I'm like, damn you're good. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, damn. </joey>
<joey> - You do your job good. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You can, fucking sucks the internet. </connor>
<garnt> - You're talking to the Australian here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, sure </garnt>
<connor> - Don't don't talk to me until you have experienced </connor>
<joey> a point four upload. </joey>
<connor> - No dude, cause in fucking Wales, man, you would get like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but you live in the middle of fucking nowhere. </connor>
<connor> - Right, so you would, they'd be like, oh yeah, </connor>
<connor> we only have copper wire by the way. </connor>
<connor> We're not going to put any other wire down. </connor>
<joey> Here's your 0.1 download that doesn't work half the time. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, cool. </joey>
<joey> And then they charge you like fucking $80 a month for it. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, okay, why? </connor>
<joey> It doesn't work. </joey>
<joey> - That's what it was like for us in Australia. </joey>
<joey> We had copper wires everywhere. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then did they say that like, </connor>
<joey> oh, someone will come on this day and then no one turns up. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - That happened so many times, or they turn up, </joey>
<connor> they'd be like yeah, we're gonna send somebody to fix it. </connor>
<connor> They turn up and they're like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I have no idea what's wrong with it. </connor>
<joey> - Like especially in Australia, the whole, </joey>
<joey> if I were to sum up the whole like just service business </joey>
<joey> side of things in one phrase would just be, </joey>
<joey> that was a fucking lie. </joey>
<joey> Because they never show. </joey>
<joey> Like the service men never show up on time. </joey>
<joey> Transport never fucking shows up on time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, oh my God, the Australia, the Sydney transport. </joey>
<joey> I don't know about other parts of Australia </joey>
<joey> but Sydney transport had to be one of the worst </joey>
<joey> I've ever experienced. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Really? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so I had to catch a bus every day to go </joey>
<joey> to uni, all right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And this bus turns up every 20 minutes. </joey>
<joey> That's what it says on the timetable at the stop. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, okay, cool. </joey>
<joey> This next one's coming in 10 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 10 minutes passes, no bus, like not a single bus. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, did I miss it </joey>
<joey> while I was looking down at my phone? </joey>
<joey> Where is it? </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - All right, whatever. </joey>
<joey> Another 10 minutes doesn't show up. </joey>
<joey> Like, okay. </joey>
<joey> But then five minutes before the next bus shows up, </joey>
<joey> the previous bus shows up. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - But, because the bus is full. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't stop. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm like, not only are you 15 minutes late </joey>
<joey> but this motherfucker didn't even stop for me. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Dude, you can have that in Wales as well. </connor>
<joey> This boy is lucky, he grew up in a city. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I did too technically. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, shit. </joey>
<garnt> - He grew up in Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> - I grew up in Sydney. </garnt>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Which is like the biggest city. </joey>
<garnt> - One of the biggest city of Australia </garnt>
<connor> - So like, my bus, that was the one that I used to get </connor>
<connor> if I want to go to England, like Chester. </connor>
<connor> I would have to get this bus. </connor>
<connor> And it was every 30 minutes. </connor>
<connor> Problem was, is that it was always give or take </connor>
<connor> 30 minutes late. </connor>
<connor> Like 30 minutes late or early. </connor>
<connor> So you basically had like to go there and wait. </connor>
<connor> And like, if it said like, half, three, </connor>
<connor> it would just turn up at four. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then you were like is this the next bus that's early? </connor>
<connor> Or is it this bus that's late? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's basically fucking madness. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, it was bad as well because not only was sometimes </joey>
<joey> the bus is late but sometimes the bus would come </joey>
<garnt> five minutes early because I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> It just happened to run all the traffic lights. </joey>
<joey> - Like, it wasn't really a schedule. </joey>
<garnt> It was just like a rough estimate of time. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a recommended route, </garnt>
<joey> like we should probably get here... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, recommended time of arrival. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, just stick around though. </connor>
<connor> Fuck those kids. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, and it's the same with like package deliveries </connor>
<connor> in the UK. </connor>
<connor> I hated it, because they would say, </connor>
<connor> between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, wow. </connor>
<joey> So I just got to be at the house the whole fucking day? </joey>
<joey> - 12 hours. </joey>
<joey> - Because you've just said Tuesday, </joey>
<joey> like that is eight to eight. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And they wouldn't even turn up on that day sometimes. </connor>
<connor> So it's like what is he, what is... </connor>
<joey> - Meanwhile, here in Japan we just got a couch </joey>
<joey> for the office just this morning. </joey>
<joey> And we set it for 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Two hour window, perfect. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - The couch arrives at 1201. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And they phoned you as well. </joey>
<joey> - They phone you to make sure that you're in </joey>
<garnt> and they can come and everything and it's beautiful. </garnt>
<connor> - And if you miss it, you can also just reschedule. </connor>
<connor> Say, if you miss it like 8:00 AM, </connor>
<joey> you can reschedule it the same day </joey>
<joey> for it to come at like 4:00 PM. </joey>
<joey> Which is like insane, because in the UK, if you miss it, </joey>
<connor> it's like, right, well, next month we have a schedule. </connor>
<connor> We have a slot three, and it's like, what? </connor>
<connor> It was horrible pre-ordering games. </connor>
<connor> And the games turn up like four days late </connor>
<connor> and then you might miss it </connor>
<connor> and they just wouldn't post it through the letter box. </connor>
<connor> So you got to call them up or go online </connor>
<connor> and then they'd be like, oh we have a free slot </connor>
<connor> in five days. </connor>
<connor> It's like, five days, I bought this game, </connor>
<joey> what do you mean five days. </joey>
<joey> - See, because back when I was living in Australia </joey>
<joey> I know I've got a lot of comments about this </joey>
<joey> but we have Amazon now in Australia. </joey>
<joey> But back when I was living in Australia, </joey>
<joey> - Congratulations. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know, we finally got it. </joey>
<joey> Because people are like, Joey, what are you talking about? </joey>
<joey> we do have Amazon. </joey>
<joey> Back when I was living in Australia, we didn't have Amazon. </joey>
<garnt> Back in my days, we didn't have Amazon. </garnt>
<joey> - Joey is an Australian boomerang. </joey>
<joey> - I'm an Australian boomerang. </joey>
<joey> - Back in my day. </joey>
<joey> - Back in my day, we didn't have Amazon yet. </joey>
<joey> Like Amazon's only like a recent thing that got introduced </joey>
<joey> to Australia, because we only had eBay. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, wow. </joey>
<joey> - Why would you use eBay for anything? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like I still have never experienced Amazon now </garnt>
<joey> or the comforts of like living in a place where </joey>
<joey> you can just get your package literally hours off. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's beautiful. </joey>
<garnt> - Order it. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, especially coming from me, who'd never </joey>
<joey> experienced Amazon until moving to Japan. </joey>
<joey> The first week of me experiencing Amazon I was like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like a God. </joey>
<joey> Like I can just get things delivered now, without having to </joey>
<joey> wait arduous amounts of time. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know how people move to Japan </garnt>
<joey> before Amazon existed as like a Gaijin, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know for like... </joey>
<joey> I guess my house just wouldn't be furnished </joey>
<connor> for like a month, I guess or even more and fuck knows </connor>
<connor> how I would just get like normal necessities </connor>
<garnt> that I just can't find in stores. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. It's like, oh, you know, I need a phone charger. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't just, you know, go on Amazon, get it delivered, </joey>
<connor> probably the same day. </connor>
<connor> Or I could trek 30 minutes by train to the closest </connor>
<connor> big camera to buy one measly cable. </connor>
<joey> Why would I do that? </joey>
<joey> - Tokyo doesn't have this, but London did. </joey>
<joey> London had Amazon now </joey>
<joey> and it was basically like two hour windows. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You could, if you ordered it, it would come in two hours. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was pretty good. </garnt>
<connor> - I was just saying... </connor>
<connor> - Like expedited shipping? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like sometimes we would be at a house party </connor>
<connor> and we'd run out of alcohol and like instead of going </connor>
<connor> to the Tesco we'd literally just order our alcohol </connor>
<garnt> off Amazon and it would just turn up like an hour later </garnt>
<connor> when we were like low on beers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is the future. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like a whole crate. </garnt>
<garnt> And then also, like I remember I ordered a crate of beer </garnt>
<connor> and like a Nintendo switch game and I was like sick. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I was like... </connor>
<joey> - They're like who ordered this? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like who ordered a fucking Mario Party Super? </joey>
<connor> So, Super Mario Party and I'm like, that's me. </connor>
<garnt> - It was at the bottom of the box. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just really wanted to play Mario Party. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just fucking jealous of the guy </joey>
<connor> in the other room playing Mario. </connor>
<connor> I really wanted it, man. </connor>
<joey> - That's awesome though. </joey>
<joey> - I think on that incident, </joey>
<joey> it was quicker to get it delivered on Amazon now, </joey>
<joey> than it was to download it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<connor> - Because the download is a piece of shit. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, true, true. </joey>
<connor> - That's like first world problems in a nutshell. </connor>
<joey> Download too slow, just order it off Amazon. </joey>
<connor> It's slightly faster </connor>
<garnt> - Because when I used to make long videos, </garnt>
<joey> I had to leave my PC on all night and a bit on the next day. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't use it. </joey>
<joey> I distribute upload files for Evan to edit, </joey>
<joey> I would have to leave it on all night. </joey>
<joey> Hoping that when I woke up, they were all uploaded. </joey>
<joey> Otherwise I probably would be able to use my PC. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> So, yeah, that was a pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> Now I just upload it in one hour. </joey>
<joey> - Because that's the one with the copper wiring, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that like when you're using an upload, for example, </joey>
<connor> like really heavily, the download has to compensate </connor>
<connor> for the upload. </connor>
<connor> So yeah. </connor>
<connor> So like every time I would like upload a video </connor>
<connor> at like 1:00 AM, right? </connor>
<joey> I couldn't use the internet because I had legitimately </joey>
<joey> like fucking dial up speed. </joey>
<garnt> - I was about to say going back to dial up at this point. </garnt>
<joey> - It was legitimately dial up speed. </joey>
<joey> It took like two minutes to load up Twitter </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, I can't, I can't do this. </joey>
<connor> - I can't live like this. </connor>
<connor> - I can't do this man. </connor>
<joey> Why would you do this to me? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's crazy. </joey>
<joey> And they said like, the companies used to throttle </joey>
<connor> my internet all the fucking time. </connor>
<garnt> - God, were you a Virgin. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Fucking virgin man </joey>
<joey> - Virgin media fucking sucks. </joey>
<joey> - My God, what a version company? </joey>
<connor> - They would really have closed shop because, on paper </connor>
<connor> they give you the best internet speeds. </connor>
<connor> - 100 megabytes download. </connor>
<connor> Never fucking saw it once. </connor>
<connor> - You never see it. </connor>
<garnt> And at peak times, man, you are not getting anywhere close, </garnt>
<garnt> near to what they advertise to you. </garnt>
<joey> - The moment you upload or download anything as well </joey>
<joey> they immediately throttle you and had to call them up </joey>
<joey> so many times like, hey, turn that shit off. </joey>
<connor> I paid for this. </connor>
<joey> And they charge you so much. </joey>
<joey> - We're going back to the days of dial up </joey>
<connor> where you have to be like, mom, get off the phone, </connor>
<connor> I'm downloading a game. </connor>
<connor> - I had to that to my little brother </connor>
<connor> when I used to play league at home, I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> and my ping would go from like maybe 66, 150. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like get off the fucking phone. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember back in university, whenever you were living </garnt>
<garnt> in like a shared house, my God, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to game in a shared house is fucking impossible. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause yeah, your ping would either be like 10, </garnt>
<joey> when no one's awake or when it's dinner time, </joey>
<joey> it's like fucking 800. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, who's fucking downloading </joey>
<joey> another episode of 'Game of Thrones'. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's a fucking duck. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's torrenting. </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone puts their hands up. </garnt>
<joey> - It was fucking worse for me because </joey>
<connor> when I was doing YouTube, like way back in Australia, </connor>
<connor> all of my YouTuber friends were in America, right? </connor>
<connor> So every time I'd jumped onto like G-mode or something, </connor>
<joey> on a good day, my ping would be like 300. </joey>
<connor> I'd be like, guys... </connor>
<connor> - Why even play a 300 pings? </connor>
<joey> - Cause I was desperate for friends. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> I didn't have any YouTuber friends in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - There must be a Formula for like ping correlation </connor>
<joey> with how desperate you are to hang out with that person. </joey>
<joey> Because I play league of legends a lot with Titus and Emily </joey>
<joey> and it's like 200 ping. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, man, this sucks, but it's really fun. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I mean 300 pings G-mode was still fun. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, yeah, no one could kill me </joey>
<joey> because I just keep fucking teleporting. </joey>
<joey> - What is the value of friendship, right? </joey>
<joey> - Is it 300 pings. </joey>
<connor> - What is your ping limit for us? </connor>
<connor> - We should break down the value of friendship </connor>
<connor> by ping number. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like, would I pay 160 ping for you? </connor>
<joey> Yeah, I'll pay you for that. </joey>
<joey> - 800 ping, ultimate friend. </joey>
<joey> 100 ping, just an acquaintance. </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna talk to you, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so you used to upload daily </garnt>
<joey> on that garbage internet. </joey>
<joey> - I sure did. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - And that's why my computer exploded, remember? </joey>
<joey> - How did you not get like burned out, from that. </joey>
<joey> I think I would like hey,... </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I did get burned out, </connor>
<joey> after like two and a half years of doing that. </joey>
<joey> Because I quit Let's Plays a week before I moved to Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I remember when you quit that and I thought like, good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, everyone was like, good. </joey>
<joey> You should have done that. </joey>
<joey> And I think I did it at the perfect time </joey>
<joey> because that was just around the time, like early 2015. </joey>
<joey> That was around the time when gaming </joey>
<joey> was kind of starting to dip. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like just overall, that's when YouTube </joey>
<joey> kind of shafted all of gaming. </joey>
<joey> YouTube was like no more spotlight for you. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's around 2015. </connor>
<garnt> - Which like speaking about that, have you guys </garnt>
<joey> in your YouTube careers, ever properly experienced burnout? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When was the last time you guys experienced burnout? </joey>
<joey> - Last time I experienced like proper burnout was maybe, </joey>
<joey> this was back before I was leaving with Aki. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I was just living on my own. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, I just had like a moment, </joey>
<joey> like maybe for like half a year where I was just constantly, </joey>
<joey> like all I was thinking about was like, all right. </joey>
<joey> What's the next video? </joey>
<connor> What's the next one? </connor>
<connor> I just keep one upping myself. </connor>
<connor> And like just coming up with ideas because even back then, </connor>
<joey> I think it was maybe uploading like once </joey>
<joey> every three days or something. </joey>
<joey> So not as intense as daily but it's still pretty intense. </joey>
<joey> Especially because now I wasn't doing Let's Plays anymore. </joey>
<joey> I was doing like straight up like, </joey>
<joey> I was writing a script every fucking day. </joey>
<joey> So that shit burnt me out like a hell of a lot. </joey>
<joey> And there was like a point where I was legitimately like, </joey>
<joey> should I just like stop? </joey>
<joey> Like, should I just stop YouTube for a while? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then I was like, nah, ain't worth it. </joey>
<connor> - I think a lot of people view us here a lot </connor>
<joey> about like, the mystical YouTube burnout, what it means, </joey>
<joey> like, can you like try to explain. </joey>
<joey> - At this point, I'm sure for a viewer hearing burnout </joey>
<joey> was just like, oh let's just get that </joey>
<joey> off the YouTuber checklist. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of just become a cliche now. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, oh, you reached burnout. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, see you in a couple of days, </garnt>
<joey> you'll be over it soon. </joey>
<joey> Like people think that YouTuber burnout is just like, </joey>
<joey> like I dunno </joey>
<joey> - Woe is me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, kind of a woe is me, </joey>
<joey> like a very privileged first-world problem. </joey>
<joey> But I think it's just another form of like creative burnout. </joey>
<joey> And if you've never experienced burnout in your life </joey>
<joey> or create a burnout, artists block is another word for it. </joey>
<joey> It's essentially where you want to do something </joey>
<joey> and you want to make something, but you either </joey>
<joey> have no motivation or no inspiration to do, </joey>
<joey> or both sometimes. </joey>
<connor> You're just like, man, I really want to get a video out. </connor>
<garnt> I know I need to get a video out. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to be creative. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't know what to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And I have no motivation for it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I think there's one person who reached burnout recently. </garnt>
<garnt> Then they made a statement about it </garnt>
<garnt> and like hit me hard because... </garnt>
<joey> So the author of "Tower of God" recently went on hiatus </joey>
<joey> for like an indefinite period of time. </joey>
<joey> So we don't know, he hasn't said, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to be away for this long. </joey>
<joey> He actually just wrote like a really really long post </joey>
<joey> just detailing that he's just had no breaks </joey>
<joey> for this entire like time during "Tower of gods". </joey>
<joey> And I remember there was one line that really hit me </joey>
<joey> which was, I think he said, I didn't know </joey>
<joey> whether I was working to upload or uploading to work. </joey>
<joey> No, no. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know whether I was living to upload </joey>
<joey> or upload to live. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, dude, I totally get that, man. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because there are times during burnout </joey>
<joey> where you're just like, man </joey>
<joey> - What am you doing? </joey>
<connor> - What am I doing? </connor>
<garnt> Am I even enjoying this anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> - So I mean, to explain to the viewers, </garnt>
<joey> how do you like get into burnout? </joey>
<joey> Like, how do you, like, what does it feel like? </joey>
<connor> Like, like how does it start? </connor>
<joey> - It happens in so many different ways. </joey>
<joey> I feel really depends on the person, but like, </joey>
<joey> a common thing that would happen is, for example, </joey>
<joey> like if you uploaded like four or five videos </joey>
<joey> that are like absolute bangers, right. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, boom, views, boom views, boom, views. </joey>
<joey> And then after that really good streak </joey>
<joey> you have another streak, but in the opposite direction </joey>
<joey> of like, oh, that one bombed, oh, </joey>
<joey> that one bombed even harder. </joey>
<joey> Oh, that one bombed even harder. </joey>
<joey> And you start to lose self motivation and like you start to, </joey>
<garnt> I dunno, it's really hard to explain, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> You don't realize creative burnout started </garnt>
<joey> until you're deep in creative burnout. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's really hard to see the early signs </garnt>
<garnt> of creative burnout. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes it's just, you just wake up and you just do a job. </garnt>
<connor> And then eventually like five months down the line </connor>
<connor> you're like, man, I've just been feeling the same. </connor>
<connor> Exactly the same this entire five months. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just not getting anything new out of this. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure, like most people who just work normal jobs </connor>
<joey> get it as well with their own job </joey>
<joey> where they just kind of feel light, </joey>
<joey> like, hmm, do I like this or? </joey>
<joey> Like, I know a lot of people don't like what they do </joey>
<joey> and they just do it to survive </joey>
<joey> because they don't have a choice. </joey>
<joey> I mean, we're very lucky that we do something that is, </joey>
<joey> most people would say it's pretty fun, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's very... </joey>
<joey> - And no doubt it is. </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely like, it's a very hard job </joey>
<connor> and I'm not in like any manual intensive kind of way, </connor>
<connor> but like, yeah, we're working so fucking hard. </connor>
<joey> It's a hard job, like mentally, but still definitely by far </joey>
<joey> like the best job I've ever had. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't think of a job </joey>
<garnt> that would give me this much freedom. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I wouldn't replace this for anything. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why we haven't quit. </connor>
<connor> But in terms of pure work hours. </connor>
<joey> I know for a fact, I put more hours working, </joey>
<joey> like actual working in this job unlike any previous job. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, easily. </joey>
<joey> - And it's because you can never switch off. </joey>
<joey> And I think this is the same war for anyone. </joey>
<joey> Who's like self-employed, where, especially in our position </joey>
<joey> where our jobs stemmed from our hobby. </joey>
<joey> So do you ever get that point when you're kind of watching </joey>
<joey> an anime and you can or reading a manga </joey>
<joey> and there's just that little voice in the back </joey>
<joey> of your head that says, you can make a video out of this. </joey>
<joey> You can make a video out of this, </joey>
<joey> instead of just like reading it for platitude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's why I've completely, </joey>
<joey> over the last two years or so. </joey>
<joey> I've had a complete anime burnout, just for that. </joey>
<joey> Like, I've stopped. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm sure my viewers can easily see that, </joey>
<joey> I have not been talking about recent animate whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> When people ask, hey, have you watched this? </joey>
<joey> Hey, have you watched this recent stuff? </joey>
<joey> I always say, nope, nope. </joey>
<joey> I'll get to it. </joey>
<joey> I'll get to it, because I have that thing of like, </joey>
<joey> I could just watch this for my own entertainment. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time, I feel like I'm wasting my time </joey>
<garnt> if I don't make a video on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> That's my biggest fear, is just wasting time. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno, like, whenever I feel like I'm wasting time, </joey>
<joey> I just can't lose myself in like any show or something. </joey>
<connor> And for anime, that's times 10, because I can never </connor>
<connor> just watch an anime just for purely watching </connor>
<connor> an anime anymore. </connor>
<connor> That's made watching anime and reading manga </connor>
<connor> 10 times harder. </connor>
<connor> Cause if I feel like I don't get anything out of this, </connor>
<connor> either like for entertainment wise or if I see something </connor>
<connor> I can't talk about or something like that, </connor>
<connor> then I just cant get myself to focus in there. </connor>
<connor> Like recently I just watched the good place, </connor>
<joey> which is like a live action show on Netflix. </joey>
<joey> - You watch live action? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - I did something I hadn't done in a long time. </joey>
<connor> And I watched all four seasons, in like a few days. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, what the fuck did I just do? </connor>
<connor> How did I? </connor>
<connor> I didn't know I had this in me. </connor>
<joey> Remember when I watched one piece in like two weeks. </joey>
<joey> - I can watch. </joey>
<garnt> - I can still binge stuff. </garnt>
<connor> My God </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, cause I think the hardest part is like, </connor>
<joey> when I used to work at McDonald's and I used to go home </joey>
<joey> and I got to watch anime or play video games. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was just like totally different. </joey>
<joey> I didn't have to worry about McDonald's. </joey>
<connor> - You didn't have to second guess, right? </connor>
<connor> Like you could just be like, immediately like, </connor>
<joey> I'm watching anime. </joey>
<connor> - And I think the hard part about burnout is that, </connor>
<joey> instead of like the job being difficult itself </joey>
<joey> is that it creeps into every aspect of your life. </joey>
<joey> Because YouTube is more often than not </joey>
<joey> themselves is the product. </joey>
<joey> Like, we're like the brand, if you will. </joey>
<joey> You know, like even just, if I go out for a meal, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, hmm, am I wasting potential </joey>
<joey> by not posting about this and what I'm doing? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like, everything in your life is like infected </joey>
<connor> with this thought of like, should I try and monetize this? </connor>
<garnt> - It's the point where everything in your life </garnt>
<joey> becomes a commodity, even experiences. </joey>
<joey> Like even experiences can become a commodity </joey>
<joey> or like in our cases it could become like a nice fun story </joey>
<joey> on Trash Taste and that kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> Where everything, you start thinking about everything </joey>
<joey> in your life in terms of your job and how it can affect </joey>
<joey> your YouTube, or how you can use that to benefit. </joey>
<joey> And it gets to a point sometimes </joey>
<garnt> where it just becomes subconscious. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is why I never understood the mentality </joey>
<garnt> of people who do like daily vlogs of their lives. </garnt>
<garnt> - My God. </garnt>
<connor> - How do you do that? </connor>
<connor> - I think you have to be a psychopath. </connor>
<connor> - I think you do, you have to be psychopathic </connor>
<joey> or sociopathic or a combination. </joey>
<garnt> - You definitely lose something. </garnt>
<joey> Like my relationship with anime and manga </joey>
<joey> has forever been changed. </joey>
<joey> Like I still love anime and manga, but my relationship </joey>
<joey> with it has been forever changed </joey>
<joey> because that to me is content, that to me is my job. </joey>
<joey> - It's work material. </joey>
<garnt> - Imagine if your entire life was content. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> - My God. </garnt>
<connor> - This is why like, all the like, cut, </connor>
<garnt> like vlogging couples always going to breaking up, right? </garnt>
<joey> Because of course you have to break up </joey>
<joey> because your whole relationship is the YouTube channel. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Your whole relationship is determined by the algorithm. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and it's basically, how long you stay together </connor>
<joey> is how long is the money worth it. </joey>
<joey> After you get so rich it's like, </joey>
<joey> at what point do you need this extra money? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Let's be honest. </joey>
<connor> Like if you already have like two houses. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, that's fucking crazy, like, I've seen, </joey>
<joey> say like there are some family vloggers, for example, </joey>
<joey> that have been going on for like, five, 10 years. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, how are you guys like, okay, mentally? </joey>
<joey> Cause that would drive me fucking insane. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because like, I get insane just from going to a bookstore </joey>
<joey> and being like, all right, I've got to find my next video. </joey>
<joey> Let alone, you do that every moment of your life, </joey>
<joey> you'd be like, all right, </joey>
<joey> what's something I can like pick up and show on camera. </joey>
<joey> To like show them that we're living a normal life. </joey>
<connor> - Also as well, whenever I've hung out with like YouTubers </connor>
<joey> it's normally always like the newer ones or the smaller ones </joey>
<joey> who always want to like take a picture and post everything. </joey>
<joey> Because I think that they haven't like experienced it yet. </joey>
<joey> cause if you were hanging out with big YouTubers </joey>
<joey> they're ever like, oh, let's post this on social media. </joey>
<joey> Let's take a picture of the post. </joey>
<joey> It's always like, oh, we're not, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's just like this kind of vibe that you get around </joey>
<connor> some people where you're like, all right, cool. </connor>
<connor> This is just going to be a private thing. </connor>
<joey> Nothing's going to be like,... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Weirdly, it's like, you usually have to, </joey>
<joey> if you're interacting with a bigger YouTuber </joey>
<joey> you usually have to be the one to be like, hey, </joey>
<connor> is it okay if I upload this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> I would ask, I mean, if I'm within a bigger YouTuber, </connor>
<joey> and for some reason wanted to post what I was doing </joey>
<joey> at that moment in time, I would ask them, but I never do. </joey>
<joey> I always like it, like a side when I'm like </joey>
<joey> someone pulls out a camera are they're gonna post it. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, all right. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're gonna do that thing, here we go. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanted to eat dinner, but fine. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's turn them into something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, cause to me it's like, </garnt>
<joey> the only hundred percent escape I get. </joey>
<joey> It's just like a nice fucking meal. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> I fucking love food. </joey>
<connor> - You just like food man. </connor>
<joey> - I fucking love food. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, who doesn't? </joey>
<joey> - To me, like food is, talking about, </joey>
<joey> very tasty, very delicious. </joey>
<joey> And I can eat a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I'd like to think so, yes. </joey>
<joey> - Right, but for me, my favorite part about food </joey>
<joey> is like the social aspect of food </joey>
<joey> and like eating with someone </joey>
<connor> and like having it like be a conversation </connor>
<connor> and the food is like a compliment to that </connor>
<connor> because it's a shared experience, that you can discuss. </connor>
<connor> And if you don't know, someone's like, oh, okay, </connor>
<connor> well maybe you can talk about the food </connor>
<connor> and then it opens you up a little bit. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I just really like that aspect of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't like that being like ruined like people </garnt>
<garnt> trying to like monetize it </garnt>
<garnt> - Right in front of your salad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, I'm just trying to enjoy my immaculate meal, </garnt>
<joey> my A5 beef. </joey>
<joey> - My my immaculate salad. </joey>
<joey> - And sometimes I'll post a picture. </joey>
<joey> Oh no, sorry, I'll take a picture. </joey>
<joey> 99% of the time I don't post. </joey>
<joey> It's just for me. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I want to remember this. </joey>
<joey> - That's something I've noticed recently. </joey>
<joey> I'd say, especially in the last like two or three years </joey>
<joey> or so, where I've, for some reason </joey>
<joey> the more I do social media and the more I used to post, </joey>
<joey> now I post way less. </joey>
<joey> I experience more, if that makes sense. </joey>
<garnt> - This is like a lot of people ask, </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt, why don't you post on Instagram? </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt, post more on Instagram </garnt>
<connor> - I fucking don't post anything on Instagram too. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember I've tried so many times </garnt>
<garnt> to get more my Instagram. </garnt>
<connor> And that's just because I fucking hate having an experience. </connor>
<connor> This is the thing I hate the most </connor>
<connor> having some kind of experience </connor>
<connor> whether it's a nice meal or you're going somewhere new. </connor>
<joey> I feel pressured to document it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I got to take a nice photo of this for Instagram. </joey>
<joey> - Like for one, I fucking suck at taking photos. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So half the time I'm like trying to figure out, </joey>
<joey> how do I make what I see look good? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like, how do I do that? </joey>
<joey> This is why I don't work with like live action stuff. </joey>
<joey> But I also, I just hate that experience </joey>
<joey> of just having to feel like I need to document this. </joey>
<joey> I need to make sure the world knows what I'm doing. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like ever since I just completely given up </joey>
<joey> on my Instagram. </joey>
<joey> Yes, I've just given up at this point. </joey>
<joey> - Everybody unfollow now. </joey>
<joey> - You can unfollow me, I probably won't notice. </joey>
<joey> But like, as soon as I just gave up on it, </joey>
<joey> then it just felt like a weight was off my shoulder. </joey>
<joey> - Right </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like Twitter for me is just way more casual. </joey>
<joey> - I love Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - I love Twitter, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Twitter, I don't have to try. </joey>
<garnt> It's just, I say any stupid story that comes to my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, I tweeted penis and it got 25,000 likes. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, you guys will like fucking anything. </joey>
<joey> But like with Instagram, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm kind of the same. </joey>
<connor> Like, I'm pretty I'm not gonna say I'm active on Instagram, </connor>
<connor> - You're like the most active of us. </connor>
<connor> - I'm probably the most active but the thing is, </connor>
<connor> is that like, I'd say the past 10 to 15 photos </connor>
<connor> I put up on Instagram, I didn't take. </connor>
<connor> It was either Aki took it, or somebody else, </connor>
<connor> like Luke took a lot of recent ones. </connor>
<joey> Cause he's a camera guy. </joey>
<joey> - I just never think when I'm at a place I'm like, </joey>
<connor> I should take a picture, like I do occasionally, </connor>
<joey> there's pictures of my Instagram at places. </joey>
<joey> But most of the time I never think I should take a picture. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I'm just gonna enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, and that shouldn't be like a thing of like, </joey>
<connor> wow, look how amazing I am. </connor>
<connor> I just... </connor>
<joey> - You have nothing to prove, right? </joey>
<connor> It's like, I don't have to take a nice photo of this trip </connor>
<joey> I went to. </joey>
<joey> To prove to you that, oh, I went on this nice trip. </joey>
<joey> Like that should just be something that you should cherish, </joey>
<connor> not to say, don't post your experiences on Instagram. </connor>
<joey> Like if, if you're okay with that, go for it, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's not a necessity, </joey>
<joey> especially if you're a content creator or YouTuber. </joey>
<garnt> - I think what we're saying, more like, </garnt>
<garnt> Dolby is about other content creators or other YouTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> Because as a content creator you do commodify your life </garnt>
<garnt> and you need to find as I learned that I needed to find </garnt>
<garnt> some parts of my life that just weren't touched by YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, really have to like actively make sure </connor>
<connor> you're thinking about it. </connor>
<connor> - I also think that when you're starting out </connor>
<joey> it's a lot easier to fall into the traps of self-employed. </joey>
<joey> Cause a lot of the time YouTubers are young. </joey>
<joey> And, you know, I started when I was 19. </joey>
<joey> And I have no chill. </joey>
<joey> - You were 19 when you started? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 19 when I started. </connor>
<joey> - How old were you when you started Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - 17. </joey>
<joey> - 17, I was 18 when I started. </joey>
<connor> - I find when you get that first initial growth </connor>
<joey> your thought is to pour everything into it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I definitely did do that </joey>
<joey> and I definitely got burned out very quickly. </joey>
<joey> Cause I was doing university as well at the time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, same. </joey>
<joey> - So it was like, I was putting in </joey>
<joey> a full 40 hour work week on my YouTube. </joey>
<connor> And then I was putting probably not a full 40 hour work week </connor>
<connor> into my university studies. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, it was definitely like YouTube, university. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then my social life was just, </connor>
<joey> - In sham </joey>
<joey> - you know, tumbleweed. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, and the sad thing is that for every one of us </joey>
<joey> that you hear the success story. </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of survivor bias with that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> Because for every three, YouTubers like, that did it, </joey>
<joey> during a job or university, we made it through, </joey>
<joey> but it was probably like a hundred people </joey>
<joey> who sweat their ass off full throughout university </joey>
<joey> to get into work and failed miserably, </joey>
<joey> didn't have anything to show for it. </joey>
<joey> Like I took a gamble and it worked off </joey>
<connor> but it was a dumb gamble in reality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But I was passionate about it. </joey>
<joey> - But I mean the more dumb gamble for you would have been </joey>
<joey> if you saw that little bit of success and you're like, </joey>
<connor> I'm going to quit university. </connor>
<connor> - Which is something that you should never do. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, please do that. </connor>
<connor> Cause I was going to do a master's, but I ended up </connor>
<connor> getting a bachelor's because I just hated engineering </connor>
<connor> by the end of it, I got a two, one at the end. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, I'll take it, its good enough. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Do you have that in US? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - Like the rating system. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I'm not from the U S. </joey>
<garnt> - Is there like different levels of degree? </garnt>
<joey> - Like, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Like bachelor's, master's. </garnt>
<connor> - Not the bachelor's like the pass rate like the floors. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - First, two, one, two, two. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I only.. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like first, second or third degree. </garnt>
<garnt> - I probably got the lowest one. </garnt>
<garnt> I legitimately just slid past. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, give me the paper, I'm fucking out. </joey>
<garnt> - Gotta go to fucking first baby. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God, dude. </connor>
<connor> - You shouldn't, you would, </connor>
<connor> I wish Garnt was in my dissertation presentation. </connor>
<joey> You wouldn't have fucking cackled this way. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> So I'll go on a tangent real quick. </joey>
<joey> So my dissertation was fucking awful. </joey>
<garnt> A dissertation, by the way, is your final paper. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like 30 pages long. </garnt>
<garnt> And in my one in engineering, we have to like </garnt>
<garnt> actually either prove something like that's been proved </garnt>
<joey> before or like make a device or something. </joey>
<joey> So I decided I'm gonna make, so we were given a topic </joey>
<joey> and my topic, </joey>
<joey> - You told me this. </joey>
<joey> - my topic was a wave energy device. </joey>
<joey> I loved renewable energies and I loved doing that. </joey>
<joey> And luckily we had like one of the best guys in the UK, </joey>
<joey> it was the guy who was my tutor. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I was like, yeah dude, I can make a wave energy device. </joey>
<connor> Wave energy devices have never been proven </connor>
<connor> to like work very well. </connor>
<connor> In concept they work but they don't work in large scales. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Normally it's below the waves. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like the flow of the bumblebees. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, but I can do it. </connor>
<connor> I can make a device that will work. </connor>
<connor> I had like no experience in work-shopping </connor>
<joey> or like making things. </joey>
<joey> So I didn't know why I thought this would go well. </joey>
<joey> So I did this whole paper. </joey>
<joey> I wrote this, everything about it, about this concept </joey>
<joey> then I had to build the concept. </joey>
<joey> And it was the biggest piece of shit </joey>
<joey> I ever built in my life. </joey>
<connor> So I dead ass, made this like pathetic little wooden thing </connor>
<connor> with some copper coils strapped to it </connor>
<connor> then like a bobbing thing, I got like a toilet float. </connor>
<connor> I turned up to this thing, like a kid, </connor>
<connor> like a six year old kid. </connor>
<connor> - At the science fair, right? </connor>
<joey> - At the science fair, it was literally science </joey>
<joey> fair quality, but even worse than that, </joey>
<joey> and I turn up and I'm like, so I go through 10 minutes </joey>
<joey> of all this very detailed, scientific, like calculations, </joey>
<joey> the proofing and then I pull out this piece of shit, </joey>
<joey> cardboard thing, like wooden plywood. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, so you just pull this up and down </joey>
<joey> with the waves and it'll make electricity. </joey>
<joey> And then I had an LED attached, one singular LED </joey>
<joey> and he's like, that's not powering it. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, you have to go really fast. </connor>
<connor> So I start doing like this like fucking this, </connor>
<connor> like jacking it off basically. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, so do you know any waves that go that fast? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, no, there are no waves that go that fast. </connor>
<garnt> - I love that's like the most university professor </garnt>
<joey> kind of question. </joey>
<joey> It's like they will ask you questions </joey>
<connor> where they know the answer. </connor>
<connor> They just want to see you like, </connor>
<connor> bullshit your way through this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there's two people, my tutor. </connor>
<connor> And he was giggling the whole time when I pulled it out. </connor>
<connor> And the auditor kind of person who does the scene before </connor>
<connor> and I had to dead ass and look her in the eye and be like, </connor>
<joey> this is very scientific, very accurate. </joey>
<joey> It will work, I promise. </joey>
<joey> This is so embarrassing, and everyone before me </joey>
<joey> was in a full suit and I just turned up in a T-shirt. </joey>
<joey> I did know that we had to dress nice. </joey>
<connor> And so it was just fucking painful. </connor>
<connor> And then he kept asking me questions like, </connor>
<connor> can you hook it up to a battery? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I don't have any dry cells lying around. </connor>
<joey> Maybe you do. </joey>
<joey> I don't really know. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - You got any lithium material cell? </garnt>
<garnt> - What did you do? you just made a device </garnt>
<connor> to light an LED that didn't even do that. </connor>
<connor> - And so I basically made a very basic </connor>
<garnt> electromagnetic thing. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what it sounded like. </connor>
<garnt> - Just like you put the magnet in a coil </garnt>
<garnt> and then it makes electricity. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so the idea was that it bobs up with the wave. </connor>
<garnt> - Flemmings left hand rule. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like some shit people were doing in like the 1600s </garnt>
<joey> for science experiments. </joey>
<connor> - The problem is is that </connor>
<joey> there's too many variables in waves. </joey>
<joey> Like yeah, you would need like hundreds </joey>
<joey> of the little wave devices. </joey>
<joey> But how the fuck are you going to have that </joey>
<joey> on top of the waves? </joey>
<joey> The shit's going to break all the time. </joey>
<joey> Basically, it doesn't work. </joey>
<connor> I fucked up and I embarrassed myself. </connor>
<joey> - I just remembered a similar thing for... </joey>
<joey> It wasn't for like, cause we didn't really have </joey>
<joey> like a dissertation for us. </joey>
<joey> We had like three big projects that we had to do. </joey>
<joey> And then those three projects would go on display </joey>
<joey> at like the graduation party for our curriculum. </joey>
<joey> And one of them for the course that I was doing was... </joey>
<joey> I did like a computer robotics course. </joey>
<joey> And have you ever seen like those robots? </joey>
<garnt> They have them a lot in America, but they're those </garnt>
<garnt> like robot arms that are basically like robot bartenders. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's an Australian invention, but basically </garnt>
<joey> it's just this giant white arm that's programmable </joey>
<joey> and it pulls drinks basically. </joey>
<joey> It's just an automated cartoon robot. </joey>
<joey> So we had one of those because I think our university </joey>
<joey> was the first to develop it or something </joey>
<joey> and we had one laying around. </joey>
<joey> So we had to make a program that used the bartender robot </joey>
<joey> and then they would show that off at the graduation party </joey>
<joey> to actually serve drinks at the graduation party. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, okay, that sounds dope. </joey>
<joey> The problem was is that it was a group project. </joey>
<joey> Never goes well. </joey>
<joey> And second of all, </joey>
<joey> I was the only one who knew how to program. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> And third of all, I sucked at programming. </joey>
<joey> So we made this like whole thing. </joey>
<joey> We planned out this giant thing being like, all right, </joey>
<joey> let's do it where when you press this button, you can choose </joey>
<joey> like the amount of shots that can go into the glass. </joey>
<joey> You can choose the glass size, all this shit. </joey>
<joey> And we're like, all right, who's going to program it. </joey>
<joey> The other two looked at me and they're like, </joey>
<joey> we don't know how to program. </joey>
<joey> I was like, all right, I guess I'm programming it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's always that point where you're like </garnt>
<garnt> does anyone not know how to do this? </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, I'm going to take responsibility. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's like, all right, I guess I have to learn JavaScript </garnt>
<garnt> from scratch man, sick and C++. </garnt>
<joey> Okay, yeah, I can do this. </joey>
<joey> - Is that working? </joey>
<joey> - And so in the end we have to present it. </joey>
<joey> Kind of like at this stage we have to present </joey>
<joey> in front of the class, but the problem was </joey>
<joey> the only thing that worked. </joey>
<joey> There was one thing that worked. </joey>
<joey> We had like 10 different options that you could choose from. </joey>
<joey> None of them work, except for one. </joey>
<joey> And that was the one where you press a button </joey>
<joey> and it'll pour a beer. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> A single beer. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the most Australian thing I've heard all day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Australia has been saved. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not even like, and this is a button </garnt>
<garnt> you could only press once. </garnt>
<garnt> Once the robot poured one beer, that was it. </garnt>
<joey> The app was dead. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - We passed, somehow. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> But then the professor was like, so do you want to have this </joey>
<joey> on the graduation thing? </joey>
<joey> We're just like, no, no, please. </joey>
<joey> I'm not even going to show up to the graduation. </joey>
<joey> I'm too embarrassed </joey>
<joey> because I'm going to see all these other amazing projects </joey>
<joey> and just feel like absolute shit for it. </joey>
<joey> But if you want one beer, it's all yours. </joey>
<connor> - It'd better be the best beer of your life. </connor>
<joey> - It was like some VB shit. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God, fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - You guys have reminded me of like so many </garnt>
<joey> of my university projects and dissertations. </joey>
<joey> Like I remember my dissertation was like a lot. </joey>
<joey> Did your dissertation feel like a lifetime to complete? </joey>
<joey> Because mine did. </joey>
<joey> And I remember like weather station, had several stages. </joey>
<joey> I remember like, </joey>
<joey> - Depression, </joey>
<joey> - like one of the first stages I had to build </joey>
<joey> like a wireless antenna. </joey>
<joey> So we had to like, had to build a system </joey>
<joey> where I could transfer data wirelessly. </joey>
<joey> And my friend actually helped me build it. </joey>
<joey> And I remember we basically just recreated </joey>
<joey> probably the invention of porn. </joey>
<joey> Right? (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Okay, because what happens? </joey>
<joey> We were working on this for like an entire day </joey>
<joey> and we couldn't get it working. </joey>
<joey> We were like, why is this not transmitting? </joey>
<joey> Is this the receiver, maybe receiving the signals wrong. </joey>
<joey> We don't know, and then suddenly, </joey>
<joey> after so much work, we'd like, get it working. </joey>
<joey> We send like this message like, hello world </joey>
<joey> or some basic ass message. </joey>
<joey> And it was just like the fucking Eureka moment. </joey>
<joey> It was like such a bro moment. </joey>
<joey> That was like, yes, we got this message to send. </joey>
<garnt> We got data from one antenna to another wirelessly. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we just looked at each other. </garnt>
<garnt> We're like, what do we do now? </garnt>
<garnt> And he could just go, let's try sending ASCII porn. </garnt>
<joey> - So mute on the real porn, just ASCII porn. </joey>
<joey> - No, we couldn't send that much data at that time. </joey>
<joey> So we were just like, what can we send? </joey>
<joey> Let's send ASCII boobies. </joey>
<joey> So we Googled like a naked girl with like, </joey>
<joey> through an ASCII filter. </joey>
<joey> And then we try sending that and we're like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, it fucking works. </joey>
<joey> - And thus porn was invented? </joey>
<joey> - And we're in the room like, wait, </joey>
<joey> this is exactly how porn was started. </joey>
<connor> Just imagine some scientists having this Eureka moment, </connor>
<garnt> getting like, imagine like the telegram being invented. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the next thing they want to send </garnt>
<garnt> is fucking ASCII porn or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't remember that in history. </connor>
<joey> - I was like, we could go to the store </joey>
<joey> to buy the Playboy magazine </joey>
<joey> or you could just send it to me while I'm home. </joey>
<joey> - He was like, Ooh. </joey>
<connor> - Jacking off to ASCII boobies, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, but like I remember, </connor>
<garnt> I remember going all the way forward </garnt>
<garnt> to when I had to present it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, I'm still fucking pissed to this day. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I had my project, which I worked so fucking hard on. </garnt>
<connor> I actually knew, it was actually working. </connor>
<connor> It was like </connor>
<connor> - Why do you gotta do me like that? </connor>
<connor> - Wow, the call out. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - It was many sleepless nights, many red bulls </connor>
<connor> to get this fucking tracking system working </connor>
<connor> that I had been working on all year. </connor>
<connor> And so for some reason, you know, </connor>
<connor> like that dickhead professor just seems to wake up </connor>
<connor> and he just wants to be an asshole. </connor>
<connor> He just, for some reason that was the day he woke up </connor>
<connor> and he wants to be an asshole. </connor>
<connor> So he just starts grilling me on this presentation </connor>
<connor> on my presentation and asking me questions </connor>
<connor> that you shouldn't expect from my level basically. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I was doing a masters </connor>
<connor> but he was asking me like PhD level questions. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> And I was there for a good, like 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Why do you hate me? </connor>
<connor> - Because I swear the questioning </connor>
<connor> was meant to be like 10 minutes, max. </connor>
<joey> He's going to ask you 10 minutes worth of questions. </joey>
<joey> He goes on for 20 minutes. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like sweating. </joey>
<joey> It was like the worst job interview I've ever been in. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, when you're just spitting bullshit </joey>
<garnt> and you don't even know if it's correct anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> That was like the point I was getting at. </garnt>
<garnt> So, he finishes with me and I'm just like,(Garnt gasps) </garnt>
<garnt> what the? why did he do that to me? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like sweating. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't even get a good mark off my presentation </connor>
<connor> but what really kills me is that the person next to me </connor>
<connor> was the one girl in my class. </connor>
<connor> The one girl in an engineering class. </connor>
<connor> - He didn't grill her? </connor>
<garnt> - And okay, so I saw his face. </garnt>
<garnt> So like when he was like, grilling me, </garnt>
<garnt> he was like eyebrows frowned, like, yeah, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a shit about what you said. </garnt>
<garnt> Goes up to the next person. </garnt>
<garnt> Hi, what project do you have here? </garnt>
<joey> - My boy's horny on me. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And I know, I know for a fact that she didn't know </joey>
<joey> that that thing didn't fucking work. </joey>
<garnt> She didn't put any fucking work into it. </garnt>
<garnt> But she got a higher mark on the presentation than me </garnt>
<garnt> and my thing actually worked. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck you. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's like, well, now we know </garnt>
<joey> who is sucking the professor off after class. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know how we got this present. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know how we got this fucking time. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, back to the YouTube burnout. </joey>
<joey> I was telling the story and like, </joey>
<connor> I think the most burnout I ever got on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> like cause we can get into like now later on. </connor>
<joey> But I remember, when I first moved to London </joey>
<joey> for some reason, cause I was going to London </joey>
<joey> quite a lot to do voice work. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, fuck it. </joey>
<joey> I'll just move there </joey>
<connor> because why not? </connor>
<connor> There's nothing better to do. </connor>
<connor> And I moved there and I was making about 1200 a month total </connor>
<connor> before tax, which, not great. </connor>
<joey> - So you're making about $500. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, and my rent was like 600 pounds a month. </joey>
<joey> Council tax was like a hundred pounds a month. </joey>
<joey> And then there was bills included. </joey>
<joey> So well, after all bills and tax was gone, </joey>
<joey> I was left with like a hundred to 200 bucks </joey>
<joey> for like food and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh, oh, that's not good. </joey>
<joey> That's not good, and then... </joey>
<joey> - Do the math. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was doing the math on my spreadsheet </joey>
<joey> and it was like, you're fucked, you're absolutely fucked. </joey>
<joey> And so... </joey>
<joey> - That's put in a spreadsheet formula, </joey>
<joey> it comes out, you're fucked. </joey>
<garnt> - Conclusion, you're fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that first month I moved there, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> I really wanted to change my content up as well </joey>
<joey> because I was doing strictly like Black Butler based stuff </joey>
<joey> at the time. </joey>
<joey> And I was desperate to get out of that </joey>
<joey> because I really didn't want to keep doing that because I.. </joey>
<joey> - You were burned out at Black Butler. </joey>
<joey> - I'd fucking started hating it. </joey>
<joey> And the viewers were really obnoxious at times as well. </joey>
<joey> And so I really wanted to make this content work. </joey>
<joey> And as you guys know, when you... </joey>
<joey> Normally when you try new stuff on YouTube, </joey>
<joey> the first few times you do it, it isn't perceived well. </joey>
<connor> Normally people are a bit hesitant about it. </connor>
<connor> At least, it was quite drastic at the time, for me at least. </connor>
<connor> So I started doing new content and I was working my ass off </connor>
<connor> and none of it was getting views. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh, I'm gonna go broke. </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to be able to... </connor>
<joey> - I'm in danger. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like Chuckles, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yo, these next four videos, bangers, </connor>
<joey> hundred percent bangers. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This is my new content, new me. </joey>
<joey> This is where I'm going to turn it all around. </joey>
<connor> Then they all bombed so hard. </connor>
<connor> - Like how hard are we talking? </connor>
<joey> - I was averaging about, in 24 hours I was averaging </joey>
<joey> about 25 K views at that time up to 30 </joey>
<joey> which is not... </joey>
<joey> - How many subs did you have at the time? </joey>
<garnt> When I moved to London, it must've been about 200 K. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I was averaging anywhere between 25 K </garnt>
<joey> to 50 K views, a video a week, which is fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember these videos all came out </joey>
<joey> and they got like eight K. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - I checked the address and it was like $15. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I'm getting $15 a month </joey>
<joey> from these videos, I'm going to go fucking broke man. </joey>
<joey> And then fucking Amino come down and being like, </joey>
<connor> hey, you want $200 for a sponsored video. </connor>
<connor> I have like, no fucking choice, but to take it. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm actually gonna like be homeless </connor>
<connor> If I don't take it or I'm gonna have to ask my mom </connor>
<connor> for like, hey mom, can you spot me? </connor>
<connor> I don't want to do that. </connor>
<garnt> I don't ask my parents for money. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love how Amino's every man's first sponsor. </garnt>
<connor> - Because they fucking rip you off. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember they were my first sponsor. </garnt>
<joey> - They know how to slide in well. </joey>
<joey> - Cause their whole tactic is going after channels </joey>
<joey> that have like, are up and coming, </joey>
<joey> that don't know any better. </joey>
<connor> Because I know they gave people </connor>
<garnt> who gave them a million view videos 15 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yep. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - 15 bucks, because they don't know any better. </garnt>
<joey> It's crazy. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - And genius. </joey>
<joey> - It's just genius but slimy as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Completely slimy, 100 genius. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then luckily, you know, those videos later on </garnt>
<joey> started turning over all around maybe three </joey>
<joey> or four months later and it started </joey>
<joey> to really pick up the new stuff. </joey>
<joey> I started getting an audience, but man, </joey>
<joey> those three months where it wasn't picking up </joey>
<joey> were the scariest for three months of my life. </joey>
<joey> Cause I thought I was going to like, I mean, okay, </joey>
<joey> I've never tried super fucking hard at something </joey>
<garnt> in my life and failed. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought like, fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a winner. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause I'm, I'm psychotic </connor>
<joey> when I want to get something done. </joey>
<joey> Like I was working like,... </joey>
<joey> - I think stoic is the word you're looking for. </joey>
<joey> - Psychotic. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You are past stoic </connor>
<connor> - I was like a relationship vlogger bro. </connor>
<connor> I was on full psychopath mode bro. </connor>
<joey> I was working easily, like 12, 14 hours a day. </joey>
<joey> To get this shit working. </joey>
<joey> I didn't have any time for video games. </joey>
<joey> Cause I was like, I need to make this work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it wasn't working. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, what am I doing wrong? </joey>
<joey> And then it was probably cause I was probably too invested </joey>
<joey> in it probably didn't help. </joey>
<joey> Because I felt that every single video I was going </joey>
<joey> to make could make me homeless if I fucked it up. </joey>
<joey> So it was like, fuck, not am I overly invested in this </joey>
<joey> because I really want it to succeed. </joey>
<joey> I'm also going to go fucking homeless. </joey>
<connor> If I don't get this fucking working. </connor>
<joey> And it's like, you see it. </joey>
<joey> I see it with streamers as well. </joey>
<connor> When they're like, I'm gonna stream 12 hours a day. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, that is... </connor>
<garnt> - Bro, I don't know how streamers do it man. </garnt>
<garnt> Streamers is a skillset that I could never understand </garnt>
<garnt> that I could never do no matter how much I try. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's your personality though, </connor>
<garnt> because I think if it was my job, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I'd have no problem streaming it eight hours a day. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would have massive problems. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think I'd have, I just want to do other shit. </garnt>
<connor> Like I could do it, but I'd prefer to do other shit. </connor>
<joey> - I very quickly noticed like, we talked about last week </joey>
<joey> about how I've been getting into VTuber streams and whatnot. </joey>
<joey> And I have a lot of like IRL stream of friends as well. </joey>
<joey> Like, some of them can go like eight to 12 hours a day. </joey>
<garnt> No problems at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I've noticed that like, with streaming, it really is </garnt>
<connor> like YouTube, where anybody can start it </connor>
<connor> but not anybody can do it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You really have to be built. </joey>
<connor> - It takes years of fucking up. </connor>
<garnt> - It does. </garnt>
<connor> - And also the right personality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because people come into YouTube </connor>
<connor> thinking they can succeed right away. </connor>
<garnt> And what they don't, like YouTube is not about making </garnt>
<connor> one bang of videos. </connor>
<garnt> The way I see YouTube is that if you make enough videos, </garnt>
<joey> eventually, eventually, you're going to get one </joey>
<joey> that's on the algorithm. </joey>
<joey> And I've seen so many channels that are just have like, </joey>
<joey> have like a thousand views on every video. </joey>
<joey> And then one view, one video gets like 200, 300 </joey>
<joey> sometimes a million views. </joey>
<joey> And you just can't recreate that. </joey>
<joey> And it's about being able to consistently grow your views. </joey>
<joey> It's not about getting that one bang of video. </joey>
<joey> It's about slowly, like some people rise up very quickly, </joey>
<joey> but you shouldn't ever think that you're gonna be one </joey>
<garnt> of those people, those are like the lucky ones. </garnt>
<garnt> But I believe that if you play your cards right </garnt>
<garnt> and if you know what you're doing in terms of marketing </garnt>
<garnt> on YouTube, there is a path that you can take </garnt>
<garnt> that is sustainable growth. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, YouTube to me, isn't about getting 15 minutes </joey>
<joey> of fame and then you've made it. </joey>
<joey> It's about getting 15 minutes of fame </joey>
<garnt> every day, consistently. </garnt>
<joey> - It's about making 10 videos that are good </joey>
<joey> and are growing consistently, and never stopping. </joey>
<joey> And that's why burnout exists, </joey>
<joey> it's because once you've finished one video </joey>
<garnt> you have like a day of rest and you realize </garnt>
<garnt> you got to do it all over again. </garnt>
<connor> - No matter how good the last one was, it doesn't matter </connor>
<joey> because that's not going to be like, </joey>
<connor> you're not a movie actor. </connor>
<joey> - That's not going to pay your bills for the next ten years. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, unfortunately. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, do you guys remember an exact point </garnt>
<joey> when you just kind of realized, like, you know </joey>
<joey> when you started YouTube, you're like, </joey>
<joey> I can do this forever. </joey>
<joey> Making videos, talking about anime, fucking easy. </joey>
<joey> This is like the dream job, I can do this forever. </joey>
<garnt> Do you ever have a point when you're just like, man, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the end game of this? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what am I doing? </garnt>
<connor> - You know, when I worked at McDonald's, </connor>
<garnt> I didn't think like, what's the end game to this. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, how many McFlurries do I got to make? </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, did you ever think, man, how much longer </garnt>
<garnt> can I keep just making McFlurries? </garnt>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - What is there off the shop manager? </garnt>
<joey> What's above that? </joey>
<connor> - Dude, the moment I started working at McDonald's. </connor>
<joey> I was like, I want to leave here so fucking bad </joey>
<joey> but I really want that new X-Box </joey>
<connor> but I really wanna fucking leave. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's the end game, right? </connor>
<connor> That's the goal that is an end game </connor>
<connor> - X-Box is the end game. </connor>
<connor> - I guess. </connor>
<connor> It's hard because I think what I want </connor>
<joey> out of YouTube changes constantly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think right now I'm in a place where I think </joey>
<joey> I'm the best way I've ever been on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> I think I've got my mental health at the best place </joey>
<joey> where it's ever been on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> I really do separate. </joey>
<joey> And I really do take care of myself, which is weird. </joey>
<joey> Cause I got a comment on a few recent videos that like, </joey>
<joey> is Connor doing okay? </joey>
<joey> - There's always those comments. </joey>
<joey> - Is Connor depressed? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's weird. </joey>
<connor> Cause like if I am more real in the videos, if anything, </connor>
<connor> I've stopped caring about if I look kind of annoyed </connor>
<joey> or depressed at any points. </joey>
<joey> Like maybe when I'm directing someone </joey>
<connor> or doing something like that. </connor>
<joey> - You don't have to bother with like the business smile. </joey>
<connor> - No, I just turn on the camera </connor>
<joey> and just literally just do me. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like it's being received better than ever. </joey>
<joey> And it's hard to do that, but also I think </joey>
<joey> because I've gotten such a good control over the separation </joey>
<connor> of job and like, what I'm doing? </connor>
<connor> Like, when I went away this weekend, Niigata, </connor>
<connor> I didn't think about YouTube for one moment </connor>
<connor> for like four days. </connor>
<connor> I upload a video at one point, but that's just one point </connor>
<joey> in the evening where I schedule it, and that's it. </joey>
<joey> Like, I just don't think about YouTube </joey>
<joey> when I'm not working now. </joey>
<connor> And how I managed to do that, because I remember </connor>
<connor> there was a time when, like I said in London, </connor>
<connor> I could not turn it off. </connor>
<connor> Like I could not stop thinking about YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Everything was YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Like, what am I gonna do next? </connor>
<joey> What's the new idea? </joey>
<joey> What's this new deal? </joey>
<joey> - Cause I remember you messaged me a couple of days ago </joey>
<joey> when you were still up in Niigata. </joey>
<joey> And we had like a really brief discussion about it </joey>
<connor> about how Connor was like, </connor>
<garnt> is it bad that I'm starting to care less about YouTube? </garnt>
<garnt> Not in the sense of like, I don't care about videos </garnt>
<joey> but it doesn't take over my life as much. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I will get back to your question later, </connor>
<connor> but I guess, cause it's weird. </connor>
<connor> Because my whole YouTube career, if you will, </connor>
<connor> I've always thought about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Always like I don't stop thinking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, is it bad that I have large periods </garnt>
<garnt> of time like, two, three days </garnt>
<garnt> where I can just not think about it? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that bad? </garnt>
<connor> Like, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Am I bad? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<connor> That's like yours, that's healthy. </connor>
<joey> That's what I'm trying to do. </joey>
<joey> I haven't been able to achieve that. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I think throughout my YouTube career. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I think that's my problem. </connor>
<connor> I think like... </connor>
<connor> - I wish I could tell you how I did it. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - This year, especially, I think I've been like close </connor>
<joey> to burnout around like fucking 10 times. </joey>
<joey> - You've been really bad this year. </joey>
<joey> - And I think it's just because this year. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck you Connor. </connor>
<connor> - You suck this year. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck you guys. </connor>
<connor> - I think I can definitely tell when around you </connor>
<connor> that you're like... </connor>
<connor> I can feel that you're stressed about it. </connor>
<garnt> - And I think just because normally </garnt>
<joey> I'm used to a change of environment or change of breath room </joey>
<joey> just because of like the global situation. </joey>
<connor> We've not been able to travel. </connor>
<connor> - Lockdown has definitely made it worse. </connor>
<connor> - Lockdown has just made it like 10 times worse. </connor>
<connor> And I know, like I've gotten a few comments recently, like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, Garnt's uploading videos less, what's going on there? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, there's nothing going on. </connor>
<connor> I'm just staring at a blank. </connor>
<joey> That's the problem. </joey>
<joey> The thing that really stresses me out is this notion </joey>
<joey> that if you don't upload like in the viewers mind, </joey>
<joey> if you don't upload </joey>
<joey> - You're dead. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone's thinking either he's dead or man, </joey>
<joey> he must be working on a banger video. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> He must be pooling all his time </joey>
<joey> to this fucking banger video. </joey>
<connor> And it's just, sometimes that just makes it more pressure. </connor>
<joey> Like, especially if there's a long break that, man, </joey>
<garnt> coming back with just another of the same upload </garnt>
<garnt> I've been doing before just makes it really difficult. </garnt>
<joey> - That's one thing that I guess is like the good thing </joey>
<joey> about having a schedule or like good thing </joey>
<joey> about having a timeframe of like, </joey>
<joey> okay, it's been however many days, I have to upload a video. </joey>
<joey> Because that expectation </joey>
<joey> gets completely thrown out the window. </joey>
<joey> And then when you do release that banger of a video, </joey>
<joey> it's a pleasant surprise, right? </joey>
<joey> You're like, oh, shit, my man was able to do this </joey>
<garnt> in the same timeframe as a regular video. </garnt>
<joey> All right, I see you. </joey>
<garnt> - I know it's an unhealthy mindset </garnt>
<joey> but sometimes even when I'm on holiday </joey>
<connor> or even when I'm like away, </connor>
<connor> I'm secretly thinking to myself like, </connor>
<connor> hmm, this could have been time that I've used, </connor>
<connor> was doing something on my channel. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like a big no in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I go on vacation. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how to switch off though, I really don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess. </garnt>
<connor> Having like a little bit of backlog of videos is like, </connor>
<garnt> you see what you don't have. </garnt>
<connor> - That's it, that's it. </connor>
<garnt> Because I have never in my YouTube career felt </garnt>
<garnt> like I've been on top of my work, because unlike you guys, </garnt>
<joey> I finish a video, I upload it. </joey>
<joey> And that grace period, that 20 to 48 hour grace period </joey>
<joey> after I upload a video, that's my holiday. </joey>
<joey> Because that's the only time I can mentally be like, </joey>
<garnt> okay, I deserve this break. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel uncomfortable if I'm not at least four </connor>
<connor> or five videos recorded ahead. </connor>
<connor> Like, they may not be edited and done. </connor>
<connor> But like, I don't feel comfortable </connor>
<connor> unless I have that buffer. </connor>
<joey> Because like, for example, when I moved back to my parents, </joey>
<joey> before moving to Japan, I just wasn't in the mood. </joey>
<joey> Because I hated the environment. </joey>
<joey> I love my parents, but I just didn't like being home. </joey>
<connor> And I just didn't want to make videos. </connor>
<connor> So I just didn't. </connor>
<joey> And then also when I moved to Japan, </joey>
<joey> I wanted to enjoy Japan for the first month. </joey>
<joey> So I didn't do videos for a month. </joey>
<connor> I didn't feel bad about that, because I had the backlog </connor>
<joey> and I completely used all of my backlog for that month. </joey>
<joey> And also I just don't have to worry </joey>
<joey> about taking a weekend off or taking off. </joey>
<joey> I haven't made a video or done any video stuff </joey>
<joey> in about a week and a half now. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why, I just can't think of ideas right now. </joey>
<joey> And I've also been really fucking busy. </joey>
<joey> I mean, we did the, oh, the video </joey>
<joey> that we can't talk about yet. </joey>
<joey> That's coming out soon. </joey>
<joey> - We did a special thing. </joey>
<joey> - We did a special video. </joey>
<joey> And then also we have the podcast in between there </joey>
<joey> and then I've been really busy and I was way behind </joey>
<joey> on a bunch of other stuff. </joey>
<joey> So it's just like having that backlog, even if, </joey>
<joey> okay, this is my advice to your Garnt. </joey>
<joey> Even if you have to do a month between each upload, </joey>
<joey> try and get like one or two videos backlog </joey>
<joey> that you can like drip out so that you can at least </joey>
<joey> then take those one or two days off and be like, </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to think about it, because I don't need to. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to take these days off. </joey>
<joey> I know I'm taking these days off. </joey>
<joey> So why would I ruin them by thinking about like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, shit, what are the Fiverr sellers up to? </joey>
<joey> What are they doing? </joey>
<connor> What pawn are they drawing? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I really, it's difficult. </connor>
<connor> I guess I fucked it up so many times that I've learned now. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like I'm on like the extreme of that </joey>
<joey> because, say for example, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> every AX which is in July, </joey>
<connor> - Fuck. </connor>
<connor> I usually go to America for like. </connor>
<connor> - Makes me sad remembering that. </connor>
<connor> I usually go to America from anywhere between one </connor>
<connor> to three months because I'm going around, </connor>
<connor> I'm visiting places, whatnot. </connor>
<connor> And so I have to make a backlog. </connor>
<joey> I mean, I could technically just make videos </joey>
<joey> while I'm at Aki's parents' place, </joey>
<joey> but that would be fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> And I don't want to use my time on holiday </joey>
<connor> because it takes technically the whole night </connor>
<connor> to fucking worry about work. </connor>
<connor> So, two months before that I just grind. </connor>
<joey> I grind like fucking crazy. </joey>
<joey> And I make like legit two to three months </joey>
<garnt> worth of videos ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how I do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like something I have never heard of. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, last year I made 12 videos ahead. </joey>
<garnt> - I wish, I wish I could be that ahead, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish, I like wake up and I dream of that moment. </garnt>
<joey> - And it was great because for those one to three months </joey>
<joey> that I was away, because we also went to like Europe </joey>
<joey> and stuff and like, I went to go see you. </joey>
<joey> And I went to go see everyone, all my friends in Europe </joey>
<joey> and all my friends in America. </joey>
<connor> The thought of YouTube was just completely gone. </connor>
<connor> I turned back into just regular Joey for two months. </connor>
<connor> And it was so liberating, but it's a double-edged sword. </connor>
<connor> Because when you're not thinking about your job </connor>
<joey> or doing YouTube for that long, and you come back to it, </joey>
<connor> it's like taking a gap year at uni. </connor>
<connor> - It is a little difficult to get back into it. </connor>
<connor> But you also might come into it more refreshed than ever. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, no, yeah. that's what I mean. </joey>
<joey> That's why it's a double-edged sword </joey>
<joey> because it can easily be either one of the two. </joey>
<joey> You can either come back and be like, </joey>
<joey> I have like 20 new ideas. </joey>
<joey> Or you can come back and be like fuck I don't wanna do this. </joey>
<connor> - I think the point that was the biggest turning point </connor>
<joey> for me was getting an editor. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yes. </joey>
<joey> - And I know that you always think that </joey>
<joey> like YouTube was always like, man </joey>
<joey> but I've just got this touch to it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, no, you're fucking wrong. </joey>
<joey> You are actually just wrong. </joey>
<joey> There was someone who could do it better </joey>
<connor> than you because that's their job, to just do that. </connor>
<joey> - They can do it better and faster </joey>
<connor> - Better, faster and guess what? </connor>
<joey> - You've free time now, you know what that's like, </joey>
<connor> you never had that before. </connor>
<connor> And I sucked at editing. </connor>
<joey> I fucking sucked, Garnt edits. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean Garnt told me to... </garnt>
<garnt> - I convinced Joey to get an editor. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because up until less than two years ago, </joey>
<joey> I was editing all my videos. </joey>
<connor> - I remember back in the early days of YouTube </connor>
<joey> people used to be iffy about, like viewers used </joey>
<joey> to get like pissed if you had an editor. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But not anymore, I'm glad that it's changed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's like sponsorships, right? </joey>
<joey> It's just grown to be like accepting. </joey>
<joey> - The way I see it is that I've gotten better editing. </joey>
<joey> And now I have more time to make better videos </joey>
<joey> and I can make more ambitious videos </joey>
<joey> because I'm not the one. </joey>
<joey> Cause the worst thing was, is that like, </joey>
<connor> I want to make this video ambitious </connor>
<connor> but don't add more work in post for myself. </connor>
<garnt> So it was always like, you would always limit yourself </garnt>
<connor> because you're like, I don't want to have to add work. </connor>
<connor> - This is my problem. </connor>
<connor> Because apparently I'm a fucking workaholic. </connor>
<joey> - You are a workaholic. </joey>
<joey> - It's just, I dunno, like I just want to feel ahead </joey>
<connor> of my work for once in my life. </connor>
<connor> And it's really hard because I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You're too hands-on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I am too hands-on but even like, </connor>
<connor> even if I have an editor. </connor>
<connor> I need to learn how to just see what the viewer sees. </connor>
<joey> Because every time I get an edit, </joey>
<joey> so every time I come up with a finished video </joey>
<joey> I can always be like, I can make this better. </joey>
<joey> I can improve this by an extra little bit. </joey>
<garnt> And I always end up doing it. </garnt>
<joey> - Guess that's the bad thing about being a perfectionist. </joey>
<joey> It's that like, you'll never satisfied. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, you could argue that. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, Maybe that extra touch you do put in is the reason </joey>
<joey> why you've done so well. </joey>
<garnt> You know, why everyone comes to watch your videos on anime </garnt>
<joey> Maybe it is, maybe it wouldn't matter at all. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> This is just like my... </connor>
<connor> - Why don't you test though? </connor>
<connor> Why don't you do a test? </connor>
<joey> - Test it out, just let Allan just take all of the editing. </joey>
<connor> - Cause they will fucking kill me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But this is the thing, you've got to let go, </connor>
<connor> you've got to let go. </connor>
<connor> - Here is the thing bro, </connor>
<joey> because it's not just about one video. </joey>
<joey> As we know, you can't get enough metrics </joey>
<joey> or enough analytics of one video. </joey>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> - Like you can make what you feel is like the worst </joey>
<garnt> fucking video of your channel </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason it does well. </garnt>
<connor> - What if you put it out there and it's, nothing happened. </connor>
<connor> Oh, shit, I can just let him do it. </connor>
<joey> - Because the exact opposite happened with me. </joey>
<joey> When you talked me into hiring Mudan to be my editor, </joey>
<joey> I was like, okay. </joey>
<joey> Mudan watches my videos, </joey>
<connor> so he should have a good grasp of it. </connor>
<connor> All right, I'll let him edit </connor>
<connor> like the first couple of videos. </connor>
<connor> Dude, the first couple of videos, </connor>
<connor> I feel so bad towards Mudan, </connor>
<joey> cause I made him redo that first video like five times. </joey>
<joey> Cause I was like, all right, add this little zoom in here. </joey>
<joey> No, I would have added this here. </joey>
<joey> I would have added this here </joey>
<joey> and I feel so bad now Mudan. </joey>
<connor> But nowadays I can just be like, all right, Mudan. </connor>
<connor> Here's the script, here's the raw files, go ham fam. </connor>
<joey> And he always just nails it. </joey>
<connor> - I think one of the biggest things </connor>
<connor> that an editor does as well. </connor>
<connor> At least for our kind of content is that, dude, </connor>
<joey> I do so much embarrassing shit, </joey>
<joey> that I would delete for sure. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That would never make it into the cut, </joey>
<joey> that they would put in. </joey>
<joey> And the first time I saw it, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I don't really like that. </joey>
<joey> I look kind of fucking stupid there. </joey>
<joey> And then after a while I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I guess that's kind of funny and adds a bit of charms. </joey>
<joey> So now if I ever work with anyone who edits my videos, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, please make me look as stupid as fuck. </joey>
<joey> Make me look so fucking dumb. </joey>
<joey> Please poke fun at me the whole time. </joey>
<joey> - The whole monkey brain. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, poke fun of me. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like, I mean that's, what's funny. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I find that funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's very British self-doubt. </garnt>
<joey> - Very much, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I also like now, </joey>
<joey> cause I work with multiple editors now. </joey>
<joey> So like I always just tell them now to just throw in as much </joey>
<joey> of your personality into your editing, as best as possible. </joey>
<joey> Because I feel that like the landscape of YouTube editors </joey>
<joey> has kind of changed in the sense that now YouTube editors </joey>
<joey> have almost become their own identity in the video </joey>
<joey> where like, perfect example is Game Grumps, for example. </joey>
<joey> Like Barry, the first editor was just as much </joey>
<joey> of an important aspect of Game Grumps as the hosts were. </joey>
<joey> And I feel that like with a lot of YouTubers the editor </joey>
<joey> is kind of just become another part </joey>
<joey> of that person's like personality. </joey>
<joey> I feel it just clearly makes for a different type of video </joey>
<joey> but also it makes it really unique at the same time. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess that's why I'm having such a hard time letting go </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like what I do is I put my personality </garnt>
<connor> into like I let Allen do the hard, like most of the work </connor>
<connor> and like the other 5% is just me. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm self inserting myself into my videos, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like it's because of that </connor>
<connor> that people would know me </connor>
<connor> or like why sit down in the first place? </connor>
<connor> It's because my videos are very personal </connor>
<garnt> and it's like my personality reflected. </garnt>
<garnt> Not only in like my script, but my editing as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And the way, like I edit jokes. </garnt>
<garnt> - You and Alan have known each other for so long. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like Alan would have a good grasp </garnt>
<garnt> of your type of personality. </garnt>
<joey> - He definitely does. </joey>
<garnt> There are some videos that take </garnt>
<joey> no effort at all for him to edit. </joey>
<joey> And there's some videos where he's just like </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the fuck. </joey>
<connor> I dunno, it's a difficult balance. </connor>
<connor> I'm still working on it. </connor>
<connor> It's funny that I'm like 13 years </connor>
<connor> into my YouTube career or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - Still haven't figured this shit out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I still haven't figured this shit out. </connor>
<connor> It's only because me and Connor </connor>
<connor> were talking about like our perfect vacation. </connor>
<joey> And like our perfect vacation, which we were like, </joey>
<joey> we were hoping to do sometime after COVID allowed us. </joey>
<joey> Was just like fly to Korea, spend an entire day </joey>
<joey> in like a gaming cafe. </joey>
<joey> - Multiple days. </joey>
<joey> - Or multiple days and just playing league of legends. </joey>
<joey> And if you would play league of legends, Joey, we'd be like, </joey>
<garnt> let's get Joey on board. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, but the only problem with that is I have </joey>
<joey> to play league of legends. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's good fun, it's good fun. </connor>
<connor> It's to me, like the perfect vacation is just shutting off. </connor>
<joey> And like I miss being able to waste all day playing games </joey>
<joey> and what better way to do it than in Korea in a gaming cafe </joey>
<joey> with like, where you can get food, all that kind </joey>
<garnt> of shit delivered to your table. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, it sounds amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I really want to, I love league and I... </connor>
<joey> - I'll join you guys, but I'll play Mario 64. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can come and just chill next to us </joey>
<joey> on one of the PC, play PUBG, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> What do you play on PC Joey? </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, I was just going to fuck you or something. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You be like, do you guys wanna go outside? </connor>
<joey> - I'm just imagining that, but we can also go out </joey>
<joey> and get fucking Korean barbecue, some amazing food. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, this is just the perfect holiday. </joey>
<garnt> Fuck traveling, fuck seeing things. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm the kind of guy when I go on vacation. </connor>
<connor> I just, because I work so fucking much. </connor>
<joey> The last thing I want to do is work on my vacation </joey>
<joey> in terms of like doing too much shit. </joey>
<joey> Like I just want to eat food, drink and relax </joey>
<connor> and like take it easy. </connor>
<connor> Like, I like beaches, but I mean, I normally just, </connor>
<connor> I like good hotels as well. </connor>
<joey> - I mean that's why like, whenever I go on a vacation </joey>
<joey> with Aki or I go on a vacation with like my friends, </joey>
<joey> I usually let them decide. </joey>
<joey> And I just kind of tag along and be like, </joey>
<joey> I'm down for anything now. </joey>
<joey> If we want to go sightseeing, cool. </joey>
<joey> If we want to just drink, cool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm very hands-off with my vacation. </joey>
<joey> If there's a schedule I'm like, no, no. </joey>
<connor> This is already a turnoff right now. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, should love food. </connor>
<joey> - Where are some places though that we've been thinking </joey>
<joey> to go once COVID is over? </joey>
<garnt> I mean, we mentioned Korea, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would like to go to Korea </garnt>
<joey> to just spend some few days. </joey>
<joey> - Is that like at the top of your bucket list right now? </joey>
<joey> - I mean right now cause it's just easiest to get to. </joey>
<joey> - It's like less than an hour by plane, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I remember going to Korea like two years ago. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been either. </joey>
<joey> - Actually like Seoul's just very much like Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> just less busy. </joey>
<connor> And I very much enjoyed the vibe </connor>
<connor> and also the e-sports scene was massive there. </connor>
<connor> I went there for the league of legends, grand finals. </connor>
<connor> - We both love watching the legends worlds. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's starting soon, but yeah, I flew all the way </connor>
<connor> to Korea just to see Fanatic get decimated </connor>
<connor> but the experience was fucking fantastic man. </connor>
<connor> Like the team, I was actually cheering for got destroyed, </connor>
<garnt> but just going there and seeing this massive stadium </garnt>
<garnt> like the noise that they made, like I've been </garnt>
<garnt> to a football match before, but I still think the energy </garnt>
<garnt> of this like stadium watching a fucking video game </garnt>
<garnt> was like 10 times more intense. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I mean like I've seen clips of sports commentators </joey>
<joey> versus e-sports commentators. </joey>
<joey> - Pentakill. </joey>
<joey> - Pentakill. </joey>
<joey> - Pentakill, Pentakill. </joey>
<connor> - I love that clip. </connor>
<joey> - I love that clip because I'm just like, wow, </joey>
<joey> this guy is excited about Pentakill. </joey>
<joey> - There's so many good clips like that. </joey>
<joey> The commentators get so hyped </joey>
<connor> It's great, I love it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I totally get it though, right? </joey>
<connor> - Dude, we get so fucking hyped when we watch it, dude. </connor>
<connor> We would like, stand up like, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we get worked up, </joey>
<joey> whenever we watched like insane speed runs </joey>
<joey> We're just like, what's happening. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the true spectator's full. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Did Super Monkey Ball speed runs, </joey>
<connor> the best thing to watch dude. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the cocaine of speed run </connor>
<connor> - Dude, if you get super drunk </connor>
<joey> and watch super monkey ball speed runs. </joey>
<joey> It's so fun. </joey>
<joey> - Which is what we did last Christmas. </joey>
<garnt> - We just got massively drunk </garnt>
<garnt> and watched Super Monkey Ball speed run. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was so fun because you're like, </garnt>
<connor> what is happening? </connor>
<connor> - How do you practice this? </connor>
<connor> - You're like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Then the next course starts and, what's he going to do? </connor>
<connor> Then he fucking flips the whole world </connor>
<connor> and gets it in across the map. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, what the fuck </connor>
<joey> It's so good. </joey>
<joey> - What is it about motion controls that makes it </joey>
<connor> so much more impressive. </connor>
<connor> - It's just crazy. </connor>
<connor> Man, going back to YouTube burnout. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, where were we on that point? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, is there anything else we want to talk about? </connor>
<connor> - I wonder, like where are you right now with it, </connor>
<connor> like, do you feel, would you say you're burnout? </connor>
<joey> - I was in like kind of a mini burnout. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I just have artist's block right now, </joey>
<joey> I cannot think of anything. </joey>
<connor> I don't dislike it, I love it more than ever, </connor>
<connor> I just can't think of anything now. </connor>
<garnt> - I think speaking, honestly, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like pretty close to burnout. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's been difficult because I was already </joey>
<joey> having trouble keeping up and a semblance of like a schedule </joey>
<joey> this year and then Trash Taste started. </joey>
<joey> And like, you think, cause we take one day off a week </joey>
<joey> to film this, right? </joey>
<joey> Which doesn't sound like a lot. </joey>
<joey> But for me as someone who already values every day </joey>
<connor> that I do work, it kind of like builds up. </connor>
<connor> So, that one day, a week turns into like quite a lot </connor>
<connor> when we're adding like extra secret projects on top of that. </connor>
<connor> - We have a lot coming in. </connor>
<connor> They gonna take weekends away. </connor>
<connor> - So I guess for me, especially after Trash Taste started, </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to figure out a good, a new work-life balance </connor>
<garnt> that kind of works with me doing everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And not working myself to death </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe I just might take a break sometime soon. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know yet, I haven't figured it out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> It's not about seeing if you can take a break </joey>
<joey> or seeing like what the balance is, </joey>
<joey> because everyone's balances I feel work really different. </joey>
<joey> Because like for me at least, my rule of thumb is </joey>
<joey> at least three days of the week </joey>
<joey> I try and not do any YouTube stuff. </joey>
<joey> So like four days and also weekends, </joey>
<joey> - weekends </joey>
<joey> - Weekends for me as well. </joey>
<joey> So it's like two days on the weekend. </joey>
<joey> And then one to two days during the week </joey>
<joey> is just a day where I don't do anything. </joey>
<joey> It's just no work, no YouTube work, nothing. </joey>
<joey> And then the rest of the four days, I go balls to the walls. </joey>
<joey> And like that's all I do. </joey>
<joey> Of course it depends on my schedule. </joey>
<joey> But I feel that like, because before, when I was </joey>
<joey> in like that really, really like deep, deep burnout. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't going out at all. </joey>
<joey> Like I wasn't going to see anybody. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely having like a social life is like really </joey>
<joey> important to not feeling like you're trapped. </joey>
<joey> And I think definitely for me, like AX and conventions </joey>
<connor> in general was such a huge, like mini-vacation for me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's so refreshing when you go to a convention. </joey>
<connor> - And we just didn't get that this year. </connor>
<connor> - I know. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is why I think everything's just been exasperated. </garnt>
<connor> - It was awful, cause I remember the last day AX happened. </connor>
<connor> So 2019, I distinctly remember the week before </connor>
<joey> I was working so much that I thought like </joey>
<joey> I was just ready to like fucking start crying </joey>
<joey> and like, come on, so I'm just like, I can't do this. </joey>
<joey> And if that AX hadn't happened, like at that time, </joey>
<joey> I didn't know what I would've done. </joey>
<joey> Cause I think I would have been way too burnout. </joey>
<joey> Cause yeah, I burned myself out so much in the anticipation </joey>
<joey> that I could enjoy this thing and have the vacation </joey>
<joey> and luckily it was great. </joey>
<garnt> I had a fucking great time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, it's been weird now, </garnt>
<garnt> because we don't have any of that. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember speaking to Emily and Emily was like, </connor>
<connor> what's the last time you took a vacation. </connor>
<connor> Before the Niigata one, and I was like, hmm, </connor>
<connor> like an actual vacation, I think it was like two </connor>
<joey> or three years. </joey>
<joey> Never took a vacation. </joey>
<joey> It was just like maybe a weekend trip. </joey>
<joey> That was like a little getaway for like one or two days. </joey>
<joey> But not like an actual vacation. </joey>
<joey> It actually been like two, three years. </joey>
<joey> Plus I'd actually done it now because I'd never would. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, cause you don't about it, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, cause conventions were my, </joey>
<garnt> I mean, conventions are work. </garnt>
<garnt> - Technically. </garnt>
<connor> - They're a hundred percent work. </connor>
<garnt> - Like you still enjoyed it and it was just a nice break </garnt>
<connor> from your routine. </connor>
<garnt> That's why I do my conventions. </garnt>
<connor> - But I can't really call a vacation. </connor>
<connor> And it was crazy that I would go like two, three years. </connor>
<connor> She didn't even question if I needed a break, </connor>
<connor> like even Christmas, like, and all the family holidays </connor>
<connor> and stuff that I would do. </connor>
<connor> I would still be doing work. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Well I think that's why I like, I've kind of been blessed </joey>
<joey> in that aspect because I am really good at scheduling </joey>
<joey> and getting it on top of my schedule because I've been able </joey>
<joey> to take short vacations. </joey>
<joey> Like whether it be with family or with friends </joey>
<joey> or just whatever, just very frequently, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> minus all of the conventions because to me conventions </joey>
<connor> aren't a vacation, it's just work, </connor>
<joey> but a different type of work. </joey>
<connor> - Just having like a weekend away helps so much </connor>
<joey> to like recharge you, I think. </joey>
<joey> And as well as my videos have been getting a lot more </joey>
<joey> ambitious as well, recently, </joey>
<joey> so I've adding on more work schedule. </joey>
<joey> - That's the power, isn't? </joey>
<joey> - Same upload schedule but like three times </joey>
<joey> the amount of work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I did, by the time we were recording, </joey>
<joey> like a rented boyfriend video, first video was easy. </joey>
<joey> It was two hours of work on my end of recording work. </joey>
<joey> Cause there's loads of other work that went in before that. </joey>
<joey> But two hours of just reacting to applications. </joey>
<joey> That's easy. </joey>
<joey> Second part was hard because I had to schedule 13 people </joey>
<joey> with different time zones, calls, one hour calls </joey>
<joey> with these people and then plan out what I was going to do </joey>
<joey> on each call. </joey>
<joey> Because I did something different for everyone. </joey>
<joey> One of them I had to like get a whole Bob Ross set up </joey>
<connor> and one of them I had to get all sculpting stuff and others. </connor>
<joey> Just different things at each one and there's one hour each. </joey>
<joey> So just pure call times, it was 13 hours. </joey>
<connor> And then on top of that I had to then fucking </connor>
<connor> micromanage my schedule </connor>
<connor> Which if you try and schedule times zones, </connor>
<connor> oh my fucking God. </connor>
<connor> It's not difficult, but you feel like your brain </connor>
<joey> is going to implode trying to juggle all these times zones </joey>
<joey> and plot them all out. </joey>
<joey> And this is just for one video. </joey>
<joey> And then, you know, back in March I did the audio book video </joey>
<joey> which is like a month of straight work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that was the most stressed I've ever seen you. </joey>
<joey> - I thought you were going to burnout there. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how I did it because I was also uploading </joey>
<joey> weekly videos in between this behemoth of a video. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's crazy, cause I had to make the audio book </joey>
<joey> and make the video. </joey>
<connor> I just, I don't know how I did not get burnout. </connor>
<joey> - That's the double edged sword, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> Is that like, the more you do YouTube </joey>
<joey> and like the moment you're like, </joey>
<joey> - I want to do better. </joey>
<joey> - The moment you decide to venture out into that one </joey>
<joey> ambitious idea and you make it happen and it's successful </joey>
<joey> then you start thinking, all right, I did it once. </joey>
<joey> I can do it again, but better. </joey>
<joey> And then it just keeps getting </joey>
<joey> and then it just keeps escalating </joey>
<joey> and escalating and escalating until you realize, oh shit, </joey>
<connor> I don't have time to make this video. </connor>
<connor> It's either going to suck </connor>
<joey> or I have to sacrifice other ideas. </joey>
<garnt> - It kind of sucks when you reached the point where </garnt>
<garnt> you make a banger video and then you think, man, </garnt>
<garnt> how am I going to top this? </garnt>
<garnt> If I'm not going to top this, what's the point of trying. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - The way I see it is that like, </connor>
<joey> the videos that I put out most often </joey>
<joey> or the like the standard videos that I hope people enjoy </joey>
<joey> and that they like buy a bit of time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then every now and then I like to just hopefully </connor>
<garnt> think that these are the banger videos. </garnt>
<garnt> The ones that like really blow people away. </garnt>
<garnt> But I hope that in between them, the videos I do put out </garnt>
<joey> like keep people engaged and enjoying. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I think it's kind of bitter sweet when you do bring out </joey>
<joey> that banger video and it doesn't amazing. </joey>
<joey> And then you're like, all right </joey>
<joey> I have to upload a couple of throwaway videos </joey>
<joey> but then throwaway videos do just as well. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I can literally do anything and it'll be all right. </joey>
<joey> - By throwaway videos we mean videos </joey>
<joey> that take very little time in comparison. </joey>
<garnt> - Way less time. </garnt>
<joey> - The thing that you have to get around </joey>
<joey> with being a YouTuber is that the effort you put in a video </joey>
<joey> does like hardly ever equates the views it gets. </joey>
<joey> - Never. </joey>
<joey> - There's no correlation to that. </joey>
<joey> And you know, the people may notice how much effort you put </joey>
<garnt> in X videos, but what YouTube cares about the metrics, </garnt>
<garnt> the money you make does hardly gets affected. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all idea based, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's all about, do you have a better idea? </connor>
<connor> It doesn't matter how you execute it. </connor>
<joey> Do you have a better idea, if you do, we'll pay you more. </joey>
<connor> - It's unfortunate, but I think I've just come to accept </connor>
<joey> and I'm totally fine with knowing that maybe my video </joey>
<joey> that I put two months of work into won't do well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just happy that I did it. </joey>
<joey> Cause I'm like, I can at least be like, I'm capable of this. </joey>
<joey> - It looks good on the resume. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm working on a video right now where I was </joey>
<joey> I was a Fiverr seller for like two months </joey>
<joey> and it's all done now, but that's two months of work. </joey>
<joey> And if that video bombs, I was gonna be pretty sad, </joey>
<connor> - I'ma cry. </connor>
<connor> - It's gonna be pretty fucking sad, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> Because two months, two months of fucking work into that. </connor>
<connor> - And then afterwards you do a video that takes an hour </connor>
<joey> to make and you'll be like, it'll get just as many views. </joey>
<connor> - Ten times even better sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's YouTube, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I think I've just come to accept now </garnt>
<connor> that I'm not doing it for the views. </connor>
<connor> I'm doing it because I want to make these videos </connor>
<connor> that I think are cool. </connor>
<connor> That's pretty much where I've gotten to now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I think Trash Taste's been great because it allows me </connor>
<connor> to just even more further lean that mindset of, </connor>
<joey> I don't really care cause we have Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> and Trash Taste gets more views than most of my videos. </joey>
<joey> And it's just me chatting shit for hours. </joey>
<joey> So I gotta not give a shit about the views. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've definitely started to care less on my main channel. </joey>
<connor> - Trash Taste is... </connor>
<joey> - Care less about the views actually. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't give a fuck about my channel. </connor>
<joey> - Trash Taste has really been like bittersweet </joey>
<joey> just to see like how much effort we put into our videos </joey>
<joey> on our own channels. </joey>
<joey> Then we come in and chat shit for two hours </joey>
<joey> and we're like a million views </joey>
<joey> for like two hours just chatting. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, what am I doing right? </joey>
<joey> And what am I doing wrong? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, hold on a million views. </joey>
<joey> And there's only three cuts in the video, what's happening. </joey>
<connor> - It's nice though because it feels that like obviously </connor>
<joey> there's, we're doing something right here. </joey>
<joey> You guys must enjoy it. </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I think our dynamic must be working, I guess. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I'm very glad that it's doing well. </connor>
<joey> - But that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that because of Trash Taste, because this is quite </joey>
<joey> different to what I do and what we all do </joey>
<joey> in our own channels. </joey>
<connor> It's kind of incentivized me more to explore different </connor>
<connor> things on my main channel. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I recently brought out a video where I kind of go </garnt>
<garnt> personal into like my whole thing about being half-Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a really good video. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was really scared to upload that. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's got nothing to do with anime </garnt>
<joey> and it's just my life story basically. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, I really don't want this to look </joey>
<joey> like another sob story. </joey>
<joey> Like a woe is me type of story, </joey>
<joey> but people really enjoyed it. </joey>
<joey> I asked Mudan as well to like do a little bit different </joey>
<joey> on the editing side of things </joey>
<joey> and everything turned out amazing. </joey>
<joey> So when I saw that video do well, I was like, okay, </joey>
<joey> maybe I can, even though I'm called the Anime Man, </joey>
<joey> maybe not every video has to be about anime. </joey>
<joey> Maybe I can go back to my Let's Play days </joey>
<joey> and just do whatever the fuck I want. </joey>
<connor> - A lot might not know about voice acting so, it's fine. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. </joey>
<connor> But at least you also just VA, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like you don't have CDawg voice actor. </garnt>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> - Not all my videos are about the United Kingdom. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So, it's all good, man. </garnt>
<joey> It's all good. </joey>
<joey> - Why did you stop talking about Arizona? </joey>
<joey> Where did the Arizona go? </joey>
<joey> - Why not then review Virginia for the moment </joey>
<joey> and see what's up with that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's just, I dunno, cause with me, right. </joey>
<joey> At least with you guys, </joey>
<joey> because your names are a lot more general, right? </joey>
<connor> You're not bound to a certain topic. </connor>
<connor> Not like I am. </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever thought about changing your name? </connor>
<joey> - I have, in a sense, yes. </joey>
<joey> Actually a number of times I thought about it. </joey>
<joey> Like, when I was still doing Let's Plays. </joey>
<joey> I thought about changing it, just because first of all, </joey>
<joey> half of the games I play aren't even anime. </joey>
<joey> Second of all, I'm uploading like five Lets Plays in a week </joey>
<joey> and tWo anime videos in a week. </joey>
<joey> So I thought, is there really a point </joey>
<joey> to call myself the Anime Man? </joey>
<joey> But at that point, now the Anime Man is just a brand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> - People know me, not as Joey, but as the Anime Man. </joey>
<joey> So it's really hard to just suddenly change the name. </joey>
<joey> Because I've seen instances of YouTubers </joey>
<joey> who are already established in a name, </joey>
<joey> who decide on a whim to change their user name </joey>
<connor> to something, because it doesn't fit their current image </connor>
<joey> and it's never worked out. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, I know. </connor>
<connor> One channel, I think it's worked out </connor>
<connor> there was a channel called, I guess he goes by Lemmino now, </connor>
<garnt> have you seen his videos? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> He used to be a top 10 channel. </garnt>
<joey> - Top 10, he's still a top 10. </joey>
<joey> - My God, Lemmino. </joey>
<joey> Like, now he basically just does Netflix documentaries. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of like the level of YouTube content </joey>
<connor> that he puts out. </connor>
<garnt> - Really, really good stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> He used to be called Top Tens. </garnt>
<joey> And obviously he's not doing top 10's now. </joey>
<joey> I think he might do them, every now and then. </joey>
<connor> I don't think he does though. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, he changed his name. </connor>
<joey> And I remember being weirded out at first. </joey>
<joey> I was like what? why? </joey>
<joey> But now you don't give a shit </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> I feel that is just a really small handful. </joey>
<joey> - True. - True. </joey>
<joey> - Most of the time you're just like, oh God, </joey>
<connor> why did the name change? </connor>
<connor> - You'll basically be resetting all the SEO's </connor>
<connor> - Why are they making completely different content? </connor>
<joey> I didn't sign up for this shit. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like, respect to anyone who has the balls </garnt>
<joey> to do that because I wouldn't be able to get away </joey>
<joey> from like, my brand that I've built up </joey>
<garnt> over this entire time. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, that's like if, for example, right. </joey>
<connor> - Like you took away VA in your name. </connor>
<connor> And you just turn it to CDawg. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think it would change anything. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, man. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's more like if you just change your name </garnt>
<joey> to like Connor. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, true, true, true. </joey>
<joey> - That's the reason why, like, for me, for example, </joey>
<garnt> I want to like say on Trash Taste, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to be established as Joey. </garnt>
<connor> Not as the Anime Man, </connor>
<joey> because I feel that's a completely different side of me. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> You've gotten the clips on you now? right? </joey>
<joey> Cause we had a discussion when we were making the channel. </joey>
<joey> We were like, so in the clip. </joey>
<joey> So we calling us the Anime Man. </joey>
<joey> And did X, X thing or like Joey. </joey>
<joey> I think I was at the mindset of like, okay, well. </joey>
<joey> It's a podcast and it's very personal and we're probably </joey>
<joey> gonna be talking about personal things. </joey>
<joey> I think it should be Connor, Joey, Garnt et cetera. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and not to say that we don't mind you guys </joey>
<joey> calling us by our usernames. </joey>
<joey> But I think the end game for Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> at least in my mind is that I don't want to be known </joey>
<joey> as The Anime Man, Gigguk and CDawg. </joey>
<joey> I wanted us to be known </joey>
<joey> as Joey, Garnt and Connor of Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> - The boys. </joey>
<connor> - The boys, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember. </connor>
<connor> I just, I wanted to be able to like, </connor>
<connor> cause I have all these cool stories </connor>
<joey> that are fucking useless to me. </joey>
<joey> What am I going to do? </joey>
<joey> When am I ever going to get mileage out of the story? </joey>
<joey> - When am I going to monetize my stories? </joey>
<connor> - Let's just commoditize it. </connor>
<garnt> - Let's just commoditize my entire fucking life. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, I love telling the chest story. </connor>
<connor> Cause that's such a fucking cool story. </connor>
<connor> I never get any use out of that. </connor>
<joey> And also people will just like, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's like adding layers to me, I love it when I get to learn </joey>
<joey> more about a creator and like that personal side </joey>
<connor> I actually like, I like, I think that, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I just also, I'm just gonna say I love fucking talking. </connor>
<connor> I love talking. </connor>
<joey> I just won't shut the fuck up. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I would argue we wouldn't have a podcast </joey>
<connor> if we didn't like talking. </connor>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<connor> - That's why I can stream just chatting for like four hours. </connor>
<garnt> Cause I'm a fucking psychopath I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> I just won't shut up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have too many stories to hold. </garnt>
<connor> - I just want to keep fucking chatting shit. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I love talking and it's great being able to. </connor>
<garnt> I love talking about YouTube as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you never get the opportunity to do it. </garnt>
<joey> - You never, because all of our friends, all of our family, </joey>
<garnt> they don't know what the fuck we do. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and then I could talk about it with you guys </connor>
<connor> but I pretty dominate every single conversation we have </connor>
<connor> off the podcast. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> So it's nice to just talk about it here. </connor>
<connor> And then we can just chat shit. </connor>
<connor> Like poopy poopoo, stinky, in private, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - We're sorry for anyone who goes into this podcast </garnt>
<garnt> thinking it was going to be like an anime exclusive podcast. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I know on. </joey>
<connor> - I think you two are worried about that. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, no, dude, </connor>
<joey> I want us to be like chatting shit. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, I want it to be like, eventually, </garnt>
<garnt> we start off as an Anime podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we eventually grow out. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then we can eventually maybe start tensioning out. </garnt>
<joey> But not right from the get-go first episode, we were like, </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad, I'm glad. </joey>
<joey> - Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, let's talk about Japan. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but we're really glad that you guys have like, </joey>
<joey> kind of stuck around and just enjoyed us chatting shit. </joey>
<joey> Like arguably more so than us chatting about anime. </joey>
<joey> - I wonder, I mean, going back to the previous topic, </joey>
<joey> is it like, cause you hear a lot of advice </joey>
<joey> that YouTubers give to people. </joey>
<joey> I feel a lot of it's pretty shit. </joey>
<joey> Let's be honest. </joey>
<joey> A lot of it's pretty funny fucking </joey>
<connor> - Like how so? </connor>
<joey> I mean, don't give examples necessarily, </joey>
<joey> but like, how are they shit? </joey>
<connor> - There's generic phrases that YouTubers say, </connor>
<garnt> and we, let's be honest. </garnt>
<connor> We say it cause it's fucking easy. </connor>
<connor> Like... </connor>
<garnt> - You mean what I'm going to call like the convention panel. </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt, give me the most stereotypical. </connor>
<connor> And I'll say if these are the shit ones, </connor>
<connor> give me stereotypical answers on advice </connor>
<connor> when someone asks you how to be a YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> - Just be yourself. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - That is fucking terrible advice. </joey>
<joey> - Shake my head. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know how many people I know who are insufferable. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I have so many mates where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> listen you're a fantastic mate. </joey>
<joey> But if you act like this on camera, </joey>
<joey> no one's going to want to watch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> You have a lot of mates. </connor>
<joey> You're like, you just kind of come off as a dick. </joey>
<joey> - Let's say, because for me now I used to say, </joey>
<joey> just be yourself and just have fun with it. </joey>
<joey> Have fun with it. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> But nowadays I just make it a meme because </joey>
<joey> I get also many times. </joey>
<garnt> Someone's like, how do you start becoming a YouTuber? </garnt>
<garnt> I just say, hit the upload button. </garnt>
<connor> - Are we actually going to break this down? </connor>
<connor> - Should we give advice? </connor>
<connor> I think why not? cause people want to know </connor>
<connor> fucking YouTube advice and we may as well like, </connor>
<garnt> actually give good advice. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, how to become a successful YouTuber </connor>
<connor> from Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> I feel like we say generic advice because there's like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like the generic advice that we give </connor>
<connor> is like the core of like... </connor>
<connor> - It is fucking useless to most people. </connor>
<garnt> - It is useless because there's only so much </garnt>
<garnt> you can say like a half hour panel </garnt>
<connor> - It's one of those things where it's like, </connor>
<joey> you know, in the show when the old man gives advice </joey>
<joey> and you're like, that's fucking dumb. </joey>
<joey> And then 10 years later when he actually does it </joey>
<connor> you're like, fuck, he was right. </connor>
<connor> That's pretty much the advice. </connor>
<connor> Like, cause you're like it's completely useless </connor>
<connor> to anyone starting out. </connor>
<connor> Cause that doesn't mean anything </connor>
<joey> when you've been doing it for this long. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it is the core, like you said. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But the be yourself thing is like, </joey>
<joey> I think that's the biggest like, </joey>
<connor> - Cop out. </connor>
<joey> It is a bit of a cop out. </joey>
<connor> - Because you don't, you're not, </connor>
<connor> yourself as a normal person, you're not a presenter. </connor>
<connor> No one normally is a presenter </connor>
<connor> or a personality who's made for like cameras. </connor>
<connor> You have to, you have to get that, and you do it </connor>
<connor> by forcing yourself to act maybe a little bit more </connor>
<connor> exaggerated than you normally do. </connor>
<connor> And then over time, maybe you get way more comfortable </connor>
<connor> and it does become your kind of like default. </connor>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno, because like, be yourself to me is like </garnt>
<connor> I guess less accurate than just, </connor>
<connor> don't try to be someone you're not. </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> Don't change your personality. </connor>
<connor> - If you are going to play a character, </connor>
<connor> play a character that is based on your own self. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> - Which is I feel like, well, </connor>
<connor> like a lot of us do online anyway. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's just like an exaggerated </connor>
<garnt> perfected version of ourselves. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I say. </connor>
<connor> I say like, imagine you on your best day </connor>
<joey> and that is you on every single one of these YouTube videos. </joey>
<connor> That's what should it be? </connor>
<connor> You know, whether or not that should be right? </connor>
<connor> Like, should you be sad on camera and stuff like that? </connor>
<joey> It's like, not really about that. </joey>
<joey> It's, think of every single best personality trait you have </joey>
<connor> and show that, make that come through. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so that does require a little bit of, you know, </connor>
<connor> a bit of fuckery, going home with your personality. </connor>
<connor> You do have to change it a little bit. </connor>
<connor> But I found as well that it made me a better person </connor>
<joey> in general that like I, the things that people liked </joey>
<joey> about me became more prominent in my general personality. </joey>
<joey> So it wasn't more so that I was faking it more so </joey>
<joey> that the real me kind of changed </joey>
<joey> into a more confident version of myself. </joey>
<joey> And I, you know, you should pass a way </joey>
<connor> of really making you see your flaws. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's a fine balance as well, because I feel that </joey>
<joey> it's not about like, faking a personality, right? </joey>
<joey> Because if you... </joey>
<connor> - It's exaggerated. </connor>
<garnt> - But if you exaggerate it too much </garnt>
<joey> that's when people are like, then you become access to doubt </joey>
<garnt> - Then you become that psychopathic vlogger. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, then you become that psychopathic vlogger </joey>
<joey> who is like the most angel image online. </joey>
<joey> But then when you meet them in person </joey>
<joey> they're an absolute cunt. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, sometimes in conventions, </connor>
<connor> people come up to me like, wow, </connor>
<joey> you're a lot more calm than in your videos. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, well, yeah, because, oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Did you get that? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I am like, if I'm fucking crazy in my videos, </joey>
<connor> or doing something stupid. </connor>
<connor> Like, I genuinely am like that </connor>
<connor> but you can't do that all the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Otherwise you're a psychopath. </connor>
<joey> - You're either a psychopath or Guy Fieri. </joey>
<joey> - You know, in real life it's fucking annoying. </joey>
<connor> You're in a friend group and someone wants to be </connor>
<connor> the center of attention all the time. </connor>
<garnt> Like, it's not natural to want the center </garnt>
<garnt> of attention all the time. </garnt>
<connor> Like, it's totally okay to be in a friend group and be like, </connor>
<connor> I'm just not going to say anything for five minutes </connor>
<connor> and I'll wait for my time to join in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - And if you don't join in at all, that's fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah man, that's what I thought. </joey>
<joey> - You can just be there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's plenty of YouTubers I've met </joey>
<joey> where, you know, you'll like, oh, you're totally different. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You're not even close. </connor>
<connor> - Not gonna say any names, obviously, but... </connor>
<garnt> - I don't wanna get in trouble. </garnt>
<joey> - we've had our fair share. </joey>
<garnt> - This is the gospel we have </garnt>
<garnt> behind the scenes, unfortunately. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, if the cameras weren't on </joey>
<garnt> we'd totally be saying names. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, that person sucks. </joey>
<joey> - It's because you wouldn't... </joey>
<joey> Okay, you see drama on YouTube behind the scenes sometimes. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, wow, everyone is drama. </joey>
<joey> No one knows about it. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of crazy. </joey>
<connor> So yeah, every, YouTuber you watch probably has some drama. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just about whether they... </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone has dirt on someone else. </garnt>
<joey> - That's just about whether they choose to monetize it. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so true, that's so true </garnt>
<joey> - But everyone has shit with other people. </joey>
<connor> It's very natural. </connor>
<connor> - I've had issues before, but I've always done it in private </connor>
<joey> and I've always swamped in private. </joey>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Same. </garnt>
<connor> - If someone's crossed the line I've told them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess going back to like general advice </garnt>
<garnt> on how to be a successful YouTuber. </garnt>
<connor> I think one thing that's not really mentioned a lot </connor>
<connor> is just know who your audience is. </connor>
<connor> Like, don't try to appeal to everyone. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - You can't please everyone. </connor>
<connor> - You're gonna be disliked by a lot of people. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you're gonna be disliked by a lot of people, </connor>
<connor> just accept that. </connor>
<connor> I feel like one thing that not many people think about, </connor>
<connor> especially like even us, when we started, </connor>
<connor> we didn't really think about it. </connor>
<connor> We didn't really think, oh, I want to be this kind of person </connor>
<joey> or aim for this kind of audience </joey>
<joey> but it's something you kind of grow into. </joey>
<joey> And now all three of us have very different brands </joey>
<joey> in terms of like what our content is about. </joey>
<joey> And it's something we grow into. </joey>
<joey> But you like anyone, anyone who's trying to </joey>
<joey> be a YouTuber has a harder time getting into that </joey>
<joey> because you have way more competition. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> Because I know that if I were just starting YouTube </joey>
<joey> out today, I would be totally different. </joey>
<joey> Like my content would be totally different </joey>
<joey> than what I'm doing now. </joey>
<joey> And that's because I exist, right? </joey>
<joey> So if I exist, then you can't do the same thing, </joey>
<joey> you can't exist in the same space that I do. </joey>
<joey> And so one thing that you've got to find </joey>
<joey> is like a unique way to make yourself memorable. </joey>
<joey> And sometimes that might just be </joey>
<joey> how you approach your content. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes that may be your personality. </joey>
<joey> But a lot of the successful YouTubers that are rising up </joey>
<joey> quickly have found a way to make their own niche. </joey>
<connor> Even if it's like this very saturated market. </connor>
<connor> Like I think the person who like sticks out to me, </connor>
<connor> the most recent that I can think of was like Nikki Jakey </connor>
<joey> and how fast he rose. </joey>
<joey> And that's because his content and the way he delivered it </joey>
<joey> was just so unique compared to every other gaming content </joey>
<garnt> out there, even though gaming was such a saturated market. </garnt>
<joey> - Gaming outside of YouTube is everywhere. </joey>
<garnt> - And I would say like, that's one extreme. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't have to go like, as unique as him, </garnt>
<garnt> but even like a lot of other people who are rising up </garnt>
<garnt> have found a way to make their own voice unique </garnt>
<garnt> or make their presentation unique or something </garnt>
<garnt> that is memorable about them. </garnt>
<joey> If that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - And it's funny as well, because a lot of those types </joey>
<joey> of YouTubers tend to be the most humble. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because like I remember in a Nike Jakey video he once said </joey>
<joey> like, yeah, because I'm just John Tron on an exercise ball. </joey>
<joey> So he said, that's what he called himself. </joey>
<joey> He's like, I'm John Tron on an exercise ball. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, you shouldn't sell yourself that short </joey>
<joey> because he's completely different. </joey>
<joey> He's made up his own thing. </joey>
<joey> And I feel, as you said, that's, that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, there's nothing wrong with getting inspired </joey>
<joey> by an already existing YouTuber, being like, </joey>
<joey> I like that aspect of this YouTuber. </joey>
<joey> So I'm going to take that into my own thing. </joey>
<joey> But there's a difference between getting inspired </joey>
<joey> by PewDiePie and then trying to be PewDiePie 2.0. </joey>
<connor> - I think when I started YouTube, I think like, </connor>
<garnt> I definitely loved dance videos, but I just knew that like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just doesn't work with me. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - As much as I'd love to make a Gigguk video. </connor>
<connor> I just can't, that's not, I can't pull it off. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a Gigguk video because it's a Gigguk video. </garnt>
<joey> - I think you learn, a good YouTuber will learn very quickly </joey>
<joey> what tools they're working with. </joey>
<joey> And you can figure out what you can kind of get out of that. </joey>
<joey> It's difficult though, because I think again, </joey>
<joey> like you've said, like a lot of people with like specialties </joey>
<joey> are coming up now. </joey>
<joey> So if you want to join something, like gaming </joey>
<joey> you need a fucking good skill to separate. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So think like, if you're making a video, </garnt>
<garnt> like is it just another carbon copy of someone else's </garnt>
<garnt> or I always told myself, like, let's say </garnt>
<joey> even though we're in different genres, right? </joey>
<joey> Let's say Markiplier uploads a video, right. </joey>
<joey> At the same time I upload a video. </joey>
<joey> What reason does someone have to watch my video over his? </joey>
<joey> Because you know, that's, I mean, this is the problem. </joey>
<joey> It's only X amount of time in the day </joey>
<joey> and you need the eyeballs on you. </joey>
<joey> So you need to make your videos as good as the best people </joey>
<joey> on YouTube, otherwise people aren't gonna watch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like some people will and, and they'll be very grateful </joey>
<joey> because you're doing a very niche thing. </joey>
<joey> But in general, you need to make your content </joey>
<joey> like as good as other people around you. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter how big or small you are. </joey>
<joey> This is the fundamental. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because everybody starts off small. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone starts off small. </joey>
<connor> The problem is, is that the YouTube algorithm </connor>
<connor> doesn't give a fuck at your side. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I'd say that. </garnt>
<garnt> I obviously agree. </garnt>
<garnt> You should make your content as good as possible. </garnt>
<connor> I just don't think. </connor>
<connor> Especially as a small growing YouTuber, making your content </connor>
<connor> as good as like some of the bigger YouTubers </connor>
<connor> - You're not going to, but you should have that mindset. </connor>
<connor> - You should eventually. </connor>
<connor> But what I'm saying is like, if you're starting our YouTube </connor>
<connor> some of the charm, is just discovering this YouTuber </connor>
<connor> who just like, is like a diamond in the rough. </connor>
<connor> You shouldn't, like the quality of your videos. </connor>
<connor> You shouldn't need to think that you need to make </connor>
<joey> like a John Tron fucking quality video of right off the bat. </joey>
<joey> Because like, I feel like you should, getting into YouTube, </joey>
<garnt> you should understand what YouTube is at it's core. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, cause I think I watched, like I still do. </connor>
<connor> I watch like 40 hours plus of YouTube a week </connor>
<connor> and been doing that for like years </connor>
<garnt> - And YouTube at its core isn't a video hosting platform. </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube at a core is a friendship simulator. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<garnt> - And I mean, that's, that's, it is. </garnt>
<connor> - I really want to be friends with report of the week man. </connor>
<connor> I love that man seriously. </connor>
<garnt> - Because, the thing is, a lot of the most successful </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers, you know what their personality is like </garnt>
<connor> and a lot of the reason why I started watching </connor>
<connor> like YouTubers big or small is because I like a certain part </connor>
<connor> of their personality. </connor>
<connor> And there was some like, even if there was someone I hated </connor>
<joey> there was part of their personality or part of their content </joey>
<joey> that I couldn't stop watching it, what drew me to it. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like a lot of the successful YouTubers </joey>
<connor> have been able to kind of like convey their personality </connor>
<connor> into their content in some way, that goes back </connor>
<connor> to like being like memorable and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But you know, it plays into like parasocial relationships </connor>
<connor> and all that, which is a totally fucking different topic. </connor>
<connor> But if you're talking about success, like it's basically you </connor>
<connor> the more you can become successful successful quickly </connor>
<joey> by just having people who relate to you as a person. </joey>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> - And that goes into, you can't please everyone </joey>
<joey> because your personality is not going to appeal to everyone. </joey>
<joey> But having your own, putting yourself out there. </joey>
<garnt> And if people like you, or if people </garnt>
<garnt> find part of you interesting and you can convey that, </garnt>
<garnt> then you will grow as a YouTuber. </garnt>
<connor> - It's true </connor>
<connor> I think, unfortunately everyone can't be like, </connor>
<joey> ultra mega charming right off the bat. </joey>
<joey> Like, I mean like report of the week. </joey>
<joey> I love that guy's, I love him. </joey>
<joey> And that kind of personality doesn't come along often. </joey>
<joey> It's just pure, charming and like innocence. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But you know, what if you have like just a normal, </joey>
<connor> medium, boring personality. </connor>
<connor> Like, I feel like I probably had like a boring aspect. </connor>
<joey> - All of our first videos were just like... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and just developing that </joey>
<joey> along your, finding your niche like you said. </joey>
<garnt> Like going into it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like knowing your audience, </garnt>
<connor> like these are all Important things. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I was someone who was like this, awkward social kid. </connor>
<connor> - Same, same. </connor>
<connor> - And especially like, as a YouTuber </connor>
<connor> I still don't feel like I've changed a lot. </connor>
<connor> I just know that, hey, like if I'm going to be like, </connor>
<joey> when I realized, hey, if I'm going </joey>
<joey> to be a fucking degenerate, let's just like notch. </joey>
<joey> Let's just go all out. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking give a shit anymore. </joey>
<joey> And it's just taking part of yourselves </joey>
<connor> and just like going full throttle with it. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, I dunno because I knew it. </connor>
<joey> - I agree. </joey>
<joey> - I knew like that's just gonna make you stand out. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> Like now I'm not ashamed of being a degenerate </connor>
<connor> and I'm fucking glad that I took that change in my content, </connor>
<connor> because like, it just made me less embarrassed </connor>
<connor> about being who I was originally. </connor>
<connor> And like, instead of being a quiet kid, </connor>
<connor> I could just talk about all the shit </connor>
<connor> I was like, thinking about. </connor>
<joey> - Anime titties. </joey>
<garnt> - Anime titties, let's go baby. </garnt>
<joey> - So bottom line, how to be a successful YouTuber, </joey>
<connor> be yourself (Garnt laughs) just be yourself. </connor>
<connor> - I guess that's, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's kind of like what I'm talking about. </connor>
<joey> - That's what it all goes back to. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's the core, right? </joey>
<connor> It's the fucking core that I'm talking about. </connor>
<connor> Well, I can't normally, I can't say this kind </connor>
<connor> of answer in a fucking panel. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, no. </connor>
<joey> You're just fucking bore everyone to death. </joey>
<joey> But you know, there's and I also think it's important </joey>
<joey> to just upload, like, just do it. </joey>
<joey> - Consistency. </joey>
<joey> - I have so many friends who are like, </joey>
<joey> I'm working on something big, like it's big, bro. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure you all have this friend. </joey>
<joey> Who's like, Oh, I've got shit in the works. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, and then it's like two years later. </joey>
<joey> Oh, it's, it's coming. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's coming. </joey>
<joey> - It's coming. </joey>
<joey> - Then they upload it. </joey>
<connor> And then they're like, that's it, I'm famous, I'm done. </connor>
<connor> And then they realize they have to do it again. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the amount of channels I've seen that have </joey>
<joey> more update videos than actual content </joey>
<connor> on their channel is staggering. </connor>
<joey> - And it's that thing right. </joey>
<joey> Where I think everyone who watches YouTube, idolizes </joey>
<joey> that YouTuber who uploads once every three months. </joey>
<joey> And it's a legendary, right. </joey>
<connor> But in reality, there's only a very small room </connor>
<joey> for channels like that. </joey>
<joey> There's only a select few who can do that. </joey>
<joey> And in reality, most of us </joey>
<joey> have to just keep fucking uploading. </joey>
<joey> That's just how it is. </joey>
<connor> Because a lot of us aren't capable of putting in </connor>
<joey> that amount of work into a video. </joey>
<joey> Like I love , what's his name? </joey>
<joey> Frederik Knudsen. </joey>
<joey> What is his name? </joey>
<joey> - Down the rabbit hole. </joey>
<joey> - Down the rabbit hole, love his videos. </joey>
<joey> I don't mind how long it takes him. </joey>
<joey> Cause that that man must put in. </joey>
<joey> I don't want even want to know how much work he puts in. </joey>
<joey> I love that wings of redemption. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a two and half hour long video. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've watched it like four times and I love it. </connor>
<joey> - In the same sense, like the right opinion, for example. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've watched this for... </connor>
<joey> - Fucking four hours. </joey>
<joey> - When I was sick I watched this four hour video </joey>
<joey> in one sitting of his Nick Carter avocado video. </joey>
<joey> And I thought I was losing my damn mind watching this. </joey>
<joey> But you know, again, it's a very, </joey>
<joey> everyone wants to be that channel, right? </joey>
<joey> The really well-respected channel that does that. </joey>
<joey> But unfortunately I think as a YouTuber </joey>
<joey> you'll know very quickly on if you can do that or not, </joey>
<joey> if that's your kind of thing, some people can do that. </joey>
<joey> A lot of people just </joey>
<joey> just got to accept that you're going to be </joey>
<joey> that dude who makes one video every two days. </joey>
<joey> Like, and there's nothing wrong with that. </joey>
<joey> Like just embrace it. </joey>
<joey> - There's a space for that on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a space for everything. </connor>
<connor> If you've got to make slime videos, don't. </connor>
<connor> - I for one love the slime videos, </connor>
<joey> - Oh, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - to be honest with you. </joey>
<joey> When I discovered that like a week ago </joey>
<joey> I was like, okay, kind of like, I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know what the biggest pitfall, </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of YouTubers fall down? </connor>
<joey> Is that when they get one successful video series </joey>
<joey> they're like make 10 of that. </joey>
<joey> Make 10 of that, </joey>
<joey> - Do it again. </joey>
<joey> - And I think... </joey>
<joey> - You mean every top 10 channel? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, you meet people. </joey>
<joey> And they make, they just make repeats </joey>
<joey> and repeats of the same video. </joey>
<joey> And you've got to realize like, </joey>
<joey> if that's the only thing that's pulling people in </joey>
<joey> you haven't made any other foundation </joey>
<joey> to keep people engaged. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you've got to be patient. </joey>
<garnt> - When that stops, eventually we're gonna get bored </garnt>
<garnt> of doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> You kind of got not really anything else. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why like... </garnt>
<connor> - You're going to burn out, eventually, </connor>
<connor> like we talked about. </connor>
<connor> Putting a foundation is actually really, really important </connor>
<connor> and something that most people don't think about </connor>
<connor> because most people would just want to get </connor>
<connor> as successful as they can. </connor>
<garnt> - More views, more views, more views </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, I've been doing the cosplay series </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah, I've, I've done a fuck ton of those </garnt>
<garnt> but I do one of them about every two, three months. </garnt>
<connor> So they're really well spaced out and it's really important </connor>
<connor> to just make sure you're diversifying it </connor>
<connor> so that it's not like a business meeting. </connor>
<connor> Make sure the synergy of your uploads are diverse enough </connor>
<connor> to get to cooperation. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's the exact problem I had </connor>
<joey> with the Antony standby, right? </joey>
<joey> Like I haven't done one in, like seven months </joey>
<connor> eight months or something. </connor>
<connor> And people to this day ask me, when's the next? </connor>
<connor> - When you bring it out. </connor>
<connor> People are gonna be like, hell, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - When I do it, eventually, maybe, it's going to be great. </joey>
<joey> But the reason why I stopped making those </joey>
<joey> for the longest time is because </joey>
<joey> that's exactly what happened. </joey>
<joey> It was really successful the first time. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I'll do it every week </joey>
<joey> just do it over and over and over again </joey>
<joey> I made like 60 anime samples, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And now at this point, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I want to do something else with it. </joey>
<joey> I just don't want to like upload another Q and A again, </joey>
<connor> because that's essentially what it is. </connor>
<joey> It's just a fucking Q and A. </joey>
<connor> - I also just want to make sure people know </connor>
<joey> that at the end of the day, we're fucking dudes </joey>
<joey> who talk shit in front of the camera, it's not a big deal. </joey>
<joey> Like why do people get like, </joey>
<joey> people with 10,000 subs stacking egos? </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, bro, my job is to literally me being a clown </joey>
<joey> I like, do not think you're hot shit ever. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why people do that either though. </joey>
<joey> - You talk about Japanese car torrents, dude, that's sad. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like dude, come on, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking know your place, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, it blows my mind or you see </garnt>
<connor> like some of these channels, like you see like, </connor>
<connor> do you see like reaction channels? </connor>
<connor> And they're like, I'm kind of a big deal now. </connor>
<garnt> Bro. </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, like chill, like chill. </connor>
<joey> I see the shit you're posting on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, bro, just stop man. </joey>
<joey> - The audacity of this man is just insane. </joey>
<joey> - There are like a few channels who could be complete </joey>
<joey> assholes and I'd be like, I'm still gonna watch dude. </joey>
<joey> You're fucking God to your content. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You deserve a good dig sucking. </joey>
<joey> But most of us are shitty YouTubers, </joey>
<joey> who don't make anything. </joey>
<connor> So don't get an ego. </connor>
<connor> We don't do anything impressive. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I think having that Attitude towards it, </connor>
<connor> like give it, I H one of my videos of my baby </connor>
<joey> and I cashed so much about it, </joey>
<joey> but I never ever think I'm like anything special. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I think that goes a long way in making you </garnt>
<connor> a down to earth person in personality. </connor>
<connor> - Being humble goes a very, very long way. </connor>
<connor> And, that's what it is, as Garnt said before, right? </connor>
<joey> Like YouTube is just a friendship simulator. </joey>
<joey> And if you want to get those friendships, </joey>
<joey> being humble is probably the best personality trait </joey>
<joey> you can have on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - Oh dude, dude. </connor>
<connor> I've made some of the best friends in my life from YouTube, </connor>
<garnt> you guys, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> Here we are now, the boys. </connor>
<garnt> - The boys wouldn't have come together </garnt>
<connor> if one of us was a dick </connor>
<connor> - Everyone I've met, obviously, including you guys </connor>
<joey> it's just like you meet and you just have this </joey>
<joey> like you can totally tell that they just don't </joey>
<connor> see themselves as anything special. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like very lucky </connor>
<connor> to be in the place that I am now. </connor>
<garnt> I wake up and I'm like, man, I'm fucking lucky to be here. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, I'm a smash of Colombini sandwich </connor>
<connor> and get back to work. </connor>
<connor> This is amazing. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm in fucking Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I know. </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile like people with like a hundred K subs </joey>
<joey> and just like the massive ego is like, </joey>
<connor> where's my caviar in the morning. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen some abhorrent behavior </joey>
<connor> from people who just think that they're hot shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then this isn't just limited to YouTube, </garnt>
<joey> but like Instagrammers. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Instagram is the worst. </joey>
<joey> - My God, like just chill. </joey>
<joey> Don't don't be an asshole. </joey>
<joey> That's the second thing. </joey>
<joey> - You want to be successful YouTuber, don't be a dick. </joey>
<joey> - But also I think thinking about the future as well </joey>
<joey> and just planning ahead I think is also important </joey>
<joey> because for like, when you hear about YouTube </joey>
<connor> success stories, everyone always just sees, </connor>
<connor> oh man, they're growing so fucking quickly, right? </connor>
<connor> I want that. </connor>
<connor> I want to grow. </connor>
<connor> I want to grow quickly. </connor>
<connor> But what they don't see a lot of the times is how </connor>
<joey> fucking long a lot of these YouTubers worked before that. </joey>
<joey> Cause you always see that one YouTuber who rises up quickly </joey>
<joey> like Mr. Beast, for example. </joey>
<connor> Mr. Beast was like, I think it was last year </connor>
<connor> or two years ago. </connor>
<connor> He was like the hottest shit on YouTube in terms of... </connor>
<connor> - He still kinda is. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, he's still here. </connor>
<joey> He's approaching like 50 mil or something. </joey>
<joey> He's like one of the biggest creators on this platform. </joey>
<joey> But what a lot of people don't talk about </joey>
<joey> is just how many times he had failed </joey>
<joey> and how many different kinds of content that he did. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, if you want to be a YouTuber </joey>
<joey> you're going to put in the grind </joey>
<joey> and it is going to be a grind and not a lot of YouTubers </joey>
<joey> talk about the grinds they put into </joey>
<joey> before they were like successful. </joey>
<joey> Cause everyone always sees </joey>
<joey> that massive fucking year that they had. </joey>
<joey> But like, I remember being a small YouTuber </joey>
<garnt> and working like, I've been on YouTube for 13 years. </garnt>
<garnt> Most of that 13 years was being a, fucking nobody. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - I have a question. </garnt>
<connor> How many years did you work on your YouTube channel </connor>
<connor> before you saw a penny? </connor>
<garnt> - Seven, eight years. </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, do you ever get those comments where people like, </connor>
<joey> dude YouTubers make too much money? </joey>
<joey> And then I always just tell them, dude, </joey>
<joey> work for seven years for nothing. </joey>
<joey> And then see if you, like, if you want. </joey>
<joey> Tell me you want to work for seven years at the chance </joey>
<joey> of being successful and getting some money. </joey>
<joey> And it's also a system that allows some amazing things. </joey>
<joey> The reason why some people make, you know, like, </joey>
<joey> I'm never going to make nearly as much money as someone </joey>
<joey> like Logan or Jake Paul makes. </joey>
<joey> But that system is also in place </joey>
<joey> so that one animator who makes one video a month </joey>
<joey> can just make enough to get by. </joey>
<joey> Because if Logan Paul and Jake Paul didn't make that much </joey>
<joey> then the animator down there couldn't make that much. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And it's, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Some of these YouTubers have way too much fucking money. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's a system that you only see the success </connor>
<joey> and you never, like you said, you never see the hard work. </joey>
<joey> Like you never see the 40 hours a week </joey>
<connor> I was putting in while trying to get a degree. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, when we say rise and grind </joey>
<joey> we mean that half as a joke, like we genuinely mean that. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, we talked about how we try to have </garnt>
<connor> a less hands on approach now. </connor>
<connor> Like, some of us to varying degrees. </connor>
<connor> - Like any business, you grow and you delegate the job. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, I don't think there is literally a YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> I know that hasn't gone through a period </garnt>
<connor> where all they did was do YouTube, from morning to night </connor>
<connor> from like waking up to night. </connor>
<connor> Like there was a year I'm sure for all three of us </connor>
<connor> where this was all we did. </connor>
<connor> And we put in that fucking grind </connor>
<connor> and the hard part was learning once we were successful </connor>
<connor> how to get out of this grind </connor>
<connor> because it's like unsustainable. </connor>
<joey> But you gotta be prepared to put the work in there </joey>
<joey> because it is going to be really, really hard fucking work </joey>
<joey> because you got to compete with everyone. </joey>
<joey> And every YouTuber I know has gone through a period </joey>
<joey> where they've just wanted to fucking kill themselves </joey>
<joey> for how much work they've done. </joey>
<joey> But that's, that's just the landscape. </joey>
<joey> Cause that's how much people want to succeed. </joey>
<joey> And if you're not prepared to do that for like a year, </joey>
<joey> at least, because some people did in a month. </joey>
<garnt> Like minimum, you got to do this for a year. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't matter what kind of life situation you're in. </garnt>
<garnt> Whether you're in like fucking uni, </garnt>
<garnt> like who you're working, you've got a job </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube doesn't care, YouTube doesn't wait for that shit. </garnt>
<connor> - It's unfortunate because, you know, obviously, </connor>
<joey> likely the more older you get, </joey>
<joey> the more responsibilities you have, </joey>
<joey> which means less time for YouTube. </joey>
<joey> And it just, it sucks because life isn't fucking fair. </joey>
<joey> And you know, we're really lucky that we all started </joey>
<joey> at like a perfect time, which is in university </joey>
<joey> where we could afford to throw everything else </joey>
<joey> out the window. </joey>
<joey> And I feel bad, cause sometimes you get emails </joey>
<joey> from people who are like, working fathers and you're like, </joey>
<joey> hey, I really need to do X and X. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, fuck dude. </joey>
<joey> Like, I mean, it's kinda hard cause you really have </joey>
<joey> to put in way more time than you could ever put in </joey>
<joey> in your situation. </joey>
<joey> It sucks because it's not fair. </joey>
<garnt> - Because like for me, when people ask me, </garnt>
<joey> what do I have to do to like make YouTube my job? </joey>
<joey> The first thing I asked them no matter how many </joey>
<connor> like sub counts they have, if they were thinking </connor>
<connor> about making this a job, I'm like are you prepared </connor>
<connor> to take a year out of your life? </connor>
<connor> - To make it work. </connor>
<connor> - To make it work, at least a year out of your life. </connor>
<connor> If you're prepared to take a year out of your life </connor>
<connor> to make this work then it's something I think is feasible </connor>
<connor> with the right work ethic. </connor>
<connor> Because it's not just about work. </connor>
<connor> It's not just about, cause with YouTube </connor>
<joey> you'd not only have to work hard, </joey>
<garnt> you have to work smart as well too, to stand out. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's not even a guarantee, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That that one year is like you have a chance </garnt>
<joey> of becoming successful. </joey>
<garnt> - If we're throwing pure numbers into this, </garnt>
<garnt> into the algorithm, I feel like if you have </garnt>
<garnt> over 100,000 subscribers, you can make this into a job. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you probably could. </connor>
<connor> Maybe not right at that point, but you can easily get. </connor>
<connor> - With a good amount of views. </connor>
<joey> With a healthy amount of views. </joey>
<joey> - With a healthy amount of views, </joey>
<joey> like if you've just like, obviously, </joey>
<connor> just reached a hundred thousand and you have like, </connor>
<connor> - Don't quit your job. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not saying you can quit your job </connor>
<joey> but you do have a chance to make this a job </joey>
<joey> if you play your cards right. </joey>
<joey> But like I said, are you prepared to take a year </joey>
<joey> off your life, maybe? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That's kinda like the crossroads. </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen a lot of people at </garnt>
<connor> - And there's also, you might see a channel </connor>
<connor> and they might've gotten like a big burst of numbers </connor>
<joey> but there's maybe something going on in the channel </joey>
<joey> that's quite unhealthy. </joey>
<joey> Like, you'd see, like if that channel is like low views, </joey>
<joey> low views, low views, low views, and one big view. </joey>
<garnt> And that's consistently what they're getting, </garnt>
<garnt> it's normally a bad sign. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We can just see a channel and we can know </garnt>
<garnt> if it's going to be like successful. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because most of the time, if you reach a hundred thousand </garnt>
<connor> you have some kind of foundation. </connor>
<connor> - You've been doing something right. </connor>
<connor> - You've got a foundation and it's, this is like, </connor>
<connor> unless you've just had one bang of video </connor>
<joey> and then you've just reached under a thousand. </joey>
<joey> But like most, like I'm throwing this out. </joey>
<joey> But like most of the cases I know. </joey>
<joey> where someone reaches a hundred thousand, I knew </joey>
<connor> that they could turn into a job. </connor>
<connor> It was something that you won't be living well, </connor>
<connor> when you when you start off, like, </connor>
<garnt> - None of us did. </garnt>
<garnt> - none of us were. </garnt>
<connor> - I was worrying about being kicked out of my house. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that was fun. </connor>
<garnt> - But if you understand enough about how to monetize </garnt>
<joey> your work and the internet, like fucking artists, </joey>
<joey> please please learn how to monetize your work. </joey>
<joey> There's so many talented people out there </joey>
<joey> where they're not making a single penny </joey>
<joey> because they don't know how to market their skillsets. </joey>
<joey> Like if you just do a bit of research </joey>
<joey> about how to market yourself </joey>
<garnt> and how to monetize your platform, you can make this a job. </garnt>
<connor> - I truly do think anyone can be a YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> Like it's not, </connor>
<connor> - I do as well. </connor>
<joey> - I think it just takes different amounts of time </joey>
<joey> for different people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think anyone can do it. </joey>
<joey> - Some people it just clicks, for some people you're really </joey>
<joey> have to grind it out. </joey>
<joey> - At the end of the day, you know? </joey>
<joey> And even if you're working father with 10 kids </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there is a chance of some path </joey>
<joey> that you could make it work. </joey>
<joey> - You just got to figure it out. </joey>
<garnt> - It's hard, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean there's no foolproof way to make it happen. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're not saying it's easy. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no foolproof way, but there is, I guess ways </garnt>
<joey> that you can increase your chances. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of ways. </joey>
<connor> - We can definitely go way more in-depth </connor>
<joey> into this in future podcasts. </joey>
<connor> - I could chat for like four hours of this shit, but... </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So we'll probably leave us for another episode, </connor>
<connor> but in the meantime, guys. </connor>
