<joey> - You might have to sort that out later. </joey>
<connor> - It was not big, I won't

<connor> (gentle music) </connor>
<joey> - What's up you zesty zymolytic zoologist, </joey>
<garnt> welcome back to another episode, </garnt>
<joey> - Zoologist? </joey>
<garnt> - That's the only word starting
with, "Z" I could think of. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's like one out
there watching us right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he's like I'm Zesty, I'm Zymolytic </joey>
<joey> and I'm a zoologist, thank you Joey. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> I'm Joey with Garnt and Connor. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think I've ever met
a single zoologist yet, yet. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - They'll be the one comment. </joey>
<joey> - Now there's gonna be that
one comment being like- </joey>
<joey> - Zesty zymolytic zoologist here. </joey>
<joey> - I'm right here, I'm right here. </joey>
<joey> - Do I know a zoologist? </joey>
<joey> - I know a zoologist.
- Yeah, I do. </joey>
<joey> - I wouldn't be surprised </joey>
<joey> if you knew one,
- Why? </joey>
<joey> 'cause I feel like in Australia there's </joey>
<joey> a lot more zoologist there because- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just next door
neighbor Ted, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> Because there's just so much
more wildlife over there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they're all there. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, everyone needs to be a zoologist, </connor>
<connor> otherwise how do you know </connor>
<garnt> what's gonna kill you there or not. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, you've never been Birmingham? </connor>
<connor> - Every time a snake pops up it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Someone call a zoologist." </connor>
<joey> And Ted is like, "Yeah, all
right let's have a look at this. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, you're right, you're
right, she'll be all right." </joey>
<connor> - I'd never met someone
who does stuff with zoos </connor>
<connor> that is sad. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] People who work with animals- </connor>
<joey> - You've never met a depressed zoologist? </joey>
<joey> - People who like work with animals </joey>
<connor> are always like the most
chill, happiest people. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair I would be- </joey>
<connor> - They have the best customers. </connor>
<joey> - I would be pretty happy as well </joey>
<joey> if I could work with animals.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, when you hear about these, </connor>
<connor> like they're always in Australia like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, we work on the coast." </connor>
<connor> And they're just like, they
like help coral or some shit </connor>
<connor> and they're just always like
super happy, they're like, </connor>
<joey> "You wanna save the coral?"
- Well I mean, you know, </joey>
<joey> what kind of message
will they be presenting, </joey>
<connor> if they're like super sad? </connor>
<connor> - I want a miserable zoologist </connor>
<joey> - (deep sighing) Yeah, you know. </joey>
<connor> - who's like, "Turns out planet is dying, </connor>
<connor> it's fucking annoying, can't do it." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, there's fucking kangaroos
living outta my backyard. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know I feel like
you're either like happy </garnt>
<garnt> that you're working with animals </garnt>
<garnt> that you like to be around, right? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Mmm. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause you've chosen to
be in that profession- </garnt>
<garnt> - First choice. </garnt>
<connor> - Or I mean like, the
only thing I can think of </connor>
<garnt> is people who work with
like, venomous animals </garnt>
<connor> or something like that </connor>
<connor> or animals that can put you in danger, </connor>
<connor> but if that's the case, </connor>
<connor> you have to be someone
who's enthusiastic enough- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they love it, they're like- </connor>
<garnt> - They fucking love it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like, "Oh, don't
pet the crocodile too hard, </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna chuck it, I'm gonna jump on it." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like those videos
of like the, those like, </joey>
<joey> you know, venomous like
snakes and spider collectors, </joey>
<joey> they're just like every time they're like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, I just got
a brand new tarantula, </joey>
<joey> this thing could kill me in an instant, </joey>
<connor> but my God she's a beauty." </connor>
<garnt> You know like, they're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> they're so happy to see this
like really a, to be fair, </garnt>
<joey> a lot of venomous creatures
do look fucking cool. </joey>
<joey> - [Grant] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Would I wanna be around one though? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Does your life insurance- </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Does your life insurance cost up </connor>
<connor> if you own like a
venomous spider or snake? </connor>
<joey> - You might have to maybe
like double VAX actually, </joey>
<connor> you know, like double,
like double life insurance. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I think you can vaccinate
these venomous things. </garnt>
<joey> - Can I like double life insurance? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think that's how venom works. </joey>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure it's not. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure you have to
wait until you get poisoned. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I think that there's
a snake with like COVID venom, </joey>
<garnt> you know, like the newest str, </garnt>
<garnt> like the Delta strain
of like the Cobra venom. </garnt>
<joey> - But wouldn't it be so
cool if like, you know, </joey>
<joey> anti-venom just like worked
like that or like, you know, </joey>
<joey> antidotes for venomous poison,
which is what would work. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Would you
really wanna sit there? </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, yeah let me, </joey>
<joey> can I get the Cobra shot real quick? </joey>
<joey> - Even if you did, you wouldn't get it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause like, why would you, why
would any normal person need </joey>
<joey> like 100 different fucking
snake infection, venom, </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> We're not fucking Killua
from, "Hunter Hunter," </joey>
<joey> - Well, you know. </joey>
<connor> - You don't need poison training. </connor>
<joey> - No, but like, what if you're
like going to like a specific </joey>
<joey> like area of the world that
has like a specific danger? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they do.
- Specific danger. </connor>
<connor> - If you go to like certain places </connor>
<joey> that have like really bad
mosquitoes or something, </joey>
<joey> if you get-
- Yeah, right? </joey>
<connor> - So why don't like people
who say like, you know, </connor>
<connor> decide like, oh, I wanna go
to the Australian Outback, </connor>
<joey> be like, all right just gimme- </joey>
<connor> - I don't think it's
that much of a concern. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, you think,
- I feel like if more, </joey>
<joey> - until you hear about people dying. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like you have
more chance of getting hit </joey>
<connor> like by a car in the airport,
than you do from getting, </connor>
<connor> so I feel like we should
ban cars before we ban- </connor>
<garnt> - With Sydney airport definitely </garnt>
<joey> that place is a fucking mess. </joey>
<joey> - Just feels like the dumbest superpower </joey>
<joey> anyone could hope for.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like that one guy
in like, "My Hero Academia" </joey>
<joey> who has quirks against
like every anti-venom </joey>
<joey> and he's only useful in Australia. </joey>
<joey> Like everywhere else in the
world, he's just useless. </joey>
<joey> - He's like born in the
UK, he's like, "Well, fuck? </joey>
<garnt> I can't use this at all." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Well, you can though, </garnt>
<joey> it just takes fucking long time. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, you
can build up some resistances </garnt>
<garnt> to like, some venoms. </garnt>
<connor> I dunno how much you
can build up resistance </connor>
<connor> because I dunno if there's
been any studies of like, </connor>
<connor> anyone who's like tried to
build up enough resistance </connor>
<garnt> to like, take on like a back black Cobra </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But I, </connor>
<garnt> - Don't think you'd need to.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think you need to. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, you caused it. </garnt>
<connor> You just get more used to it. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it's, it's like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - The more you get bitten, </garnt>
<joey> the more resistant you become. </joey>
<connor> - I assume if there is
like, something that makes, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, like those ants </connor>
<joey> or something that like
make you really in pain. </joey>
<joey> Maybe if you just like. </joey>
<joey> - What ants specifi, like fire ant, like. </joey>
<garnt> - A bunch of them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, like the bullet ant. </garnt>
<joey> - What if you got bitten
by one every single day, </joey>
<garnt> shortly after a while is,
you wouldn't phase you </garnt>
<connor> after like 10 years, maybe
someone wants to try this. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, no, because some experiment. </garnt>
<joey> - We want to be bitten by a bullet ant </joey>
<joey> every day for the next 10 years? </joey>
<joey> - Isn't there. </joey>
<connor> that tribe that is like,
revolved around putting a glove </connor>
<connor> of bullet ants on your hands? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But I think they do it
every day there. I think it's. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I don't think, they don't do it. </joey>
<joey> - It's it's like a, it's like
Tim, where's my, where's my, </joey>
<joey> like my fire ant glove somewhere? </joey>
<joey> - "Honey, honey, honey, </joey>
<joey> it's trying to be a fire ant
glove." "Yes, dear. Ahh!" </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure it's like, </joey>
<connor> a thing that they do during ceremonies. </connor>
<connor> - It's like to initiate
like a kid into chi, </connor>
<connor> into adulthood or something. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Adulthood,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But like, from what I can understand, </garnt>
<connor> like the people in the tribe
are more resistant to that </connor>
<connor> venom than other people who have tried it. </connor>
<connor> - Well, yeah. Obviously. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I mean, I dunno why they
like who, who decided that? </joey>
<garnt> Who decided that they would
do that as a ceremony? </garnt>
<joey> You know, let's just like, </joey>
<joey> get a bunch of fucking ants to sting you. </joey>
<joey> "You're a man now, boy." </joey>
<joey> - I wanna hear like the
council meeting of like, </joey>
<garnt> when they decided that
they were like, "All right, </garnt>
<joey> So, Jim's just turned 18,
you know, he's, he's, he's, </joey>
<garnt> he's ready to bear children.
He's ready to be a dad. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But we need like, </garnt>
<joey> a ceremonious thing." </joey>
<joey> Some guy was like, "Maybe
just share a beer with him?" </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Yeah. That's kinda like, </joey>
<joey> what if we though, hear me out, </joey>
<joey> put his hands into a
fire ant nest?" Genius. </joey>
<connor> - I, part of me gets it. </connor>
<connor> I'm, I understand why. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you know, I'm
not here to be like, </joey>
<connor> wow, your culture is, </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause, think about it. </joey>
<joey> We, we look at the fuckin'
stars and we are like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, well it turns out I'm I'm angry." </joey>
<joey> - So what, what, what
- You know, with, </joey>
<joey> - You, what, what, what do you mean? </joey>
<garnt> - With like Star Signs and stuff? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, the only difference
is that we just agree. </garnt>
<joey> - You talk about like astrology. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm joking, being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I'm gonna get married
tomorrow, apparently." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, oh, oh, I thought I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think angry is a Star Star. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> No, you could be angry right? </connor>
<garnt> From the Star Sign. Point is, </garnt>
<garnt> - Mad at Ares? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't fucking know. I
don't keep up with this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - All Ares are angry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mercury's in retrograde, </garnt>
<joey> I gotta put the fucking snake glove on. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Like I, you know, </joey>
<joey> they probably thought that
it had some meaning and it, </joey>
<joey> probably carries some value. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course,
- Like I'm sure, right, </joey>
<connor> Here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> We know that like jumping in a cold bath </connor>
<joey> or something is good for you. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yes.
- We know that, </joey>
<joey> 'cause of science. </joey>
<joey> - Like cold showers and stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] But before, </joey>
<joey> if there was no science backing this up </joey>
<joey> and you were like, </joey>
<joey> "Kind of jump in this bath for
sci, for, for health reasons, </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, fuck off. </joey>
<joey> I'm not jumping in a cold bath. </joey>
<joey> Why would I jump in a cold bath? </joey>
<joey> I'm not doing that. It's stupid. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean,
- Why would that help me? </connor>
<joey> - I wouldn't do it, even if I
knew there was health reasons. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, but like, it's like, </connor>
<joey> you know, now that there is, right? </joey>
<joey> And so I can understand why </joey>
<joey> maybe these people have
this notion that like, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure, there might
even be health benefits </joey>
<joey> to getting bitten by ants, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Maybe there is, we haven't,
we just haven't researched it. </connor>
<garnt> - There's so many things
that haven't been researched. </garnt>
<connor> We don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I don't, I don't think this is
worth researching personally. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, what if I told you that? </garnt>
<connor> Like, if you like, you
know, inflated your, </connor>
<connor> your big toe once a year, would
help with curing Alzheimer's </connor>
<joey> you'd probably be like, "Well
shit, I'm not gonna do that. </joey>
<joey> But thanks," you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> There's so many things
that can help, "X" disease, </joey>
<joey> or help stop things.
- [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - You're like, I'm just,
I'm just not gonna do that. </joey>
<joey> When they're like, that one paper came out </joey>
<joey> that one time that was like, </joey>
<joey> "Research suggest eating no
more than five french fries </joey>
<joey> at a time to lower the risk of cancer." </joey>
<joey> It's like, let's be honest. </joey>
<joey> I'm never gonna eat less
than five French fries. </joey>
<joey> - (Joey giggling)
- That's just impractical. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just not gonna do that. </garnt>
<joey> - Go to McDonald's be like, </joey>
<connor> - I don't care. </connor>
<connor> - I think like at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> people just don't care. </connor>
<joey> - No, they don't. </joey>
<joey> - Like if they couldn't
convince smokers to stop smoking </joey>
<joey> by like, actual scientific
research that prove </joey>
<joey> that it heavily increases
your chance to get cancer, </joey>
<joey> the more you smoke, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- you know, </joey>
<joey> if they couldn't convince humanity </joey>
<joey> to stop smoking after that, then? </joey>
<joey> - There not stopping anyone. </joey>
<joey> - Then what would like, five french fries? </joey>
<garnt> Like avoid fi, like eating
less than five French fries. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because like
the moment you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, you should probably
stop smoking 'cause you know, </joey>
<joey> it could give you every
type of lung cancer </joey>
<connor> or you know, just cancer in general." </connor>
<connor> Then they're just be like, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- "Dude, that's kinda cool." </joey>
<joey> - I think.
- [Joey] And that's it. </joey>
<connor> - But as humans like, we're so shit </connor>
<joey> at recognizing long term effects </joey>
<joey> and by long term like,
more than like a week. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like something effect, </joey>
<joey> we just don't think it'll affect us. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because it's like,
"Oh it's a week away. </joey>
<joey> Anything could happen.
I can die tomorrow." </joey>
<connor> - We just ignore the fact that bad stuff </connor>
<connor> can happen to us by doing everything now. </connor>
<joey> - But, yet isn't it so weird
that there's such like, </joey>
<joey> a disposition between
people who are like that, </joey>
<joey> where they're like, "Oh, </joey>
<joey> it's happening in like,
three days from now. </joey>
<joey> That's basically never gonna happen." </joey>
<joey> To, to people who, you know, say, </joey>
<joey> believe in things like
astrology, where they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, in 73 in years and four days time </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna get hit by a car. Well fuck, </joey>
<joey> I better stop preparing." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Which astrology are you reading? </joey>
<garnt> - You know like, like those kinds of like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- belief space, </garnt>
<garnt> like systems, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, not to like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> not to throw anyone's
belief system under the bus, </garnt>
<garnt> you can believe whatever
the fuck you want, right? </garnt>
<joey> But like, that was one thing I
always had trouble, you know, </joey>
<joey> coming to terms with, with
that kind of stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Where it's like, </joey>
<joey> it's so up in the air,
that it really, and, </joey>
<joey> and it's not backed up
by science in any way, </joey>
<joey> as of right now that
it's like, you know, how, </joey>
<joey> why would you even think
about something like that? </joey>
<joey> Whereas like, with smoking,
for example, it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, yeah, I had like seven
of my fuckin', you know, </joey>
<joey> friends granddads die
because of lung cancer </joey>
<joey> probably due to smoking." </joey>
<joey> So you should, you know, if
that doesn't convince you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, I guess
it comes down to the point </joey>
<joey> where like, it's like even now science, </joey>
<joey> as sad as it is, science in
the, in this day and age, </joey>
<garnt> isn't always like the determining factor </garnt>
<garnt> over whether people listen
to what science says </garnt>
<garnt> or not, because nowadays it's, </garnt>
<garnt> - 'cause science is the government, dude. </garnt>
<joey> And you don't wanna trust
the government, do you? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I think science, </garnt>
<garnt> the problem is with science </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, the, this
age of like misinformation </garnt>
<garnt> and just not knowing one is, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of misinformation out there, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yep.
- and not knowing </garnt>
<garnt> which sources to trust. </garnt>
<garnt> And number two, science
has just got so advanced </garnt>
<garnt> that the normal person isn't gonna be able </garnt>
<garnt> to follow along with what science says, </garnt>
<joey> because the logic is so past </joey>
<joey> what a normal person would
be able to understand </joey>
<joey> that you might as well be talking about </joey>
<joey> God or fuckin' stars in the sky. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, you know,
how am I gonna understand </joey>
<joey> what the fuck scientist are researching </joey>
<joey> when it comes to like making
mini black holes in the sun, </joey>
<joey> like Institute or whatever, </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing)
- like, and they're like, </joey>
<joey> fuckin' firing protons to each other. </joey>
<joey> Like what the fuck do I know about that? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know, what I mean? </joey>
<joey> That's that's so far beyond
my knowledge of understanding. </joey>
<joey> - It just sounds like
science fiction, right? </joey>
<garnt> - It literally sounds
like science fiction. </garnt>
<connor> - Unfortunately, we're a
sucker for a good answer </connor>
<connor> and an easy solution.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that's
- So, especially when like, </connor>
<joey> you know, the top researchers </joey>
<connor> and scientists in the world are like, </connor>
<joey> you know, when explaining like,
oh, how does gravity work? </joey>
<joey> And they're just like, we don't know. </joey>
<joey> Then they're like, "Ha, I
told you, must be Jesus." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- You know, like, just like, </joey>
<joey> because we hate it when
we don't know something. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Mm hm.
- Like, </joey>
<joey> no matter how significant
or insignificant it is. </joey>
<joey> And so, when immediately </joey>
<joey> when we're thrown into
that kind of situation, </joey>
<joey> humans are just very good to being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's magic. Must be magic." </joey>
<joey> - A lot of the times we just
garner towards what feels right </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- or what we want to believe. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's like, we like to believe </connor>
<connor> that we're all unbiased robots who only </connor>
<connor> go with pure facts and logic. </connor>
<connor> But a lot of the times we are very biased </connor>
<connor> towards our beliefs and it takes, </connor>
<garnt> I guess, it takes a lot
more effort to unbelieve </garnt>
<garnt> and unlearn something than
it is to just, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> than it is to learn something fresh </garnt>
<garnt> or just like, build up your beliefs fresh. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I'm sure that happens in like, </joey>
<joey> between scientists as well, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, as much as you
think scientists are just, </joey>
<joey> like purely like facts </joey>
<joey> and logic based only no emotion
thrown into what's over, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure, you know, </joey>
<joey> there's been instances
where like, a scientist </joey>
<joey> or a, you know, let's
say like a physicist, </joey>
<joey> like, comes up and be like, "All right, </joey>
<joey> I've got this new theory.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - About how the universal was created. </joey>
<joey> What do you think?
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Here's, a bunch of theoretical
things that, you know, </joey>
<joey> we've been researching,
all that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there's been a couple
of scientists who are like, </joey>
<joey> "No."
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - "That sounds dumb as fuck,
because I don't like you. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- That, happens a lot, right? </connor>
<joey> And you know, a lot of
scientists are also religious. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Of them, you know, </joey>
<joey> 'cause there's a lot of, "We
don't know a lot of things." </joey>
<joey> And also science isn't about
having concrete answers. </joey>
<joey> It's about attempting
and trying everything </joey>
<joey> and then proving that
there's no other way, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- it could be </joey>
<joey> anything else, right?
I think that's the problem </joey>
<joey> is that a lot of people have this </joey>
<joey> rigid view of science is like, </joey>
<joey> it can only be, science is 100% right, </joey>
<joey> all the time. </joey>
<joey> And it's not, we're
just eliminating things </joey>
<joey> that we know for sure it isn't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so a lot of the time
when theories are presented </joey>
<joey> or hypotheses or whatever,
you know, we have so, </joey>
<joey> so many examples of
history being incorrect, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- and we fix it </joey>
<joey> when we realize it. </joey>
<joey> And the problem is, </joey>
<joey> is that a lot of the time, </joey>
<joey> that kind of gets
galvanized into being like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, well look,
science is wrong sometimes. </joey>
<joey> they get it wrong." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, no, when we never, </joey>
<joey> science is never ever
presented to know everything, </joey>
<garnt> it's, we're building blocks. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the most accurate representation </garnt>
<connor> that we have at this current time. </connor>
<connor> - We're building up a
library of what we think to, </connor>
<joey> - I think like Tim Minchin
said it the best way. </joey>
<joey> He said like, "Science adjusts its views </joey>
<joey> based on what's observed." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- "And faith is the denial </joey>
<joey> of observation so that
belief can be preserved." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, that's pretty
much it because it's like sci, </joey>
<joey> yeah, as you said, like science
changes all the fuckin' time </joey>
<joey> because we don't know
everything in the world, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- So it's like, </joey>
<joey> so we have to kind of make
compromises for what we now know, </joey>
<joey> which could completely
change what, you know, </joey>
<joey> like say like 500 years ago
when people legitimately </joey>
<joey> believed that like, the sun
rotates around the earth </joey>
<joey> and not the other way around. </joey>
<joey> And then when they discovered
that they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Well fuck, all these science, </joey>
<joey> what have all these scientists been doing </joey>
<joey> for the past 500 years wasting our time. </joey>
<connor> - Problem is, is that we are
really bad as like, humans </connor>
<joey> of understanding stuff we don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, 'cause if
you'd have back then, </joey>
<garnt> it would make total sense that we, </garnt>
<garnt> the sun revolves around us. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause it looks like it does. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- And we don't, </joey>
<joey> have any other way of even
remotely comprehending </joey>
<joey> that it couldn't revolve, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- around us. </joey>
<joey> But once you find out, it's
like, "Oh well of course, </joey>
<joey> of course it, of course
we revolve around it." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- "That makes so much sense." </joey>
<joey> So it's really easy to
believe in the thing </joey>
<garnt> that your makes sense in your brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - That makes most like
logical sense in your brain. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause like, yeah, like
I like I said before, </connor>
<connor> like science now has got to a point </connor>
<garnt> where a lot of the more advanced concepts </garnt>
<connor> where the normal person is not
gonna be able to comprehend. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Mmm.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so at that point
you're gonna have your, </connor>
<garnt> just putting your faith
in a person of authority, </garnt>
<connor> that they're under thing is good enough </connor>
<garnt> that they can, you know,
take what these studies say </garnt>
<connor> and present that in a manner,
which you can understand. </connor>
<connor> But at the end of the day,
you're still putting a trust, </connor>
<garnt> your trust into something </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't fully understand yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> Which, I mean getting back to the, </garnt>
<garnt> getting back to like, the habits </garnt>
<garnt> and the things you believed, </garnt>
<garnt> even if, you know, science
is like disproved it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Like, do you guys have like, </garnt>
<garnt> any like, wives tales
or like anything that, </garnt>
<garnt> any habits that was formed from
basically at a childhood age </garnt>
<garnt> where like, your parents said something, </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you like, you, did
it as a kid because you, </garnt>
<garnt> your mom or dad said so. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, I have a Japanese grandma. </joey>
<joey> They are nothing but wive's tales. </joey>
<garnt> - Like okay, so like to this day, </garnt>
<garnt> like whenever I get ill, right? </garnt>
<connor> I eat a shit ton of oranges. </connor>
<connor> Like I eat like a pack
of oranges, a day, right? </connor>
<connor> - I know a lot of people who do that. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oranges! </connor>
<connor> - And like, because, when
I was young, my mom said, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, vitamin C is good
for the immune system." </connor>
<connor> - Where did this come from? </connor>
<connor> - I dunno where that came from. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure there is
some science back to it, </connor>
<garnt> but like, I think I've read to it once </garnt>
<garnt> and yes, vitamin C does
improve the immune system, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's like one, I believe, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> this is, all my memory,
so, you know, feel, </garnt>
<garnt> please fact check this. </garnt>
<joey> - It also might have
just been Garnt's house. </joey>
<garnt> - It might, it might have just
been my, household, but one, </garnt>
<garnt> I believe that's to like, prevent illness. </garnt>
<garnt> So, it like boosts your immune system. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's a more healthy immune system. </garnt>
<joey> And two, there's only so much
vitamin C intake you can do. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- To really have a big effect </joey>
<joey> on your immune system.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, but like that
doesn't matter in my mind, </joey>
<joey> 'Cause in my minds, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I've been conditioned to think, "I am ill. </joey>
<joey> I need to eat a shit ton of oranges </joey>
<joey> to intake this vitamin C
to have these Fuckin'." </joey>
<joey> - Basically, just like a Pavlovian effect. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - It's like coughs once,
"Where are the oranges?" </joey>
<connor> That's so weird because
in my house it was, </connor>
<connor> if you were starting to
get sick or you were sick, </connor>
<connor> My mom and my grandma,
especially my grandma </connor>
<joey> would make me eat a shitload
of ginger and spring onion. </joey>
<joey> I dunno why. </joey>
<joey> It just seems like a
healthy alternative but, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Just one of those things </joey>
<joey> where it has that taste
to it that you're like, </joey>
<garnt> this has to be healthy. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, but this has to </garnt>
<connor> - 'cause it tastes. </connor>
<connor> - No one else is gonna eat this. </connor>
<joey> - It tastes so harsh. </joey>
<joey> - It's 'cause it tastes like medicine. </joey>
<joey> - Like it tastes like
medicine before even like </joey>
<garnt> being put in a dish, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, another one I had a lot was like, </joey>
<garnt> if I got like a cut on
like my knee or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then you'd, my grandma would
tell me to put wasabi on it. </garnt>
<connor> - What?
- What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - That's a very famous
Japanese one, though. </connor>
<connor> A lot of,
- What? </connor>
<connor> - that's a very famous Japanese household, </connor>
<connor> - Where did that come from? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, maybe it's
because like, you know, </connor>
<joey> you put like an antiseptic on, right? </joey>
<joey> And it starts to sting. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But that means </connor>
<connor> it's like killing the bacteria, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah
- Ohh. </joey>
<connor> - So someone probably thought, "Well, </connor>
<joey> wasabi does that regularly." </joey>
<joey> - Is that where the stinging? </joey>
<joey> I don't think the stinging
is part of killing bacteria. </joey>
<joey> I think that's just like an effect. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if that's
even a wive's tail, either. </joey>
<connor> But like I did, like when I
was little, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I was running around in the park and </connor>
<connor> then I fuckin' slid and scratched my knee. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah.
- And, and you know, </connor>
<connor> it was fine until I got home </connor>
<connor> and my grandma saw it, and was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh fuck, we gotta patch you up dog." </connor>
<connor> So then she went into the kitchen. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "The bandages are over here." </joey>
<joey> She's like, "No, no,
no, no, no. I got this." </joey>
<joey> Pulls out a fuckin' tube of wasabi. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Grandmother,
what are you doing?" </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no, no, no, no no. </joey>
<joey> - And she's just like, all
right, just hold still. </joey>
<joey> Like fuckin' pulls, you know, </joey>
<joey> squirts some onto a finger </joey>
<joey> and just starts like rubbing my knee. </joey>
<joey> - Ohhh.
- And uh, that shit hurts. </joey>
<joey> - No fuckin' shit.
- Like, a lot. </joey>
<joey> And you know, I wouldn't
exactly say it worked. </joey>
<joey> If anything, it just added
an extra step of, oh, </joey>
<garnt> now it hurts and I have to shower. </garnt>
<garnt> To get this fuckin' burn. </garnt>
<garnt> - It burns now.
- And it burns. </garnt>
<joey> my regular skin, that's
not affected by the cut. </joey>
<joey> - Awful, awful. </joey>
<connor> - So that, yeah, so, that was
the moment where I was like, </connor>
<joey> "Grandma, you should
probably like, you know, </joey>
<joey> read up on like some, you
know, basic first aid." </joey>
<joey> - I'm just wondering
where that started from. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, I can imagine
it's something similar </joey>
<joey> to putting salt on a wound, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Which is, you know, it's a, </joey>
<joey> it sterilizes the wounds
as well as it could do. </joey>
<connor> - Does it? I thought it was just painful. </connor>
<connor> - No, it does. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's,
- Could we Google this? </connor>
<connor> - This. I don't. </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] By the way, wasabi
is somewhat antibacterial. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. But if I pissed on your leg, </connor>
<connor> it'd be somewhat anti bacterial. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> The problem is, this is the problem. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - When you, when these
things get some form of like, </joey>
<joey> it's like, Yeah, you are 1%, right. </joey>
<joey> 1%, right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> One right, I heard right, I heard right. </joey>
<joey> - I better add that to my
five minute daily life hacks. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, is salt, like a,
kind of like an antiseptic. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Supposedly, creates conditions </joey>
<connor> that make it difficult
for bacteria to grow. </connor>
<garnt> - Supposedly.
- Probably written </garnt>
<connor> by the same person who
said wasabi was it as well. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God, actually this is, </joey>
<joey> - I thought salt in the wound was </joey>
<joey> you did that because you
wanted to like be painful. </joey>
<joey> Like you would like, torture to someone. </joey>
<connor> - What? what do you mean? </connor>
<joey> - What, do you think it's
like people in the painaline. </joey>
<connor> - That's what we say, salt on the wound. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like, right,
let's say I fucked you over, </connor>
<garnt> to put salt in the wound,
I'll do it extra damage. </garnt>
<garnt> - It,
- Do it to fuck someone over. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is painful, but I'm pretty sure, </garnt>
<connor> - Where did they originate
from, salt in the wound? </connor>
<garnt> Can you Google this? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure it's not meant, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not medical or anything. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like., it's to add
more pain to someone. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I think it came from like, </garnt>
<garnt> salt is like a preserver, right? </garnt>
<connor> So it kind of makes it
hard for bacteria to grow. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no.
- It preserves the wound. </connor>
<connor> - This is complete bullshit,
you're making this up now. </connor>
<garnt> - Guys, actually, I don't
know where I know this from, </garnt>
<garnt> but I,
- Yeah, </garnt>
<joey> you're just making shit up. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] It didn't means
what you think it means. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Ashley] It's(indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, no, no ,no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's no medical, "Step on a crack break </garnt>
<garnt> your mother's back." </garnt>
<garnt> No, that is not how that
works, it just rhymes. </garnt>
<garnt> You think that medical
things happen to exist </garnt>
<connor> because they rhyme. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm actually curious where okay, </garnt>
<garnt> Is it so, does putting salt in
a wound make it worse at all? </garnt>
<garnt> Does it do anything? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Does make it hurt more. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know.
- I know that, I know that. </garnt>
<garnt> I know that. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Does make it hurt more. </joey>
<joey> But it's also like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> it makes it difficult for
bacteria to grow, it does. </garnt>
<connor> - It makes it difficult,
it's so vague though. </connor>
<connor> That's like, there's a
difference between a treatment </connor>
<connor> and something.
- Yeah, </connor>
<joey> just put some antiseptic on. </joey>
<connor> - Sure. If I cut my leg off,
it'd be harder for me to walk. </connor>
<connor> Like I, you know, it's,
- Put some salt. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Yeah, that's why like you, </garnt>
<garnt> you wash wounds with like
saline solutions, as well. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, you don't do with salt. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Saline solution. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but saline solution is salt water. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's salt water, that's, </connor>
<connor> - You put like, you don't put on those, </connor>
<connor> like the fuckin' rocks
rubbing it in there. </connor>
<garnt> - No we don't, that's not why. </garnt>
<connor> - The saying isn't put saline on me. </connor>
<joey> - I cut my legs. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - All I'm saying is if I'm
like lost in the wilderness </joey>
<connor> or something and I'm like,
fuckin' like miles away </connor>
<connor> from Civilization. </connor>
<joey> - Put some rock salt on it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, just like grind up some rock salt </connor>
<garnt> and just like just sprinkle
it on, sprinkle it on. </garnt>
<joey> - Japan though, is full of
so many of those kinds of </joey>
<connor> idioms, it's like, </connor>
<connor> - We're not taking medical
advice from idioms and, </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> But like, there's a lot
of like idioms like that, </connor>
<garnt> especially in Japan where
it's like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> one of them that, my
grandma used to tell me </garnt>
<joey> all the fuckin' time was
like, don't whistle at night </joey>
<joey> because snakes will come. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- And it wasn't until </joey>
<joey> a couple years later I
found out snakes are deaf, </joey>
<joey> so,
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> And then I started whistling
like a motherfucker </connor>
<connor> during the night time, you know? </connor>
<connor> So it's like, where did they come from? </connor>
<connor> I dunno. </connor>
<connor> - It's like I said, step on the crack, </connor>
<joey> - Break your mothers back.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Why? Okay, I, and as a kid, I even, I was, </joey>
<joey> when I'd heard this, I was like, no, </joey>
<joey> that doesn't make any sense. </joey>
<garnt> - How fragile is my mother's back. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, I've stepped on many cracks. </garnt>
<garnt> Intentionally, after hearing this </garnt>
<connor> to test the theory out. </connor>
<connor> Would, am I a bad person? </connor>
<joey> Probably. </joey>
<connor> - You go home, your mom's
like writhing on the ground. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no.
- [Joey] Oh no, mama! </joey>
<joey> - I think about how
everyone has collectively </joey>
<joey> stepped on a crack at some point. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't the earth just one big crack. </joey>
<connor> That's, it's just, it's
all one big tectonic plate. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Also, what does?
- All of Japan is a crack. </connor>
<connor> - Also? What defines as a crack? </connor>
<connor> Like if I were to step on an ass crack, </connor>
<connor> would I still break my mother's back or? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<joey> - So I bend over for a second. </joey>
<joey> Ahh. </joey>
<joey> - Well, how, amazing, how this, you know, </joey>
<joey> scientific fact actually
just rhymes as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, wow. </joey>
<joey> - Amazing. </joey>
<joey> Also, but other stuff that
I don't really believe in, </joey>
<garnt> anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And even as a kid, I remember
that whenever I heard these, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, no, that doesn't sound right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why? What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like a cat crossing ,under
an going under a ladder. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh. </joey>
<garnt> - Or a black cat crossing
your path is bad luck. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's more
like superstition though. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a superstition.
- That's what do you is? </joey>
<joey> This is chugging a bunch of
oranges not superstition? </joey>
<joey> - I guess so, I guess so.
- It is. </joey>
<joey> They're all superstitions. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, if.
- Wait what's the, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the difference? </garnt>
<garnt> - You just wanna go pee on it. </garnt>
<joey> - What's the difference between
superstition and an idiom. </joey>
<connor> - Well, idioms are more
to explain, like it's. </connor>
<joey> - Like an example.
- Raining cats and dogs. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I see, I see, I see, okay. </joey>
<connor> - That's an idiom, but, </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, so yeah, all of these, okay. </connor>
<connor> Replace idiom with superstitious. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Superstitions. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- These are all superstitions. </joey>
<joey> - You know, I guess it's
superstitious of you </joey>
<garnt> to consume bunch of oranges in the hope </garnt>
<garnt> that it'll cure your illness, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's superstitious.
- I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> there's another word for it. </garnt>
<joey> - You have no, no 'cause it's.
- Bullshit? </joey>
<joey> - No, cause it's purely
based on like hearsay </joey>
<connor> and information you've heard and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - But, but I feel like there's, </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] These're all folk remedies. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, It, I, </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all superstitious though, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it originates from, </garnt>
<garnt> it's all underneath that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Alternative Medicine. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's come from
like someone's, experience </garnt>
<connor> that has been passed down. </connor>
<garnt> Superstition feels more
like supernatural, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where you know, like, </garnt>
<garnt> opening up your umbrella
in indoors is good, </garnt>
<garnt> it's bad luck, I dunno
where that came from. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But like, at least like, </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't do that anyway,
'cause why would you do that? </garnt>
<joey> That's yeah, why are you opening indoors? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Well, like what if you're
in like an umbrella store </joey>
<joey> and you wanna test it out, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they have umbrella stores? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - You never get to open it though, do you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you do.
- Oh, wait yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean it's, </joey>
<joey> - I'm cracking that bad boy open. </joey>
<joey> - I crack that bad boy. </joey>
<joey> - But that's, you know, come on </joey>
<connor> if were my own house, come on. </connor>
<joey> - And then every middle aged woman </joey>
<connor> in that store looked at
me like, "Superstition." </connor>
<joey> - I don't think they believe
in that, in Japan there. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of people do.
- [Connor] Do they really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a lot of people do. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like in Asia, </joey>
<connor> the culture around
superposition is like very, </connor>
<connor> very prevalent, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Because every, everything is, </connor>
<garnt> - They don't call it superstitious. </garnt>
<connor> It has some kind of merit to it. </connor>
<joey> - Well, 'cause everything like, you know, </joey>
<joey> 'cause the whole belief
system is very like, </joey>
<connor> spiritual based, all right?
- [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I think a lot of superstitions </connor>
<joey> are more widely believed. </joey>
<connor> - There's like a, I'd say a scale of like, </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- stepping on a crack </garnt>
<garnt> or break your mom's back. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's like,
- The lower end of belief. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Well, yeah.
- Yeah. Whereas </garnt>
<joey> maybe I've, heard this from many people, </joey>
<joey> the vitamin C thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Which I have, I dunno
if it has any merit, </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if it does. </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno, it just like,
there is some like really, </garnt>
<garnt> really basic logic around it, </garnt>
<garnt> that you're like, I can kind of see that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like saying like, it's like </garnt>
<connor> I have this theory that drinking water </connor>
<garnt> will help me feel better </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like, you are right. </garnt>
<connor> But I feel like you are vastly like, </connor>
<garnt> oversimplifying the situation. </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind of like the
same thing with say, </connor>
<garnt> you like your experience with
like, manuka, honey, right? </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like,
- Yeah, that is superstitious. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> is there any science behind that? </connor>
<connor> But like when I had, when
I had COVID I was like </connor>
<connor> fucking spooning these, this manuka honey, </connor>
<connor> like nobody's business. </connor>
<connor> - That's like a, </connor>
<connor> - It actually like, helped my throat. </connor>
<garnt> Like,
- What's it called? </garnt>
<garnt> - It felt a lot better. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's it called? The placebo. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Placebo. </garnt>
<garnt> - It could be.
- That's like a placebo. </garnt>
<garnt> - It could be.
- Which is like, </garnt>
<joey> I'd argue is a branch of
the superstitious crew. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause, I actually remember, </joey>
<joey> - Placebo is the documented effect, </joey>
<joey> that it actually has an effect. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, yeah.
- As in, </joey>
<joey> your brain is making up,
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> for some form of fucking
thing that you think. </connor>
<joey> - But placebo's so interesting because, </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Ahh, so, </connor>
<connor> - it's like, it hasn't been like, </connor>
<connor> properly studied and the scientists reckon </connor>
<joey> and like a lot of psychologists
reckon there is like, </joey>
<joey> something legitimate there,
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - but we just dunno what it is. </connor>
<connor> - Because we don't, we don't
know what the fuck is happening </connor>
<connor> - Because it's like, we don't know </connor>
<connor> if it's actually a thing that works </connor>
<joey> or if it's just coincidence. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Like, </joey>
<joey> - What?
- [Ashley] Well, </joey>
<connor> the placebo effect is, that is, does work. </connor>
<connor> We just don't know how. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> We, we dunno how it, </garnt>
<garnt> - it's document, it's like the whole, </garnt>
<garnt> remember the life flashing
before you're eyes thing? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And how I was telling you guys recently </joey>
<joey> there was an article that
said they were scanning </joey>
<joey> someone's brain on a table,
which is collecting scans. </joey>
<joey> We didn't talk about this on podcasts. </joey>
<joey> We talked about in the
taxi, I remember this. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that's right. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I've gotta remember things. </joey>
<joey> I've got like a catalog of our
topics that we talked about. </joey>
<joey> Joey you mentioned the superstitious. </joey>
<joey> We'd mentioned that in the
episode before, I knew that, </joey>
<joey> but Joe didn't go on it for
too long, so I was like, </joey>
<joey> I won't say anything. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Anyway, the guy was getting
a scan, a brain scan, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- And you know, </joey>
<joey> he's having a regular scan, </joey>
<joey> brain checking what's
going on in the brain. </joey>
<joey> Oh well what's going on there. </joey>
<joey> And during this generic
scan that they were doing, </joey>
<joey> the guy died of a heart attack. </joey>
<joey> And whilst they were scanning
him, while he was dying, </joey>
<joey> I assume they tried to help him. </joey>
<joey> I assume they didn't just leave him, like, </joey>
<joey> "Now hold on, let's keep scanning. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, well this data's lit. </joey>
<joey> - Hold off, hold off, hold off, the data. </joey>
<joey> They did find out that
apparently right before he died, </joey>
<joey> it was the part of his brain
that was responsible for </joey>
<joey> memories was like firing like crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which would, although not proven, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's only one instance. </joey>
<joey> It would back up the theory that, </joey>
<joey> - [All] Your life
flashed before your eyes. </joey>
<joey> - Or least all these
memories start flashing. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is makes, </joey>
<joey> which is one of those things
where it's like, okay, </joey>
<joey> I guess that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause a lot of people have
said that it's happened </joey>
<joey> and although there's no
way to solidly prove it, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - but that's until then
it was not superstition. </joey>
<joey> - We only have, yeah, </joey>
<joey> we only have testimonies from people </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> who have been like near death experience. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Or like, you know, </joey>
<joey> - And then we have some
kind of not 100% proof, </joey>
<connor> but some evidence to indicate </connor>
<connor> that the theory holds more water. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's, </garnt>
<connor> - We kill need to kill more people. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Basically. </garnt>
<connor> - Like right before they, </connor>
<joey> just like plug 'em out and just be like, </joey>
<joey> quick get on the CAT Scan. </joey>
<connor> - Right, now edge more people, I think. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - We need more human experimentation. </garnt>
<joey> - You know, we need, </joey>
<joey> - Put an ultimate edge. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What's that fucking movie? </joey>
<connor> - Is like, edging of life. </connor>
<garnt> - What was that really shit movie </garnt>
<connor> where they literally edged their life. </connor>
<garnt> The whole, concept was, </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh that one was, </garnt>
<garnt> - "Flat lining?" </garnt>
<connor> - "Flat lining."
- "Flat lining." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fucking movie. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I never saw that one. </joey>
<joey> I, that just sounded
like a dumb horror movie, </joey>
<connor> - But no. like yeah, I mean like. </connor>
<connor> (moaning) </connor>
<connor> - I wake up and I just saw Jesus. </connor>

<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> Going back to like the
salt thing and just, </garnt>
<connor> - You're not, you're
not gonna let this go. </connor>
<connor> - No, because I, you just
like talking about it </connor>
<connor> just reminded me about the time </connor>
<garnt> where I kind of got an ulcer, I believe. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, like you you've had
a mouth ulcer before, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yes.
- So, how do you deal with it? </joey>
<joey> - I put like ulcer cream on it. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, what do, what if
you don't have ulcer cream? </garnt>
<garnt> Like what did, </garnt>
<garnt> - I just don't, try not to touch it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Toothpaste? </garnt>
<joey> - As much as I can.
- Toothpaste. </joey>
<joey> - Toothpaste.
- Toothpaste. </joey>
<joey> - I've heard toothpaste works. </joey>
<joey> - Is that a superstition? </joey>
<connor> - Again, could be bullshit,
could be bullshit. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay? So like as a kid,
my mom was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, just gargle salt water, or like, or. </garnt>
<connor> - I believe that does have some, </connor>
<joey> because saline you're making, </joey>
<connor> - If it's an inside the mouth, </connor>
<garnt> - You're making a saline solution. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- It was like, I would, well, </garnt>
<joey> - I would always either gargle
salt water or, or gargle a. </joey>
<garnt> - Die's nuts? </garnt>
<garnt> Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - Damn it, I was gonna say that. </joey>
<garnt> - Mouthwash, mouthwash, mouthwash. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry.
- All at once. </garnt>
<joey> - I was, I was legitimately
right about to say </joey>
<garnt> what you said that I was like, "Fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> - How do we go from salt
water to Die's nuts? </garnt>
<connor> - We have a million people
who watch this podcast. </connor>
<garnt> I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would either like gargle, </garnt>
<garnt> - We're a disgrace.
- salt water or mouthwash. </garnt>
<connor> And then one day my ulcer was like, </connor>
<joey> so bad that the salt water
wasn't doing anything, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- So like, as like a teenager, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, what if, instead
of just doing salt water, </joey>
<joey> which is basically just diluted salt, </joey>
<joey> what if I just go straight to the source </joey>
<joey> and just fucking pour salt on it, right? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And that, I swear to God,
that's, so that's what I did. </joey>
<joey> I just like got some like salts </joey>
<joey> and just poured it all
all over this ulcer. </joey>
<joey> And it fuckin', stang like
nobody's fuckin' business. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- It stang like, </joey>
<joey> it stang like fuckin' hell, </joey>
<joey> like burnt over in my mouth, </joey>
<joey> but then it kind of numbs the wound. </joey>
<joey> And I remember waking up the next day </joey>
<joey> and it was a lot less painful. </joey>
<joey> It started healing straight away. </joey>
<joey> Now, I dunno if there's
any science behind this, </joey>
<joey> I have Googled it. </joey>
<garnt> And I know like some other
people do it as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's no, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if there's any
back science behind it. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, after that
I started putting salt </garnt>
<garnt> on my ulcer whenever I get a mouth ulcer. </garnt>
<garnt> And it seemed to like, it
seemed to heal it faster. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure there is like, some
kind of science behind it, </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But like, </garnt>
<joey> I feel that's like, probably
the more extreme method </joey>
<joey> of fixing, like you basically
just napalmed your mouth. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah so,
- Could though, </garnt>
<joey> As the science says, you're
completely wrong, there. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> So I remember one day. </joey>
<joey> - It could also just
be a coincidence that. </joey>
<joey> - I remember one day that, yeah, </joey>
<joey> one day Connor had just
coming in the office </joey>
<joey> and complaining about a mouth ulcer. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I have
the perfect solution. </joey>
<joey> Just, </joey>
<joey> - Walks into the kitchen,
just comes back with salt, </joey>
<joey> - Just pour a bunch of salt on it. </joey>
<joey> It's it's easy, Connor. </joey>
<joey> I do it all the time, do it all the time. </joey>
<joey> I remember him coming in, </joey>
<joey> him coming in like the
next day or something. </joey>
<garnt> And he was like, "Garnt, why did you, </garnt>
<garnt> you literally just convinced
me to pour salt in a wound. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all you done. Didn't help any." </garnt>
<connor> - It didn't, I remember
it didn't help at all. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Really. </joey>
<joey> - It just like, </joey>
<joey> it stopped the pain for
like two hours in exchange </joey>
<joey> for like one burst of immense pain. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But like, </joey>
<joey> it didn't do anything. </joey>
<joey> - You basically just poured your own pain. </joey>
<joey> - I think that Garnt
would've healed naturally </joey>
<joey> without the salt. </joey>
<joey> And I think he just poured salt </joey>
<joey> and happens to remember
that it then went away </joey>
<joey> as ulcer do go away. </joey>
<joey> - Basically, just did
like ulcers hardcore. </joey>
<joey> - The problem with illnesses.
- It doesn't hurt enough. </joey>
<joey> - Illnesses that go away.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> obviously in very serious illnesses, </joey>
<joey> the pseudoscience is very harmful. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And very fucked up that people try </joey>
<joey> and sell solutions that
are like, you know, </joey>
<joey> they'll be like, "Just take our herbs and, </joey>
<joey> and your cancer will go away." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, that's fucked up.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You're even telling people that. </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - But the, I think the reason
why with generic illnesses, </joey>
<joey> so many superstitions come about </joey>
<joey> is because they go anyway on their own. </joey>
<joey> And if you are doing shit
and it happens to go away, </joey>
<connor> you're probably, your mind is, "Aha, </connor>
<connor> I was sick one time and then I, I, </connor>
<connor> I played with my poop for
20 minutes in my hands. </connor>
<connor> Like Play-Doe and it
went away the next day." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, well, no, that's, that, </connor>
<joey> - Now I've got three other illnesses. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> ( laughing) </connor>
<joey> I have, I have cholera,
but I did lose the flu. </joey>
<joey> So, you know, it's like,
you can do things, anything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Do it every single time you get sick </joey>
<joey> with a generic illness
that will go away anyway </joey>
<joey> after 48 hours.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then you'll remember
that you did that thing </joey>
<joey> and then it went away.
- [Joey} Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So this probably happened
with like the vitamin C. </joey>
<joey> You be maybe have a little
bit of placebo effect as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And then boom, </joey>
<joey> it goes away and you're like, </joey>
<joey> well it must be vitamin C </joey>
<joey> 'cause every time I take vitamin C, </joey>
<connor> my cold goes as if you did nothing, </connor>
<joey> your vitamin C wouldn't go away, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- but it's not how it works. </joey>
<connor> It would go away anyway. </connor>
<connor> - But I want to like,
an experiment of like, </connor>
<connor> especially with the vitamin C thing, </connor>
<joey> of like catch a cold one time, </joey>
<joey> do the vitamin C thing and then
catch a call the second time </joey>
<joey> and don't do the vitamin C thing. </joey>
<joey> Which one heals faster? </joey>
<joey> - You'd need to do this
like a hundred times </joey>
<connor> to get any data worth considering. </connor>
<joey> - Well, there's plenty
of sick people today. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But they're all different. </joey>
<connor> You'd need the same person over </connor>
<joey> and over it put their whole life. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - And even then, it wouldn't matter, </joey>
<connor> 'cause we could just like
view the immune system anyway, </connor>
<connor> with the things that we do, we. </connor>
<joey> - I dedicated my whole life to see. </joey>
<joey> If oranges work during the flu. </joey>
<connor> Turns out, we don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Science sucks, </connor>
<joey> 'Cause science is boring as fuck. </joey>
<joey> It takes a long time and
people don't like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Whenever.
- Unfortunately, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe we can make it. </connor>
<connor> - They want results now. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, yeah, maybe we can, </connor>
<connor> go to another planet in 200 years. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh shit, I'm not
gonna be around for that." </connor>
<connor> So what's the point? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Why do it? </connor>
<garnt> - That's the problem back back </garnt>
<garnt> to humans are just so incapable </garnt>
<garnt> of like, really caring about things </garnt>
<connor> that happen in like the
far future and like, </connor>
<connor> - Global warming.
- Yeah, global warming. </connor>
<connor> - The reason why we're so shit with it. </connor>
<joey> - It's not gonna affect me tomorrow. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, fuckin' whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> we've talked about
something similar before </garnt>
<garnt> where like talking about just imagining </garnt>
<garnt> five years in the future </garnt>
<garnt> or like where you're
going to be five years </garnt>
<garnt> or 10 years in the future, it's like, </garnt>
<joey> - Could you imagine what
2027 is gonna be like, no. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause everyone thought in 2012, </joey>
<joey> that 2022 is like, "Yeah,
flying colors, right?" </joey>
<garnt> - I couldn't imagine being
30 and here I am for 31, </garnt>
<joey> like how the fuck did
that happen, you know? </joey>
<joey> - You basically dead.
- I'm basically dead. </joey>
<connor> - I think same with that exercise, right. </connor>
<joey> Like I can't, I know
exercise is good for me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And I like it when I do it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I just can't, I can't visualize </joey>
<joey> the benefits to my life. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- That's the problem, right? </joey>
<joey> - That's why it's so hard to maintain. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's why it's
so hard to keep it up. </joey>
<joey> Even though I feel amazing when I do it, </joey>
<joey> I normally have so much
energy, I feel great. </joey>
<joey> I know, and I can feel the
immediate tangible benefits. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- But for some reason, </joey>
<joey> I just can't convince myself long term, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- that I can visualize that, </joey>
<joey> Hey, when I'm 70, maybe I'll
be a lot better off for it. </joey>
<connor> If I just put in the work now. </connor>
<joey> - Even, not even that,
it's just like, you know, </joey>
<connor> - 50, 60. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you could be
like working out, right. </connor>
<joey> And like a week later
you'd look down your body </joey>
<joey> and be like, why do I still
look exactly the same? </joey>
<connor> That yeah, that size as
well, dude, that hurts. </connor>
<joey> - Like it's, it blows.
- You get that pump on, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- you do it, you go hard. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, "Why? Why?" </joey>
<joey> But then you eat like
two weeks of McDonald's </joey>
<joey> and you're like, "Wow,
nothing changed, amazing." </joey>
<joey> Which you love it. </joey>
<joey> You love that nothing changes. </joey>
<joey> But then you get angry
when it doesn't change. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - We suck as humans. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what sucks, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that if you want to
gain weight fast or look, </garnt>
<joey> get ripped fast, you also
have to accept the fact </joey>
<joey> that maybe one binge drinking weekend, </joey>
<connor> may fuck your body to death. </connor>
<joey> - Speaking of human sucking,
I saw this recent thing. </joey>
<connor> - Okay.
- That. </connor>
<connor> - What a segue. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, because I looked
at this and I thought, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, human suck." </joey>
<connor> But there was an article that
came out not so long ago. </connor>
<connor> I'll just read the, </connor>
<connor> - By who? Who's the article first? </connor>
<connor> - There was a lot of different articles. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay.
- That came out </connor>
<connor> all over the place. </connor>
<connor> But I'll just read the
title of this article </connor>
<connor> 'cause it explains everything. </connor>
<connor> - Go for it. </connor>
<connor> - Lonely Apers has just
launched a dating app </connor>
<connor> for NFT collectors. </connor>
<joey> - A dating app.
- A dating app. </joey>
<joey> Somebody has developed a
dating app specifically, </joey>
<joey> for NFT bros to date NFT hoes. </joey>
<connor> - I don't, I think the
problem with this is is that, </connor>
<joey> - Everything.
- There is well, everything, </joey>
<joey> but let's now, let's I'm
gonna take a guess here. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay.
- What do you reckon </garnt>
<garnt> the demographic of
people who have NFTs are? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, okay.
(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, okay.
- Jojoesque dating app, </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna work.
- No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<joey> Let's let's look at this positively. </joey>
<joey> - Okay.
- Sure, okay. </joey>
<joey> - So what you are saying is </joey>
<joey> we are going to be removing people </joey>
<connor> with NFT profile pictures
from our dating pool. </connor>
<joey> - True, actually. </joey>
<joey> - I think, that's the a positive, right? </joey>
<garnt> Surely, surely. </garnt>
<joey> - But that means that we are just like, </joey>
<joey> forcing these kinds of
people to reproduce. </joey>
<joey> which is, </joey>
<joey> - Forcing, these people to reproduce. </joey>
<joey> - Are you saying people who like NFTs </joey>
<joey> should not be allowed to reproduce? </joey>
<joey> - No, I'm not saying that, but you know, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Is that what you're implying. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] No. </joey>
<connor> - Well it's okay though,
they go on the metaverse, </connor>
<connor> it's fine, let 'em have,
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Just like, but just like
reading through this article </joey>
<joey> just made me have like, several aneurysms. </joey>
<joey> "There is no need to enter or
display personal information. </joey>
<joey> Instead one can link their
crypto wallet to access the app. </joey>
<joey> Once logged in the user
can display their net worth </joey>
<joey> and NFT portfolio," </joey>
<joey> - It's awful.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - "You can also filter your matches </joey>
<joey> by their crypto currency
value and the NFT collection." </joey>
<garnt> - What.
- I, if I had a dollar </garnt>
<connor> for every time I saw an article about </connor>
<connor> something to do with NFTs that I despised. </connor>
<garnt> I wouldn't need to buy
anything ever again. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, why did the? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd probably own an NFT. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be rich enough to own an NFT. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd be very wealthy, I would be very, </joey>
<joey> they, I've not seen a single
good thing with an article. </joey>
<joey> It's never like, "NFT
owners pledge to stop," </joey>
<joey> - Global warming.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - "To save the world." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And it's like, no, </joey>
<joey> it's like NFT owners
pledge to have a yacht club </joey>
<connor> where they all wank each
other off or something. </connor>
<connor> That's all, it ever is. </connor>
<connor> It's like the, the NFT restaurant thing. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's are you just making a, </connor>
<connor> are you just trying to make
some kind of tangible effect, </connor>
<connor> that you own an NFT? </connor>
<connor> It's like, (growling) there's some reason, </connor>
<joey> there's some reason. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, so explain what
this restaurant is. </joey>
<connor> - You need to own an NFT
to go into the restaurant. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - That's it. </connor>
<garnt> - That's it.
- That's it. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, so, </connor>
<connor> - Do you just like, you
just go up to the bouncer </connor>
<joey> and you be like. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's getting to the point </garnt>
<joey> where it's just like classism
with extra steps now, </joey>
<joey> actually it's not even
any extra step, it's just, </joey>
<connor> - Well we've hated on
NFTs, like so many times </connor>
<connor> I just, yeah, it sucks, it sucks. </connor>
<joey> - It's yeah, I just, I
just saw that article </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, I
legitimately thought it was </joey>
<connor> an Onion article, at first. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah.
- 'Cause it sounds like one, </connor>
<joey> I realize, oh the sad
reality, that's a real thing. </joey>
<connor> - Even if they, you know,
they could turn around </connor>
<connor> and win people back onto and NFTs, </connor>
<connor> which I don't think they can. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] No,
- I just can't see </joey>
<joey> them winning the public
faith back in it again now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Since everyone has just seen
how much of a mess it's been. </joey>
<joey> I don't, you know, and whatever you think </joey>
<joey> about the technology or
whatever you think about </joey>
<joey> what it can be done with
it, you have to recognize </joey>
<joey> that the NFT like this kind of landscape </joey>
<garnt> that it had has become right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Is such a mess. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Rife with scams, fucked up shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- You know, money laundering. </garnt>
<garnt> Just every kind of awful
thing you can imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It has had such a bad public rep </garnt>
<garnt> that it would not only need </garnt>
<joey> to come up with something revolutionary, </joey>
<joey> that is actually good. </joey>
<joey> It would then have to
win people back over. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- By fixing its image, </joey>
<joey> which I don't think it can </joey>
<joey> 'cause the internet doesn't
want to make it more regulated. </joey>
<joey> Doesn't wanna make it more fair. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It also just seems, </joey>
<connor> - They like how free it is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it also just seems like </connor>
<joey> that community doesn't
really care about it either. </joey>
<joey> - No, they do, they do.
- [Joey] Do they? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause they push it
onto everyone and everything. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Well then, how come they're not, </joey>
<joey> trying to do anything
to better their image? </joey>
<connor> - They're not.
- And instead. </connor>
<joey> Making these fucking
dating apps in restaurants. </joey>
<joey> - It's a free for all right now. </joey>
<joey> Every company and every person
is trying to grab a part </joey>
<joey> of like the, it's a gold rush. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone wants that bit of it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- So the reason why </joey>
<joey> everyone is shoving it down, </joey>
<joey> everyone's throw, is 'cause
they have investments. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- They wanna make sure </joey>
<garnt> they don't lose the money. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay.
- Pass it onto the next sucker </garnt>
<connor> who comes in too late. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it's like, it's also so weird. </garnt>
<joey> Did you see the clip where it was like, </joey>
<joey> I think Jimmy Fallon? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like presenting his
NFT with Paris Hilton. </joey>
<connor> - like NFT?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Ahh.
- Of course, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. It's, </garnt>
<connor> - Is it a meme at least? </connor>
<garnt> Or is it like?
- No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> It is serious, okay. </connor>
<connor> So I believe it's Jimmy Fallon, </connor>
<connor> but they, Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton. </connor>
<connor> Well, Paris Hilton was on
the, "Jimmy Fallon Show" </connor>
<connor> and they started talking about NFTs </connor>
<connor> and how Paris Hilton
convinced Jimmy Fallon </connor>
<connor> to buy a, "Bored Ape NFT." </connor>
<connor> - What a nightmare scenario. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so, it was so
weird 'cause it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never seen a clip of two people </garnt>
<garnt> more out of touch with
like, the wider world. </garnt>
<garnt> So they like, so Jimmy finally brings out </garnt>
<garnt> his like Bored Ape, it's Bored Ape right? </garnt>
<joey> That's the name? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, a Bored Ape, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> He brings out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the monkey is, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Board Ape. </garnt>
<joey> - He brings out his Bored Ape NFT, right? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - He goes, "Isn't this
beautiful, look at this. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey giggling) </garnt>
<garnt> This is amazing." </garnt>
<garnt> And like you could hear
the audience clapping. </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen this image,
I thought it was a meme. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Really?
- No, no, no, it is real. </garnt>
<connor> - The image was put on
the picture to show it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and I've never
heard such a applause </connor>
<connor> where it was so obvious
that there was a big light </connor>
<garnt> saying, "Applause Please," </garnt>
<garnt> because you could tell
the audience had no idea </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck they were talking about. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Another massive problem </connor>
<connor> with the whole NFT landscape, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that it benefits the
people who have big platforms. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yes.
- Right. </connor>
<joey> If you have a big platform,
it's free money for you. </joey>
<joey> That's why people are doing this. </joey>
<joey> (coughing) </joey>
<joey> The moment something is advertised to you, </joey>
<joey> as you should buy it, </joey>
<joey> is the moment you it's too
late for you to make money. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You know, </joey>
<joey> the moment that consumers are
seeing big names promoting it, </joey>
<joey> it's too late to make money. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, some people might make money. </joey>
<joey> The majority of people
are not gonna make money. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - And the majority of
people are gonna lose money </joey>
<joey> and the people who get money
are people like Jimmy Fallon, </joey>
<joey> people like,
- People already rich. </joey>
<joey> - people who big influencers, </joey>
<joey> people who have the platform, the power. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- To push people </joey>
<joey> towards their investment. </joey>
<joey> It's a glorified pyramid
scheme in many ways. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's like, </joey>
<joey> how do you get your money by
getting more people into it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right? </joey>
<joey> It's, that's how it works. </joey>
<joey> And that's why you're
seeing, like when I anything </joey>
<joey> or mentioned in anything NFT, </joey>
<joey> doesn't matter what the comment is. </joey>
<joey> These, these verified NFT accounts, </joey>
<joey> like everything with the phrase NFT in it. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- They don't, </joey>
<joey> I could be saying NFT suck and
they can gargle on my nuts. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And someone </joey>
<joey> who supports NFT will like that comment </joey>
<joey> just because they've Googled
NFT and they like everything, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they're trying to get followers. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - They're trying to get engagement. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So then they can push
it more and have more, </joey>
<joey> a bigger sphere of influence. </joey>
<garnt> - What if they just like gargling on nuts. </garnt>
<garnt> - They might gargle, they probably do. </garnt>
<garnt> - They probably do.
- They probably do, if they, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Like, "Yes, please." </garnt>
<joey> - I hate it. I hate it so much. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause, it's so obviously a scam, </joey>
<joey> like the moment that you
are being advertised to </joey>
<joey> about buying an investment is the moment </joey>
<joey> that you've already, you can't make money. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, and I think </connor>
<connor> that's what's so fuckin'
disappointing, as well. </connor>
<joey> Especially with, you know, as you said, </joey>
<joey> like big influencers, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like getting in on it,
like, you know, when I, </joey>
<joey> when I saw that like
"M and M" bought like, </joey>
<garnt> an NFT of just what looks
like a monkey version </garnt>
<garnt> of himself, I was like,
why would you do that? </garnt>
<joey> - Because, </joey>
<connor> - Very has my childhood died so quickly. </connor>
<garnt> - The moment you have a
big sphere of influence, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just free money. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And in their eyes, </joey>
<joey> it's low risk public image
because you are not asking your, </joey>
<joey> you don't have to, </joey>
<joey> it's not like you're bagging
your followers for money, </joey>
<joey> but what you're doing is making them pay </joey>
<connor> for something that makes
your thing more valuable. </connor>
<joey> - It's heavy incentivizing. </joey>
<connor> - Right, and you can claim just that you, </connor>
<joey> it was just an investment. </joey>
<joey> It's like buying a stock. </joey>
<joey> It's like, no it's not. </joey>
<joey> - It's like buying a house. </joey>
<joey> - It's not like buying a stock. </joey>
<joey> It's different, right. </joey>
<joey> There's rules around buying stock. </joey>
<joey> For reasons, right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Even though sometimes
the rules are a bit fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Still.
- Yeah. I mean, I. </garnt>
<garnt> - Feel very passionately about this </garnt>
<connor> and I hate the system so much. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I'm like the only thing </garnt>
<garnt> I have to add to this is like, </garnt>
<garnt> do you think this negative
image is purely, you know, </garnt>
<joey> is purely based on like the Western circle </joey>
<joey> and just like our
perception of the internet? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, definitely, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because like I've heard like
of the like NFTs have a very, </joey>
<joey> very different perception in
like the Japanese circles, </joey>
<joey> and, you know, the Japanese, </joey>
<joey> especially the art communities as well. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they see it as,
from what I've read, </joey>
<joey> at least they've, they have
a much more positive view </joey>
<joey> of NFTs and they see it
as like an opportunity </joey>
<joey> to of course give, you
know, ownership to artists </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that, which is a lot, </joey>
<garnt> you know, given the
cultures, I understand why, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe Japanese people
would be more accepting </garnt>
<garnt> of this idea because it's
like for Japanese people </garnt>
<garnt> and Japanese artists, it's a
lot bigger problem than it is. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm, I'm all for giving
rights to artists and whatnot. </joey>
<garnt> But you know, </garnt>
<joey> I feel there are other ways
that you can do it if the </joey>
<garnt> systems were, you know, </garnt>
<joey> probably implemented, not to
mention that in Japan like, </joey>
<joey> you know, the whole copyright laws </joey>
<joey> in Japan especially are just like </joey>
<joey> on the next level of outdated. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right?
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - Like it's so like I think
if anything, the reason why, </joey>
<garnt> - Of course Japanese are gonna, </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, of course the Japanese
are gonna look at NFTs </connor>
<connor> and think like, oh, this is perfect. </connor>
<garnt> Like this,
- Perfect. </garnt>
<joey> - this gets around everything
that we've believed in </joey>
<joey> and done in like a really cool way </joey>
<joey> that supports artists like. </joey>
<garnt> - Like more ways to copyright, shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Fuck yeah, bring it in. </joey>
<connor> bring it in </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, please. </garnt>
<connor> - That requires the good faith </connor>
<joey> of all parties involved though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like everyone has to
be using it correctly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the problem is, is that, </joey>
<joey> - They're not. </joey>
<joey> - In English, were definitely
not at least, you know, </joey>
<joey> and there is, there are
some very valid reasons </joey>
<joey> to own NFTs or Bitcoin </joey>
<joey> or any of these currencies, right? </joey>
<joey> Like if you live in a, if you are a, </joey>
<joey> like a Russian person right
now and all your money was in </joey>
<joey> the Ruple, yeah, you're fucked. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Like your money's gone. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You don't, you don't
own much money anymore. </joey>
<joey> If you had that all on a Bitcoin wallet. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, you'd still be very wealthy, right? </joey>
<joey> So that makes more,
that, in those scenarios, </joey>
<joey> it makes a lot of sense. </joey>
<joey> The problem is it's kind of replicated </joey>
<joey> what the fine art world was before </joey>
<joey> to like the big private investors, right? </joey>
<joey> It was basically fine art, it was the, </joey>
<joey> this glorified money laundering, </joey>
<joey> - Money laundering. </joey>
<joey> - And money transactioning thing, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And now in the West,
people figured out, "Huh, </joey>
<joey> you can make a lot of money </joey>
<joey> and money that you can hide very easily." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - By doing this NFT shit. </joey>
<joey> And so, it's kind of turned into </joey>
<joey> more of a democratized, fine art, shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For people, right? </joey>
<joey> Like the whole, you ever
watched like, "Tenant," </joey>
<joey> did you watch, "Tenant?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I watched, "Tenant." </joey>
<joey> - You know, like the art that
was held in the airports. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it couldn't be taxed. </connor>
<connor> That's actually a real thing. </connor>
<garnt> - I know that's a real thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Was that a major part of, "Tenant?" </garnt>
<connor> - That was a big plot
point in, "Tenant" is where </connor>
<connor> they steal the artwork </connor>
<connor> and all the valuable stuff </connor>
<connor> from the airport holding, </connor>
<connor> the tax haven in the airport. </connor>
<joey> - Clearly this movie really
made an impression on Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> - I just remember things going backwards. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Like it's, like things looking cool. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like the first time
in like media that I can recall </connor>
<joey> that has like told people
that these things exist. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - People didn't know these existed before, </connor>
<connor> you know, it just, </connor>
<garnt> - Was that an massive part of, "Tenant?" </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I would've remembered that. </garnt>
<garnt> Which scene was this in? </garnt>
<garnt> Was this in the first scene? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't remember them ever. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't fucking know
the full fucking playlist </connor>
<joey> of, "Tenant." </joey>
<joey> I dunno what fucking happened. </joey>
<joey> - I just like. </joey>
<connor> - They had a big, </connor>
<connor> there was a big plot point
about them doing a heist </connor>
<connor> in the first half of the movie. </connor>
<connor> - Was there?
- Oh my fuckin', </connor>
<joey> - The only thing I know is that the, </joey>
<joey> - 31s been run, </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He's basically dead.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - When he dies, like his life
doesn't flash before his eyes, </connor>
<garnt> just, "Tenant" the movies. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember them being in an airport, </joey>
<garnt> but I don't remember
them, pulling in a heist. </garnt>
<connor> - Why were they in the airport, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> Why they were in an airport? </connor>
<garnt> Why they were in the airport? </garnt>
<joey> - I remember them being an airport. </joey>
<connor> - That is a good question. </connor>
<connor> Maybe they were getting
a flight or something. </connor>
<connor> No, they were investigating
the, they were, </connor>
<connor> this is a complete
fuckin' tangent right now, </connor>
<connor> 'cause we going into, </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - they were investigating
the phenomenon, right? </connor>
<connor> That you know, </connor>
<garnt> the phenomena where time
moves backwards or something. </garnt>
<garnt> That's that's all I remembered-ish. </garnt>
<connor> - I can remember they're
stealing something, </connor>
<garnt> that was in holding. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I thought, </joey>
<garnt> - And in the holding places, </garnt>
<garnt> they normally have art because
you can't basically buy </garnt>
<garnt> and sell in this area because it doesn't, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - it's not under any
jurisdiction for the taxpayer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right. </garnt>
<connor> - So you can.
- No, I remember there being, </connor>
<connor> I remember being paintings there. </connor>
<connor> I just don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I just don't remember that being like </garnt>
<garnt> a massive part of the
plot point, but I over, </garnt>
<connor> - It was like, I brought it up </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was like the first
time it had been addressed </connor>
<joey> or brought up in like prominent media. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, well, </joey>
<garnt> - This is, these things exist. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah well, they've
existed for like a very, </garnt>
<garnt> very long time and it's
not just like fine arts, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, it's not just paintings, </garnt>
<garnt> any valuable thing, like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Stuff in the British museum. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's only the place
where they come from, </garnt>
<garnt> you know like the point was is </garnt>
<garnt> that it's, I just think with the way </garnt>
<joey> that NFTs are structured
right now, it's just, this is, </joey>
<joey> this was obviously gonna happen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was, it's just been rife with scams. </joey>
<joey> Like half this shit is awful. </joey>
<joey> Like yeah, there's some legitimate uses. </joey>
<joey> The technology seems somewhat
promising, right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Fact that it uses more
than like, most countries, </joey>
<joey> the entire like Bitcoin network
uses more electric teeth </joey>
<joey> than countries. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Is very concerning. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yes. </joey>
<joey> - And that there are more, you know, </joey>
<joey> they're making new coins, </joey>
<joey> they're making new ways </joey>
<joey> that are much more efficient than stuff. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, we get it. </joey>
<joey> But it's not there right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's not doing that right now. </joey>
<joey> It's not working right now in a way </joey>
<joey> that works for the world. </joey>
<joey> - Do you think it would ever work out? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it definitely will at some point. </joey>
<joey> Obviously the idea of having a way </joey>
<joey> that you can 100% own something </joey>
<joey> digitally is going to be very
convenient at some point. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It, the way you said yes, like, "Yeah." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But right now it just doesn't, </garnt>
<connor> the way that it's being
used is like a joke. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, I mean like it's weird to, </garnt>
<garnt> seeing how fast they just came from, </garnt>
<garnt> like basically nowhere to
everyone talking about them. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, crypto, I, </garnt>
<joey> - Well because, it has
been just been so, like, </joey>
<garnt> it's just been shoved
down everyone's throat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every celebrity is jumping on it. </garnt>
<joey> - It was literally, yeah, </joey>
<joey> it was literally last year, </joey>
<garnt> where I had not heard of the word </garnt>
<joey> NFT till like May or April </joey>
<joey> and then I couldn't stop hearing it. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I remember being, </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I only found
out what it was like </joey>
<joey> a couple months ago. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] On the fucking podcast. </garnt>
<joey> - On the podcast, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm so envious of you, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I think I just like,
yeah, I just avoided all that. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't follow anyone who is in that. </joey>
<garnt> - And now there's the
metaverse that's coming along, </garnt>
<garnt> which is just like, what? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, have you seen that
these companies are buying like </connor>
<joey> space in like the metaverse. </joey>
<joey> They're buying like plots
of land in the metaverse. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I've seen that, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So they're buying,
- What do you think of that? </joey>
<joey> What do you think of that? </joey>
<joey> - They're buying digital land. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, that's like, I mean,
I feel like it is just, </joey>
<joey> That's some sci-fi territory. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like the past year
has opened up basically </garnt>
<garnt> the age of like the digital gold rush. </garnt>
<connor> - Is this what it must
have felt like to see like </connor>
<garnt> the .com bubble. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<connor> - I think so.
- I think so. </connor>
<garnt> That's that's that's must have
been what it felt like where </garnt>
<connor> you see millions of fucking
dollars being invested in, </connor>
<connor> - Like the dumbest shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> In like fucking kittens.com </connor>
<joey> or something like, I don't fuckin' know. </joey>
<joey> - Dude. </joey>
<garnt> - And now kittens.com is worth millions. </garnt>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know if this is true, </connor>
<connor> but you're in the metaverse right? </connor>
<connor> They don't have legs. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen that? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] No. </joey>
<connor> - They don't have, they only
have like torsos, upper body. </connor>
<joey> - So, this is very much
similar with me with NFTs. </joey>
<joey> I know nothing about the metaverse. </joey>
<joey> - So, do you know why. </joey>
<garnt> - Sold off, online by Facebook? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's all I know. Do. </garnt>
<garnt> - You do you wanna take a guess? </garnt>
<connor> Why they only have torsos in this world? </connor>
<joey> - Why. </joey>
<joey> - Is it for people who
perhaps are in wheelchairs </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that, or? </joey>
<connor> - That's a very noble thought, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Unfortunately it's not, </joey>
<joey> - Maybe inclusive of everyone. </joey>
<joey> - Can you fetch it, Ashley? </joey>
<joey> But to my understanding, </joey>
<joey> it was to stop people like, </joey>
<joey> doing like, implying sexual acts </joey>
<joey> and stuff and doing things. </joey>
<joey> From what I understand, </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- Are you serious? </joey>
<connor> - from what I understand,
that is the reason why. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it is like, </connor>
<connor> I read somewhere that like, </connor>
<connor> foot fetishes are like, </connor>
<joey> I think the most common
fetish in like the world. </joey>
<connor> - What's it got to do with Facebook? </connor>
<connor> - Well no, because the legs. </connor>
<joey> - Because of the legs. </joey>
<joey> - But, it's like digital feet. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Ooh, ooh, those (indistinct)." </joey>
<connor> I was like, where you
going with this point? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's the weirdest tangent. </connor>
<connor> - Well no, I </connor>
<connor> - Joey just wants to
talk about foot fetishes. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, I was just like, </connor>
<garnt> trying to back up your point. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Mark Zuckerberg, </garnt>
<joey> scared of Quinton Tarantino </joey>
<joey> or getting in the metaverse or something. </joey>
<connor> - I was trying to back up your point and </connor>
<connor> you guys made me out,
like I'm fuckin' weird. </connor>
<connor> Like he's in to digital feet. </connor>
<connor> - Joey's like, "Mmm,
them Sims feet though." </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Delicious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why didn't they just
delete the feet then? </garnt>
<connor> If that's, just have no one, </connor>
<connor> - Stop.
- No one has feet </connor>
<joey> - Everyone's a stub. </joey>
<garnt> Everyone just looks like Kirby, </garnt>
<joey> you know, just stubs and knobs. </joey>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Apparently,
it's a technical issue. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the cameras can't
capture the whole body. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bullshit. </garnt>
<connor> - It's, I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> - Is anything questioned
about sexual stuff? </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] I haven't found it. </garnt>
<joey> - Can you Google sexual, Mark Zuckerberg, </joey>
<joey> metaverse, no legs, sex. </joey>
<garnt> - Fetish, fetish, Mark
Zuckerberg, metaverse, </garnt>
<garnt> foot fetish. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Also you can. </joey>
<joey> - What, sorry. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Turn off face search. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's on </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] It's already off. </joey>
<joey> - So I apparently as well, there's like a, </joey>
<joey> you have like your own bubble, </joey>
<joey> people can't come into your space. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - But to me it's weird, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I dunno if I'm just like stupid, </joey>
<connor> but it just looks like really shit VRChat. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I saw. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, so is this like a game </joey>
<joey> that Facebook is developing? </joey>
<garnt> Or like. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just looks like
VRChat, but just less fun. </garnt>
<garnt> And. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like VRChat has really good games in it. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you seen this? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No.
- [Garnt] No. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] There's like games
in VRChat and it's nuts. </joey>
<joey> I was playing Super
Monkey Ball the other day. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh wow. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] In VRChat. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] In VRChat. </joey>
<joey> - How were you not sick? </joey>
<joey> - I know, I'm gonna say,
and there was also like, </joey>
<joey> - I get sick playing regular. </joey>
<joey> - Like a Tron game where you throw discs </joey>
<garnt> and they bounce around. </garnt>
<garnt> You gotta Dodge it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] That's pretty cool. </garnt>
<connor> - Try to hit the other person. </connor>
<garnt> - That just seems like
a VR game in a VR game. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so it is, and there's like, </connor>
<connor> there's a whole cooking game. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - In a VR game and it's like free. </connor>
<connor> It's like, why the fuck
would any one party? </connor>
<garnt> - How does VRChat work? </garnt>
<garnt> I never, 'cause I've never
played VRChat, but is it, </garnt>
<connor> like kind of like an
open source kind of thing </connor>
<connor> where people can?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where everyone creates?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Their own games,
- Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - their own spaces and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all user generated. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay.
- And that's why it's so good. </joey>
<joey> - It's like MineCraft. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause you'll be in
a lobby and yeah, does it, </joey>
<joey> is it annoying that you get in a lobby </joey>
<joey> and there's like 10 year olds screaming? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that's annoying. </joey>
<joey> And think mark Zuckerberg
is trying to address </joey>
<joey> that by making it like age
only, like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> over a certain age allowed to join. </joey>
<joey> - Right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure people get the, </joey>
<joey> - It's still really good. </joey>
<connor> Like it's genuinely good, like I like it. </connor>
<joey> - So, okay, so going back to the whole, </joey>
<garnt> like buying digital plots of land on meta. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, like how does that work? </garnt>
<joey> Like what?
- I tend, </joey>
<joey> - It's more the question of why? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, if you own,
- Advertising </garnt>
<connor> - digital land, it's like the
metaverse is being marketed </connor>
<connor> as this place that is
kind of like, just a new </connor>
<joey> virtual reality world that
everyone's going to go to. </joey>
<joey> Right?
- [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So you can literally live
like a second life or even like, </joey>
<joey> you know, your online media
life in this virtual place, </joey>
<joey> that's called the metaverse. </joey>
<joey> So what are companies doing? </joey>
<garnt> They literally buying plots
of land in this virtual land </garnt>
<garnt> for treating it like
they're buying real lands </garnt>
<garnt> that exists in the real world. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, this is just lame. </garnt>
<garnt> This is legitimately just lame. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] It is, it is.
- It's scary. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] You want hear like, </joey>
<joey> the most depressing thing ever, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Please.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - Investors are playing, </joey>
<joey> paying millions for virtual
land in the metaverse. </joey>
<joey> And apparently a company
recently dropped $2.5 million </joey>
<connor> on a patch of land in Decentral land. </connor>
<connor> One of the most popular metaverse worlds. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - and the prices have gone up 400 to 500% </connor>
<connor> in the past few months. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, how much land are we talking? </joey>
<connor> Like how many digital square
meters are we talking? </connor>
<connor> - I don't fully understand it. </connor>
<connor> Another person spent 4.3 million </connor>
<connor> on a parcel of virtual land. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - I, oh my God, I, </connor>
<joey> - Is this what happens when
you just have too much money? </joey>
<connor> - Yes.
- I think this is what, </connor>
<connor> I think what's happening
is that a lot of companies </connor>
<joey> with a lot of money are like, </joey>
<joey> let's just throw something into it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, your right. </joey>
<joey> - If it fails, doesn't matter </joey>
<joey> if it goes up tenfold big money. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's what's going on. </joey>
<joey> And I think people in companies
are hearing whispers of it. </joey>
<joey> And I think I also, </joey>
<joey> I imagine as well that
Facebook is doing a really </joey>
<joey> good job at convincing these companies, </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That, that this is gonna be a big deal. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sure. </joey>
<joey> - When I feel like anyone
who is in the tech space, </joey>
<joey> looks at metaverse and is like, </joey>
<joey> "I just don't see how
this can become a thing, </joey>
<joey> that's like good." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause how the fuck are
you gonna convince everyone </connor>
<connor> to get a virtual headset? </connor>
<connor> Do you know how annoying they are to? </connor>
<connor> I love my tech </connor>
<connor> and I gotta admit virtual
reality headsets are a pain </connor>
<connor> in the fucking ass.. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - Well, it comes with the assumption </joey>
<joey> that virtual reality headsets </joey>
<joey> will be at one point more streamlined </joey>
<connor> than they already are, </connor>
<connor> which they really, really need to be. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like the barrier of entry </connor>
<connor> for our virtual headset is like fuckin', </connor>
<connor> - Oculus System has done great, obviously. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is Facebook. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And that is probably </garnt>
<garnt> the most user friendly headset. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's still like, it's not perfect. </joey>
<joey> - Not perfect, no, not at all. </joey>
<joey> - You like you don't
wanna have a business, </joey>
<joey> I do not wanna have a business meeting </joey>
<joey> with a fucking headset on. </joey>
<joey> - It's like honey, where's my headset? </joey>
<joey> Need to get into a business meeting. </joey>
<joey> - One of the main pictures
of like the metaverse </joey>
<joey> like you could have a
meeting with your coworkers. </joey>
<connor> Have you had a virtual reality headset on </connor>
<connor> for more than two hours? </connor>
<connor> - No.
- It is, </connor>
<connor> I have.
- I have. </connor>
<garnt> - It's awful.
- It's, you get sweaty. </garnt>
<garnt> It's bulky. </garnt>
<garnt> - The only reason why
I haven't done a stream </garnt>
<joey> on my Oculus is because
I can't wear that thing </joey>
<joey> for more than 20 minutes
without feeling sick. </joey>
<joey> - That's also another, </joey>
<joey> - It also depends on the game, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because I remember like, </joey>
<joey> I remember hearing about these rumors </joey>
<joey> that people get motion
sickness from where headsets. </joey>
<joey> And I, </joey>
<joey> - Superstitions.
- Superstitions, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like,
- It's bullshit, </joey>
<connor> you're not sick. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, they
must just be weak minded. </connor>
<connor> I ain't like that. </connor>
<connor> And I remember like the first
time I got like my Vow Vindex, </connor>
<joey> one of the first games I bought
was like Pavlov, I think. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Or it was like the, it's like the, </joey>
<connor> basically a virtual reality CSGO. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Okay.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I remember walking
in that for like 10 seconds </connor>
<connor> and I just got immediate
fuckin' motion sickliss </connor>
<connor> Like, my brain searched through like my, </connor>
<connor> the entire history of humanity </connor>
<connor> to like see if there was any </connor>
<connor> kind of experience that could like, </connor>
<connor> help regulate what I was going through. </connor>
<connor> And it was just like, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Nope, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what's going on right now. </connor>
<joey> You're just gonna, you're just
gonna feel sick right now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] You're sick. </joey>
<garnt> Like the thing is, I get motion sickness, </garnt>
<joey> even if it's like not a very like, </joey>
<joey> movement intensive game. </joey>
<joey> Like I get sick after like
20 minutes of Beat Saber. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] No. </connor>
<joey> - And like you're not
even moving in that game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm, I'm totally fine on
the Motion sickness part. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I've only had one game </joey>
<joey> that's given me motion sickness. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or like, not even emotion, </joey>
<joey> like make me feel like, "Ooh." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] yeah, </joey>
<garnt> - It was like this ninja
game, Santiro or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And like, you jump around. </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty sick. </garnt>
<joey> But like you act, you jump in the air. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Really fucking high. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You can change direction in the air </joey>
<joey> again in any direction. </joey>
<joey> - Oh.
- So you can imagine, </joey>
<joey> it's like jump up, fly
back and it's, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm getting sick, just hearing it. </joey>
<joey> - But, it's good, but I, </joey>
<joey> the thing that I have difficulty with </joey>
<joey> is these headsets are not light. </joey>
<joey> - They are, </joey>
<joey> - They are uncomfortable to wear. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] They're bulky, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The index, I love the index. </garnt>
<garnt> Amazing quality. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gray piece of hardware. </garnt>
<connor> - It is heavy, and also
the wires can suck my dick. </connor>
<connor> I hate the wires. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - What I like about the
Oculus, there's no wires. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like the thing is
that I can't play a virtual </garnt>
<garnt> or I haven't been able to
play a virtual reality game </garnt>
<garnt> more than a few hours before either like, </garnt>
<garnt> my head gets tired or I
just want to chill out. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just wanna like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like I start sweating
a lot because you're wearing, </garnt>
<garnt> - I sweat a lot as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, you, you start like, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like you're basically
wearing a sink on your head. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
- You're, you are. </garnt>
<connor> - That's that's basically
what it is, right? </connor>
<connor> - Pretty much, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like an entire bottle of this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Traps the heat. </connor>
<connor> - It's just uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> It's it's not comfortable at all. </connor>
<connor> And like, I don't think, </connor>
<connor> I dunno if this is just
like boomer me talking, </connor>
<garnt> but I can't see it being a real substitute </garnt>
<garnt> for just face to face interactions, </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- to me at least </joey>
<garnt> - Never, no it won't. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean like, you know, again, </garnt>
<joey> like in order for the metaverse
thing to really pop off, </joey>
<connor> it needs to be like, VR headsets
need to be common enough </connor>
<connor> in every household as much as like say, </connor>
<connor> a computer is today, right? </connor>
<connor> And I just don't see it
happening for a while. </connor>
<connor> - The Oculus isn't, it isn't quite there. </connor>
<joey> And it's also expensive. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It is.
- You strap on these, </joey>
<joey> I think the Oculus is 300 bucks retail. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, that's steep
for a lot of people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, you know, if you look </garnt>
<joey> at the progress we've made in the past, </joey>
<joey> what 10 years, when did
the HTC Vive come out? </joey>
<joey> That was the first big one, wasn't it? </joey>
<joey> the first big deal? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- When was that? </joey>
<joey> When did the HTC Vive
get released, Ashley? </joey>
<joey> Can you have a look?
- [Ashley] HTC what? </joey>
<garnt> - Vive.
- HTC Vive. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought it was the Oculus
Rift was the first like, </joey>
<garnt> real big one. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the first one I heard about. </garnt>
<connor> - Was that like the one
that was with steam? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, that was, that was. </garnt>
<connor> - When did the Oculus Rift then come out. </connor>
<connor> - That was like the, </connor>
<connor> the OG Oculus Rift that was before, </connor>
<connor> - Facebook bought them, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Facebook bought them out. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] The Steam Vive
was unveiled in March, 2015. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, what about the Oculus Rift. </connor>
<joey> - Oculus Rift?
- The original or yeah, </joey>
<connor> the original OK. </connor>
<connor> - The original Oculus Rift was the one </connor>
<connor> with the rollercoaster sim. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I thought the HTC Vive was
the first time VR headsets </connor>
<joey> became like, somewhat viable. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, like a thing? </joey>
<connor> - Like to play games like, seriously. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Oculus was March, 2016. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> - So, the Vive came out before. </joey>
<joey> - The Vive was the, I dunno, </joey>
<joey> I could be totally wrong. </joey>
<joey> I don't you could Google
what the first VR headset is. </joey>
<joey> I think it's fair to say at least, </joey>
<joey> to my memory at least </joey>
<garnt> that I think the HTC Vive
was the first headset </garnt>
<garnt> that came out that like made gaming </garnt>
<garnt> seem like it made sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - On a, it wasn't just a gimmick. </garnt>
<garnt> it was like, you could
actually play games. </garnt>
<garnt> Like SuperHot was amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> Some of the demos are really good. </garnt>
<garnt> And there were games coming out here </garnt>
<garnt> and there that were, that
were pretty good as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Now, I, you know, </connor>
<connor> I think we thought there
was gonna be a big boom, </connor>
<connor> but it, there really hasn't been, </connor>
<connor> - It's just, </connor>
<garnt> - That many games in the past seven years. </garnt>
<connor> It's just because the money
isn't there right now, </connor>
<joey> because it's so hard. </joey>
<joey> There's so many barriers of entry </joey>
<joey> for buying like a VR game. </joey>
<joey> So like the only big game I
can think of is Half-life. </joey>
<joey> That's the only like, game where
I look at this VR game and, </joey>
<joey> - It make sense. </joey>
<joey> - and it's like stands
up as like a game game. </joey>
<joey> You know, it's like a lot
of games that I play on VR. </joey>
<joey> It seems like a tech demo with like, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - it seems like a glorified tech demo, </connor>
<connor> but like Half-life
actually feels like a game. </connor>
<connor> And that's because, you know,
Valve, like invested in it. </connor>
<connor> And I don't even like, </connor>
<connor> I can't believe they
made profit on it at all. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Like, because </connor>
<connor> I feel like that was more of
just them flexing to be like, </connor>
<connor> guys, we still make game. </connor>
<connor> Remember, remember, remember? </connor>
<connor> We made games. </connor>
<connor> We were fucking, we were a fucking amazing </connor>
<connor> game developer back in the day. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Well I play,
- We can still do it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- We can still do, baby. </garnt>
<garnt> - We still got it, baby. </garnt>
<garnt> - I played a lot of games on the VR </garnt>
<joey> and Superhot is still
probably the best one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Superhot is the best one.. </joey>
<joey> - That's the game that I get </joey>
<joey> when people come to my house and </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, you wanna wanna try, VR? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Super hot is the game </garnt>
<garnt> that, I'm yeah, try this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it's so good.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - It's Superhot and Beat Saber, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - which is the best VR
experience, I've probably had </connor>
<connor> - Yes, same here. </connor>
<garnt> - So far. </garnt>
<connor> - It's, I understand 'cause
like, setting up the Valve Index </connor>
<joey> is like, it's the best headset, right? </joey>
<joey> If you want performance and gaming. </joey>
<garnt> But, my God.. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - The cable, </garnt>
<joey> - It is a fucking commitment, </joey>
<joey> - I think, </joey>
<joey> - to set that thing up. </joey>
<garnt> And you nee a space big enough. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is another reason why it like, </garnt>
<connor> in Japan is like not popular at all. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think my problem with VR gaming </garnt>
<garnt> that I've had so far is </garnt>
<garnt> that it turns gaming for like, for me, </garnt>
<garnt> gaming is like a passive activity. </garnt>
<joey> - Mm.
- [Joey] Mm. </joey>
<joey> - But VR gaming is
definitely an active activity </joey>
<joey> for me, where I, you know,
you feel physically involved. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't feel passive, </joey>
<joey> - I do like that, though. </joey>
<joey> - I do like that as well. </joey>
<joey> But like the, you know, </joey>
<joey> when you have like a fucking eight hour, </joey>
<joey> 10 hour gaming session, </joey>
<joey> I don't want to, that that's like, </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I there's only so long I can have, </connor>
<connor> I can do something active. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- For that period of time. </connor>
<connor> Like to me, a lot of games
are a passive activity </connor>
<garnt> where you sit down on the couch </garnt>
<garnt> or sit at your PC, you
just like chill there. </garnt>
<joey> And you just. </joey>
<joey> - I think it also depends on like, </joey>
<joey> the demographic as well, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, 'cause I'm sure like, you know, </joey>
<connor> the average 10 year old has
a lot more fuckin' energy </connor>
<connor> to move around for eight to 10 hours. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Well, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Versus like, you know, </connor>
<joey> someone who's in like their 40s. </joey>
<joey> - When I played a Gorilla Tag. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, on, VR? </joey>
<joey> - On VR, just all like 10 year olds. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It was all 10 year olds. </connor>
<connor> - Well like, you know, I
think back to like when I was, </connor>
<connor> I think back to when I
was 10 and the fuckin', </connor>
<joey> you remember the EyeToy? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, my God.
- The camera. </joey>
<joey> - For PS2.
- For PS2. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like when that shit came out </joey>
<connor> and you had to like
physically move around and, </connor>
<connor> like you know that like as a 10 year old, </connor>
<connor> that's like, fuck yeah, I
could do this for hours. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, </joey>
<joey> - If you got me an EyeToy
now probably be like an hour </joey>
<joey> and a half and I'm done. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but that to me, that
was always like a gimmick, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, like that
one time you go to like </garnt>
<garnt> your cousin's house and
they pull out the DDR mat </garnt>
<connor> and you're like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> We're having a DDR night. </connor>
<connor> - Pull out the virtual boy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the shit mat
that like barely registered. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You got a fuckin' stamp on like, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah yeah.
- You got pieces of foam. </connor>
<garnt> - And they were like break
after like one use or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a shame. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I think that like VR
gaming is some of the most fun </connor>
<joey> and rewarding gaming out
there when it's done right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is. </joey>
<joey> - Problem is there's no incentive </joey>
<joey> for people to develop games for it. </joey>
<joey> Like it's hard.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And also it's like, you know
when you're a kid and you, </joey>
<joey> I dunno if you've ever had them, </joey>
<joey> I dunno what they're called in Australia. </joey>
<joey> But in the UK, the brand
calls like scale electrics. </joey>
<joey> It's like the, you know, those cars, </joey>
<joey> you have to lay out that track. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And then you have the. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, hot wheels. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe hot wheels,
- Kind of like hot wheels. </joey>
<joey> - You lay out the track </joey>
<joey> and then you have those things that </joey>
<joey> like, you turn the buttons </joey>
<joey> and they go sroom, around the the fuckin' </joey>
<connor> what are they called in? What's
the generic name for them? </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] I think you're right. </connor>
<connor> - Scale electrics on
like the fuckin' scales. </connor>
<connor> - I always thought scale
electrics was a brand </connor>
<connor> like Hot Wheels. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I think it was a brand. </connor>
<garnt> I'm trying to know whether the, </garnt>
<joey> - I only really play with Hot Wheels. </joey>
<connor> - Oh I, what was your point? </connor>
<joey> - It's like that. </joey>
<joey> That's what VR feels like right now. </joey>
<joey> And it needs to get to the point where, </joey>
<garnt> current gaming is, where it feels like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, you put on the headset
and you're good to go. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- Right now it's like, </joey>
<garnt> I have to turn on the two base stations. </garnt>
<garnt> I have to make sure all
the cables are plugged in. </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I gotta install this update. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh the tracking's off. </garnt>
<joey> I gotta fix the tracking." </joey>
<joey> It's like, it's such a, </joey>
<joey> it's like going back to that feeling </joey>
<joey> as a kid where you set up
that track, you set it all up. </joey>
<joey> Just for that like 30
minutes of enjoyment. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then you gotta
put it all away again. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like until it gets to the point </joey>
<joey> where it doesn't feel
like a slog to set up. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's not that it's active. </joey>
<joey> I think it's like a pain in the ass </joey>
<joey> to set up, and I,
- Oh, it is. </joey>
<joey> - I've got mine set up now to the point </joey>
<joey> where it's as painless as possible </joey>
<joey> and it's still a pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like I five minutes of
me turning everything on </joey>
<connor> and doing it all, is just
a little bit annoying </connor>
<connor> for my lazy gamer of brain
to want to do it well. </connor>
<joey> - Well, because you're so used to just </joey>
<connor> the turn on immediately start. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right.
- That makes sense, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] It's called
Scalextric that's the brand of. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Is there a generic name
for that kind of product or? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] I think was </joey>
<joey> - just motorized cars. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Just like the, yeah. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you know how, like as a kid, </joey>
<joey> I think we had a really dodgy one </joey>
<joey> and it was just a whole
event setting it up. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It took so long, but. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but like you,
as I remember as a kid, </connor>
<connor> you had way more patience, you know, </connor>
<connor> - Exactly what I'm saying.
- like not even as a kid, </connor>
<joey> but as a teenager as well, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Like, you know, I tell
people about the fuckin' </joey>
<joey> efforts I had to go through to </joey>
<joey> even just fuckin' watch anime, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - or play some visual novels. </joey>
<joey> And you had to like download
like 7 million zip files, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> three tutorials about how
to like, install this game. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm, I think back to that now. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, man, imagine like, </joey>
<garnt> imagine trying to do that now? </garnt>
<garnt> Where you can just press
one button on Steam to like </garnt>
<garnt> play a lot of these like
Japanese underground games </garnt>
<garnt> and all that. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, even like console games, right? </joey>
<joey> Like you had to like
go into the bin to look </joey>
<connor> for the cartridge of the game </connor>
<connor> and then you had to fuckin' put it in. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's not working," pull it out, </connor>
<joey> blow on it a little bit. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Put it back in, turn
on, wait for it to load. </garnt>
<garnt> Now you just fuckin' turn on your switch. </garnt>
<connor> And the downloaded game is right there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But like, I saw, </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I have all my games cartridge. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Oh really? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I give them to my like, </joey>
<connor> other people when I'm done with them. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, Okay.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> - That makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - But like a big thing
that I've kind of like </joey>
<joey> felt recently is that like, </joey>
<joey> I've kind of like thought
what is the direction </joey>
<joey> that gaming is going to go, right? </joey>
<joey> What, because I've
recently procured myself </joey>
<joey> a PlayStation 5. </joey>
<joey> I know.
- [Joey] Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - I know guys, I know, I know. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you're the lucky few. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the lucky few. </joey>
<joey> And the reason I did that was entirely </joey>
<joey> because I was like, I'm not gonna, </joey>
<joey> I don't need a PS5, I don't need a PS5. </joey>
<joey> And then Horizon Forbidden West came out </joey>
<joey> and Horizon Zero Dawn were like </joey>
<joey> one of my favorite games of all time. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, "All right,
this kind of deserved </joey>
<joey> the special treatment." </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll try and go out my way </garnt>
<garnt> to get a PS5 in order to play this game. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the game looks fucking amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - and it's fantastic, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But is it that different
from playing it on a PS4? </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't really say so. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I, </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like hyper-realism in video games </joey>
<joey> has almost reached a limit. </joey>
<connor> To the point where it's like, </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - we can't get any better graphics. </connor>
<connor> - Things don't look that much different. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Than like eight years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- They don't, they haven't, </garnt>
<connor> - Can't get any better than this. </connor>
<joey> - Like I remember jumping from like, </joey>
<joey> I remember the first time I got my N64 </joey>
<joey> and I played Super Mario 64 </joey>
<joey> and like my mind fuckin' blew. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was like, I was, </joey>
<garnt> I like running around in 3d
after 2d Mario all this time. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I could not comprehend, </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - How such an experience Could be done. </garnt>
<garnt> - 12 Year old me was
like, "Up is forward?" </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> (heavy panting) </joey>
<garnt> - What, how does that work? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And now I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I think there are extra pixels that I'm, </joey>
<joey> that my eye is seeing right now. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- I feel like, </joey>
<joey> - Unless you have like a 12K like TV, </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You're not gonna see the difference. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like it's a bit smoother </joey>
<joey> 'cause there are slightly more frames, </joey>
<joey> but it certainly isn't
like the mind blown, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - kind of experience that I felt before. </joey>
<joey> - But that's what I'm saying like that, </joey>
<joey> that's why I feel like
we've almost reached </joey>
<joey> that limit when it comes to like, </joey>
<joey> amazing graphically how games can be. </joey>
<joey> And that's why I feel like, </joey>
<joey> especially the Indie
scene for the past like, </joey>
<connor> 10 years has been more focused on </connor>
<connor> and making these more like stylized games, </connor>
<connor> like pixel games and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Like yeah, you know what I want back? </connor>
<connor> I want cell shading in games back. </connor>
<connor> Can we have that back? </connor>
<connor> - Has it ever left? </connor>
<connor> - I think it's like it used
to be in the forefront. </connor>
<connor> I feel, of like all the mainline games </connor>
<connor> or like the main.
- [Connor] Is it? </connor>
<connor> - In a way it was,
- I don't think so. </connor>
<joey> I think for like certain
demographics, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> like when like Wind Waker
came out, for example, </joey>
<joey> everyone fuckin' hated it
at first until they played </joey>
<garnt> and they realized how
amazing it was, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I remember when everyone, </joey>
<joey> when Wind Waker came out </joey>
<garnt> and there was so much discussions in like </garnt>
<garnt> magazines to be like, this is a step down, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey giggling) </garnt>
<garnt> like this is a graphical step down. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what the trend was, right? </connor>
<connor> It was realism, realism, realism. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, realism, realism. </connor>
<joey> And then when we started getting used </joey>
<joey> to the cell shaded shit,
like with what's it? </joey>
<joey> Lollipop Chainsaw is like </joey>
<joey> another game series that's like </joey>
<joey> very cell shade, very stylized, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - People are also like, oh man, </joey>
<joey> this game looks too fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> Like it's not pretty enough. </joey>
<joey> And then people immediately,
when they played the game, </joey>
<joey> they found out, oh, you know what? </joey>
<joey> This is pretty, but just on a
different caliber of pretty. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean like I would say like </garnt>
<garnt> Wind Waker has aged the best
visually in terms of like, </garnt>
<joey> I would argue like pretty
much every Zelda game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You know? I mean, </joey>
<garnt> I think it looks better
than Pokemon Arceus. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the best thing is, </garnt>
<garnt> - Right?
- Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> And the best thing is
those kinds of styles, </joey>
<joey> a lot of the times are ageless. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like look at Cuphead. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, or, yeah, exactly.
Or like, you know, </joey>
<connor> like Wind Waker looks just as good </connor>
<connor> even in today's standards </connor>
<connor> because it's so stylized. </connor>
<connor> Whereas if you go back to like, </connor>
<connor> you know, Ocarina of Time, right? </connor>
<joey> You're like, ooh, </joey>
<joey> not as pretty as my 12
year old mind back then. </joey>
<connor> - Ocarina of Time, was a fugly game. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- It's not a pretty game, </garnt>
<joey> - If you have the context, you know, </joey>
<joey> the setting and stuff
it makes perfect sense. </joey>
<joey> - Of course, you know, people
who say like, you know, </joey>
<joey> with all those N64 games who
are like, "No, no, it looks, </joey>
<joey> it looks just as good today." </joey>
<joey> Are obviously, they're just
operating off nostalgia. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> But like anyone can look at
Mario 64 and go, "Fuck me, </joey>
<joey> that's an ugly game." </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- You know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it just, </connor>
<connor> - Actually I think Mario
64 looks kind of good. </connor>
<joey> - You think, compared to like, Ocarina? </joey>
<connor> - Well , yeah like if you look
at something like GoldenEye. </connor>
<garnt> GoldenEye looks awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that looks awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, GoldenEye looks jacked. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, and Ocarina
of Time, I think looks awful. </garnt>
<joey> I think Mario 64, like I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> I think it looks okay. </joey>
<connor> I don't think it aged as
bad as you might think. </connor>
<joey> - I think you should probably </joey>
<connor> take a little closer look at it. </connor>
<connor> - I have, I have, I have. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I was, </joey>
<joey> - Bowzer looks like shit. </joey>
<joey> Okay.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'll give you that,
Bowzer looks like shit. </connor>
<joey> - The Peach in the opening
scene, I'm just like, Ugh. </joey>
<joey> What is that? </joey>
<joey> - That is true, actually. </joey>
<garnt> I, 'cause when I, when
I think of Mario 64, </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason I go to Mario Sunshine. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because that was like, I
guess my childhood Mario. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah </joey>
<joey> - I remember, and Mario Sunshine has aged </joey>
<joey> a lot better visually than Mario 64. </joey>
<joey> - A million times better, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because with, yeah, </garnt>
<joey> I feel like that generation of games like, </joey>
<joey> - PS1?
- No, not, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't say PS1, 'cause like, </joey>
<joey> I look back at like Metal Gear Solid one </joey>
<joey> and I look back at like,
pixels talking to each other, </joey>
<connor> like Snake's face, he doesn't
have detail, it's like. </connor>
<connor> - One triangle.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a triangle. </connor>
<connor> And I remember thinking, </connor>
<connor> how the fuck did I get invested </connor>
<garnt> in these cutscenes of the Snake </garnt>
<garnt> going, "Otacon" and it's just
like a pixel going, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But like I feel like
the PS2, GameCube era </garnt>
<garnt> was kind of when we started
really, like really getting to, </garnt>
<joey> the point where I couldn't see </joey>
<joey> that much of a big jump
in graphical fidelity. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- And then afterwards </joey>
<joey> I did see a difference with PS3. </joey>
<joey> PS3 to me is when it kind of like peeked, </joey>
<joey> you know, where, you know, </joey>
<joey> Last of Us originally came
out on the PS3, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yes.
- And I was just like, </joey>
<joey> I, to me it like the original Last of Us, </joey>
<garnt> like pretty much every game looks about </garnt>
<connor> the same as Last of Us, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Even though I could tell
they look graphically better. </garnt>
<garnt> They're not that much graphically better </garnt>
<garnt> that I think, "My God, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a fuckin' mind blowing </garnt>
<connor> amount of improvement," you know? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But Wii looks pretty bad though. </connor>
<joey> - The Wii, well,
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's because the Wii had like, </joey>
<joey> very limited hardware. </joey>
<joey> - In isn't in, isn't four AEP the Wii? </joey>
<joey> - I think so it. </joey>
<joey> - Has a native resolution of four AEP. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's a up scale. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it looks rough </joey>
<joey> when you go back and play it. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Oh." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember as a kid </joey>
<joey> when Super Smash Bros
Melee, no Brawl came out. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember, I thought, "Dude,
this is like the pinnacle." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I thought that with Twilight Princess. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] I'm like, </joey>
<joey> this is insane.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then I looked back like a year ago </joey>
<joey> and I was like, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> It looked like that the entire time? </joey>
<joey> I think 'cause I'm remembering
the rendered cutscenes </joey>
<joey> for that game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the cutscenes look amazing. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause of course they fuckin' do. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. But I think in, with, </joey>
<joey> in a case with that
generation of consoles, </joey>
<connor> like the wii, I think it
depends on the game as well, </connor>
<connor> because like Twilight
Princess still looks great. </connor>
<connor> Even though that's a Wii game, </connor>
<connor> - Was it? </connor>
<connor> - I think it still looks great. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't like it. </connor>
<joey> - Compared to brawl. </joey>
<joey> - I think every single footage </joey>
<joey> I've seen of tri princess of late </joey>
<connor> has been the HD Remaster. </connor>
<joey> - The HD remaster, but if
you look at it comparatively, </joey>
<joey> like a lot of these like HD Remasters, </joey>
<joey> I don't really see the point
of calling them HD Remasters </joey>
<joey> 'cause if you put them side
by side, they're really, </joey>
<joey> unless you're like a fuckin',
you know, pixel snob, </joey>
<joey> like you're not gonna see like, you know, </joey>
<joey> when Final Fantasy 10
Remaster came out, right? </joey>
<joey> Like the HD Remaster, </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I played it and I was like, </joey>
<joey> how does this look any
different to the PS2 version? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, did you see the,
the GTA III Remaster? </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, it was a disaster. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - It was like the game looked worse. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Did you see this?
- I didn't see this. </garnt>
<joey> - It was like a massive controversy. </joey>
<joey> - No, I didn't see this at all. </joey>
<joey> - They like took off the
original Grant Theft Auto </joey>
<joey> and you couldn't buy it,
the original third one. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they were like, "You
have to buy the remake." </joey>
<joey> They reversed it a little bit. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember exactly what they did. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But they released this remake </joey>
<joey> and it looked worse than the original. </joey>
<joey> It was like they just turned like </joey>
<joey> the smoothness option on. </joey>
<joey> Like everything had just been smoothed. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - So, people just looked even
weirder in the cutscenes. </joey>
<joey> - Ugh. </joey>
<joey> - And all of it looked,
have you not seen the, </joey>
<joey> - Naw.
- Okay, </joey>
<joey> let me quickly grab a
few images and show you. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna just type in Grand Theft Auto, </joey>
<joey> GTA III Remaster images,
images, comparison. </joey>
<connor> Com par i son, okay. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, so like, look at this. </connor>
<connor> This is the original and
this is the Remasters. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh that's, that's
- [Joey] That's gross. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] That's just uncanny. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] There's also like, </joey>
<joey> there's so many where doesn't look like, </joey>
<joey> that much better. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- [Connor] It's like, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I'd say the original
has more character to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, a lot of the cutscenes, </garnt>
<garnt> the characters just look worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- It was really weird. </garnt>
<connor> I just don't understand. </connor>
<joey> - But that's the thing with like, again, </joey>
<joey> that's the thing with
like HD Remasters, right? </joey>
<joey> Like when they see Remaster of Wind Waker, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "This legitimately
looks no different." </joey>
<connor> It still looks just as good. </connor>
<connor> - I think it does look a bit crisper. </connor>
<connor> - Ya think so?
- I'm not sure, though. </connor>
<joey> I think I,
- It's very minute, though. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Thank you
- I would say, right? </connor>
<connor> Like you know, compared
to like Final Fantasy VII </connor>
<garnt> and final fantasy VII
Remake, by the way, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly.
- Like you know, </garnt>
<garnt> exactly like you that's a big job. </garnt>
<connor> That's a big job. </connor>
<joey> - It's the difference
between remaking a Remaster. </joey>
<joey> - That's true.
- Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, they just kind
of like uped the contrast </joey>
<connor> and smoothed it all out </connor>
<connor> and made it probably
just higher def, like, </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, higher resolution,
but like it's so stylized, </joey>
<joey> so stylized though that like </joey>
<joey> in terms of like actual
graphical updates or upgrades, </joey>
<joey> it's like, it's not something
to write home about. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, if you look at the image, </connor>
<joey> it just looks like the edges are smoother. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like RCX has been turned on. </joey>
<joey> - But you're not gonna see </joey>
<connor> that big of a difference
when you're playing the game. </connor>
<connor> - It wouldn't make a difference, </connor>
<connor> - No.
- To your experience </connor>
<joey> playing the game.
- No, not at all. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I guess
that's talking about like </garnt>
<garnt> the graphical differences as well, </garnt>
<garnt> but in terms like gameplay differences, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like the gaming industry
as a whole has just like </garnt>
<garnt> optimized pretty much like 90%
of everything thing they can, </garnt>
<garnt> that can be optimized. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, every, so
often we get something like </garnt>
<garnt> Breath of the Wild that completely changes </garnt>
<garnt> the way you look at like
an open world, for example. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And now every open </connor>
<connor> world game has a glider </connor>
<connor> for some reason.
- [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Even if it doesn't need it, like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Well yeah, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like the technology is less so </garnt>
<garnt> focused on making the
things very high graphics </garnt>
<joey> or making the textures more advanced. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I think right
now a lot of the technology </joey>
<joey> from what I understand is focused on like </joey>
<joey> the lighting and stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> So, making it, so when you
put a character in a world </joey>
<joey> that you can add all of
the effects naturally. </joey>
<joey> So instead of having a beam of light </joey>
<joey> and you programming
light, the light is here. </joey>
<joey> It's like you program room </joey>
<joey> and then you have a
bunch of options to like </joey>
<joey> turn on the, I've forgot what the name </joey>
<joey> of the lighting thing is. </joey>
<joey> It's like lighting where,
uses like the calculations, </joey>
<joey> like figure out what would happen </joey>
<joey> if like a ball went in the way. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - From the reflection stuff. </joey>
<joey> I think that's where a lot </joey>
<joey> of the advancements are being made. </joey>
<joey> Not so much in like, the
individual like assets makeup, </joey>
<joey> because the models that we
have of characters in games </joey>
<joey> are very, very high quality. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- They are. </garnt>
<garnt> They have been for a while. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the only thing that's left </joey>
<garnt> is making how the models
interact with the world. </garnt>
<garnt> More realistic if they want that or, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, whatever they wanna do. </garnt>
<garnt> And so now it's about making the machines </garnt>
<garnt> that can do these animations </garnt>
<joey> or do these things built in </joey>
<joey> and do them smoother,
from what I understand. </joey>
<joey> I could be totally wrong. </joey>
<connor> Someone might correct my comments. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I wanna know, right. </joey>
<garnt> Like what's the, once we've perfected </garnt>
<joey> that hypothetically what's the next step? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, that's why I do look to VR, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I do remember the first time </garnt>
<garnt> I tried Beats Saber, </garnt>
<garnt> and the first time I tried Superhot, </garnt>
<garnt> I did get that same kind of feeling </garnt>
<garnt> that I got playing Super Mario 64 </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time, which is just like, </garnt>
<joey> your brain has never experienced
something like this before. </joey>
<joey> And it's just fuckin' pure cocaine. </joey>
<joey> It was like, the first time I
played Superhot VR was like, </joey>
<joey> one of the funnest gaming
experiences I've ever had, </joey>
<joey> like period. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - But like that was an hour or so. </connor>
<connor> However long time we play Superhot. </connor>
<garnt> - There's no big games in VR, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - They're all really good,
like one to three hours. </connor>
<joey> - Where's the next Mario's,
where's the Mario VR game, Dude? </joey>
<connor> I wanna Mario VR game, where I am Mario. </connor>
<connor> - Uses that, "Movement is limited," right? </connor>
<joey> - Movement, right. </joey>
<connor> - You, if you let like, </connor>
<joey> - Mario Kart VR, where's Mario Kart VR? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it could be. </connor>
<connor> I think there are a racing games in VR. </connor>
<joey> - Well they did it in Mario land. </joey>
<connor> So why can't they do it in an Oculus? </connor>
<connor> - That was not very good, though. </connor>
<connor> - That wasn't very good. </connor>
<connor> - But,
- You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Right? Like if we get
like a Mario Kart VR. </connor>
<joey> - I think right now the point is like </joey>
<joey> movement is really hard. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And when movement is
realistic, it's not good. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's not what you want. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- But also </joey>
<joey> if you add unrealistic movement </joey>
<joey> to your character, it becomes really hard </joey>
<joey> to make it feel real, like
that thing I mentioned </joey>
<joey> where you jump around. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You don't jump around, </joey>
<joey> you just point the stick </joey>
<joey> and press jump. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you can't do that movement. </joey>
<joey> There's no, I can't
jump in fuckin' my room. </joey>
<joey> Like an idiot, right? </joey>
<joey> I wish I could. </joey>
<connor> You know how bad ass that would be? </connor>
<connor> Jumping off the fucking walls. </connor>
<garnt> - I wanna be on the
sidelines watching that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wish I could. </garnt>
<garnt> - I will never get
bored of like the random </garnt>
<garnt> for every like random clips like </garnt>
<garnt> that sometimes get
recommended of my YouTube </garnt>
<connor> of like grandmas trying VRs,
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> for the first time and like </connor>
<connor> them doing like the balance beam game, </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - and just like jumping
head first into a wall. </connor>
<connor> - People jumping and shit. </connor>
<connor> Oh, my God. </connor>
<joey> - Like that guy jumping
into his TV, right? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That was my favorite. </joey>
<joey> - I will never get bored with it, </joey>
<joey> or like the grandma who like, </joey>
<joey> oh I think it was a grandma or grandpa </joey>
<joey> who did like the climbing one, </joey>
<joey> and they like slowly fell. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<garnt> - Like they fell into
like a table or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you see those? </garnt>
<connor> I know there's some places you can do it. </connor>
<connor> And it's like an activity. </connor>
<joey> They, the VR headsets that
the cables go up to the roof. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's like a, a
treadmill you're standing on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like an Omni direction, </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you can have a gun </joey>
<connor> and then you can like run around. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- There's, </joey>
<joey> I know there's one place in Shinjuku, </joey>
<connor> I think you can do that. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - With the treadmills? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I think so. </joey>
<joey> - I've done that as well. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck?
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I know there's a few in America. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It looks really cool. </joey>
<joey> It looks really like. </joey>
<garnt> - It looks really good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like to try that out.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like imagine it's one
where it's like a trampoline, </garnt>
<garnt> that gives you like feedback </garnt>
<garnt> based on how much pressure
you put on the trampoline or </garnt>
<garnt> something, kind of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like, </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like you're on gravity </garnt>
<garnt> and the trampoline gets stiffer. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if it's like less, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're on like a swamp landing, </joey>
<garnt> - Yes.
- like swampy, that'd be cool. </garnt>
<connor> I dunno how you do that, though. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like I've
heard like one technique </connor>
<connor> that people use to combat motion sickness </connor>
<garnt> in VR games, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Is to literally. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's drinking vitamin C. </garnt>
<connor> - Rubbing wasabi in their eyes. </connor>
<joey> - Eating a fuck ton of oranges, </joey>
<connor> pouring some salt in their wounds. </connor>
<connor> - I had to do it, I had
to do it, I had to do it. </connor>
<connor> - But also actually just like walking, </connor>
<connor> like walking in the spot, you know like, </connor>
<joey> like just literally, like
just moving your legs </joey>
<joey> to make you feel like you're walking. </joey>
<joey> And it's just weird that that just like, </joey>
<joey> that is enough, </joey>
<joey> - Rewires your brain.
- Tricks your brain </joey>
<joey> into thinking, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, okay, this is real walking, now. </joey>
<garnt> I can understand this, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I've never done that
before, I should try that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I should try that. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like it's VR right </garnt>
<garnt> now is at the very new stages. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm very interested to see how and like, </garnt>
<garnt> if gaming gets to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where this kind of does become mainstream </garnt>
<garnt> and we get some like actual, </garnt>
<garnt> triple A games with VR games. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause yeah, right now it seems like </garnt>
<garnt> a very overpriced piece of
tech for a lot of tech demos. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a shame 'cause I really like it. </garnt>
<joey> I really want it to evolve, </joey>
<joey> - Um hmm. </joey>
<joey> - but I don't think it's gonna be where </joey>
<joey> I think it would be really sick </joey>
<connor> and mainstream for like
another 10 years, at least. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just waiting, man. </joey>
<connor> I want sort out line. </connor>
<connor> - Hey, 40 year old me, </connor>
<garnt> I'm gonna be jamming in
VR when it's out, man. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna be that dad that is like, </garnt>
<garnt> in like doing his PC stuff
all the time, playing games. </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna be that dad for sure. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna be the generation
when we are retired, </joey>
<joey> we're like, "Oh finally, </joey>
<joey> I can get started with my
back catalog of games." Right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, aren't we
getting close to the year </garnt>
<garnt> that Sort out Line was set now, as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - 2025, I think. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, something like that. </joey>
<connor> - I mean it could be done just like. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know how I remember, </joey>
<joey> - Just like, just hook a
wire up to your like PC </joey>
<joey> or something that like electrocutes you. </joey>
<joey> If you die in the game, it's like, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> like you actually just like
gives you like a, like. </joey>
<joey> - Like a shock collar. </joey>
<joey> - That gives you a lethal voltage, </joey>
<joey> if you die in the game. </joey>
<joey> Like we could just do, we
could probably do it now. </joey>
<joey> We just don't, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'cause we're scared
of what we could create. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I'm sure there's something. </joey>
<connor> - We're scared of
advancements in technology. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] 2022, for this year. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, this year. </joey>
<garnt> - Actually this year, </garnt>
<joey> - Sort out Line, online
is this year, let's go. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, my God. I actually you've read. </garnt>
<garnt> I think they're releasing, like
someone's releasing an MMO. </garnt>
<joey> The first VR MMO. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God, it's real, it's real. </joey>
<garnt> - It's real. </garnt>
<connor> - We can barely make good MMOs now. </connor>
<joey> - I hope I get selected as a beater. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - You, are a beater Joey. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I hate to date the video, </connor>
<joey> but I just wanna talk about this one </joey>
<joey> that I saw on Twitter this morning. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right? </connor>
<connor> - It's old news by the time this come out. </connor>
<connor> - So probably old news by
the time this comes out, </connor>
<connor> but I just couldn't fuckin' believe it. </connor>
<joey> Snoop Dogg has joined FaZe Clan. </joey>
<joey> - What?
- I'm not even joking. </joey>
<joey> He has joined faZe Clan as FaZe Snoop. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay.
- What do you think about. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> I might be out of touch here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- What is a FaZe Clan? </joey>
<garnt> Well like I know FaZe Clan, </garnt>
<connor> but I don't know FaZe Clan. </connor>
<connor> What are FaZe Clan? </connor>
<connor> - Like what is a FaZe Clan? </connor>
<connor> - Well, what? </connor>
<joey> - It's, you know, it's a, </joey>
<connor> it was originally a YouTuber organization. </connor>
<joey> - Now it's an eSport organization, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then it, so they always had, </connor>
<joey> it was back in the day
when Card started it, </joey>
<garnt> which, made it an Optic. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- That's how it started. </connor>
<connor> - I followed it then, </connor>
<connor> but like they've seemed to like </connor>
<garnt> just gone out of that little bubble and, </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't know what FaZe is anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know either. </joey>
<joey> - Are they just like a YouTube house. </joey>
<connor> Or YouTube group? </connor>
<connor> - No, it's like a brand. </connor>
<joey> And you know, if you, if
you're anointed into FaZe, </joey>
<joey> - Anointed. </joey>
<joey> - Knighted into FaZe. </joey>
<joey> - You do get genuinely
get a lot of success </joey>
<joey> just off the its a very powerful brand. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - With younger audiences normally. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Not a lot of people
our age watch Faze much. </joey>
<connor> - Are they still?
- 15, 16 something? </connor>
<garnt> - Are they still an eSports organization? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, they do everything.
- Or are they? </connor>
<garnt> It's kinda like a brand, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, there's, </garnt>
<joey> it's kind of what they're, that's, </joey>
<joey> - Is it like an agency? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so it's, from what I understand, </joey>
<joey> it's more of an agency. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- But, </joey>
<joey> all of the eSports brands are all kind of </joey>
<joey> going that way right now. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they realize that relying </joey>
<joey> only on eSports is not
the best for business. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you can, you
know, if your team competes </joey>
<joey> only four times, six
times a year, you have to, </joey>
<joey> you can only monetize the sponsors </joey>
<joey> and then those events. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Whereas, </joey>
<joey> if you have an entertainer, </joey>
<connor> you can monetize every time they upload </connor>
<connor> or do something and take a cut. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, now it just seems like </connor>
<garnt> a lot of eSports organizations are </garnt>
<connor> just streamer organizations. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that's,
- Pretty much. </connor>
<connor> what I feel with like with FaZe Clan now. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, are they still
the eSports organization </connor>
<joey> or are they an entertainment? </joey>
<joey> - I always thought it was like, </joey>
<garnt> I always thought it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, kind of like factioned off. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas like these, </garnt>
<joey> like we have a bunch of
FaZe Clan members who </joey>
<joey> are like the eSports players </joey>
<joey> who don't go on Twitch
or YouTube or anything. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then we have the YouTubers </joey>
<joey> and then we have the Twitch streamers </joey>
<joey> and then, you know. </joey>
<connor> - Well a lot of the time as well, </connor>
<connor> they want to get the, the
best players in a game </connor>
<joey> or a genre because normally
the best players at any game, </joey>
<joey> if they stream, they
will have of an audience. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Not necessarily always, </joey>
<joey> but they've a lot better
chance of getting an audience. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - You know,
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - and you can, kind of help them </connor>
<connor> and coach them through it. </connor>
<joey> - Well, they're definitely
gonna get a bigger audience now, </joey>
<joey> now that the Snoop D
O double G has joined. </joey>
<joey> - In dunno. </joey>
<joey> For some reason when I heard that, </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, that doesn't
sound surprising to me. </garnt>
<connor> I dunno why, I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> - Snoop does some interesting business. </joey>
<joey> - Snoop does a lot of, </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure the deal is
very good for Snoop. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure it's an extremely
good deal for Snoop. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure he needs the money. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Well, to me has the same energy of, </garnt>
<joey> do you remember like back when, you know, </joey>
<joey> when E3 happened and you'd see
like these press conferences </joey>
<joey> and then like at every
like E3 presentation, </joey>
<joey> they'd be, they'd have this
like one random celebrity, </joey>
<joey> come on to promote their games. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know, fucking
Drake promoting Madden </joey>
<joey> or something like that.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That it has the same
energy as that, for me it. </joey>
<joey> - It does, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Where you just get like this random, </joey>
<joey> with this random celebrity
to promote your brand </joey>
<joey> or promote your game and
it wouldn't make any sense, </joey>
<garnt> but you know, I just, </garnt>
<garnt> it makes sense because it's so, </garnt>
<garnt> it's such meme worthy, </garnt>
<joey> that people are gonna
talk about it anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<garnt> - And Snoop Dogg has done plenty of shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, he's so a amazingly in touch </joey>
<connor> with like internet audiences </connor>
<joey> and just meme culture that like he's, </joey>
<joey> it's just like a win for him. </joey>
<joey> It's just, I don't know, </joey>
<connor> there's just something weird about it. </connor>
<connor> Something weird about it. </connor>
<connor> - Well he's always posting. </connor>
<joey> - We'll have to call him FaZe Snoop, now. </joey>
<joey> - He's always posting on Instagram </joey>
<joey> and stuff and all that. </joey>
<joey> Remember he like doxxed his
Uber driver or something? </joey>
<joey> - What?
- He like doxxed his like, </joey>
<joey> delivery or door dash person. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Because they didn't like, </joey>
<joey> deliver the food.
- Right. </joey>
<garnt> - He like showed a picture
and their first name </garnt>
<garnt> to all of his followers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause he was showing the interaction. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right.
- He was angry that he, </garnt>
<garnt> I think Snoop Dogg was upset </garnt>
<joey> that they didn't deliver the food. </joey>
<joey> And I think Snoop was trying
to tell him where to go. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- To deliver. </joey>
<joey> ' Cause he Snoop lives in
like a gated community. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> - It's probably bit
harder to give it to him. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And he was like
complaining on his Twitter </joey>
<joey> and showed the face </joey>
<connor> and name of the person. </connor>
<connor> And this guy got like
a lot of hate, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus,
- Poor guy. </connor>
<joey> - poor guy.
- Yeah, but, </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It just, it, for me, </joey>
<joey> it's like really fascinating </joey>
<joey> just watching these like very
traditionalist celebrities </joey>
<connor> and like music artists and whatnot, </connor>
<connor> like kind of really dig their
heels into things like Twitch </connor>
<connor> and YouTube and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah.
- You know, </connor>
<connor> like when I found out
like, you know, T-Pain, </connor>
<connor> regularly streams on Twitch </connor>
<connor> and he has like a pretty
fucking massive audience. </connor>
<garnt> - T-Pain streams on Twitch? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. T-Pain, T-Pain is
massive on Twitch, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he's been streaming constantly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like everyone wonders, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, what happened to T-Pain?" </joey>
<joey> He's on Twitch now. </joey>
<joey> He's just streaming on
Twitch, like deadmau5 as well. </joey>
<garnt> He's just streaming on Twitch. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know deadmau5
is streaming on Twitch. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really bizarre that like </garnt>
<joey> at least I find it very bizarre </joey>
<joey> to see these like,
people you only ever see, </joey>
<joey> - Traditionally?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> The people you'd only
ever see on like TV shows </joey>
<connor> and like music videos </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Just suddenly being looked at. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] You know, let me look at, </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I just dropped a $5 donation </connor>
<joey> to T-Pain the other day
on Twitch, you know? </joey>
<joey> This is weird to say out loud, I dunno. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] T-Pain stream,
he's streamed 1500 hours. </connor>
<garnt> - He's got the analytics up. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's, I'm looking at, </garnt>
<garnt> - Real streamer boy, here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - His, he's active
normally one day a week. </joey>
<joey> - One day, okay. </joey>
<joey> - And normally he seems
quite wild, I think actually. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure he is busy doing other things. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure he stream more than me. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right.
- He streams more than Garnt. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, he streams more
than me, I'll tell you that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow yeah, he's quite active. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I was surprised, I just randomly. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I remember I was just like </connor>
<joey> going through Twitch one day and you know, </joey>
<joey> like the channels issue, watch thing, </joey>
<joey> you know, came up </joey>
<joey> and on the top of it,
it just said, "T-Pain." </joey>
<joey> I was like, that can't be
the same T-Pain, right? </joey>
<joey> - That's the guy who wrote, </joey>
<joey> "Through the Fire and Flames?" </joey>
<joey> The guitarist? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the guitarist for
DragonForce something. </joey>
<connor> - He streams on Twitch. </connor>
<connor> - The guitarist and the
drummer actually stream. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Really regularly. </connor>
<connor> - I remember they wanted
to perform their song, </connor>
<garnt> but they couldn't for copyright reasons. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that sounds like, </garnt>
<connor> - Which was like, </connor>
<joey> - sounds like the age of the internet. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause Copyright laws are broken. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, like I remember like when, </joey>
<joey> - They'll get DMCed. </joey>
<connor> - They would, they would. </connor>
<connor> - When like Gordon Ramsey replied to xQc </connor>
<connor> or something </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - about the cooking thing,
that was so surreal. </garnt>
<garnt> - What a weird, </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think the that's Gordon Ramsey. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure that's just
someone managing his account. </connor>
<connor> But I think Gordon has very good people </connor>
<connor> in charge of his accounts. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> because Gordon's pretty
active on like TikTok, right? </garnt>
<garnt> He's pretty active on like
social media platforms. </garnt>
<connor> I Feel,
- I have to doubt </connor>
<garnt> that he's he's keeping up with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I think Gordon is a
very good team of zoomers, </joey>
<joey> - Like, yeah.
- coaching him </joey>
<joey> and telling him what to do. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause again, and one of his videos, </joey>
<joey> he just kept talking about uncle Roger. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you obviously have someone who's like, </garnt>
<garnt> keeping you in touch
and telling you who's? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, obviously, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> We've talked about how
whoever they've hired </garnt>
<garnt> for like the, "Kitchen
Nightmares" titles on YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Top 10 times the food was busing, </garnt>
<garnt> "Kitchen Nightmares," like that. </garnt>
<connor> That was like an actual
YouTube title, like happening. </connor>
<connor> - And it worked, it worked, </connor>
<joey> it got so many fuckin' views, you know, </joey>
<connor> Even though it's like a decade
old show now or something. </connor>
<connor> I dunno. </connor>
<garnt> - I tell you the people
running his accounts, </garnt>
<garnt> - The most cursed title. </garnt>
<joey> - are like on top of that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't even wanna know how much the, </joey>
<joey> "Kitchen Nightmares" </joey>
<joey> YouTube account makes. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've noticed as well, </joey>
<joey> the YouTube, "Kitchen Nightmares" account, </joey>
<joey> literally just reposts the same
clips with different titles </joey>
<joey> and different montages all the time. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> - They'll be like top 10
times the burger was good. </joey>
<joey> And then I'll, the next one will be like </joey>
<joey> top 10 times the food was good </joey>
<joey> and they'll just reuse the same clips. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So they just keep making different lists </joey>
<joey> and then reusing the same clips. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's finite. </joey>
<joey> There's only, they don't have, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - more than what they have now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's genius, though. </joey>
<joey> - But somehow they've been daily uploading </joey>
<connor> and keep uploading stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - It's genius though, </garnt>
<garnt> because whenever, I dunno about you guys, </garnt>
<connor> but whenever a, "Kitchen Nightmares," </connor>
<connor> - I watch it. </connor>
<connor> - Clip shows up my timeline there. </connor>
<connor> I always got time. </connor>
<garnt> I all, even if I've seen this clip like </garnt>
<joey> 10 million times before, </joey>
<joey> - So, all right, how
busing is it actually? </joey>
<joey> I gotta find out. </joey>
<garnt> - "Kitchen nightmares." </garnt>
<connor> - It's about 10 times
man, the food was busing. </connor>
<connor> Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - And I think another one was like, </connor>
<connor> when the food wasn't busing, </connor>
<connor> top 10 times the food wasn't busing. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Right. </connor>
<garnt> - "Kitchen Nightmares" gets on average </garnt>
<joey> or fluctuates from anywhere </joey>
<joey> between 30 to 70 million views a month. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Holy shit. </joey>
<joey> - Right, that's probably
in the range of like, </joey>
<connor> it could be anywhere </connor>
<connor> from like 100 to 200 grand a month. </connor>
<joey> - Well yeah, knowing how well
food channels do, especially, </joey>
<garnt> - It's probably 200,000, 200,000 plus. </garnt>
<joey> - It's probably on the higher end. </joey>
<joey> - Which is what, </joey>
<joey> which makes me wonder
why don't more reality </joey>
<garnt> TV shows post as many fucking clips </garnt>
<garnt> as they possibly can. </garnt>
<joey> - Probably because a lot of
their production team are out </joey>
<joey> of touch or maybe some copyright issues. </joey>
<connor> - Probably a mixture of things. </connor>
<joey> Also probably a lack of
faith that they'll do well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, the "Kitchen Nightmares" brand </joey>
<connor> is still very strong. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, what show were you
thinking of specifically. </joey>
<joey> - Like pretty much any reality TV show? </joey>
<joey> I feel like,
- Like "Big Brother?" </joey>
<joey> - "Big Brother" like "90
day fiance," you know? </joey>
<joey> Like and any basically
anything made by TLC, </joey>
<garnt> like fuckin' "the Bachelor,"
like shit like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I feel like reality TV
in like, especially reality TV </garnt>
<garnt> was meant to be watched in a group. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, TLC uploads clips, all the time. </connor>
<garnt> That's why they're so,
they could do so well. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause they upload all the
clippable moments to YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's how "90 day
fiance" got big to begin with, </joey>
<connor> it's because the clips went viral. </connor>
<garnt> - I would like, I wonder
if it would do even better </garnt>
<garnt> on like, if they not only
uploaded whole episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> but like uploaded whole
episodes, uploaded clips, </garnt>
<garnt> uploaded like fuckin' montages, </garnt>
<garnt> like with the "Kitchen nightmares" things, </garnt>
<garnt> because it feels like, </garnt>
<joey> this kind of content is
just infinitely recyclable. </joey>
<joey> Because it's content </joey>
<joey> that you're gonna fuckin' watch </joey>
<joey> whenever you have like a lunch </joey>
<joey> and you need to sit down </joey>
<joey> and you're like, what
clip do I want to watch? </joey>
<joey> Oh, maybe I'll just watch
"Kitchen Nightmares." </joey>
<joey> Maybe I'll just watch "90 Day Fiance," </joey>
<joey> again the same "Big Ed
Clip" or whatever, you know? </joey>
<joey> - You never get tired
of those "Big Ed Clips." </joey>
<garnt> - You'll just never get
tired of that, right? </garnt>
<joey> - The clip of somebody
who's over like 600 pounds. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, or someone
with like a gross, </joey>
<connor> you know, obsession or. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Coffee enema. </joey>
<connor> - I like smelling butt holes. </connor>
<connor> Thank you. </connor>
<garnt> - Was it like, what was that show? </garnt>
<joey> Like my weird, my obsession, my? </joey>
<joey> - "My Strange Addiction." </joey>
<garnt> - "My Strange Addiction," yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> The one of other coffee
enema gets me every time. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> there's no way someone actually does that. </joey>
<joey> And they do. </joey>
<joey> I'm like gross. </joey>
<garnt> - The one thing that
makes me cringe the most </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason is the, </garnt>
<connor> there was this one British
woman who eats concrete. </connor>
<connor> Who eats bricks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it wasn't the fact that she, </connor>
<connor> - It's just better than British food. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That is a British delicacy, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Developing a strong
jawline with that one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You told me, they were
like, why do Legos have, </connor>
<connor> "Do not eat" warnings
and British food doesn't? </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That was the argument? </joey>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> No, it was just like the noise </joey>
<joey> that it made when she was crunching. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, God, did she,
- I can hear it. </joey>
<connor> - Have any teeth left? </connor>
<connor> - Probably filing them down slowly. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Honestly. </garnt>
<joey> - Like you know that feeling </joey>
<garnt> where you accidentally
get sand in your mouth </garnt>
<joey> and it's just like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> it's just the worst for? </joey>
<joey> - Like Anakin Skywalker,
like millions atrocities. </joey>
<joey> That feeling alone. </joey>
<joey> - That feeling, I understand Anakin, </joey>
<joey> - God, </joey>
<joey> - for that one moment </joey>
<joey> where you accidentally
get sand in your mouth </joey>
<joey> and you just spend the next
five minutes, just like, </joey>
<garnt> oh, there's just a weird crunch in it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't get rid of it. </garnt>
<joey> - I think maybe the reason
why like a lot of like, </joey>
<joey> you know, shows like
that, reality TV shows </joey>
<joey> don't post clips and full episodes. </joey>
<joey> I think it's because a lot
of their, like, I dunno, </joey>
<joey> this is just speculation, </joey>
<joey> but I'm guessing a lot
of like the producers </joey>
<joey> and the production team </joey>
<joey> and the people behind the actual show </joey>
<joey> still have some level of faith </joey>
<joey> that people still watch TV. </joey>
<joey> Like they used to back in the day. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Mm hm.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And so they're like, well, I mean, </joey>
<joey> we're still getting numbers. </joey>
<joey> Maybe not as big as you
know, back in the aughts, </joey>
<joey> but you know, people still watching TV. </joey>
<connor> - I also imagine that maybe </connor>
<joey> if you're producing a lot of shows, </joey>
<joey> I imagine there has been a lot of shows </joey>
<joey> that just lost 'cause they
didn't archive them properly </joey>
<joey> or they didn't, they don't have the files </joey>
<joey> or they have them. </joey>
<joey> They just dunno what, which ones, which, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> - I Imagine there's a
lot of that going on, </joey>
<joey> probably copyright, you know, </joey>
<joey> like maybe the production team made it </joey>
<joey> and then sold it to a network </joey>
<joey> and maybe the network
doesn't have the rights </joey>
<joey> and the production team doesn't, </joey>
<connor> maybe they also don't have
the rights for the and, </connor>
<joey> - And I'm sure they didn't
build those contracts, you know, </joey>
<joey> with the cause of like, oh, you know, </joey>
<joey> if these go on YouTube,
then we hold all the rights. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure they do now a
lot of networks probably do, </joey>
<joey> but I don't, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but like a show
from the two thousands? </joey>
<joey> Probably not. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Like I notice right now, </garnt>
<joey> especially like whenever
I go on my Netflix, </joey>
<joey> holy fuck they make a
lot of reality TV shows. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like with every single genre, right? </joey>
<joey> - But that's wrong. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I remember when Netflix kicking, </joey>
<joey> - It's like, pick an occupation, </joey>
<connor> there's probably a
reality show around that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - A glass blowing one,
you watched that one? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, there's a glass blowing one? </garnt>
<joey> - There's a glass blowing like course </joey>
<joey> - Of course there is. </joey>
<joey> - there is like competition. </joey>
<connor> I watched that the full series. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - Did they have like, the
reality TV like interviews? </joey>
<connor> - It was like "Master
Chef" with glass blowing. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - And they had like the archetypes </joey>
<joey> of the glass blowing judges. </joey>
<joey> They were like the, you know, </joey>
<connor> like the Gordon Ramsey, the an nice one, </connor>
<connor> the mean one. </connor>
<joey> - I can't believe he just
said that about my vase. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] No. </garnt>
<joey> - Is it like exactly the same format </joey>
<garnt> and everything like that? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but like you have </connor>
<connor> now 30 minutes to make your glass. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> It is literally like master chef, </joey>
<joey> but replaced with glass blowing. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't that bad. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Is it called blown away? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, blown away. </joey>
<joey> - Blown away.
- Blown away. </joey>
<connor> - How many seasons it got now? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] It's got, hold on, let me see. </joey>
<joey> Probably two, two. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember when like Netflix was like </garnt>
<joey> just shitting out like
five documentaries a day </joey>
<joey> and now they're like shitting out five </joey>
<joey> different reality TV shows. </joey>
<joey> - I not as </joey>
<garnt> - Glass blowing got a season two </garnt>
<connor> and "No game, no life" didn't? </connor>
<connor> like what the fucks wrong with people? </connor>
<connor> - I'm surprised that
like every single death </connor>
<joey> in the US hasn't had a
docu-series at this rate. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - Like everything has been
covered at this point. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't, it's crazy. </joey>
<joey> Like I watched one the other day </joey>
<connor> about like some grandma who was
killing people in her house. </connor>
<joey> And, and I was like how are
they finding this stuff? </joey>
<joey> Who's finding this. </joey>
<connor> This is insane. </connor>
<joey> - Why was this not televised earlier? </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I should know about this. </connor>
<joey> Grandma killing people. </joey>
<joey> This feels like a TV show plot. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If this happens on TV
would be like unrealistic. </joey>
<garnt> - Obviously you don't watch </garnt>
<garnt> enough True Crime documentaries </garnt>
<joey> or True rime podcasts or channel. </joey>
<connor> - Well it's just, </connor>
<connor> - The True Crime podcast. </connor>
<connor> Like been there, done that. </connor>
<garnt> - I've been there, done that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I feel like there's, </garnt>
<garnt> - This basic.
- the obsession. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes you're watching True Crime. </garnt>
<joey> You're like, and then you
just get this moment of like </joey>
<joey> your, your consciousness going, </joey>
<joey> "Don't you think it's weird
that you're watching stories </joey>
<joey> about people being murdered
and just shoving cameras in </joey>
<joey> their face and in
interrogating people to tell us </joey>
<joey> how they felt 20 years ago </joey>
<joey> when their family member died?" </joey>
<joey> Like, do you not get
that when you watch it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I get these
moments, I'll watch a full series. </connor>
<connor> I won't get it. </connor>
<connor> Every now and then I'll
just watch a series. </connor>
<connor> And it's always with the family interviews </connor>
<connor> where it kind of </connor>
<connor> makes me think, why are they just </connor>
<connor> making these family members just like </connor>
<joey> fucking talk about this
shit and cry on camera. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They're like, 'I loved him and stuff." </joey>
<joey> and it's like, it's genuine, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like these poor people </joey>
<joey> who like didn't ever wanna
talk about this again, </joey>
<joey> have just been shoved with it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they probably,
when someone was like, </joey>
<connor> "Here's 10 grand talk
about your dead cousin." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And how they were close to you </connor>
<connor> and how it was suspicious that </connor>
<connor> that one guy who never
got caught was suspicious. </connor>
<joey> - You know, that brutal Myrtle, </joey>
<joey> but you saw in front of your eyes, </joey>
<connor> recall that word for word. </connor>
<joey> - And it's just the same formula as well. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It feels like we've turned
it into a sort of like, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Glorification? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we've glorified
murder and stuff and, </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's scary isn't it? </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like, because Sydney, </joey>
<connor> I've talked about this before, </connor>
<connor> but Sydney listens to a lot. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I know.
- a lot of like, </connor>
<connor> she loves it. </connor>
<connor> True Crime videos, True Crime podcast, </connor>
<garnt> whenever like she's doing her make-up </garnt>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> And like every so, every. </connor>
<connor> - The time he discombobulated him. </connor>
<garnt> - Her arms were cut off. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Her legs were cut off. </joey>
<joey> - And every so often I'd be like, </joey>
<joey> and then David trapped Sally </joey>
<joey> in her basement for two weeks </joey>
<joey> and brutally (beep) her before </joey>
<joey> (beep) her (beep) and her. </joey>
<joey> But before I get to next point, </joey>
<joey> I'd like to bring up my sponsor </joey>
<joey> for today's video, NordVPN. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Bra,
what is this right now?" </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, like I get it. </connor>
<joey> Like, you know, like the, you know, Nexpo. </joey>
<joey> - You don't wanna end
up like Sally, right? </joey>
<joey> You should get NordVPN. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno if these guys, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't even know if Nexpo </joey>
<joey> or I know rainbow has sponsors and stuff. </joey>
<garnt> Like it's totally, I understand. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I get it.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But you have to admit
like, it is a little jarring. </connor>
<garnt> - It is, it's so jarring </garnt>
<connor> when I just about this like story. </connor>
<connor> - I love the channels, by the
way, I love your guys' video. </connor>
<garnt> - Brilliant channel. </garnt>
<joey> - But there's but there's right
and wrong places to put it. </joey>
<garnt> - I dunno, it's so weird. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think there's ever like a, </garnt>
<garnt> - Unfortunately the topic I think </garnt>
<connor> just doesn't lend well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It just doesn't lend well, </connor>
<garnt> but like there's been weird transitions. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we've done very, </garnt>
<garnt> many weird transitions in, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure, in our careers, </garnt>
<garnt> we've like just
transitioning to a sponsored </garnt>
<garnt> that we've had for this video. </garnt>
<connor> - We had the, the Berserk
thing one time, right? </connor>
<joey> We were talking about the passing of? </joey>
<joey> - Mira.
- Mira. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And because the way that we recorded it, </joey>
<joey> there was an ad break that was put </joey>
<garnt> right in the middle of us talking about, </garnt>
<garnt> - Not our finest work.
- Yeah, not our finest, </garnt>
<connor> - There is 'cause of how
we should have caught it. </connor>
<connor> - unplanned and something
that we looked over, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But there's, yeah. </connor>
<joey> It's not any like True
Crime, True Crime YouTubers, </joey>
<joey> there, I dunno, </joey>
<joey> I don't think it is there is a right way </joey>
<joey> to transition from some of </joey>
<joey> the stuff they talk about
to an advertisement. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Every time I hear it, it's just like, </connor>
<garnt> it just takes me out for a second. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like, we've, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> In a way I, it's totally fine. </connor>
<garnt> And I don't think it's like bad. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not condemning in any, </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I'm not condemning it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like, I like the content. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like, you have to admit, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you're watching
it and you're like, </joey>
<joey> it is strange how we've
turned this into like, </joey>
<joey> it's like the common day watch mojo. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Like we've turned in, </joey>
<joey> like the we've turned
murders into what we, </joey>
<joey> like top tens used to fill, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> like, whereas top 10 used to fill </joey>
<joey> that I'll just put
anything on kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We just like murder and horrible acts. </joey>
<joey> Just let it fill the void somehow. </joey>
<connor> Like there's a like channels and I'm. </connor>
<joey> - I'm surprised watch a murder
hasn't gone into that yet. </joey>
<connor> There's like top 10, </connor>
<joey> like girls who've been
trapped in dungeons. </joey>
<joey> - There's probably is some.
- Probably. </joey>
<joey> - I know that there's people </joey>
<joey> who do their make-up and
talk about True Crime. </joey>
<joey> That's a common. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I've seen that a lot, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Which is also a strange
evolution, but impressive. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, get ready with me </joey>
<garnt> while I talk about this horrible murder. </garnt>
<joey> - It's,
- It's a cool evolution. </joey>
<joey> - It's like next level mukbang, right? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> They're just, they're doing makeup </garnt>
<garnt> and they're talking about True Crime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna see a mukbang </garnt>
<joey> where they talk about True Crime </joey>
<connor> as they're like, just demolishing a, </connor>
<connor> - I hear you're saying this,
I bet it already exist. </connor>
<connor> - It probably exists. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't give Nikocado Avocado
anymore ideas, man, don't, </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, come on, Nikocado is
publishing a live True Crime. </connor>
<joey> Whatever he's doing to his
body is True fucking Crime. </joey>
<joey> - That's a True Crime
documentary to happen. </joey>
<joey> - That's True Crime what he's doing </joey>
<joey> to his digestive system, Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I mean, again like
I watch a lot of it. </joey>
<joey> I consume a lot of it, </joey>
<joey> but I do just get those
moments where I'm like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the reality hits, right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, It is weird. </joey>
<joey> - Especially where, like I thought </joey>
<joey> about it the other day </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, I don't know anyone </joey>
<connor> in my immediate circle or relatives </connor>
<connor> or anything where somebody has had like </connor>
<connor> something really horrible
happen to them or a murder. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, do you know anyone? </connor>
<connor> Like a cousin who knows
someone who's been murdered </connor>
<joey> or something like that? </joey>
<joey> - No.
- Not when it comes to murder. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And like </joey>
<joey> this True Crime stuff </joey>
<joey> almost kind of like normalizes it </joey>
<garnt> in your mind, I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that this is a
normal thing that happens. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think, </garnt>
<connor> - When in actual fact
isn't normal, at all. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think it normalize it, </garnt>
<garnt> it just desensitize you to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah well, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> it makes you think </garnt>
<garnt> that it is a normal thing that happens. </garnt>
<connor> - Really, I've never heard of like, </connor>
<connor> I've never listened to True Crime </connor>
<garnt> and thought it was a
normal thing that happened. </garnt>
<connor> - Like you watch it. </connor>
<garnt> These are real people, like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - These people, these interviews, </garnt>
<connor> this could be your cousin,
this could be your mom. </connor>
<joey> Like,
- I think it's the gravity </joey>
<joey> at which they address </joey>
<joey> that particular topic </joey>
<joey> where it's like, they say like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, so Tim got murdered." </joey>
<joey> Like in the same tone as like, </joey>
<joey> "So, I met up with Bob
the other day," you know? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like, I think, yeah. </connor>
<connor> The, I think the gravity </connor>
<joey> of the situation is often lost. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- In the content. </joey>
<joey> - Because there's so
much content like that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </connor>
<joey> there's the, the content is King and the, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not saying that I want to sit there </joey>
<joey> and feel traumatized every single time. </joey>
<joey> I watch something about True Crime. </joey>
<joey> I just think it's kind of interesting </joey>
<joey> and worth talking about the fact </joey>
<joey> that we don't consume it </joey>
<connor> and we don't empathize,
necessarily, always. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I mean, </garnt>
<joey> it is entertainment in a sense, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right, right.
- It is entertainment. </joey>
<joey> We don't watch it to
really, how can I say this? </joey>
<garnt> Really, we don't watch
it to not sympathize, </garnt>
<garnt> but we don't watch it. </garnt>
<joey> - People don't watch these
kinds of documentaries </joey>
<joey> and cry at the end of it. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Is what, you know, </joey>
<joey> like they don't, they're not like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, I feel so sad </joey>
<joey> for these like families,"
start shedding a tear. </joey>
<joey> - We watch it out of morbid curiosity </joey>
<joey> is what I was trying to say.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, there's, there's a
sense of morbidness to where, </connor>
<garnt> we want to know the gross details. </garnt>
<connor> - How far does morbid
curiosity go, though. </connor>
<garnt> That's the question?
- That's the question. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, that's when you start </connor>
<joey> getting into the weird shit, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And that's the part where
it's like, "Oh, okay." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - To the point where it's like, </joey>
<connor> you liking True Crime documentaries, </connor>
<joey> that's nothing compared to like </joey>
<connor> some of the weirder stuff you're into. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes I wonder like, </connor>
<connor> do I think I'm consuming
this content wrong? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I've watched some things </connor>
<joey> where it'll be like a documentary </joey>
<joey> and it'll be like, oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> like a kid got like beat up by his parents </joey>
<joey> and no one helped him. </joey>
<joey> And then the kid died and it's like, </joey>
<joey> I have to like stop for the day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, I have to like take a, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I have to like of just
step back and be like, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can't do anything. </joey>
<joey> But then people will
watch like tons of these. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, I'm wondering like, </joey>
<joey> what are they experiencing </joey>
<joey> That's different from me? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Like that makes it so </joey>
<joey> that I walk away from this </joey>
<joey> just feeling drained and exhausted. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then like, "Ooh, next one." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, one thing, I found really, </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna know
like, cause I'm curious. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, one thing that I
found really interesting </connor>
<connor> is that Japan doesn't have
any programming like that. </connor>
<connor> - No, they don't, they
don't, I've noticed that. </connor>
<connor> - And and I think it's because, </connor>
<connor> - It's like taboo.
- Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> It is taboo to like bring it
back up and talk about it. </connor>
<connor> And especially like, you know, </connor>
<joey> I can't imagine a fuckin'
TV program being like, </joey>
<joey> "Knock, knock, Hey, your son
got murdered 10 years ago. </joey>
<joey> Can you talk about it." </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Tell us about it.
- Like, you know, like </connor>
<joey> they wanna respect the families, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, not saying that, you know, </joey>
<joey> all of these like True
Crime documentary makers </joey>
<connor> have no respect on the
families or whatever, </connor>
<connor> but it is scarily like, it is scary. </connor>
<connor> - It feels invasive at times. </connor>
<connor> - It does feel invasive. </connor>
<garnt> - It feels very intimate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it's scary </garnt>
<joey> that no one who watches that kind of </joey>
<joey> programming second guesses, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- that invasiveness. </joey>
<connor> - But also I understand
maybe if somebody was, </connor>
<joey> your family was murdered, </joey>
<joey> I can also understand the opposite. </joey>
<joey> Where being able to talk about it </joey>
<joey> and express your frustration, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Maybe gets it off your chest? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - can help you get like grief </joey>
<joey> and help you kinda get
the story out there. </joey>
<joey> And you feel like I've told my case. </joey>
<joey> I've told people what it is and, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] And I'm sure, </joey>
<connor> - I get both sides, I do. </connor>
<joey> - And I'm sure you know,
the ones who think that, oh, </joey>
<connor> if I just talk about it on camera </connor>
<connor> and get it off my chest </connor>
<joey> and let people hear it,
would make me feel better. </joey>
<joey> Are the ones that turn into documentaries. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's why kinda get worried with these. </joey>
<joey> Sorry, I've interrupted like </joey>
<joey> three times in a row now Garnt. </joey>
<joey> Final time, I promise, I promise. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Unprofessional. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't even remember what I said. </connor>
<connor> Like twice, the time I had like a point </connor>
<connor> and was gone and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> oh man, I have another point. </connor>
<connor> - But gonna be like, "Connor,
let Garnt fucking speak!" </connor>
<joey> You know, that's another
thing addressed in, </joey>
<joey> I think a I few of them
here and there is like, </joey>
<joey> this is where I start to get a bit </joey>
<joey> weirded out with True Crime is when, </joey>
<connor> as the True Crime investigators online. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That go around and then start, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> pushing buttons and sending emails </garnt>
<connor> and asking people questions
who don't wanna talk about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- It's like, </garnt>
<connor> I think people have a right, </connor>
<connor> - Mentioning keyboard warriors,
keyboard investigators. </connor>
<connor> - Amateur detectives. </connor>
<garnt> - Like what was that? </garnt>
<joey> Oh fuck, what was that one where that guy? </joey>
<joey> Ah, shit. </joey>
<joey> Which one was it? There was, </joey>
<joey> this guy was like the head
detective for the online. </joey>
<garnt> And do you know what, have
you watched this with? </garnt>
<connor> Sydney's probably
definitely fucking watched. </connor>
<connor> I gotta ask Sydney. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't fuck with cats? </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - That the only one I know where, </connor>
<garnt> - That was actually a good one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But there's been
another one where a guy. </connor>
<connor> - He's just like a four
chain user or something? </connor>
<connor> - I need, I don't feel
confident saying about it. </connor>
<joey> I need to go and check. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Which one </joey>
<joey> it was on Netflix, </joey>
<joey> but there's one where this
guy was basically like, </joey>
<joey> like in charge 'cause the police
weren't helping that much, </joey>
<joey> but the police have to
go through, you know, </joey>
<joey> systems and, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - They don't always do
the best job, obviously. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] But they have to
go through the procedure. </joey>
<joey> - But this guy kind of like </joey>
<joey> steamrolled in and was like, </joey>
<joey> I'll help you family. </joey>
<joey> I'll be the detective. </joey>
<joey> And it was kind of weird watching </joey>
<joey> this documentary and watching this guy. </joey>
<joey> - What was the family like?
They were like, oh yes. </joey>
<joey> - They liked it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we, because they
were vulnerable spot. </joey>
<joey> You know, this guy was selling them, </joey>
<joey> the thing that I can help, you know? </joey>
<joey> - That's not cool. </joey>
<joey> - But I think the guy genuinely
believed he could help. </joey>
<joey> I don't think it was a scam or anything. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause there was no money involved. </joey>
<joey> He was like, I will help you. </joey>
<joey> But, it just felt kinda weird. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I was about to say
if like, if he was like, </joey>
<joey> I'll help you solve the
case, give me some money. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, he was like an internet guy, </connor>
<connor> who's just really into True Crime. </connor>
<joey> And he was going about being
like, I will solve this. </joey>
<joey> I'll help you do it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck, I need to figure out what this is. </joey>
<connor> I have such a vivid image of this guy. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, do you think that's
morally correct to do or? </joey>
<garnt> - It might have been. </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno, it really
depends on the situation </garnt>
<joey> because was this guy diluted </joey>
<joey> or did this guy actually help out? </joey>
<joey> I dunno, what grounds, I guess what, </joey>
<joey> from what Connor has described, </joey>
<garnt> what grounds did he
have to come to a family </garnt>
<garnt> and was like, I can
solve this crime for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did he want the clout? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Like, so the next time
he's on a True Crime, </joey>
<connor> he was like, "So, you might
have heard of this case. </connor>
<joey> Oh that was me." </joey>
<joey> - It's from, "Tiger King 2." </joey>
<joey> - Oh.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> - There's this guy who was like, "Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm definitely certain that
Carol Basking killed it. </joey>
<joey> I'll help the family and stuff." </joey>
<joey> It was just weird. </joey>
<joey> It was just, like this guy's
clearly just inserting himself. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- In this situation. </joey>
<joey> - He just wants to be
part of the storyline. </joey>
<connor> - It just, it was just
like, I just, just, I, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, just leave
it up to the professionals. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like to me, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I get too invested
in True Crime stories, </garnt>
<garnt> which is why I've never fully
like been into True Crime. </garnt>
<connor> Because like, I would hear some </connor>
<connor> of the stuff that Sydney
listens to or something. </connor>
<connor> And sometimes they like actually </connor>
<connor> play like the 911 call </connor>
<connor> that is made about this crime. </connor>
<joey> And I hear this shit and I'm like take, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like fresh out of the shower </joey>
<joey> ready for my day or something. </joey>
<garnt> And I got like a kid
fucking crying on the phone, </garnt>
<garnt> telling like, the police that
her mother's been murdered </garnt>
<garnt> or something, I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> - And then you immediately
feel dirty, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just like, "Sydney, I wanna cry now. </garnt>
<joey> Can we not listen to it?" </joey>
<joey> - She's just like. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Uh huh. </connor>
<joey> - And we're not trying to imply </joey>
<garnt> that if you do consume this stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> you've no empathy or, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No, no, no, of course not. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, this is just
like, I get too invested in it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Just wondering like why,
like why is it different? </joey>
<joey> - It's interesting. </joey>
<joey> - But like how far have you guys gotten </joey>
<joey> with like your morbid curiosities, right? </joey>
<connor> Because the internet is a wonderful, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes a terrifying place </connor>
<connor> where you can see
anything you want to see. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yes.
- Right? </connor>
<connor> And I know a lot of people </connor>
<connor> and a lot of kids went through a phase </connor>
<garnt> where they stumbled upon like </garnt>
<garnt> the darker side of the internet, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Right, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm not even gonna
pretend to sugar coat </joey>
<joey> the fact that like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> you know, at one point
when I was in high school, </joey>
<joey> someone was like, "Do you know
of this thing called Tor?" </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, "No, what's that?" </garnt>
<garnt> And so I downloaded it </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, it's a gateway to the dark web. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, I spent an
afternoon, one afternoon on tour, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, going through the dark web </garnt>
<garnt> just to see how fucked up it was </garnt>
<joey> and can confirm that's some
fucked up shit on there. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like, for me like, I like, </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't do anything, mind you. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't do, </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey incriminates
himself on, "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't do anything. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, I saw a lot of things </garnt>
<garnt> that I probably shouldn't have seen. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like even to me,
like my, my baseline, </joey>
<joey> I could not go on. </joey>
<joey> Like, if I see a LiveLeak thing, </joey>
<joey> I'm clicking off that video. </joey>
<joey> - No, no.
- Mmm. </joey>
<joey> - I just, I just like, </joey>
<joey> I've never had that kind of part </joey>
<garnt> of myself where I was morbidly curious </garnt>
<garnt> enough to see something </garnt>
<garnt> that I probably would regret seeing. </garnt>
<joey> - I can live the rest of
my life not seeing this. </joey>
<connor> - I've seen the worst things on Twitter. </connor>
<joey> That's, I'll be honest you. </joey>
<garnt> - There's some fucked up shit on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm, the most fucked
up videos I've ever seen </garnt>
<connor> have been on Twitter.
- [Joey] Really? </connor>
<garnt> - Actually, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> Some really fucked up things, and I'm, </garnt>
<connor> I thought you were just
like being facetious there. </connor>
<connor> I thought you were,
- No, no, genuinely. </connor>
<connor> I thought you, </connor>
<connor> I thought you were just
like, oh, I had this tweet </connor>
<connor> I saw the other day. </connor>
<connor> - Like friends, like people who I followed </connor>
<joey> and I knew they'd like retweet </joey>
<joey> and be like, "Oh, this is horrible." </joey>
<joey> This video of like some
people getting shot and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've seen that. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Why are you sharing this? </connor>
<joey> - I've actually seen that, as well. </joey>
<joey> - I thought you were being
factious, too, being like, </joey>
<garnt> I saw the tweet the other day </garnt>
<garnt> that said that Dimas is better </garnt>
<garnt> than Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<connor> I said, "Oh my God, horrendous." </connor>
<garnt> - That too, that too, that too. </garnt>
<joey> - We thought you were
taking the piss there. </joey>
<joey> - I can, I, you know, I've, </joey>
<garnt> - I know exactly (indistinct), </garnt>
<garnt> - the pre 2010 era of the internet </garnt>
<garnt> where everyone loves
sharing fucked up shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And, </joey>
<joey> - When Reddit 50/50 was the King. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely saw the most haunting stuff </joey>
<joey> being shared on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Twitter is very slow
to get rid of this stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is, it is. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe not as good as other platforms </joey>
<joey> at getting rid of it and yeah, </joey>
<joey> all the fucked up shit there man I, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Some of it's still burned into my mind. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been on the dark web. </joey>
<connor> I don't really have an interest. </connor>
<connor> I don't, </connor>
<joey> - Weirdly enough, like the
stuff I saw on the dark web, </joey>
<joey> just like, just based on like </joey>
<connor> what you see as an image </connor>
<connor> or whatever is not as fucked up </connor>
<connor> as some of the stuff you'd
see on like Reddit or Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - Is it like second page of Google? </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> - No one talks about kidding. </connor>
<connor> - I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> - No, I think it's just
like, I think it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I think the thing that's like fucked </connor>
<joey> about the dark web from my experience, </joey>
<joey> on going on it, it's just like </joey>
<joey> there's conceptually a
lot of fucked up things. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like when you read
into it, it's like, "Oh." </joey>
<connor> - I thought it's just people buying drugs. </connor>
<connor> (Joey sputtering) </connor>
<joey> That's like 90% of it. </joey>
<joey> - That's like the tip
- People selling Ft, right? </joey>
<connor> - The tip of the iceberg, </connor>
<connor> you know, there's but like, you know, </connor>
<connor> there's like a lot of
other stuff you'd look into </connor>
<connor> and it's like, oh, where it's like, "Okay. </connor>
<connor> I probably didn't wanna know
that that was an operation that </connor>
<connor> is currently functioning right now." </connor>
<connor> It's some were out there
in the world, you know, </connor>
<connor> the levels are fucked up. </connor>
<connor> Whereas like you go LiveLeak and Twitter, </connor>
<connor> it's like, you're immediately
exposed to something </connor>
<joey> that's like, "Oh, that's oh,
I shouldn't have seen, like, </joey>
<joey> I didn't wanna see a guy's
head explode on LiveLeak, </joey>
<joey> but I just did." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, it is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's one of the few times </garnt>
<garnt> that a video like that or pictures, like, </garnt>
<joey> gone through the cracks, you know, </joey>
<joey> it's just like, </joey>
<joey> it's never not been haunting for me </joey>
<joey> in like every way, shape, form. </joey>
<joey> Like, I remember every
fucked up thing I see. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I see it once, and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "That is now like fucking
ingrained in my mind." </joey>
<joey> And there'll be a point
where I'm in the shower. </joey>
<joey> I have like a fuckin'
flashback to that video. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, my day is just infinitely worse. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> but there's a part of me there where like, </joey>
<joey> I know this is a reality </joey>
<joey> and I know like the internet is filtered. </joey>
<joey> So,
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It is more friendly, but like, </joey>
<joey> there's a part of me where I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I don't want to be desensitized
to this thing, you know? </joey>
<joey> - No.
- No. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I know I've met some
people who are just like, </joey>
<joey> you think that's baby shit. </joey>
<joey> I've seen the real shit. </joey>
<joey> I've seen the fucked up shit. </joey>
<joey> I've seen the Snuff films. </joey>
<joey> - Why, why, why? </joey>
<joey> - And I'm just like, well, to me, </joey>
<joey> like I like being sensitive
to this stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Because this shit is. </joey>
<joey> - It grounds me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this shit grounds you. </joey>
<joey> And like the True Crime stuff as well, </joey>
<joey> to like, to me, at least like to me. </joey>
<garnt> I don't want to be too
desensitized to the group, </garnt>
<garnt> to the True Crime stuff in case, </garnt>
<garnt> this happens in my real life. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know someone that has, </garnt>
<garnt> that happens to. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I don't wanna be </garnt>
<garnt> desensitized to that, in my mind. </garnt>
<joey> - So let's be real, like you know, </joey>
<joey> if some person comes up to you </joey>
<joey> and says like, "Oh well,
that's, that's some pussy shit. </joey>
<joey> I've seen the more fucked up stuff." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, that's not a brag. </joey>
<joey> Like why do you think you're cool? </joey>
<connor> Because you see like a
bunch of LiveLeak videos </connor>
<joey> and you're not phased by it. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, I wanna
leave, I wanna get away. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like that doesn't make, </joey>
<connor> that's not gonna make me be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, what an
absolute fucking Mega Chad, </connor>
<connor> this guy is for like sitting </connor>
<connor> through a bunch of LiveLeak playlists." </connor>
<connor> It's like, no, that just makes
me not want to be near you. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you're fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't LiveLeak shut down now? </joey>
<garnt> - Yes.
- Has it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I believe it has. </garnt>
<joey> - Really, since, when?
- Dunno. </joey>
<connor> - What a good thing. </connor>
<joey> - Damn, missed out, just kidding. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - So much good content lost forever. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, no, it's horrible. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, because
there was, you know, </connor>
<garnt> especially during like the peak
of like Reddit 50/50, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, oh God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like the mid 2010s. </garnt>
<joey> Remember when that was the craze. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you wanna explain
what Reddit 50/50 was? </garnt>
<joey> - I, I don't, I kind of don't want to </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't want people going onto it. </joey>
<connor> - Is it still a thing? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty sure it's still a thing. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's still a thing, </connor>
<connor> but Reddit 50/50 is
basically it's this Subreddit </connor>
<connor> where people post this
like, link where it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's like you have a 50/50 chance </connor>
<connor> when you click the link of </connor>
<connor> it's a really nice thing </connor>
<connor> or it's a really bad thing. </connor>
<connor> And when I say nice and bad, </connor>
<connor> I mean like really nice </connor>
<joey> and like the worst NSFL
shit you will ever see </joey>
<joey> like straight from LiveLeak. </joey>
<joey> So there's, you know, </joey>
<joey> an example would be like Reddit 50/50, </joey>
<joey> five cute puppies or
five decapitated heads. </joey>
<joey> And you won't know which one it is </joey>
<joey> until you click the link. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And in the 2010s, that was a game. </joey>
<joey> People, like kids used
to, to play, you know? </joey>
<joey> Like I remember some of </joey>
<joey> my fuckin' high school friends were like, </joey>
<garnt> you know, in a Skype call
back in the day was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You want do a little
bit of Reddit 50/50?" </garnt>
<garnt> As if they're inviting me to like </garnt>
<garnt> a Minecraft server, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's like, yeah you know? </garnt>
<connor> It's just casual gaming, you know? </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh gosh. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, poor naive
me the first time around, </joey>
<connor> I was like, what's Reddit 50/50? </connor>
<connor> Biggest mistake in my life. </connor>
<connor> I did that for five minutes. </connor>
<joey> I was like, I don't wanna
talk to you guys ever again </joey>
<joey> for letting me sit through that. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that was horrible. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, and then it became a
big thing on fuckin' YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, which is why I
feel sorry for like the, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the worst jobs I could </garnt>
<joey> imagine is the people who work for, </joey>
<joey> - Moderate, Reddit 50/50. </joey>
<connor> - Moderate Facebook and stuff, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You have to go through every
video that's been flagged. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - In Facebook or in YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was a video I saw of like some, </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it, I saw, </garnt>
<joey> it was a vice video I saw.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Of like, like one of these people </joey>
<joey> who had been interviewed and, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And some of the shit they
had to like, go through. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Awful man, </joey>
<connor> That job seems like
the worst job on earth. </connor>
<joey> - Just like completely desensitized. </joey>
<joey> Like just hearing them talk. </joey>
<connor> They just like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But apparently, obviously
you'd have to like </connor>
<connor> go through a bunch of
really horrific views </connor>
<joey> and really fucked up,
really ripe opinions. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I think, I think. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of them apparently, </joey>
<joey> like a lot of them would
like get really desensitized </joey>
<connor> and become like really fucked. </connor>
<joey> The more they did this job. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I think it was </connor>
<joey> that vice documentary where
like the girl said that like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, once you
apply for this position, </joey>
<joey> you just like, immediately
like, get therapy." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like it just comes with the package. </joey>
<garnt> - Awful, awful.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> It comes with the package </joey>
<joey> that there is a therapist,
maybe on site, maybe online. </joey>
<connor> I don't know, but. </connor>
<garnt> - What a terrifying thought. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a job out there </garnt>
<connor> that immediately requires
you to have therapy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well kind of like you,
they need the like they're, </garnt>
<joey> they're the fucking real heroes. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause there needs to be someone out there </joey>
<joey> that makes the fuckin' internet safer </joey>
<garnt> for people like us that don't wanna see </garnt>
<garnt> that on our timeline. </garnt>
<joey> - Otherwise, you know, </joey>
<joey> what's the difference
between the normal web </joey>
<garnt> and the dark web at that point, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </joey>
<joey> - Just exactly the same thing. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, right? </joey>
<joey> I just hope they get
treated fuckin' fairly </joey>
<joey> and treated well and getting paid well, </joey>
<joey> - I hope they get the best, </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that's a horrible job. </joey>
<joey> - I hope they get the best
fuckin' therapist on the planet. </joey>
<garnt> - That's sad. That's
the sadder thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> My God. </garnt>
