<joey> what's up crackheads welcome back to </joey>
<joey> another episode of the trash taste </joey>
<joey> podcast i'm your host joey and i'm with </joey>
<garnt> the other </garnt>
<garnt> crackheads i like how you like started </garnt>
<connor> with alliteration at the start of this </connor>
<connor> podcast and now it's just like that you </connor>
<connor> gave up with the alliteration </connor>
<connor> well that'd be </connor>
<connor> notorious for having a welcome sense </connor>
<garnt> they understand satire i never do </garnt>
<connor> monetize for no reason at all </connor>
<connor> never happened in the history of youtube </connor>
<garnt> no of course not any youtuber </garnt>
<connor> it's not like it happened on the last </connor>
<joey> chris episode or anything you know </joey>
<garnt> it's fine to be fair i think that was </garnt>
<garnt> just the uh copious amounts of alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> we consumed on that episode </garnt>
<garnt> i think that was the demonetization that </garnt>
<connor> forced us into just being a mess which </connor>
<connor> i'm fine with but you know just </connor>
<connor> just a mess but welcome to this episode </connor>
<joey> welcome to this episode of trash taste </joey>
<joey> so hopefully this one's not going to get </joey>
<joey> demonetized because we're going to be </joey>
<joey> talking about </joey>
<garnt> anime whoa wait we're going to be </garnt>
<joey> talking about </joey>
<joey> what do you remember when uh he's </joey>
<joey> talking about anime do you remember when </joey>
<joey> this podcast was an anime podcast </joey>
<joey> i'm not gonna bring that back i'm glad </joey>
<joey> that i stopped this from becoming an </joey>
<connor> anime podcast </connor>
<joey> my influence and then and then </joey>
<joey> me and god were like no we must bring </joey>
<garnt> her back </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm feeling nostalgic now cause i </garnt>
<garnt> get to talk about anime again on this </garnt>
<joey> podcast my [ __ ] god </joey>
<joey> i mean we barely talk about anime on our </joey>
<connor> own </connor>
<connor> i like it that way i like being an anime </connor>
<joey> fan </joey>
<joey> that's what i like yeah we're all anime </joey>
<connor> fans yeah but uh today </connor>
<connor> uh we're gonna we're gonna talk about it </connor>
<connor> we're gonna talk about some anime more </connor>
<connor> specifically </connor>
<connor> we are going to be doing what we do best </connor>
<joey> which is roasting our </joey>
<garnt> trash tastes see anime okay as like </garnt>
<connor> anime youtubers and connor </connor>
<garnt> like you know don't do me like that all </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<garnt> one of the most annoying questions we </garnt>
<garnt> get asked i'm sure is </garnt>
<garnt> what is your favorite anime like </garnt>
<garnt> you get asked this at every panel at </garnt>
<garnt> every fan meetup you've ever gone to </garnt>
<garnt> and i swear to god i don't know about </garnt>
<garnt> you but i have a different answer every </garnt>
<connor> time </connor>
<connor> i i've loaded a default answer so i </connor>
<connor> don't have to think and that will like </connor>
<connor> satisfy </connor>
<garnt> but as anime youtubers we know we are </garnt>
<garnt> normally the ones judging other people's </garnt>
<garnt> tastes but </garnt>
<garnt> now we are putting our own taste on the </garnt>
<garnt> line </garnt>
<garnt> and we are judging each other's tastes </garnt>
<garnt> and letting you all </garnt>
<garnt> judge our tastes along with us because </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> normally we don't promote our my anime </garnt>
<garnt> list or </garnt>
<garnt> we will get into what we're doing but </garnt>
<garnt> basically we are going to be showing </garnt>
<garnt> each other's my anime list </garnt>
<garnt> and then afterwards we are going to be </garnt>
<garnt> sh if you guys remember </garnt>
<garnt> there was this trend in the anime </garnt>
<garnt> community before called three by threes </garnt>
<garnt> where you basically pick nine anime in a </garnt>
<garnt> three by three grid </garnt>
<garnt> that you show to your fellow brethren </garnt>
<garnt> and that </garnt>
<garnt> basically encapsulates kind of your </garnt>
<joey> taste of anime it's basically just like </joey>
<connor> a pinterest collage </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] tumbler girls in this case yeah </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> by like guys or pinterest or something </joey>
<garnt> like that i think it was started by </garnt>
<garnt> 4chan actually wasn't it </garnt>
<joey> yeah of all things 4chan creates </joey>
<joey> they made this yeah so uh in in </joey>
<joey> trash taste spirit we're going to bring </joey>
<joey> back trash box skin right here if you </joey>
<garnt> guys remember from our </garnt>
<garnt> episodes that was that was half a year </garnt>
<garnt> was that was over half a year </garnt>
<joey> that was like six seven months ago jesus </joey>
<joey> but uh we're gonna bring it back and uh </joey>
<joey> to make it fair we're gonna pull out uh </joey>
<connor> oh wait what's this doing oh yeah that </connor>
<connor> was me i did i did </connor>
<connor> yeah this is my hidden anime list so i </connor>
<connor> actually have one from when i was a </connor>
<connor> teenager right that i never made public </connor>
<connor> and people would always ask me for my </connor>
<connor> anime list so i actually made a my anime </connor>
<connor> list </connor>
<connor> under sea dog va and just put like boca </connor>
<connor> no pico as like a 10. </connor>
<connor> and then every now and then i get a </connor>
<connor> comment on it being like i hate uconn </connor>
<joey> yeah so hi </joey>
<joey> yeah my my username as well i mean i've </joey>
<connor> done a video on it already so people </connor>
<connor> know but it's like my username is not </connor>
<connor> even the anime man </connor>
<connor> it was a blast for me it was the </connor>
<connor> username i used before i was the anime </connor>
<joey> man </joey>
<garnt> right the zinger what are you a big bang </garnt>
<garnt> finger </garnt>
<garnt> okay so first thing i gotta ask is how </garnt>
<garnt> when was the last time you remember </garnt>
<garnt> updating this because like </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm going to say this now we're all </garnt>
<garnt> picking up our mouse i haven't updated </garnt>
<garnt> my mail in </garnt>
<joey> years okay i'll give you i'll give you </joey>
<joey> an idea all right i'm looking at my </joey>
<joey> watching </joey>
<joey> list right now and uh boku no hero </joey>
<joey> academia second season is on here yeah </joey>
<connor> you've got you've got a </connor>
<joey> 91 days here and that was like what </joey>
<joey> three or four years ago no i've already </joey>
<joey> finished that one though yeah but that's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> how long good would that come out 91 </connor>
<joey> days two years no [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> when did season two of my hero come out </joey>
<connor> like two two years ago </connor>
<garnt> it was two years ago no it wasn't true </garnt>
<garnt> it was like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] three guys realized they're </garnt>
<garnt> boomers </garnt>
<joey> four years ago three four years ago so </joey>
<joey> it's been that long since i've updated </joey>
<garnt> yeah all right okay </garnt>
<joey> so wait wait are you telling me you've </joey>
<joey> watched my hero academia season one </joey>
<joey> i finished season one yeah how come </joey>
<garnt> you've like never talked about this </garnt>
<joey> before because it was like the most six </joey>
<connor> out of ten show i've ever watched </connor>
<connor> like but you'd normally milk that for </connor>
<connor> all it's worth being like yo it's mid </connor>
<connor> bros i'm triggering all the little </connor>
<joey> weaves i mean </joey>
<joey> like i could but also it's like i don't </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> if to me like calling mikey or academia </joey>
<joey> mid </joey>
<joey> is just as much of a popular opinion as </joey>
<garnt> saying that it's a 10 out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay the the first thing that pops </garnt>
<connor> out something on </connor>
<connor> it's mid but you gave it a seven out of </connor>
<joey> ten yeah it's exactly it's all right </joey>
<joey> it was how it was seven minutes it was </joey>
<joey> good but it wasn't like </joey>
<garnt> the second coming of jesus that people </garnt>
<joey> born </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> the first thing that pops out to me here </joey>
<joey> right the first thing that pops out to </joey>
<joey> me here </joey>
<joey> as like i this is how i know joey's my </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] brethren here right </joey>
<joey> because as we all know my i started </joey>
<joey> as the anime zone right and my very </joey>
<garnt> first </garnt>
<garnt> anime zone review right was bleach yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah which i </garnt>
<garnt> gave a seven and i can see </garnt>
<garnt> that mr joey the anime man also came </garnt>
<garnt> please a seven out of ten </garnt>
<garnt> i mean despite the fact how much we've </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] on bleach </garnt>
<garnt> in our like a professional career look </garnt>
<joey> look look </joey>
<joey> when i when i [ __ ] on bleach right i </joey>
<joey> mean granted i've never really like </joey>
<joey> publicly [ __ ] on bleach all that much </joey>
<joey> right like i didn't make like a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> anime </connor>
<connor> review on bleacher but look the only </connor>
<connor> thing it's </connor>
<connor> three points off for the isen arc and </connor>
<connor> then </connor>
<joey> everything else was perfect you know </joey>
<garnt> what i mean but like that's like </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i wouldn't i mean i would argue </garnt>
<garnt> everything after so soul society i mean </garnt>
<garnt> you you can like you can like the uh you </garnt>
<garnt> know the aaron carr arc </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah whatever of course the </joey>
<joey> wicked window arc was fine as well yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah i mean it was it was fine but we've </connor>
<garnt> never watched all red bleach really </garnt>
<garnt> no no you don't you don't need to yeah </garnt>
<joey> you're not missing </joey>
<joey> and if you do just read or watch up to </joey>
<joey> soul society which is the first star </joey>
<connor> which is what i've heard you can't just </connor>
<joey> stop if you're like really you kind of </joey>
<joey> have to </joey>
<joey> yeah but you can't just though you want </joey>
<joey> to see no you see it go down no you </joey>
<joey> can't you can i mean i mean it </joey>
<connor> it depends like because bleach didn't go </connor>
<connor> out with a bang it's just i know yeah it </connor>
<garnt> just like kind of </garnt>
<connor> fizzled out well i've watched all like </connor>
<connor> reviews of bleach for some reason i've </connor>
<connor> watched like every eyepatch world video </connor>
<connor> on it and i'm like yeah </connor>
<joey> cool this sounds sounds good look don't </joey>
<joey> get me wrong it was </joey>
<joey> back in the day when it was serializing </joey>
<joey> it was a super solid shown in manga </joey>
<joey> yeah and like you know as much as i like </joey>
<joey> to think that i'm like oh you know i </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> all the underground like weird you know </joey>
<joey> non-mainstream [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> i love my shonen and bleach was one of </joey>
<garnt> them like i saw society </garnt>
<garnt> honestly to this day i think bleach is </garnt>
<garnt> one of </garnt>
<garnt> just the coolest anime to come out like </garnt>
<garnt> definitely i like </garnt>
<garnt> out of the big three which is like one </garnt>
<garnt> piece naruto and </garnt>
<garnt> bleach bleach was just like that [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> cool kid you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> it always seemed like the edgiest one it </connor>
<connor> was it was definitely the edgiest </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i mean have you seen what </joey>
<joey> kubota tito looks like he looks like i </joey>
<garnt> mean i used to always see the </garnt>
<connor> amvs it's like lincoln park with yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean that that was pretty much </garnt>
<connor> blue yeah </connor>
<connor> that was bleach yeah but it was like it </connor>
<connor> went better with like bleach because </connor>
<connor> they had like half skulls and [ __ ] i </connor>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<connor> what was going on was [ __ ] sick dude </connor>
<connor> like the powers were sick </connor>
<garnt> it was just it was just the sword powers </garnt>
<joey> were sick then like </joey>
<joey> i want to see some more bad guys guys </joey>
<joey> say what you want about kubo but like </joey>
<joey> he he has a good fashion sense oh yeah </joey>
<joey> the way he dressed the characters they </joey>
<joey> were they just always looked cool </joey>
<joey> yeah really the drip was clean </joey>
<garnt> that's the perfect way to decide two </garnt>
<garnt> characters the drip was clean </garnt>
<garnt> like say what you want about bleach they </garnt>
<joey> had those characters </joey>
<joey> i would go as far as to say that bleach </joey>
<joey> might be maybe not the first but </joey>
<joey> definitely one of the biggest </joey>
<joey> shows that kind of gave like i don't </joey>
<joey> know i don't know maybe </joey>
<joey> streetwear and animes like </joey>
<joey> collaborations i would argue maybe came </joey>
<joey> from bleach </joey>
<joey> yeah because a lot of the characters </joey>
<connor> especially in like the title um </connor>
<connor> panels that he wrote during the manga </connor>
<connor> like he gave them such cool [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> looking street yeah that </connor>
<connor> honestly you can see people wearing like </connor>
<connor> people want to see this like </connor>
<joey> drip goku exists yeah exactly bleach is </joey>
<joey> the reason why drip goku exists </joey>
<joey> is this a meme </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i don't know who made it yeah </joey>
<connor> i'll show you but like it's it's this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] meme of like goku like in the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] like b-boy stance </joey>
<joey> wearing this [ __ ] drip it's like a </joey>
<connor> big meme right now </connor>
<connor> i don't know why this is a meme i i i </connor>
<connor> try to explain to some people and i'm </connor>
<joey> like but why is it a meme i'm like i </joey>
<connor> don't know i don't know but it's a meme </connor>
<joey> but the group is clean what what is </joey>
<garnt> going back to dragon ball fans what is </garnt>
<garnt> dragon ball memes man </garnt>
<connor> did this start on twitter i don't know </connor>
<connor> all right all right we're saying just </connor>
<connor> like drip goku strip coke </connor>
<joey> and then vegeta wearing like the supreme </joey>
<connor> like sweater as well just being like </connor>
<connor> it's clean goku got drip apparently </connor>
<connor> and there would be no drip goku without </connor>
<joey> drip bleaching if it wasn't for bleach </joey>
<joey> there'd be no </joey>
<joey> i feel like every kind of dragon ball </joey>
<joey> meme under the sun has just been like </joey>
<garnt> every cancerous meme in like literally </garnt>
<garnt> cancerous memes yeah in terms of the </garnt>
<garnt> dragon ball </garnt>
<connor> um community like you're lost for words </connor>
<joey> you're like </joey>
<joey> i'm surprised you've never seen it it's </joey>
<connor> all over twitter so you rated the </connor>
<connor> bleach the same as my hero season one </connor>
<joey> would you still stand by that </joey>
<joey> yeah i would because like look again as </joey>
<joey> much as i don't think </joey>
<joey> my hero is like the second coming of </joey>
<joey> christ season one was solid </joey>
<joey> as [ __ ] like i enjoyed it i i would i </joey>
<garnt> would say </garnt>
<joey> for me my hero it goes season two </joey>
<joey> than season one than season three right </joey>
<joey> right we haven't had season four yet </joey>
<connor> have we </connor>
<connor> i don't even know wait no no no no no we </connor>
<connor> haven't i don't think so i wouldn't no </connor>
<connor> we have no </connor>
<joey> i don't [ __ ] this too no no we haven't </joey>
<garnt> no we haven't yeah </garnt>
<garnt> coming out merlin have we had a am i </garnt>
<garnt> here academia season four </garnt>
<joey> it's called it's coming okay season </joey>
<joey> four's coming so </joey>
<connor> so the next one's announced but i i saw </connor>
<connor> on twitter everyone's like the next arc </connor>
<connor> is boring </connor>
<connor> and i was like great so just another </connor>
<connor> year of just mediocre [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> yeah even the biggest even the biggest </joey>
<joey> shonen right now is just like yeah </joey>
<garnt> whatever </garnt>
<garnt> no i mean like the thing is with my hero </garnt>
<garnt> is that i started off really really </garnt>
<garnt> liking it </garnt>
<garnt> and to me to me like out of all the </garnt>
<connor> modern shonen it had the potential to be </connor>
<connor> the greatest right like like he had the </connor>
<connor> potential to reach like a higher ceiling </connor>
<connor> than say </connor>
<connor> something like say black clover or demon </connor>
<connor> slayer or something like that </connor>
<connor> but it seems like the setup is there and </connor>
<connor> the potential is there but there just </connor>
<garnt> hasn't been that moment for me to really </garnt>
<garnt> make me love this and the it seems like </garnt>
<garnt> the more </garnt>
<garnt> the more i watch just the less and less </garnt>
<joey> invest i guess in there well that's how </joey>
<joey> i kind of felt watching season one like </joey>
<joey> you know the first half of season one to </joey>
<joey> me was like okay </joey>
<joey> i like this premise like superheroes </joey>
<joey> quirks okay cool yeah i can see why </joey>
<garnt> people are into this and it's good [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> action scenes were pretty [ __ ] sold </garnt>
<garnt> characters pretty [ __ ] solid </garnt>
<garnt> but then the further along i got i was </garnt>
<garnt> just like yeah all right </garnt>
<garnt> all right yeah it's just it's just a </garnt>
<joey> showing it's it's just good </joey>
<joey> it's just it's just good it's it's it's </joey>
<connor> like i i struggle </connor>
<connor> to find words just to describe how i </connor>
<connor> feel towards it because i'm just like </connor>
<connor> at the beginning i'm just like yeah i've </connor>
<connor> really liked this i'm really hyped for </connor>
<connor> this and the more i watch them i'm just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's good yeah there's not really </garnt>
<connor> much to say about it that's all it is </connor>
<joey> it's just good good it's good it's </joey>
<joey> adequate it's like going to a cousin's </joey>
<connor> birthday party </connor>
<connor> it's just like yeah i'll go i'll go but </connor>
<joey> like you know i'm not that thrilled </joey>

<joey> [ __ ] good </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah that's how i feel that's how </connor>
<connor> the show is that's it yeah exactly </connor>
<joey> but that's the thing like people make it </joey>
<connor> out to be because i'm not you know </connor>
<connor> praising the [ __ ] out of it publicly </connor>
<connor> people immediately think oh joey hates </connor>
<joey> my hair academia i don't hate my </joey>

<joey> it's like it's like it's like people </joey>
<connor> like we're talking about bleach it's </connor>
<connor> like back in bleach days when people </connor>
<connor> said that renji was their favorite i'm </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> what he's just an angry kid like no he's </connor>
<connor> a nice guy secretly and i'm like have </connor>
<joey> you ever met someone who's an [ __ ] in </joey>
<joey> real life </joey>
<garnt> what's weird to me right it's like you </garnt>
<garnt> know the same kind of twitter accounts </garnt>
<garnt> and the same kind of fan base i see like </garnt>
<connor> defending barca and having </connor>
<connor> him as their favorite character is like </connor>
<connor> the same kind of </connor>
<connor> accounts that i see [ __ ] trying to </connor>
<connor> cancel people for like </connor>
<connor> 10 year old tweets or something like </connor>
<garnt> that and i'm like here </garnt>
<garnt> they're trying to cancel people for that </garnt>
<garnt> here they are being like oh i mean </garnt>
<garnt> bucko like was a bully back in back in </garnt>
<garnt> like middle school whatever </garnt>
<garnt> but he's like turned around now he's a </garnt>
<connor> good </connor>
<joey> it's a lot easier to get behind a </joey>
<garnt> fictional character's turnaround story </garnt>
<joey> yeah exactly right like there's people </joey>
<garnt> defending vegeta and he's talking </garnt>
<garnt> he [ __ ] tried to blow up the planet </garnt>
<garnt> two weeks ago man jesus [ __ ] christ </garnt>
<connor> it's all right he's he's a good guy now </connor>
<connor> but speaking of vegeta you you gave </connor>
<joey> dragon ball </joey>
<connor> and dragon ball z both a nine out of ten </connor>
<joey> yeah i thought dragon ball was [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> no that's good oh i know you gotta </connor>
<joey> this puts into perspective how long ago </joey>
<connor> was that i probably put that in </connor>
<connor> like how many [ __ ] rhyme on movies </connor>
<connor> you gave [ __ ] a doraemon movie a </connor>
<connor> masterpiece you give that a 10 and you </connor>
<connor> gonna give the </connor>
<joey> wait which one which star on one movie </joey>
<connor> they're so good there are many </connor>
<joey> 16 you gave a 10. what is special about </joey>
<connor> 16. okay that was like the schindler's </connor>
<joey> list of darim </joey>
<joey> that was the third doramon movie uh i </joey>
<joey> think it's 16. </joey>
<connor> no that the remake is 16. what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> yeah the the original is the third one </joey>
<connor> which i couldn't find </connor>
<connor> which it doesn't exist on my anime list </connor>
<connor> for some reason all right okay but i </connor>
<connor> gave that a 10 purely because i </connor>
<joey> watched that movie that that was one of </joey>
<joey> the first rhyme on movies i ever watched </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> i mean if you guys don't know me right </joey>
<joey> now right yeah i'm a bad guy now </joey>
<connor> yeah it's it's good like honestly like </connor>
<connor> sweat like </connor>
<connor> even now i could probably rewatch that </connor>
<joey> movie and still find it enjoyable </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know durian diamond holds a </joey>
<joey> special place in my heart as you can </joey>
<joey> tell from the amount of [ __ ] door i'm </joey>
<garnt> on movies </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i'm just like i didn't even </garnt>
<connor> know there were this many dare i want me </connor>
<connor> to do they're still making dorado i'm </connor>
<joey> i'm surprised someone else has been </joey>
<joey> watching doraemon </joey>
<joey> like further along than when they were a </joey>
<connor> kid watching on tv because that's the </connor>
<connor> only </connor>
<connor> exposure i've ever had to derive yeah </connor>
<garnt> right i probably would never go out my </garnt>
<joey> way yeah too much a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> one i completely understand if you did </joey>
<connor> not grow up with doraemon </connor>
<connor> i do not blame you for not watching a </connor>
<connor> single diamond movie or episode because </connor>
<connor> that shit's hard to get into as an adult </connor>
<joey> yeah but if you're if you grew up with </joey>
<joey> it like i did then you could easily go </joey>
<garnt> back and i know man to me it's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah as a growing up growing up i would </garnt>
<connor> just like watch the [ __ ] teletubbies </connor>
<joey> movie yeah right </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> like talk to like a niece or something </connor>
<joey> and then you're like oh show me what you </joey>
<joey> watch and you watch it you're like what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] is happening </joey>
<connor> this is [ __ ] it's just wild what is this </connor>
<joey> that's probably what my parents thought </joey>
<joey> when i what the [ __ ] is this blue thing </joey>
<connor> i i noticed you gave full metal </connor>
<connor> alchemist and full metal alchemist </connor>
<joey> brotherhood both </joey>
<joey> are seven yeah why because it's like my </joey>
<joey> hero </joey>
<connor> it was no it wasn't just being a </connor>
<joey> brotherhood is not it's like at least an </joey>
<joey> eight or a nine it wasn't except </joey>
<joey> i mean i can't look acceptable yeah it </joey>
<joey> was except hold on hold on </joey>
<garnt> hold on let me let me let me act uh </garnt>
<garnt> let me act angry okay wait you gave full </garnt>
<garnt> metal alchemist a seven </garnt>
<garnt> how dare you joey how dare you i am so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] offended right now it is the </garnt>
<garnt> audacity of this [ __ ] man </garnt>
<connor> the audacity to the new viewers gone has </connor>
<garnt> never won </garnt>
<garnt> that scene with nina and the dog </garnt>
<garnt> mike did did you not get the feels </garnt>
<connor> i'm not trying to say like you need to </connor>
<connor> give it like a 10. i'm just saying </connor>
<joey> i think it's like minimum okay okay </joey>
<joey> here's the thing with that one i still </joey>
<garnt> stand by that to this day </garnt>
<garnt> because like a lot of people it was not </garnt>
<connor> the first anime i watched </connor>
<garnt> i watched that right way after a kid </garnt>
<connor> yeah me too right right yeah but it was </connor>
<connor> probably one of the first ones you </connor>
<connor> watched right </connor>
<connor> for the first 20. yeah exactly what does </connor>
<joey> that count this might have been in like </joey>
<joey> the first 200 for me </joey>
<connor> but i don't know i feel like out of all </connor>
<connor> the anime i've watched definitely the </connor>
<joey> best story here's the thing </joey>
<joey> my my experience with fullmetal </joey>
<joey> alchemist is basically </joey>
<joey> gone's next step which is because i hear </joey>
<joey> about it so much </joey>
<joey> i watched it out of obligation </joey>
<joey> god hasn't got to the stage i haven't </joey>
<joey> got to that stage </joey>
<connor> every time someone asks me a day gets </connor>
<garnt> added on exactly i'm pretty sure </garnt>
<connor> like and i was like and i was like that </connor>
<connor> as well and i'm just like you know what </connor>
<joey> i got time i'll [ __ ] watch it just </joey>
<connor> because i hear them </connor>
<connor> in the same like sitting or like how did </connor>
<joey> you know i watched so i watched </joey>
<joey> so people were like okay you don't have </joey>
<connor> to watch the first four minutes just </connor>
<joey> watch brotherhood right you hear that </joey>
<connor> all the [ __ ] time but i'm like no no </connor>
<connor> i want to see </connor>
<connor> why people are saying that right so i </connor>
<connor> watched the original </connor>
<connor> and i was like okay this was adequate so </connor>
<joey> brotherhood must be a lot better like a </joey>
<joey> lot lot better </joey>
<joey> that's what i heard yeah i think that i </joey>
<connor> was like yeah it's better but </connor>
<connor> like essentially this serves a point </connor>
<joey> higher better that's essentially no </joey>
<joey> it's not okay the first full metal </joey>
<joey> alchemist is like a low seven </joey>
<connor> and brotherhood is like a high seven </connor>
<joey> call it is </joey>
<connor> that's all it is to me also i'm </connor>
<connor> critiquing your scores here knowing that </connor>
<connor> you know some of these anime i've also </connor>
<connor> scored myself but i have no idea what i </connor>
<connor> said </connor>
<connor> because this is my list was down in 2014 </connor>
<connor> yeah holy [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> seven years ago yeah yeah i see you've </garnt>
<connor> given naruto a six compared to bleach so </connor>
<joey> would you say that you preferred bleach </joey>
<joey> over narrative absolutely </joey>
<joey> i prefer narrative really i have never </joey>
<garnt> dropped a show </garnt>
<garnt> more times than i have narrator like </garnt>
<connor> naruto has been one of those shows </connor>
<connor> where it's like i've i've watched it </connor>
<connor> i've read it and watched it like </connor>
<connor> close to the end yeah but along that way </connor>
<connor> there were so many points throughout </connor>
<connor> naruto where i'm just like </connor>
<joey> uh maybe it's not worth it you didn't </joey>
<joey> get that with bleach at all no i did get </joey>
<joey> that bit of bleach </joey>
<joey> once during the eisenhower that's it </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean bleach for me was just like a </garnt>
<garnt> constant downhill naruto just kind of </garnt>
<garnt> went up and down </garnt>
<garnt> and i i like i think back to i think </garnt>
<garnt> back sometimes when i think is now was </garnt>
<garnt> naruto a good </garnt>
<garnt> show would it would it hold up to this </garnt>
<garnt> day and i still think some of the best </garnt>
<garnt> parts of naruto </garnt>
<garnt> are still like a [ __ ] amazing yeah </garnt>
<joey> no again and that's and that's why i </joey>
<joey> probably gave it a six right because </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i completely understand why it is one of </joey>
<joey> the most </joey>
<garnt> beloved anime out there today right and </garnt>
<garnt> so like i saw parts of that but again </garnt>
<garnt> this was i didn't grow up with naruto </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of people did like this was </garnt>
<garnt> again another show that this is just </garnt>
<garnt> another show </garnt>
<joey> this is just another show right right </joey>
<joey> right yeah so </joey>
<joey> again i'm not saying that naruto is bad </joey>
<joey> i just like to point that out it's not </joey>
<joey> bad </joey>
<garnt> but it's not a 10 out of 10 for me okay </garnt>
<garnt> i'm trying to see what else i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm getting interrogated you know this </garnt>
<garnt> this is an interesting </garnt>
<joey> interrogation this is like weeb </joey>
<joey> interrogation this is like true crime </joey>
<garnt> weeb edition you know </garnt>
<joey> so yes notice his hand movement his </joey>
<joey> hands are off the table saying that he </joey>
<garnt> is quite nervous </garnt>
<garnt> so like we're not we're not like okay so </garnt>
<garnt> what is the lowest one that you've rated </garnt>
<garnt> on here i'm trying to see probably a one </garnt>
<garnt> i'm trying to see oh it's i think it's </garnt>
<joey> pupa oh yeah pupa </joey>
<joey> i i get people one i think i get bulk </joey>
<garnt> and a pico one yeah one of the the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest thing </garnt>
<garnt> that surprised me going through your </garnt>
<garnt> list is okay </garnt>
<garnt> be honest have you completed every anime </garnt>
<connor> you've scored on here yes </connor>
<connor> no way no [ __ ] there's so [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> many </joey>
<joey> except for maybe son </joey>
<joey> you completed </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> honestly think i have finished </joey>
<garnt> everything because like i remember </garnt>
<garnt> one of because when we're gonna get to </garnt>
<garnt> my list one of the reasons why my list </garnt>
<garnt> seems </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot emptier is because if i don't </garnt>
<garnt> complete a show i just don't bother </garnt>
<garnt> putting in my list </garnt>
<joey> right and well that's why i have like </joey>
<joey> the on hold section as well </joey>
<connor> oh you got the [ __ ] when did you stop </connor>
<garnt> updating this man </garnt>
<garnt> you really were the anime man before </garnt>
<connor> this what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you watched so much anime yeah you've </connor>
<connor> also rated tokyo ghoul </connor>
<connor> season one the same as season two right </connor>
<connor> come on they are they are </connor>
<joey> to be fair i would rate what did i give </joey>
<connor> season one and do what do you think you </connor>
<connor> gave season one or two </connor>
<connor> i think i gave season one and two like a </connor>
<connor> seven maybe </connor>
<connor> you did okay yeah okay </connor>
<joey> i would give season two maybe like a </joey>
<connor> four yeah i was gonna say it's like not </connor>
<joey> even remotely the same </joey>
<connor> i give it like a photo i don't know what </connor>
<connor> i was on about </connor>
<connor> yeah i'll give it like a [ __ ] try </connor>
<connor> gunner seven you stand by that </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah really really okay there were </joey>
<connor> a lot of parts about trigon i really </connor>
<joey> enjoyed but i think the problem with </joey>
<joey> trigon is that i was a little too </joey>
<joey> over hyped when i came into it right </joey>
<joey> because i heard so many people being </joey>
<joey> like yo </joey>
<joey> trigon is like same levels as like you </joey>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> barcano cowboy b-boy it's like it's like </connor>
<connor> up there with the big like classic </connor>
<connor> leagues yeah </connor>
<connor> all right i'll get into it and i watched </connor>
<connor> it and again it was good </connor>
<joey> but not to give spoilers but the last </joey>
<joey> quarter of trigon i was like </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is going on yeah really </joey>
<garnt> yeah really yeah i thought the last </garnt>
<connor> quarter of tricom was [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> great it was great i enjoyed it but i </joey>
<connor> was like well i was like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> going on i enjoyed it </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's been a long time i say </garnt>
<joey> this i haven't watched it </joey>
<garnt> in literally a decade yeah i think it's </garnt>
<joey> been a long time </joey>
<joey> it's since i was trying on it uh tempest </joey>
<joey> as well </joey>
<joey> you gave that a seven that is that like </joey>
<joey> if there was a benchmark for seven out </joey>
<connor> of ten shows it would be </connor>
<joey> the tempest it would be no tempest i </joey>
<garnt> actually i i </garnt>
<connor> i can't remember what i wrote it's like </connor>
<connor> the one that's like a isn't it based on </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's based on shakespeare's yeah i mean </connor>
<garnt> was it basically </garnt>
<joey> because i think it was very very loosely </joey>
<garnt> inspired of a shakespeare story i don't </garnt>
<connor> remember which one it was but </connor>
<connor> i gave i gave her points because at the </connor>
<joey> time it was </joey>
<garnt> quite creative and new i really liked it </garnt>
<garnt> like it's one of </garnt>
<connor> i i put zetsune and the tempest in the </connor>
<connor> same category as i do darker than black </connor>
<connor> right when i watch when i when i watched </connor>
<connor> it it was kind of like </connor>
<connor> it when i think back i was like it seems </connor>
<garnt> average in my memory but for some </garnt>
<garnt> but for some reason it sticks with me </garnt>
<garnt> and i always i always think back i </garnt>
<garnt> always think back to the show right </garnt>
<connor> what did you see what did you see what </connor>
<garnt> no i i did finish my point what yuri on </garnt>
<connor> ice </connor>
<connor> were you just trying to get a like piss </connor>
<joey> off twitter that day </joey>
<joey> no i just genuinely thought it was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] boring </joey>
<connor> i just thought it was [ __ ] boring i'm </connor>
<connor> sorry oh come on </connor>
<joey> i don't want to get into this again man </joey>
<joey> like at the time i got </joey>
<connor> so much [ __ ] remember for it </connor>
<connor> did you make an apology video yeah </connor>
<joey> no because people because i said that i </joey>
<joey> didn't like you </joey>
<joey> know you made an apology video it's </joey>
<joey> because at the time </joey>
<joey> at the time like uranus was like the </joey>
<joey> hardest thing right back like i don't </joey>
<joey> know i don't remember when it was like </joey>
<joey> 2016 2017 something like that </joey>
<connor> and uh and all i said in the video was i </connor>
<connor> don't think euronice was uh </connor>
<connor> oh no i said something along the lines </connor>
<connor> of uh 99 of people watch euronice for </connor>
<connor> the yowie elements one percent watch it </connor>
<connor> for the actual sport element </connor>
<connor> and so many euro knife stands called me </connor>
<joey> homosexual because </joey>
<connor> oh sorry not homosexual call me uh </connor>
<connor> they called me uh uh homophobic yeah </connor>
<joey> they call me homophobic because of it </joey>
<joey> uh first of all hey i'm not homophobic </joey>
<connor> you also gave a free of five joey so </connor>
<connor> yeah man </connor>
<connor> pretty bad for this wow wow damn are you </connor>
<joey> because because free i gave a higher </joey>
<joey> score than uranus </joey>
<joey> because again because kyoto animation </joey>
<joey> animated that way better than they did </joey>
<connor> you're on ice i </connor>
<connor> i i don't really think there's any world </connor>
<connor> like any review that you could warrant </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> you're not just below a five like it was </connor>
<connor> a really good story </connor>
<joey> like it was it was minimum five i think </joey>
<joey> what would you give it what would you </joey>
<garnt> give her </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<connor> i would give it a six </connor>
<connor> i think but like you could you </connor>
<connor> reasonably put it below a five like at a </connor>
<connor> four </connor>
<connor> i mean if it's not your thing because </connor>
<connor> the the thing about stories </connor>
<connor> the thing the thing about yuri and ice </connor>
<connor> is that they introduced way too many </connor>
<garnt> characters </garnt>
<garnt> and they just like kind of didn't focus </garnt>
<joey> on any of them also i'm sorry i couldn't </joey>
<joey> stand the main [ __ ] character </joey>
<connor> i love the guy who just came while he's </connor>
<joey> dancing that guy was funny as far oh </joey>
<joey> yeah that one yeah again there were some </joey>
<connor> funny parts </connor>
<connor> there's a reason why i didn't give it a </connor>
<connor> one right like there were some parts </connor>
<connor> about it </connor>
<joey> wow wow there's a reason i didn't give </joey>
<connor> it a one there's a reason i didn't give </connor>
<connor> it a one </connor>
<connor> there were some parts about it but like </connor>
<connor> was it a [ __ ] like slog </connor>
<connor> to watch all of it yeah no it was good i </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<joey> every episode pass i was like i could be </joey>
<connor> watching something else surprised and </connor>
<connor> beat you up for saying something like </connor>
<connor> that yeah </connor>
<joey> i thought you really liked it yeah no </joey>
<joey> she likes it and she's like well that's </joey>
<garnt> your opinion all right </garnt>
<garnt> here's here's something i noticed all </garnt>
<garnt> right uh kisexis </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah seven out of ten </joey>
<garnt> yeah so dude do you wanna explain why </garnt>
<garnt> it's not either like a one or a ten </garnt>
<connor> i'm guessing it's not a one because you </connor>
<connor> know he got you know he came to a </connor>
<joey> realization with his friend </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah no if if i put that </joey>
<garnt> in my list </garnt>
<garnt> like after the first time i watched it </garnt>
<garnt> with my friend i would have given it a </garnt>
<garnt> 10 right </garnt>
<garnt> right right then i rewatched it because </garnt>
<garnt> i was like i was </garnt>
<garnt> i was drunk as [ __ ] when i watched that </garnt>
<garnt> the first time let me rewatch it just to </garnt>
<garnt> double check </garnt>
<connor> there's something and i was like it's </connor>
<connor> good not a 10 though </connor>
<connor> some of these anime i'm like why would </connor>
<connor> you subject yourself to this [ __ ] yeah </connor>

<connor> through some of these shows </connor>
<connor> i'm like i i think there's something </connor>
<connor> wrong something's gone wrong in the head </connor>
<joey> so make you keep watching you have to </joey>
<joey> understand like back in like </joey>
<garnt> 2016 2015 this is all i [ __ ] did like </garnt>
<garnt> no [ __ ] wonder you burnt out anime </garnt>
<garnt> when you're like what when you're </garnt>
<garnt> actually finishing </garnt>
<connor> most of these shows yeah like you know </connor>
<connor> in the movie old boy when that guy is </connor>
<connor> trapped in that room for like 10 years </connor>
<connor> like i'm pretty sure he watched less </connor>
<connor> anime than this like </connor>
<joey> like how do you okay yeah not gonna lie </joey>
<joey> like i'm looking through my list right </joey>
<connor> now and like </connor>
<connor> i i committed my past soul for the fact </connor>
<joey> that i finished infinite straddle season </joey>
<joey> two </joey>
<garnt> finished season one you went through </garnt>
<garnt> season two </garnt>
<joey> that you didn't lie on any of these that </joey>
<joey> you know like okay uh legit </joey>
<joey> other than sazai-san i hundred percent </joey>
<connor> have finished all these all right well </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<connor> and that is like i swear i didn't like </connor>
<joey> grave a little [ __ ] reaction there </joey>
<joey> say [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i swear i finished i mean overall your </joey>
<connor> list is like </connor>
<connor> exactly what i'd expected yeah like you </connor>
<connor> you give the shows that are universally </connor>
<connor> accepted to be good good ratings </connor>
<joey> right yeah is the university to be bad </joey>
<joey> bad ratings yeah i mean i have good </joey>
<connor> taste what can i say </connor>
<connor> the public tastes i don't think i have </connor>
<connor> the publicity </connor>
<connor> in life i gave you a nice three that's </connor>
<connor> far from public taste yeah you can't </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> just do one that was your one that was </connor>
<garnt> your one whole take i wouldn't notice </garnt>
<joey> you gave charlotte to seven </joey>
<joey> yeah and that's a pretty high score for </joey>
<joey> what i think yeah i would </joey>
<garnt> in june my eight is like worst piece of </garnt>
<joey> work yeah i would give that </joey>
<joey> realistically like a fire would you say </joey>
<connor> if the director is esteemed or like the </connor>
<connor> showmakers are esteemed you're more </connor>
<connor> likely to </connor>
<joey> give a fairer review i think if i'm a </joey>
<joey> fan </joey>
<joey> of like the the creator or like the </joey>
<joey> studio or like someone in the production </joey>
<joey> team </joey>
<joey> then i'm more willing to give it like </joey>
<joey> you know say like charlotte right like </joey>
<joey> that's a matter of june production </joey>
<joey> and like i love everything managing </joey>
<joey> makes but so i gave it a seven but </joey>
<joey> realistically thinking back on charlotte </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> realistically i give it like a four or </joey>
<connor> five so this is why i'm the perfect </connor>
<connor> critic because uh i just don't know </connor>
<joey> anything </joey>
<joey> you don't like anybody i go into the </joey>
<joey> show and um i don't even know what the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] the studio made this like let's </connor>
<connor> just watch </connor>
<joey> yeah exactly so it's like bones who's </joey>
<garnt> bones what is bones you gave another </garnt>
<joey> nine </joey>
<joey> yeah what </joey>
<connor> what no you don't stand by that right no </connor>
<connor> come on i would still give it like an </connor>
<connor> eight </connor>
<connor> oh yeah i really enjoyed it i don't care </connor>
<connor> what anyone says i really enjoy but then </connor>
<garnt> again i'm a [ __ ] horror anime simp </garnt>
<connor> so that's like an anagram for i have </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] taste yeah that's what i like </garnt>
<garnt> because there is no good horror anime </garnt>
<connor> what do you mean there's there's there's </connor>
<connor> everyone okay </connor>
<connor> i mean that's i risk my case that's </connor>
<garnt> that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's a horror in the same way that </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] monster is a horror you </garnt>
<connor> know what i mean yeah monsters are </connor>
<connor> no that's that that's that's a horror </connor>
<connor> the same way that [ __ ] grave of </connor>
<connor> fireflies is a horror like it's </connor>
<joey> different kind of vibe bro what are you </joey>
<joey> talking about you know </joey>
<connor> i mean it's not like it's scary scary </connor>
<joey> you know it's kind of like this i don't </joey>
<joey> know man i was pretty [ __ ] on edge </joey>
<joey> when i watched modern okay </joey>
<connor> it's unnerving but it's not like like </connor>
<joey> it's definitely not on the same </joey>
<joey> kind of genre as another which is just </joey>
<garnt> final destination </garnt>
<garnt> the anime adaptation but even campia and </garnt>
<joey> i like the campiness of it i don't know </joey>
<garnt> i really enjoyed it i love my [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> like to me another was like a really </joey>
<garnt> good b great horror are </garnt>
<garnt> you trying to defend the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> umbrella scene </garnt>
<garnt> yes how did you not burst out laughing </garnt>
<garnt> when that happened man </garnt>
<garnt> maybe because i watched it the entire </garnt>
<connor> the entire last two episode </connor>
<garnt> episode the entire last two episodes was </garnt>
<garnt> just a [ __ ] slapstick </garnt>
<garnt> yeah comedy i might as well </garnt>
<garnt> i really love the campiness of it i </garnt>
<connor> don't know why all right </connor>
<connor> all right [ __ ] that i i completely get </connor>
<connor> why people hate another i thought i just </connor>

<garnt> my teenage uh </garnt>
<joey> taste i'm guessing sorry i i can i can </joey>

<connor> you're still dead to me </connor>
<connor> what do you think you gave i can make a </connor>
<connor> kill </connor>
<joey> you're curious i was about to is it is </joey>
<connor> it really low </connor>
<joey> i'm just curious what would you rate it </joey>
<connor> today if i asked you to rate i can make </connor>
<connor> a kill </connor>
<garnt> like two really two it's not that bad </garnt>
<connor> yeah i i would also give it a second </connor>
<connor> it's pretty bad it's pretty [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> okay wait wait wait wait wait you gave </joey>
<joey> it four you gave it a four okay okay </joey>
<joey> good good </joey>
<joey> yeah teenage me i'd say okay i can't </joey>
<garnt> make a kill was one of those shows </garnt>
<garnt> where i thought was awful and then all </garnt>
<garnt> the comments were </garnt>
<garnt> the manga's better the manga is better </garnt>
<garnt> trust me guys the manga is better so it </garnt>
<garnt> was one of those few times </garnt>
<garnt> why i call them on their bluff right i </garnt>
<garnt> called the manga readers on their bluff </garnt>
<garnt> and i read the manga up to the end right </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> this is just the same [ __ ] just </garnt>
<garnt> elongated you know what i mean </garnt>
<garnt> everyone was complaining about the anime </garnt>
<garnt> only ending of a karmico kill </garnt>
<garnt> but the manga is like equally as edgy </garnt>
<garnt> but it just it just elongates </garnt>
<garnt> it just has a different ending and it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> equally as bad in my view you also rated </garnt>
<joey> alden uh zero yeah </joey>
<joey> you gave it a six yeah you gave that </joey>
<joey> season one to six and and season two or </joey>
<garnt> six but season two come on it's </garnt>
<garnt> infinitely worse than season </garnt>
<garnt> one i don't know what i was thinking uh </garnt>
<connor> season one i know zero season one is </connor>
<connor> actually like pretty decent i think yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah you talk good of stuff about i'll </joey>
<garnt> know i i don't know zero season one i </garnt>
<connor> don't remember why </connor>
<connor> you maybe finished both of them at the </connor>
<connor> same time like you maybe </connor>
<garnt> maybe i'm pissed off with the [ __ ] maybe </garnt>
<connor> because because i remember i don't know </connor>
<garnt> season one </garnt>
<garnt> being pretty interesting and then like </garnt>
<garnt> it was </garnt>
<garnt> it was great and then the cliffhanger </garnt>
<garnt> season ending happened and it was just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> holy [ __ ] this is super interesting and </garnt>
<garnt> then season two just kind of pissed on </garnt>
<garnt> everything that season one he said she </garnt>
<connor> became like kirito and stuff </connor>
<connor> like being the goddess i know this is </connor>
<joey> like teenage gods list because </joey>
<connor> okay dude </connor>
<garnt> okay okay i i still stand by that yeah </garnt>
<joey> it is it is </joey>
<joey> season two and eight as well season two </joey>
<connor> is not as good as season one </connor>
<connor> i've </connor>
<joey> it's like a comedy like kind of trashy </joey>
<joey> like romance itchy sounds vital yeah to </joey>
<connor> be honest i like it so i thought it was </connor>
<connor> really good </connor>
<connor> he was pretty good human ambassador for </connor>
<connor> domestic girlfriends he was right up his </connor>
<garnt> phone </garnt>
<garnt> it was like one of the first comedy </garnt>
<garnt> anime that actually made me laugh and </garnt>
<garnt> i i didn't think was generic </garnt>
<garnt> and now that i look back i think yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> was probably pretty generic i don't know </garnt>
<connor> like i look at the art style and i'm </connor>
<connor> just like this is premium mid-2000s </connor>
<connor> anime it is </connor>
<connor> nothing interesting to say about this </connor>
<connor> you gave uh baccano at 10 as well i like </connor>
<joey> that i like </joey>
<joey> that yeah i i i think we all get back in </joey>
<connor> our attention </connor>
<connor> on my list i don't know what that's what </connor>
<garnt> that's why i'm curious to see what your </garnt>
<garnt> three by threes are because that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's where that's where like </garnt>
<connor> the real personality test comes in hold </connor>
<connor> on i gotta ask that maylene </connor>
<garnt> do we have beers oh no nabi gave me some </garnt>
<connor> beers </connor>
<connor> okay i'm just checking i need to make </connor>
<connor> sure okay okay okay because it would be </connor>
<connor> fine oh no no we </connor>
<connor> we also have oh yeah we got the </connor>
<connor> pickering we also have piccara um </connor>
<joey> you like that like conor you're right </joey>
<joey> you like that </joey>
<connor> we we're gonna we're gonna be smashing </connor>
<connor> some of this </connor>
<connor> so i noticed as well that you also gave </connor>
<joey> uh batum an eight </joey>
<joey> yeah joey gave batum a six yeah yeah i </joey>
<joey> actually would side more with god on </joey>
<connor> this one </connor>
<joey> even though it did end kind of [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<connor> wasn't the ending absolute [ __ ] but </connor>
<connor> the show was really fun and the show </connor>
<joey> opening was a bang </joey>
<garnt> opening [ __ ] ten out of ten dude </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] ten hour ten opening yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> soon the show </garnt>
<garnt> that was just pure fun i don't know like </garnt>
<garnt> it is </garnt>
<joey> dude it was good it was it was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> great it was one of the few death games </joey>
<joey> that didn't feel like it was one a uh </joey>
<joey> battle royale rip-off right because the </joey>
<joey> problem with every death game anime </joey>
<joey> is that it feels like of like a virgin </joey>
<joey> battle royale you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> that's real did it and like why would </joey>
<garnt> you why would i want to watch anything </garnt>
<joey> else </joey>
<garnt> but soon just it was just like you </garnt>
<joey> didn't try to pretend that i wasn't a </joey>
<joey> battle royale rip-off </joey>
<garnt> but it just like really worked it went </garnt>
<joey> off that and it just was a hell of a lot </joey>
<joey> of fun i don't know i think i gave it a </joey>
<joey> lower score i think when i first </joey>
<joey> finished it i </joey>
<joey> also gave her maybe like a seven or an </joey>
<joey> eight but then i read the manga and i </joey>
<joey> was like oh yeah compared to that wasn't </joey>
<connor> that great </connor>
<connor> i guess for some reason like batum has </connor>
<connor> always been one of those shows like </connor>
<connor> stuck with me i don't know why like i've </connor>
<connor> always just one of the season two i mean </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah i i always </garnt>
<connor> i still think about it and i still think </connor>
<garnt> about why it didn't have a season two </garnt>
<garnt> and like i i know sydney read the manga </garnt>
<joey> and she said the manga is also pretty </joey>
<joey> good </joey>
<joey> yeah the manga is way better is it </joey>
<connor> actually good yeah the manga is way </connor>
<connor> better </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah okay you gave aramonga 10 so </joey>
<joey> you did to me </joey>
<connor> but you are my brother because you gave </connor>
<joey> ganks over 10 which i also agree with </joey>
<connor> yes </connor>
<connor> you gave code geoff season one to ten </connor>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> code gear season two and eight oh what </garnt>
<garnt> are your thoughts on that okay </garnt>
<connor> okay okay i'm interested okay i've okay </connor>
<connor> so i </connor>
<connor> i remember giving it a ten okay so the </connor>
<connor> thing about code yes right </connor>
<connor> is i gave it a 10 the first time i </connor>
<connor> watched it because i thought it was like </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] masterpiece it was perfect it </connor>
<connor> was everything </connor>
<garnt> uh i recently uh not recently like i </garnt>
<garnt> really watched code yes with sydney </garnt>
<garnt> and there was a lot of flaws in season </garnt>
<garnt> one that i guess i just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of ignored as a kid or just like i </garnt>
<garnt> kind of forgot about yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like okay like i remember re-watching it </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> why is there an episode dedicated to </garnt>
<garnt> chasing a cat and how did i just blank </garnt>
<connor> this from my memory </connor>
<connor> like that that </connor>
<garnt> because i remember first watching coke </garnt>
<garnt> yes it was like easy 10 out of 10. this </garnt>
<garnt> is like </garnt>
<garnt> the greatest anime can become and i </garnt>
<garnt> think i just remembered the good points </garnt>
<garnt> of codekias because there was a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> plot holes and everything like it's how </garnt>
<garnt> can we spoil code geass </garnt>
<connor> yeah i think i think it's you know i </connor>
<connor> mean we're gonna spoil cookies okay so </connor>
<connor> it's universally </connor>
<connor> it's okay it's like this gives skip to </connor>
<connor> this skip to this time stamp below </connor>
<connor> because code yes if you haven't watched </connor>
<connor> kgs and you want to watch it </connor>
<connor> it's one of the most spoilable shows um </connor>
<connor> out there but </connor>
<connor> i i remember re-watching it and i'm just </connor>
<garnt> like man they were they really </garnt>
<garnt> they really had to like twist the plot </garnt>
<garnt> in order to make </garnt>
<garnt> nina or what was not nina um euphemia </garnt>
<garnt> just [ __ ] massacre </garnt>
<garnt> everyone right right because they </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember watching it i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> thinking </garnt>
<garnt> man the plot's kind of over now </garnt>
<connor> everything's sorted and it was just </connor>
<garnt> it was just the most racism is over </garnt>
<connor> everyone go home it was just the most </connor>
<garnt> roundabout way </garnt>
<garnt> of like okay guys we're going to make </garnt>
<garnt> the plot continue how can we make the </garnt>
<garnt> plot continue </garnt>
<garnt> and it was literally it was it was </garnt>
<joey> literally a scene where lelouch goes </joey>
<joey> ha-ha wouldn't it be funny if i told you </joey>
<joey> to kill the japanese </joey>
<joey> ha ha psych x and and then and then it </joey>
<joey> wasn't like it did happen right </joey>
<joey> yeah and like and like i just i just </joey>
<connor> remembered </connor>
<connor> thinking well i remember thinking as a </connor>
<connor> kid that was a huge plot twist and now </connor>
<connor> watching is </connor>
<joey> watching as an adult i'm just like this </joey>
<joey> is stupid i'm just like </joey>
<connor> this this kind of this kind of doesn't </connor>
<connor> make sense this this is kind of pretty </connor>
<connor> pretty cheap right there </connor>
<connor> this is pretty cheap writing yeah um so </connor>
<garnt> yeah like i would now i would give </garnt>
<garnt> code geass season one maybe an </garnt>
<connor> eight i think because the highs of code </connor>
<joey> geos are so good </joey>
<connor> yeah like you you almost forgive it the </connor>
<joey> highs are very high so you like you </joey>
<connor> forgive it for a lot of the [ __ ] it does </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then season two was like that was </garnt>
<connor> that was </connor>
<garnt> i don't know what it is about season two </garnt>
<connor> that was like a car crash that somehow </connor>
<garnt> yeah season two was a car crash that </garnt>
<connor> somehow perfectly parallel parked </connor>
<garnt> like it was </garnt>
<garnt> it was like absolute disaster and </garnt>
<garnt> somehow it like just </garnt>
<garnt> landed it landed its ending perfectly </garnt>
<joey> and i remember re-watching cody's r2 </joey>
<joey> after season one and i and aft going on </joey>
<joey> the problems i had was season one </joey>
<joey> season two just took all the like small </joey>
<joey> problems with season one and just </joey>
<joey> extrapolated to them </joey>
<joey> so like let's take every stupid every </joey>
<joey> stupid plot twist in season one and just </joey>
<joey> make it ten times bigger </joey>
<garnt> true and i think the the exact moment </garnt>
<garnt> that lost me in season two was like it </garnt>
<garnt> was </garnt>
<garnt> it was lelouch it was the i am you know </garnt>
<garnt> i am spartacine but just with lelouch </garnt>
<garnt> and i just thought okay this this is not </garnt>
<joey> this is not cleverly it's just stupid </joey>
<joey> and everything up to that till like the </joey>
<connor> final three episodes was [ __ ] dumb </connor>
<connor> but they just they stick the landing man </connor>
<connor> but like the ending is </connor>
<connor> still i think the best ending ever </connor>
<connor> inanimate </connor>
<connor> thing yeah i i i i would think i'd agree </connor>
<connor> with that i would think it's probably </connor>
<garnt> the best of the top my head the best </garnt>
<joey> ending anime has produced so far </joey>
<garnt> so god was that an unpopular opinion god </garnt>
<garnt> no god knows god knows okay hold on a </garnt>
<joey> second i'd like to point out uh for </joey>
<joey> someone who says he doesn't like </joey>
<joey> jubilee films he uh you gave mononoke a </joey>
<joey> 10. </joey>
<joey> yeah will you stick by that because if </joey>
<joey> you do then i can high-five you but if </joey>
<joey> not </joey>
<garnt> the backhand is coming okay um what did </garnt>
<garnt> i give spirited away </garnt>
<garnt> uh let me see because i </garnt>
<joey> i think thinking back what an okay is </joey>
<connor> one of my you gave spirited away in nine </connor>
<garnt> okay then yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah i i really had to </joey>
<joey> think about that </joey>
<joey> because i don't like ghibli films but i </joey>
<joey> think mononoke and spirit of the way are </joey>
<garnt> some of the few wear </garnt>
<garnt> i i i i still good i still </garnt>
<joey> like them i also love how you gave gyo a </joey>
<joey> six </joey>
<joey> that's pretty [ __ ] high if you ask me </joey>
<connor> i thought it was good </connor>
<garnt> i just uh have you read the manga i have </garnt>
<connor> read the monk how did you give it a six </connor>
<connor> first i </connor>
<connor> i watched i think i gave it a like yeah </connor>
<connor> it was like shinjito </connor>
<joey> is a ginger manga that uh and they made </joey>
<garnt> a movie about it like five years ago and </garnt>
<garnt> it is </garnt>
<garnt> horrendous i i think it is i think it </garnt>
<joey> was a fun movie </joey>
<joey> i i had a fun time watching okay i was </joey>
<joey> so sad watching it </joey>
<joey> because the thing about gyo is that i </joey>
<joey> watched the anime not knowing any </joey>
<joey> background about </joey>
<joey> it not knowing it was junji youtube i </joey>
<garnt> thought it was just a campy b </garnt>
<joey> movie horror movie which is which is </joey>
<joey> what it is </joey>
<joey> which it is but i remember because i </joey>
<joey> went into there thinking it was going to </joey>
<joey> be </joey>
<joey> absolute trash and i watched it and </joey>
<joey> despite it actually being you know </joey>
<joey> trashy </joey>
<joey> and it was trash it gave me the same </joey>
<joey> kind of enjoyment as you do watching a </joey>
<joey> shitty b movie </joey>
<joey> b movie horror yeah because it wasn't </joey>
<joey> like it was shitty animation because gyo </joey>
<garnt> the movie was animated by ufotable yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and man they </garnt>
<garnt> you can see some effort being put into </garnt>
<joey> this yeah but you also gotta admit that </joey>
<joey> like the the 3d </joey>
<joey> some of the 3d elements i was just like </joey>
<joey> god this is ugly but is that a good </joey>
<joey> thing because it's a horror like </joey>
<connor> i don't even know if in 2012 it wasn't </connor>
<garnt> you know they weren't very good yeah no </garnt>
<garnt> it was compared to some of the 3d that </garnt>
<garnt> came out in 2012 compared to like </garnt>
<connor> studio gonzo gans 3d which just makes me </connor>
<connor> want to vomit when i think </connor>
<connor> think about it don't remind me like like </connor>
<connor> it was it was good looking 3d </connor>
<garnt> yeah sure like you fightable put some </garnt>
<garnt> effort into that and i and i </garnt>
<garnt> respect them for doing that uh you </garnt>
<connor> watched halo legends </connor>
<connor> i think i think you're the only person </connor>
<connor> on my anime list who watched i didn't </connor>
<connor> even know there was an anime for halo </connor>
<connor> yeah oh my god </connor>
<connor> r.i.p to the other 19 000 people who </connor>
<connor> have rated this show </connor>
<garnt> for some reason i think i watched i </garnt>
<garnt> think i watched that </garnt>
<garnt> that was my stint when i watched that </garnt>
<garnt> and the mass effect anime as well which </garnt>
<connor> what do you think you give halo legends </connor>
<connor> did i say did i say what are you doing i </connor>
<connor> don't think so i didn't </connor>
<connor> i can't i i i had a a foregone </connor>
<connor> okay good good wow okay i i stick by </connor>
<joey> that hold on a second you gave </joey>
<connor> re-zero season one a six </connor>
<joey> did i actually oh no what's that about </joey>
<joey> oh okay why why this okay okay </joey>
<joey> i don't know why i gave it a six i think </joey>
<joey> i think it was because everyone was </joey>
<joey> hyping it up and i was </joey>
<joey> i want to be different i was kind of </joey>
<joey> underwhelmed by it right um now </joey>
<joey> i because i have rewatched zero in </joey>
<joey> preparation for season two </joey>
<joey> um i would give it a seven but i </joey>
<joey> remember </joey>
<joey> i remember coming out of re-zero just </joey>
<connor> feeling empty right </connor>
<connor> and it just it just kinda it just no </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> it kind of like i had a good f i had a </connor>
<connor> good time watching it and it just i it </connor>
<connor> was just like gut reaction of </connor>
<connor> it was a good time and i'm probably </connor>
<joey> going to forget this show in a few years </joey>
<connor> and it just it's just yeah i i didn't </connor>
<joey> end up getting it so </joey>
<joey> i i also gave space dandy a six as well </joey>
<connor> i really like space i really liked it </connor>
<joey> too i i if you </joey>
<connor> look at it like a saturday morning </connor>
<garnt> cartoon it's pretty fun yeah </garnt>
<joey> space dandy was it was a very hit or </joey>
<joey> miss for me </joey>
<joey> it was you gave sword online amazon </joey>
<joey> online 2 also was 6. </joey>
<joey> in god's opinion space dandy and sao on </joey>
<connor> the same level </connor>
<connor> on top of that he also gave uh guilty </connor>
<joey> crown of five so would you say that </joey>
<joey> would you say that sao is better than's </joey>
<connor> but going to sao versus space dandy i </connor>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> i i've rate this based on my pure </connor>
<connor> enjoyment and space standing was either </connor>
<connor> like nine on enjoyment or a two </connor>
<connor> depending on the episode which is </connor>
<connor> probably why i rated it at six </connor>
<connor> there was some killer episodes and then </connor>
<connor> there was some episodes that were just </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] drag where sword art online </connor>
<connor> was just </connor>
<joey> was just like a constant it was it was a </joey>
<joey> plateau it </joey>
<garnt> was it was just a constant six i watched </garnt>
<connor> this i'm trash i enjoy this whatever </connor>
<connor> move on you know what i mean you care to </connor>
<connor> explain this one okay </connor>
<joey> jojo seven what's up with that come on </joey>

<connor> just want to get angry </connor>
<connor> i just wanted to you know get riled up a </connor>
<joey> little bit you also gave a totoro an </joey>
<connor> eight </connor>
<garnt> okay that's wrong i don't know what what </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] was i </garnt>
<garnt> thinking what they're trying to look </garnt>
<garnt> like i had good taste oh my god no it's </garnt>
<garnt> a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> four what what do you think you gave </connor>
<connor> kuroko no basket </connor>
<connor> eight you did yeah i'm surprised i </connor>
<connor> honestly thought you would we would bash </connor>
<connor> krokor no more i love coraco </connor>
<garnt> yeah for some reason i thought you hated </garnt>
<garnt> crap i love crocodiles no i i love croco </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> i it was my it was kuroka was a sports </garnt>
<garnt> anime that got me back into sports anime </garnt>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<connor> so no i i i watched </connor>
<connor> all of makaku city actors yeah i noticed </connor>
<joey> that </joey>
<connor> he gave it a fall which i would also </connor>
<joey> agree with </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] how did you sit through </joey>
<connor> all that it was just </connor>
<garnt> i don't know i liked the aesthetic and i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know why it was just </garnt>
<garnt> maybe i was just high that day and i </garnt>
<garnt> just i was so disappointed with that </garnt>
<garnt> because i love the novels yeah because </garnt>
<joey> it's completely </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] destroyed it it was it was me </joey>
<garnt> going through </garnt>
<connor> it it was me after watching bucky </connor>
<connor> monogatari and going through the shaft </connor>
<connor> type right i'm just like this is going </connor>
<connor> to get better </connor>
<connor> this is my studio shaft i i legitimately </connor>
<garnt> thought that </garnt>
<connor> makaku city actors was like a gay porn </connor>
<connor> novel because of the internet </connor>
<connor> because all you ever see about makaku </connor>
<joey> city actors online is like gay stuff </joey>
<joey> yeah it is yeah there's a little there's </joey>
<joey> a large fujioshi fan base for mega city </joey>
<garnt> and bro the opium kaka city actors is </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] banger oh </garnt>
<connor> i still listen to that [ __ ] it's great </connor>
<connor> all the time uh </connor>
<garnt> what uh what do you think you you gave </garnt>
<connor> monster </connor>
<garnt> did i give it a 10. you did okay good i </garnt>
<connor> honestly i would agree </connor>
<connor> i'd stand by that yeah i would yeah i </connor>
<connor> love monster yeah </connor>
<connor> it's one of those animes that like i </connor>
<connor> dropped and then came back to </connor>
<connor> yeah and that i was so glad that i </connor>
<connor> picked back up because it's obviously </connor>
<connor> it's really [ __ ] slow in the start </connor>
<garnt> it is really slow but i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> monster is </garnt>
<garnt> of rarity of an anime where it's an </garnt>
<garnt> anime that has </garnt>
<garnt> an amazing manga that could have easily </garnt>
<garnt> be sliced up and have a shitty </garnt>
<garnt> adaptation but monster is one of the few </garnt>
<garnt> epic like masterpiece manga they got a </garnt>
<joey> masterpiece adaptation </joey>
<joey> so i mean like thank god it got 70 </joey>
<garnt> something episodes that are dead yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah could you imagine if monsters are </garnt>
<joey> twenty-four </joey>
<joey> that's why that's why i'm scared for the </joey>
<joey> 20th century boys ever </joey>
<garnt> gets adapted man because that's like </garnt>
<garnt> monster but even longer and even more </garnt>
<joey> also i find it hilarious he gave </joey>
<joey> ikitorsen a too </joey>
<garnt> is like imagine imagine like the </garnt>
<connor> show that birth shows like high school </connor>
<connor> of the dead </connor>
<connor> it is a battle fan service show </connor>
<garnt> and back in the day this was the most </garnt>
<garnt> degenerate kind of fan service the titty </garnt>
<garnt> action show you could do like so many </garnt>
<joey> like weir boomers [ __ ] love ikito </joey>
<connor> yeah and guys just like </connor>
<joey> nope [ __ ] your memories it's [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> no i mean i look back now and maybe i'd </garnt>
<joey> rate it higher i don't know it's uh </joey>
<joey> i i would rate it like maybe like a four </joey>
<joey> purely because it's just so tragic i </joey>
<garnt> mean like back in back in the day this </garnt>
<garnt> was all we had you know </garnt>
<garnt> nowadays there's so much trash anime and </garnt>
<garnt> trash </garnt>
<garnt> kind of fan service he shows but back in </garnt>
<garnt> the day it was kind of like ikitosun </garnt>
<connor> and then nothing else nothing really </connor>
<connor> else there's nothing like the guitar </connor>
<connor> you gave zetsuno tempest to seven as </connor>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> yeah i feel like i need to watch it </connor>
<connor> again give your own isis seven as well </connor>
<connor> a try gunner nine that's fair yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> tokyo ghouls season one of six </connor>
<connor> and two google season </connor>
<connor> it's one of the shows where i don't know </connor>
<joey> if the manga readers are right because </joey>
<joey> everyone talks about the tokyo ghoul </joey>
<joey> mark has anyone have you guys read the </joey>
<joey> tokyo ghoul manga </joey>
<joey> no okay okay so nobody knows if the </joey>
<joey> if the manga readers were right for </joey>
<joey> tokyo ghoul but apparently it's one of </joey>
<joey> the most popular manga out there and one </joey>
<joey> the highest i find it interesting how </joey>
<joey> you gave dunmuch your five </joey>
<garnt> yeah by that yeah it's it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> sword art online but beat us all out </garnt>
<connor> online so i thought art online was like </connor>
<connor> why was that show so popular when it </connor>
<joey> came out i thought it was acceptable </joey>
<joey> i gave it maybe like a six so i was just </joey>
<connor> doing some passionate rant there right </connor>
<joey> now you thought it was good and you're </joey>
<connor> like i thought it was good </connor>
<connor> i thought it was acceptable and there </connor>
<connor> was a business prison school and eight </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i stand by that prison school </connor>
<garnt> is one of the most i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> disregarding the ending of the manga it </garnt>
<connor> is one of the most hilarious mangas i've </connor>
<connor> met </connor>
<connor> i've read and the anime adaptation did a </connor>
<garnt> pretty good [ __ ] job </garnt>
<garnt> you gave warren to sarah for five yeah i </garnt>
<connor> wasn't sure if i should comment on that </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<joey> offended by that not really man i've </joey>
<joey> never watched this i have no idea i'm </joey>
<connor> curious </connor>
<connor> psycho pass a seven yeah season one </connor>
<connor> really </connor>
<garnt> really i know i thought no better no </garnt>
<connor> it's uh nine now </connor>
<connor> yeah okay thank god like psychopaths i </connor>
<connor> remember psychopath is one of those few </connor>
<connor> shows that has </connor>
<connor> stuck with me and it's it's one of the </connor>
<connor> shows where i </connor>
<connor> re-watched it and i loved it </connor>
<connor> way more re-watching it than i watched </connor>
<connor> the first time because i think what's so </connor>
<connor> damn good yeah i think i didn't </connor>
<connor> appreciate psychopaths </connor>
<connor> the first time i watched it but the more </connor>
<connor> i watched psychopaths the more i'm just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> now i like i gave it a 7 when i first </connor>
<joey> watched it and </joey>
<joey> when i was doing my when i was thinking </joey>
<joey> back to like my </joey>
<joey> top 10 favorite anime of the decade of </joey>
<joey> like the 2010s yeah psychopaths was up </joey>
<joey> there oh yeah </joey>
<joey> because it still has some like the </joey>
<joey> villain was one of the best villains in </joey>
<joey> anime </joey>
<joey> it still has some of the most unique </joey>
<joey> ideas </joey>
<joey> that i've seen in anime that has like </joey>
<joey> stuck with me and i don't think has aged </joey>
<joey> at all um </joey>
<garnt> yeah like the like the scene halfway </garnt>
<garnt> through </garnt>
<garnt> where the main character has to make a </garnt>
<garnt> choice that that </garnt>
<garnt> has stuck with me for a long time and </garnt>
<garnt> the one scene that has also stuck with </garnt>
<garnt> me </garnt>
<garnt> is um i can't remember what exactly what </garnt>
<garnt> episode it is </garnt>
<garnt> but it's the episode where this </garnt>
<garnt> they start beating the [ __ ] out of this </garnt>
<garnt> character in like the middle of the </garnt>
<garnt> street </garnt>
<garnt> right and because of the system that's </garnt>
<connor> been set up </connor>
<connor> no one reacts just because they they've </connor>
<connor> never seen something like this before </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and i don't know i i thought that was </connor>
<connor> like such a unique idea </connor>
<connor> like that has that was completely </connor>
<connor> natural in this world that genorabuchi </connor>
<connor> has built </connor>
<connor> yeah um it's i think it's what the world </connor>
<connor> building is like yeah amazing i think </connor>
<connor> it's unfortunate </connor>
<connor> i think the biggest unfortunate thing is </connor>
<garnt> that season two </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah i haven't watched season three </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but they just didn't have as </garnt>
<garnt> interesting ideas as what was in season </garnt>
<connor> one but yeah </connor>

<joey> [ __ ] about pokemon guys </joey>
<connor> this is all nostalgia talking here i've </connor>
<garnt> i'm i'm talking </garnt>
<garnt> i rated this as an adult or a teenager </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> years [ __ ] after pokemon man like get </garnt>
<connor> get your nostalgia talk out of here </connor>
<connor> pokemon wasn't that great </connor>
<connor> i need to [ __ ] be a gun but again but </connor>
<joey> i'm pretty sure you gave </joey>
<garnt> me more than eight okay yes yes yes </garnt>
<garnt> digimon is better than pokemon i will </garnt>
<garnt> fight you on this </garnt>
<garnt> i i was the digimon kid digimon the </garnt>
<connor> first movie </connor>
<garnt> was [ __ ] brilliant did you have an </garnt>
<connor> amazing soundtrack the digimon kid is </connor>
<connor> like the og neighbors kid you know what </connor>
<joey> i mean yeah </joey>
<connor> that that meme of like oh go and look </connor>
<connor> after the neighbor's kid oh is he weird </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like he's a digimon fan you </joey>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> i bet you were the kind of kid who was </connor>
<joey> like i don't play yu-gi-oh i play duel </joey>
<joey> masters </joey>
<connor> refuses to duel without the brakes yeah </connor>
<garnt> exactly no </garnt>
<joey> wait did you did either of you watch </joey>
<joey> digimon yeah i did so you so </joey>
<garnt> i only watched i only watched the movies </garnt>
<garnt> okay but are you are you still sticking </garnt>
<garnt> by the way </garnt>
<connor> i mean i watched them both at the same </connor>
<connor> age and i preferred pokemon really </connor>
<garnt> yeah because digimon's digimon had an </garnt>
<connor> actual plot </connor>
<connor> okay i think at that age that wasn't my </connor>
<connor> concern yeah </connor>
<joey> i think i think at that age the concern </joey>
<connor> is which monsters look cool </connor>
<connor> i think i think the thing was right is </connor>
<joey> that i would watch pokemon and then go </joey>
<joey> play pokemon and be like yo this is </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> exactly i would play digimon go and play </joey>
<connor> one of the [ __ ] disgusting rpg games </connor>

<connor> couldn't do anything i'm like what sick </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] made this for a children's tv show </garnt>

<connor> i i actually watched the pokemon anime </connor>
<connor> years before like i played the actual </connor>
<connor> games for the first time </connor>
<connor> really and the the thing that stuck out </connor>
<connor> to me for digimon was that </connor>
<connor> even as a kid i could recognize that </connor>
<garnt> this had story arcs you know </garnt>
<garnt> like like like even as a kid i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like what you are the most pretentious </garnt>

<joey> so far </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of shows that where you </joey>
<connor> haven't even given a score yeah i think </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of them i'm just like this </connor>
<garnt> is so [ __ ] i don't even want to give it </garnt>
<connor> a like hold up </connor>
<garnt> don't [ __ ] tell me anything until </garnt>
<connor> i've had my beer okay no i don't know </connor>
<connor> we're starting now we're starting now </connor>
<connor> it's hard you better prepare your </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] anus here </garnt>
<garnt> so like what was it okay justin </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] buccaneer stan gave baccano </garnt>
<joey> and mistakes </joey>
<joey> joey you'll taste the [ __ ] the job is so </joey>
<joey> much better eight out of ten yeah i </joey>
<connor> don't know why i did that i mean you </connor>
<connor> know really </connor>
<connor> clearly i was a fool i don't know who </connor>
<connor> that person is who signed into my heart </connor>
<garnt> and changed my score </garnt>
<connor> i love the fact that he gave bucky </connor>
<garnt> monica a higher score than parker </garnt>
<joey> weren't you [ __ ] on me for [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> liking clannad yeah </joey>
<joey> the first season is [ __ ] right what did </joey>
<joey> i give that you didn't even give it a </joey>
<joey> score </joey>
<joey> it's so [ __ ] forgettable that i </joey>
<joey> didn't even want to [ __ ] rate that </joey>
<joey> piece of [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> show bits if i could rate that i'd get </joey>
<joey> that like a seven or an eight that was a </joey>
<joey> fun show yeah that was great it's a fun </joey>
<connor> show </connor>
<connor> okay why the [ __ ] did i give c the money </connor>
<connor> of the soul and possible control in </connor>
<joey> eight yeah i don't know </joey>
<garnt> i don't know why i did i never even </garnt>
<garnt> finished that okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> season one and two the same score wait </garnt>
<garnt> did i really yeah you did </garnt>
<garnt> second thing i immediately noticed after </garnt>
<garnt> our discussion like we just had </garnt>
<connor> pokemon four </connor>
<garnt> i thought you were my brother top top 10 </garnt>
<connor> anime betrayals of all time </connor>
<connor> i can probably explain why that is the </connor>
<connor> case right </connor>
<connor> because this was made in 2014. it was </connor>
<connor> probably the age of like </connor>
<connor> i'm a big boy now pokemon pokemon that's </connor>
<connor> that's old khan </connor>
<connor> that's child conor me adult connor i </connor>
<joey> don't like pokemon i'm a man i thought </joey>
<joey> you were my boy no i am i would </joey>
<connor> i would recorrectively change that to a </connor>
<joey> ten if i could </joey>
<connor> big sad really a 10 corner really okay </connor>
<garnt> one one thing and one thing i find </garnt>
<garnt> hilarious right </garnt>
<connor> come on okay so i didn't want to go last </connor>
<connor> because i can't </connor>
<garnt> i have to talk [ __ ] about your scores </garnt>
<garnt> and not know my own connor has given </garnt>
<garnt> steins gate and sword art online the </garnt>
<connor> same score </connor>
<connor> of eight yeah </connor>
<garnt> you gave sword arts online season one </garnt>
<joey> and everything </joey>
<joey> i think i'm actually having a strike </joey>
<connor> joey's just having an aneurysm right </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> i'm not even gonna question you giving </joey>
<joey> steins get an eight okay that's fine </joey>
<joey> i meant to put ten yeah </joey>
<connor> i honestly you know what if i genuinely </connor>
<connor> i i enjoyed sold out online but if i </connor>
<connor> went back and watched it i'm sure </connor>
<connor> you know i would be like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> is this [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> i enjoyed it for like what it was right </joey>
<connor> right i liked the idea because it's my </connor>
<joey> first ever like video game anime </joey>
<connor> right right so it was fun and then you </connor>
<connor> know you think about it more and </connor>
<connor> you think about kirito and you're like </connor>
<connor> wow this show is really garbage </connor>
<garnt> but at that time yeah i mean at the time </garnt>
<garnt> everyone everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> i think we've all gone through the stage </garnt>
<garnt> where we thought sword art online was a </garnt>
<garnt> cool concept </garnt>
<joey> back when it was a cool concert i mean </joey>
<joey> look admittedly as much as i'm known as </joey>
<joey> the guy who publicly hates sword online </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i i've said that like first couple of </garnt>
<garnt> episodes really great build-up of the </garnt>
<garnt> premise </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then it kind of just fell apart </garnt>
<garnt> after a while when they were like let's </garnt>
<garnt> make kirito the edgiest protagonist </garnt>
<joey> alive and then that's when i was like </joey>
<joey> okay i mean you had a great premise yeah </joey>
<joey> and you just kind of ruined it with the </joey>
<connor> worst main character i have no idea why </connor>
<connor> i gave back and when i got three or nine </connor>
<connor> i would never ever do that </connor>
<connor> why would you give it like a five why </connor>
<connor> show [ __ ] what </connor>
<connor> boring show what that's boring man </connor>
<connor> that's so boring </connor>
<joey> yeah but you have to understand this is </joey>
<garnt> a man who skips stories oh no yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so what i want to know is how the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> do you watch bucky </joey>
<joey> why did you even watch it you watched an </joey>
<garnt> animated light novel </garnt>
<joey> yeah so i i watched back on the </joey>
<joey> gathering and then i watched like </joey>
<joey> the the next three seasons or so right </joey>
<joey> right and how did you </joey>
<joey> how did you manage that how did you </joey>
<joey> manage that i was confused a lot of the </joey>
<joey> time but i </joey>
<joey> i also just like thought a lot of it was </joey>
<joey> weird like is this the you have to bear </joey>
<connor> mind this is the first time i've ever </connor>
<connor> seen any anime where like there was a </connor>
<connor> protagonist or whatever he was just like </connor>
<connor> touching a kid </connor>
<connor> like the ghost girl and i was like i was </connor>
<connor> like whoa what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is this i'm like well why </connor>
<connor> is everyone liking this child porn bro </connor>
<joey> it's all right man it's a deconstruction </joey>
<connor> of heroin </connor>
<garnt> what i want to know is how you have the </garnt>
<connor> patience to do it because even me </connor>
<connor> well again back in the age of like when </connor>
<connor> you're an anime fan yeah you can kind of </connor>
<connor> like put up with </connor>
<connor> anything because you've just gotten </connor>
<connor> right yeah and that was when i watched </connor>
<connor> it because it's always high up on the </connor>
<connor> list </connor>
<connor> and that that might have been the thing </connor>
<connor> that may be like you know what no i'm </connor>
<joey> not watching </joey>
<joey> but here's what he's doing here's what </joey>
<joey> confuses me right is that like </joey>
<connor> you gave back to it and i would assume </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> majority of the mono atari series like a </connor>
<joey> mid score yeah </joey>
<connor> but you love katana gator catholically </connor>
<connor> is like [ __ ] awesome but it's </connor>
<joey> the same style no yeah no okay it's the </joey>
<joey> same style </joey>
<joey> it's written by the speaker dude but it </joey>
<connor> but it's done like a million times </connor>
<connor> better it's so much more entertaining </connor>
<joey> than back among actually ever was i'm </joey>
<joey> not saying katanagata is bad </joey>
<connor> yeah they're both great because like i </connor>
<connor> guess </connor>
<connor> in my mind when i think of like katana </connor>
<connor> it just feels like a quentin tarantino </connor>
<connor> like film like when i like </connor>
<connor> right right yeah like the dialogue is </connor>
<connor> really important it's like one of the </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> i don't really like it when seeing how </joey>
<joey> how did you not find that with the more </joey>
<connor> of atari series because i didn't find </connor>
<connor> the dialogue interesting </connor>
<joey> in like captain agatha yeah like the one </joey>
<joey> selling point </joey>
<connor> i didn't find it interesting i was just </connor>
<connor> waiting </connor>
<connor> you know i was sold when i circulation </connor>
<connor> came on and i'm like yo this is a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] bomb </connor>
<connor> and then i went i went to see it give </connor>
<joey> give us the [ __ ] yeah i need it after </joey>
<connor> i need it after the aneurysm i'm having </connor>
<connor> katana gathering right was like legit </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] okay i made my three by three i </connor>
<connor> honestly i didn't put katana i got three </connor>
<connor> innings i just didn't forgot i existed </connor>
<connor> that that would go in my three by three </connor>
<connor> yeah okay so katana is like </connor>
<connor> it gave me everything that like i love </connor>
<connor> about like kill bill and </connor>
<connor> pulp fiction in anime form and with a </connor>
<connor> kind of story with a setting that i love </connor>
<joey> which is like samurai i [ __ ] love </joey>
<joey> samurai </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i mean again i'm not i'm </joey>
<joey> not disagreeing with you on that 100 </joey>
<joey> agree with all of them yeah i'm just </joey>
<garnt> saying like </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's both a lot of words it's both </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> it's both weird yeah it's both </garnt>
<garnt> characters there's a very studio shaft </garnt>
<joey> no katana gutter is not studio shaft </joey>
<connor> something about katana </connor>
<connor> i just really [ __ ] enjoyed so much </connor>
<connor> more than i ever did the monogatari </connor>
<garnt> series </garnt>
<garnt> i think that's the closest you've come </garnt>
<connor> to enjoying just reading words then yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah because i think because there was a </connor>
<joey> lot of the action </joey>
<joey> was really [ __ ] good and it made </joey>
<joey> sense all in the story </joey>
<joey> you didn't like the action in the modern </joey>
<garnt> times the monogatari series actually was </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] [ __ ] insane </garnt>
<garnt> come on man it's i don't know why but </garnt>
<garnt> yeah the action was far better than it </garnt>
<joey> had any right to be yeah exactly shaft </joey>
<joey> was like all right i'm a flicks real </joey>
<garnt> quick </garnt>
<garnt> like that that that fight where it was </garnt>
<garnt> like araragi versus like </garnt>
<garnt> i think it was karen in the second </garnt>
<garnt> season yeah it was like the big brother </garnt>
<connor> versus </connor>
<joey> i can't even remember no no no no the </joey>
<joey> fight was uh khan bar </joey>
<connor> that was brutal man i don't even [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> remember this okay </joey>
<joey> i'll show you afterwards and you'll </joey>
<connor> you'll learn appreciation i will say </connor>
<connor> though the toothbrush scene is probably </connor>
<connor> the thing that made me like curious </connor>
<connor> about hentai i was like i was like oh </connor>
<joey> this is actually </joey>
<joey> kind of hot yeah honestly like the </joey>
<connor> toothbrush scene it's not i'm saying </connor>
<connor> it's hot </connor>
<joey> it i i feel like it birthed so many </joey>
<joey> degenerates yeah yeah yeah definitely </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> that's culture was born and that's </joey>
<joey> culture was born thanks to the </joey>
<connor> toothbrush team that is a classic scene </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<garnt> who are you and how much time did you </garnt>
<connor> spend on tumblr </connor>
<connor> honestly i don't know what mindset i was </connor>
<connor> in </connor>
<connor> to ever give there was i don't think </connor>
<connor> there's any point in my life where i </connor>
<joey> genuinely like nora gary in my opinion </joey>
<connor> the only 10 out of 10 aspect about </connor>
<joey> origami is the opening </joey>
<connor> yeah that was good but then again i find </connor>
<joey> it absolutely hilarious </joey>
<joey> that you gave black butler a 5. </joey>
<joey> honestly and you gave black butler </joey>
<joey> season 2 specials a </joey>
<joey> three honestly i still yeah i still </joey>
<connor> would really yeah </connor>
<joey> everyone i i made it no i didn't i would </joey>
<connor> not try and hide it that i did not like </connor>
<garnt> the show your life is a lie i see wwva </garnt>
<garnt> fans he was never a black baller he was </garnt>
<garnt> never a black follower </garnt>
<garnt> you gave mona guthrie second season at </garnt>
<garnt> 10. </garnt>
<connor> i definitely suffered as a team getting </connor>
<connor> into anime </connor>
<connor> like i was heavily influenced by what </connor>
<garnt> everyone else was i mean i agree </garnt>
<connor> i agree i am a liar </connor>
<garnt> definitely getting these them on a </garnt>
<connor> guttery attendant as well yeah </connor>
<connor> this is definitely the case of teenage </connor>
<connor> connor saw that everyone was saying the </connor>
<connor> show was good that i didn't understand </connor>
<joey> so i'm just going to put it yeah i can </joey>
<joey> tell because you gave uh </joey>
<connor> mirai nikki a nine did you actually i </connor>
<connor> think i really enjoyed that show when i </connor>
<garnt> watched it oh man </garnt>
<garnt> i'm legitimate you must have watched as </garnt>
<connor> a teenager </connor>
<joey> that was like the elephant league again </joey>
<joey> this is your first generation </joey>
<joey> he was such an edgy kid listen listen i </joey>
<connor> was like that too when i finished </connor>
<joey> yeah when i was 14 that was seven years </joey>
<connor> ago so i was </connor>
<garnt> i thought you just said how old was i </garnt>
<connor> when i was 14 </connor>
<joey> i was 17 yeah 17 when i made this list </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah this sounds about right for 17 year </joey>
<connor> old connor like dead man wonderland and </connor>
<garnt> eight yeah that checks out </garnt>
<connor> okay you gave monster a seven </connor>
<connor> um what what i'm gonna have to download </connor>
<connor> okay that might have been </connor>
<connor> that might have been from me having to </connor>
<connor> recover from the fact that i dropped it </connor>
<connor> and had to pick it back up </connor>
<connor> you dropped it about yeah about 10 </connor>
<connor> episodes in because the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> didn't [ __ ] move but then actually </connor>
<connor> but then you when you watch it and </connor>
<connor> you're like oh wait [ __ ] it's good </connor>
<connor> holy [ __ ] nevermind oh [ __ ] oh hold on </connor>
<connor> hold on </connor>
<connor> but now like i gave cowboy seven as well </connor>
<connor> which honestly </connor>
<connor> you know maybe it's an a but it's it's </connor>
<joey> honestly it's not 10 or not there are </joey>
<joey> some shows on here that i'm surprised </joey>
<joey> you watched at all like zombie loan </joey>
<connor> zombie loan i have no idea why i watched </connor>
<joey> that show but i remember being angry </joey>
<joey> that i watched that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i remember being like mad that i wasted </joey>
<joey> my time watching the only reason why i </joey>
<joey> watched zombie alone was because i heard </joey>
<joey> it was a peach pit </joey>
<connor> show and i was like i like peach pits </connor>
<joey> i gave school days of one though yeah i </joey>
<garnt> see that i see that </garnt>
<garnt> you finished sunday without god yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah i noticed that </joey>
<garnt> i haven't finished that i finished it </garnt>
<joey> but i definitely did not give it a seven </joey>
<garnt> and he gave me seven wait which one's </garnt>
<connor> sunday without gobbling exactly </connor>
<joey> that's that's that's the point i'm </joey>
<joey> trying to make </joey>
<connor> yeah with the show oh yeah i watched </connor>
<connor> that because i'm surprised you watched </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> that was when i i can actually tell you </connor>
<connor> the exact time i watched that i remember </connor>
<connor> very very </connor>
<connor> when i watched that so that when i first </connor>
<connor> got into anime i was watching it on like </connor>
<connor> the shitty like pirate sites figuring </connor>
<connor> out what the [ __ ] was going on yeah i </connor>
<connor> accidentally watched full metal </connor>
<connor> alchemist twice not realizing like what </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] i was doing </connor>
<connor> and then i finally got a free trial for </connor>
<joey> crunchyroll </joey>
<joey> and so i watched as much anime as i </joey>
<joey> could for the 48 hours right </joey>
<joey> and that was one of them we're not </joey>
<joey> sponsored by crunchyroll </joey>
<joey> actually that was that was one of the </joey>
<joey> ones that i i watched and that was </joey>
<joey> zombie along one of them as well </joey>
<joey> no no no no that was before so i </joey>
<connor> remember that was probably the first </connor>
<connor> ever 12 episode show i watched on </connor>
<garnt> crunchyroll i think right right </garnt>
<garnt> it's some of this just doesn't make </garnt>
<joey> sense you watched the outbreak company </joey>
<garnt> yeah i did yeah that's that's i would </garnt>
<connor> never expect you </connor>
<garnt> i would not have paid conor to watch it </garnt>
<joey> i think you're the only other person i </joey>
<garnt> know that has watched out </garnt>
<garnt> you finished the world god only knows </garnt>
<garnt> and gave it a nine </garnt>
<connor> yeah all three seasons i actually really </connor>
<garnt> liked it i really liked it i liked it as </garnt>
<joey> well that just that just doesn't seem </joey>
<joey> rising </joey>
<joey> i'm just like my jaws on the floor </joey>
<garnt> because if you were to tell me that </garnt>
<garnt> conor finished this show and lights i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<joey> what is this wait you also gave </joey>
<joey> higarashi an eight uh </joey>
<connor> season one yeah uh i think i would take </connor>
<joey> that back </joey>
<connor> what would you give it now i watch the </connor>
<connor> dubs so maybe a four </connor>
<garnt> like like i'm looking i'm looking at </garnt>
<garnt> some of this and i'm just like is this </garnt>
<garnt> me </garnt>
<garnt> right like he gave devlius a part-timer </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] 10. </connor>
<connor> i love that i love dude that's really </connor>
<connor> good that is really good </connor>
<connor> if you actually look at my account my </connor>
<connor> profile picture is devil's apartment </connor>
<connor> i i loved it i loved devil as a </connor>
<joey> part-timer i'm surprised as well you </joey>
<connor> watched </connor>
<joey> the east yeah i did and the two movies </joey>
<connor> and gave all them a nine </connor>
<connor> i've really enjoyed eating of these </connor>
<joey> really how have we never talked about </joey>
<connor> eating of these together i don't know </connor>
<connor> how we never talk because i [ __ ] love </connor>
<connor> you it brings up even though these never </connor>
<garnt> come it's a great [ __ ] yeah but no no </garnt>
<garnt> one ever brings that [ __ ] up it's a </garnt>
<garnt> great it's got a great first season but </garnt>
<joey> like the movies just didn't </joey>
<joey> conclude it in the way i wanted to but </joey>
<joey> like he gave both of them a nine though </joey>
<connor> i i thought eden of the east had one of </connor>
<connor> the most interesting premises </connor>
<connor> oh yeah i watched okay since no one's </connor>
<connor> talking about eating of the east we're </connor>
<joey> gonna sell what you do let's do it </joey>
<joey> let's give some love to you guys i'm </joey>
<connor> gonna be honest i remember i i </connor>
<connor> remember my feelings for the show i </connor>
<connor> cannot [ __ ] remember what happened </connor>
<connor> well i i have one memory of this show </connor>
<connor> and it was like a ship and a bunch of </connor>
<connor> naked people coming </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah that's all i remember no </garnt>
<garnt> no the the ending of </garnt>
<connor> the the ending of the first season of </connor>
<connor> eating of these was [ __ ] great oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pretty </connor>
<connor> so what is the premise again okay so so </connor>
<connor> so the premise is they have a smartphone </connor>
<connor> and i can't remember exactly how much </connor>
<connor> money they were given but you have like </connor>
<connor> 13 </connor>
<connor> 13 people who were given these </connor>
<connor> smartphones and on a smartphone </connor>
<connor> you had like this ai that they could </connor>
<connor> request anything to happen that's right </connor>
<connor> right and they were given a budget of i </connor>
<connor> think 10 </connor>
<connor> 10 million dollars always more than that </connor>
<connor> was it like a million or 10 million </connor>
<joey> billion yeah 10 billion yet which is 100 </joey>
<joey> million dollars </joey>
<joey> so they were given a budget of 100 </joey>
<joey> million dollars and all there was there </joey>
<joey> all they were told </joey>
<joey> was to save the world yeah right there </joey>
<joey> that and that was their objective so </joey>
<connor> good and so </connor>
<connor> and so the series is just the story of </connor>
<connor> these different people </connor>
<connor> and their own take on what a hundred </connor>
<connor> million dollars means </connor>
<connor> to save the world and honestly like i </connor>
<connor> don't want to spoil </connor>
<connor> it but it's [ __ ] great especially 12 </connor>
<joey> episodes </joey>
<connor> it's not just it's not just 12 episodes </connor>
<joey> it's 12 episodes and a movie </joey>
<connor> two movies two movies yeah are you sure </connor>
<garnt> are you sure it's two movies not just </garnt>
<joey> one </joey>
<joey> yeah because he gave both of them uh </joey>
<garnt> nine out of ten okay </garnt>
<garnt> but i i feel like the first season was </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] fantastic </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's and you know the problem with </garnt>
<garnt> the first season is that it didn't </garnt>
<joey> conclude the story but the first season </joey>
<joey> was [ __ ] fantastic </joey>
<joey> um the movies were not as good in my </joey>
<joey> opinion </joey>
<joey> i don't know i didn't even know they had </joey>
<garnt> movies yeah i don't remember much about </garnt>
<connor> what happened in the movies </connor>
<connor> some of these shows i legitimately can't </connor>
<connor> remember like fully watching i just i'm </connor>
<joey> just surprised you what like you watched </joey>
<joey> hinted </joey>
<connor> the stoney cat and the the hentai aussie </connor>
<connor> i did watch that yeah yeah i think </connor>
<joey> you watched it as well that doesn't seem </joey>
<joey> like a show you would watch </joey>
<garnt> why have we never talked about it you </garnt>
<garnt> watched black bullet you haven't rated </garnt>
<garnt> it but you watched that you watched </garnt>
<joey> black bullets yeah i watched </joey>
<connor> all of black bullets </connor>
<connor> yeah i remember i i actually do really </connor>
<joey> enjoy like </joey>
<joey> uh like romance slice of life shows but </joey>
<joey> i used to binge them all the time </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah now i you watch black cat </joey>
<joey> as well yeah a black house [ __ ] though </joey>
<joey> yeah the mother was white i watched </joey>
<joey> gachaman crowds and i remember </joey>
<joey> i that was i gave that a six but that </joey>
<joey> was so reluctantly like i i did not </joey>
<joey> enjoy </joey>
<joey> watching that and i watched there's a </joey>
<joey> bunch of other shows that i watched </joey>
<joey> after this i didn't include like what's </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] card game like wick sauce </joey>
<joey> or whatever it's called </joey>
<joey> sauce yeah [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah i'm angry </joey>
<joey> though watch </joey>
<joey> that i hated that i watched that why did </joey>
<joey> you even watch that this is the thing </joey>
<joey> right is it </joey>
<joey> to me i didn't i do not like looking up </joey>
<garnt> anime like i don't want to know anything </garnt>
<garnt> about the show right yeah give me the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] show let me watch it and if i </garnt>
<garnt> hate it just brain dead yeah i want a </garnt>
<garnt> dead monkey boat like if you if you </garnt>
<garnt> because here's the thing right </garnt>
<garnt> i guarantee if you just give me a show </garnt>
<connor> tell me to watch it i'll watch it i </connor>
<connor> might enjoy it </connor>
<connor> if you try and sell me on a show i </connor>
<connor> immediately will </connor>
<connor> start being like i don't know no i'm </connor>
<garnt> completely the opposite yeah i'm the </garnt>
<connor> opposite because like i've gotten to the </connor>
<connor> point </connor>
<connor> where i need to be sold on the show </connor>
<connor> because i i need to have like a reason </connor>
<connor> why i'm watching this show like is this </connor>
<connor> show going to get good am i going to </connor>
<connor> have something i get out of this show i </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> i need to i need to know that before i </connor>
<joey> get before like truly get into a show </joey>
<joey> because otherwise </joey>
<joey> nowadays i end up dropping shows after </joey>
<joey> one episode if it doesn't hook me even </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> critically acclaimed highly claimed show </joey>
<joey> if i if i don't know </joey>
<joey> that something good is coming up that's </joey>
<joey> going to be worth my time yeah then i'm </joey>
<joey> just not going to give it a chance </joey>
<joey> because i just don't have that patience </joey>
<joey> anymore i've sat through enough shitty </joey>
<garnt> shows to know that i don't want to waste </garnt>
<garnt> my time anymore yeah yeah exactly right </garnt>
<garnt> and you know it's it's just it's just </garnt>
<connor> sad because i i do </connor>
<connor> miss that feeling of finding hidden gems </connor>
<connor> where i can just be like oh i have zero </connor>
<connor> expectations exactly exactly </connor>
<connor> i gave kyo uh wait there's this one yeah </connor>
<connor> one thing that's curious to me you </connor>
<connor> watched phase zero but you rated </connor>
<connor> the second season lower than the first </connor>
<connor> season </connor>
<connor> you mean the the the actual </connor>
<connor> action-packed second season where </connor>
<connor> everything gets concluded </connor>
<connor> it's lower than the first season yeah </connor>
<joey> which is the setup </joey>
<joey> you're like you're like completely going </joey>
<connor> against everything like </connor>
<connor> all the character build up you've </connor>
<connor> brought yourself up to right it's like </connor>
<connor> oh i </connor>
<joey> hate story i love action but the season </joey>
<joey> where there's more action i'll write </joey>
<connor> lore yeah </connor>
<connor> i really enjoyed when they were </connor>
<connor> introducing like all of the characters </connor>
<joey> in in faith that's like my favorite part </joey>
<joey> of faye right </joey>
<joey> and fate's day night as well my favorite </joey>
<joey> part of fate day night is when they're </joey>
<joey> introducing the characters </joey>
<connor> because it's so cool because you're like </connor>
<connor> i know i know there's an assassin i know </connor>
<connor> there's a writer </connor>
<connor> what are they gonna be and then when and </connor>
<connor> then when you watch fate stay night and </connor>
<connor> you're like wow ryder's [ __ ] in this one </connor>
<connor> compared to fate zero </connor>
<connor> because like fate zero you watch you're </connor>
<connor> like yo ryder he's the best alexander oh </connor>
<connor> i'd [ __ ] him </connor>
<connor> but like then you watch then that's the </connor>
<connor> reason why i [ __ ] hated fate stay </connor>
<connor> night except for the animation </connor>
<garnt> because i was like which face they know </garnt>
<garnt> are you talking about </garnt>
<connor> talking about the original face okay </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> the series not the movies right the </connor>
<connor> series okay because </connor>
<garnt> i don't want to get into this review the </garnt>
<connor> point is </connor>
<garnt> i just need clarification because what </garnt>
<garnt> you saying fans were like on their seat </garnt>
<connor> right here </connor>
<connor> aren't you cool but i can't believe they </connor>
<connor> had like there was no like good alec </connor>
<connor> they should just brought alexander back </connor>
<connor> again and be like hey i'm back baby or </connor>
<connor> like it's a pre-course i guess like hey </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm back in the future yeah yeah i'm </connor>
<connor> back here </connor>
<connor> i'm back in the past yeah because that's </connor>
<connor> he was like the best part of we zero </connor>
<connor> relationship with the [ __ ] uh the </connor>
<connor> weevil whatever he's called </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] weevil waver wave </connor>
<joey> there's a lot of ones that you haven't </joey>
<joey> given a score darker than black i stand </joey>
<joey> by being a nine because if you watch the </joey>
<connor> dub dude troy baker is in that this is </connor>
<connor> before troy baker stopped doing anime </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] man he kills it as november 11. oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah so [ __ ] i i </garnt>
<garnt> i've like darker than black is a show </garnt>
<connor> that i've actually re-watched quite a </connor>
<connor> few times and i don't know why i've </connor>
<connor> rewatched quite a few times </connor>
<connor> i really i just really liked the world </connor>
<garnt> of darkness yeah </garnt>
<joey> you know what i'm not gonna lie i don't </joey>
<connor> remember anything it's like quirks but </connor>
<garnt> if they were actually [ __ ] cool and </garnt>
<garnt> weird </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah like cause cause like it was </garnt>
<garnt> like i remember watching it it was like </garnt>
<garnt> x-men but what i found interesting was </garnt>
<connor> the fact that they had to like do this </connor>
<connor> really weird activity every time they </connor>
<connor> used </connor>
<connor> their power and i just know smoking yeah </connor>
<garnt> i don't know why i just thought that was </garnt>
<garnt> really cool and </garnt>
<garnt> like it has a [ __ ] amazing soundtrack </garnt>
<garnt> as well because it was like by yokocana </garnt>
<garnt> and i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the biggest differences between </garnt>
<connor> the first season every other season was </connor>
<connor> yoko kana's music just set such an </connor>
<connor> amazing tone for this world </connor>
<connor> and this environment that it just made </connor>
<connor> you just it it just felt good </connor>
<connor> exploring this world and just being in </connor>
<connor> it i feel like i gotta re-watch it </connor>
<connor> it's fun dude and watch it dub dude like </connor>
<connor> the dub's really [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> you're saying this to joey now honestly </connor>
<joey> honestly dude like troy baker is </joey>
<joey> november 11. </joey>
<joey> i love troy you all saw me on because </joey>
<connor> troy baker plays the guy who has to </connor>
<connor> smoke even though yeah he's smoking yeah </connor>
<connor> i've watched it as well </connor>
<connor> so good man oh god um okay well </connor>
<joey> hold on you watch saki uh yeah and you </joey>
<connor> gave it a seven </connor>
<connor> sakisaki that's the one with the things </connor>
<joey> on his ear that's the yeah yeah another </joey>
<joey> the the the major one yeah that's the </joey>
<garnt> the body pillow we have yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah i watched that </joey>
<garnt> you've you've actually watched it i </garnt>
<joey> didn't watch i watched </joey>
<connor> all of saki and i i hope at the end i </connor>
<connor> was like i'm gonna understand </connor>
<connor> and at the end i was like i don't </connor>
<connor> understand myself i'm like but there's </connor>
<connor> golden wind and [ __ ] going on and stuff </connor>
<joey> like that </joey>

<joey> yeah yeah yeah okay good good 22 23 </joey>
<garnt> volumes yeah okay </garnt>
<connor> and because like more anime had a anime </connor>
<connor> original ending </connor>
<garnt> remember yeah and it was complete [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> from what i remember yeah </connor>
<connor> i remember having a good time i remember </connor>
<connor> i watched the dub and i remember the </connor>
<connor> voice acting was uh </connor>
<connor> greg as was like playing the whiny </connor>
<connor> characters he always does </connor>
<connor> and i think he was a little too whiny i </connor>
<garnt> mean that's just gregaris </garnt>
<garnt> uh he's damn he's too [ __ ] good at </garnt>
<garnt> his job no no because like i remember </garnt>
<garnt> that that was like </garnt>
<garnt> i swear he was typecasting that rolf </garnt>
<garnt> like the longest [ __ ] because there </garnt>
<garnt> were so many of those characters and no </garnt>
<garnt> one else could do a voice like him with </garnt>
<garnt> like sounding whiny yeah and so it's </garnt>
<garnt> always him doing the whiny character i </garnt>
<garnt> will say a wrecker seven </garnt>
<garnt> seven out of ten honestly i when the </garnt>
<garnt> original one </garnt>
<garnt> when i watched that everyone was talking </garnt>
<connor> about the show like jesus had came down </connor>
<connor> himself and brought a show </connor>
<connor> yeah and i watched it and i thought </connor>
<connor> honestly this is kind of [ __ ] like it's </connor>
<connor> it's good but like it's kind of [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> boring like is that </joey>
<connor> is that how you feel about it obviously </connor>
<joey> now i would give it a six is that how </joey>
<joey> you felt about ergo proxy as well you </joey>
<connor> gave that a seven as well </connor>
<connor> oh go proxy i remember i was just like </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is happening </joey>
<joey> again this doesn't seem like an anime </joey>
<joey> that you would watch no like the </joey>
<joey> ergo proxy is the last anime i would </joey>
<connor> think it was like watching </connor>
<connor> like you know when you go to a modern </connor>
<connor> art museum and you look at this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you're like </connor>
<joey> yeah i get it </joey>
<joey> is like the same amount of like what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i would get if you came up to me </joey>
<joey> tomorrow and said </joey>
<joey> so i watched uh serial experiments lane </joey>
<connor> yeah honestly i've been wanting to watch </connor>
<joey> that for a while i just </joey>
<joey> i just haven't had the the opportunity </joey>
<joey> to be like yeah i want to waste a day </joey>
<joey> yeah and not not really enjoy and have a </joey>
<joey> and i have a brain that's supporting </joey>
<joey> yeah i feel like you watch you watch </joey>
<connor> shows like that to come out with like </connor>
<connor> just your brain being like what </connor>
<connor> but like that's not fun half the time so </connor>
<garnt> i don't know i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it is fun depending on your mood because </garnt>
<connor> i remember like i </connor>
<connor> it took me ages to watch serial </connor>
<connor> experiments lane and then i was just in </connor>
<joey> this weird mood where i'm just like </joey>
<joey> yeah i i want my mind to be [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> that that sounds like yeah </joey>
<joey> right now yeah and then i don't want a </joey>
<joey> challenge yeah it's it's like </joey>
<garnt> it's like me with you ask me like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> wait i'm waiting to wake up for the day </garnt>
<garnt> where i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> yeah i want i want depression right now </connor>
<connor> you know why the [ __ ] did i give </connor>
<joey> uh this anime mao mao yusha </joey>
<joey> i was about to say you gave that a nine </joey>
<joey> and i'm like okay </joey>
<joey> and i'm like was it the milf titties is </joey>
<joey> that what it is </joey>
<garnt> that's all i remember from you know that </garnt>
<garnt> gets a little two bonus points but but i </garnt>
<garnt> think again that was in the same weekend </garnt>
<connor> that i watched the other show on the </connor>
<garnt> country will 48 hours right right </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember the mile mile yusha </garnt>
<connor> was like studio arms and if you didn't </connor>
<connor> know if you don't know studio arms they </connor>
<connor> were like </connor>
<connor> they were like famous for being a hentai </connor>
<connor> studio well </connor>
<connor> like transitioned into anime well that's </connor>
<connor> probably why it connected a little bit </connor>
<garnt> and um yeah i mean that was like one of </garnt>
<garnt> the first </garnt>
<garnt> shows they produced that was an anime </garnt>
<garnt> that was seen as just not complete trash </garnt>
<connor> but i wouldn't call it a [ __ ] night </connor>
<garnt> there's little sexual things going on or </garnt>
<connor> something like that some vibes of little </connor>
<garnt> milf step son i mean i mean that was i </garnt>
<garnt> i'd say as an impressionable teenager i </garnt>
<joey> can see why you are </joey>
<joey> connected with that on a personal </joey>
<garnt> he level with it but yeah i think that's </garnt>
<garnt> pretty much everything because uh </garnt>
<connor> you haven't rated a lot of these i would </connor>
<connor> bump kill the kill at one </connor>
<connor> for getting me into hentai that's the </connor>
<connor> same thing i would really </connor>
<connor> kill the kill is what made me be like </connor>
<connor> you know what anime girls are hot i'm </connor>
<connor> like you know what this is a hentai of </connor>
<connor> this and there was </connor>
<connor> and that's how i was like oh this is </connor>
<garnt> good that's why you need to get into the </garnt>
<garnt> ginsengs man </garnt>
<connor> um we're gonna we're gonna get him into </connor>
<connor> that event yeah </connor>
<connor> eventually wait wait okay then if you </connor>
<connor> liked maui maul yusha did you like long </connor>
<connor> horizon </connor>
<connor> i loved logarithm is one of my favorite </connor>
<joey> shows okay that makes sense because it's </joey>
<connor> written by the same people </connor>
<connor> i'm actually hype even though i think i </connor>
<connor> need to rewatch a little bit of </connor>
<connor> logarithmic season two </connor>
<connor> yeah i remember i [ __ ] loved the </connor>
<joey> world yeah like in logarithms </joey>
<joey> like i don't know how they like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> write stories like i'm glad </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm almost great i'm also glad that </connor>
<joey> the show didn't like [ __ ] blow its </joey>
<connor> load like immediately and yeah </connor>
<joey> stop telling us everything about it like </joey>
<connor> yeah i love it when the show's teased us </connor>
<connor> with the world like here's a little </connor>
<connor> crumb </connor>
<connor> yeah crumb knowledge and then they just </connor>
<joey> don't mention it for a few episodes </joey>
<connor> you're like oh [ __ ] yeah we are in a </connor>
<garnt> we're in a [ __ ] video game </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i remember log horizon i </garnt>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> watching the first two three episodes of </connor>
<joey> it dropped it immediately </joey>
<connor> because i'm just like really what what </connor>
<connor> is this beta sword art online man </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is this because like the </connor>
<connor> worst thing about </connor>
<connor> lockhorizon was that one like the </connor>
<connor> animation is like </connor>
<connor> it's like it ain't great it's like the </connor>
<joey> most typical </joey>
<connor> five out of ten animation this is just a </connor>
<joey> throwaway seasonal show </joey>
<joey> and the first three or so episodes were </joey>
<joey> like the most </joey>
<connor> generic kind of introduction you could </connor>
<joey> get to a world and it didn't start </joey>
<connor> getting interesting until they probably </connor>
<connor> started explaining </connor>
<connor> like the game mechanics and seeing </connor>
<garnt> seeing the game mechanics being broken </garnt>
<garnt> like within this world was just so </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] interesting </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that whole arc where like there was </garnt>
<connor> a guy who could kill in the villages </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah that was [ __ ] cool like </garnt>
<garnt> what really you sold me immediately was </garnt>
<garnt> like when they when they first </garnt>
<joey> discovered </joey>
<joey> that they could make things taste good </joey>
<connor> and then they like invented the burger </connor>
<joey> and was like yo this is really [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> interesting this this isn't even an issa </connor>
<garnt> car this is just like a </garnt>
<garnt> like an entrepreneur business [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> anime </joey>
<joey> basically just like a business textbook </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah how do you how the [ __ ] do you </connor>
<connor> guys remember what happens in these like </connor>
<connor> seven out of ten shows bro the moment </connor>
<connor> something isn't like exceptional i'm </connor>
<connor> like that's going into the </connor>
<connor> locker rise is not a separate </connor>
<joey> was cool because again it was like again </joey>
<joey> it's done by ton of money who's like </joey>
<joey> somehow can like </joey>
<garnt> make you learn [ __ ] while reading these </garnt>
<garnt> stories i don't know how he does it </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's like spice and wolf right </garnt>
<garnt> it's like spice and wolf exactly like </garnt>
<garnt> the reason why i love spices </garnt>
<garnt> because because like i actually learned </garnt>
<joey> like proper like </joey>
<joey> useful business skills like wait a </joey>
<garnt> minute i'm just getting horny over this </garnt>
<garnt> one or if this wolf wife </garnt>
<garnt> but i'm like who's the marketing genius </garnt>
<garnt> but i'm learning things about economics </garnt>
<garnt> that's not la that's not legal that's </garnt>
<garnt> not allowed </garnt>
<joey> what are you doing i can't be horny and </joey>
<joey> smart at the same time that's not how </joey>
<connor> that works </connor>
<connor> i just feel like i have like amazing </connor>
<connor> brain compression like i </connor>
<connor> my my brain zips zips like </connor>
<connor> you know how like when you compress a </connor>
<connor> file to like lower the memory it takes </connor>
<connor> up that's what i do with anime </connor>
<connor> immediately when i'm done i'm like zip </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] up put it in storage forget </connor>
<connor> about that thing </connor>
<connor> and then when when i rewatch it it's </connor>
<connor> like unzipping the farm like oh yeah </connor>
<joey> this did happen yeah </joey>
<joey> has this man like min maxed his brain i </joey>
<connor> actually think i actually think i've </connor>
<connor> i've </connor>
<connor> you know i've sorted the storage on my </connor>
<connor> brain apparently you've </connor>
<connor> you've got a sorting algorithm literally </connor>
<connor> just for anime </connor>
<connor> my [ __ ] god but yes i think this is a </connor>
<garnt> good time to move on to </garnt>
<garnt> our three by threes now yes there's a </garnt>
<joey> reason why i have my laptop up is </joey>
<joey> because we're gonna create uh three or </joey>
<garnt> we're gonna </garnt>
<joey> share each other's three by three of </joey>
<joey> anime yeah we've explained that </joey>
<garnt> we've explained what three by three but </garnt>
<joey> like to expand further on that i </joey>
<joey> i like i love seeing people's three by </joey>
<joey> three right because </joey>
<joey> i feel like a three by three is the </joey>
<connor> closest thing you get to a rorschach </connor>
<connor> test for like anime fans </connor>
<connor> you know you know you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> because you get you get to see </connor>
<connor> because like like asking someone asking </connor>
<joey> what someone's favorite anime is it's </joey>
<joey> like a [ __ ] stupid question because </joey>
<joey> like if you've seen enough changes all </joey>
<joey> the time it changes all the [ __ ] time </joey>
<joey> but like </joey>
<joey> with uh with like a with like a kind of </joey>
<joey> with nine anime to choose from </joey>
<joey> that's a good sample size to really get </joey>
<connor> a grasp on what this person's taste is </connor>
<connor> like not not </connor>
<connor> not if all their taste because i don't </connor>
<connor> know how hard a time you guys had </connor>
<connor> choosing nine anime i </connor>
<connor> just shoved three together again that i </connor>
<garnt> like but i had a pretty difficult time </garnt>
<connor> just choosing mine anime </connor>
<connor> well you have a [ __ ] d you probably </connor>
<connor> have like a seizure just thinking like </connor>
<connor> what am i gonna do for like breakfast </connor>
<connor> like oh my god like jesus christ </connor>
<connor> like i swear you you like take so long </connor>
<joey> to contemplate decisions </joey>
<joey> i mean i came up with mine pretty </joey>
<joey> quickly just because like i literally </joey>
<joey> thought of the first night we're gonna </joey>
<connor> look at mine first </connor>
<connor> but i literally just thought of the </connor>
<connor> first nine that i think is like </connor>
<connor> yeah i love this yeah because i think </connor>
<connor> that's the most important thing is like </connor>
<connor> i feel if you think too hard about it </connor>
<joey> then you're </joey>
<connor> kind of reshaping your tastes too much </connor>
<connor> it's just generally just a bad policy </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> so i was i was like all right what are </joey>
<garnt> the nine shows that i [ __ ] love </garnt>
<joey> thinking thing you're just a bad point </joey>
<connor> don't think i personally think thinking </connor>
<connor> is overrated i'd rather just go with </connor>
<joey> guts is that an unpopular opinion </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna say it unpopular opinions </joey>
<garnt> thinking is overrated all right so let's </garnt>
<garnt> look at mine first all right </garnt>
<joey> let's let's see what you got here joey </joey>
<connor> lucky star clanna yo what the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> to the audience who cannot uh see or </garnt>
<joey> don't go to these shows what they say so </joey>
<connor> from so the top row from left to right </connor>
<connor> is serial experiments lane clan ad fully </connor>
<connor> equally </connor>
<garnt> why lucky star i i've gotta ask my my </garnt>
<connor> why why </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<joey> okay don't don't worry about placements </joey>
<joey> too much </joey>
<joey> like don't worry about placements too </joey>
<joey> much this could be in any random [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> order </joey>
<joey> yeah reason why okay i completely get </joey>
<connor> why someone would look at me and say bro </connor>
<connor> lucky star is not good </connor>
<connor> because truth be told if you watch lucky </connor>
<connor> star today </connor>
<connor> it'd probably be [ __ ] right lucky star </connor>
<connor> to me </connor>
<connor> is so time sensitive because all of its </connor>
<joey> jokes </joey>
<joey> are time sensitive like lucky star was </joey>
<joey> one of those shows that </joey>
<joey> made fun of like otaku and weeb culture </joey>
<joey> back in like the mid 2000s </joey>
<joey> i'm turning this into a [ __ ] like </joey>
<garnt> video essence i'll tell you what [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> lucky star is my friend </garnt>
<garnt> lucky star is uh reddit humor before </garnt>
<garnt> reddit existed </garnt>
<garnt> that's it's it's it's like the it's like </garnt>
<garnt> the late 2000's reddit here </garnt>
<garnt> and the reddit just didn't exist so </garnt>
<connor> everyone's just like oh lucky sounds </connor>
<joey> amazing yeah exactly </joey>
<connor> i couldn't sit through it really yeah i </connor>
<joey> didn't finish it i see like </joey>
<joey> it's weird because randomly like a </joey>
<joey> couple of days ago i was just scrolling </joey>
<joey> through youtube and on my recommended </joey>
<joey> there was just like </joey>
<joey> a lucky star like funny complimation and </joey>
<garnt> i was just like yeah [ __ ] i haven't </garnt>
<joey> heard of lucky stars i </joey>
<joey> it was like six minutes long i'm like </joey>
<joey> you know what [ __ ] it i've got time that </joey>
<garnt> sounds </garnt>
<garnt> like an oxymoron to me lucky stuff funny </garnt>
<garnt> compilation </garnt>
<connor> but i don't know i think it's because </connor>
<joey> like especially around the time when i </joey>
<joey> watched lucky star i was like </joey>
<garnt> really heavily into obviously of course </garnt>
<garnt> like anime obviously but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was really heavily into like the otaku </garnt>
<garnt> culture especially in japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and lucky star kind of went over </garnt>
<garnt> all of that [ __ ] and put it into </garnt>
<joey> perspective of like </joey>
<joey> it's pretty [ __ ] ridiculous looking </joey>
<connor> from an outsider's perspective </connor>
<connor> yeah this cafe is weird huh yeah no not </connor>
<connor> even that it was just like </connor>
<joey> like the [ __ ] comic head scene is </joey>
<joey> still funny to this day just because </joey>
<garnt> it's so accurate </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i just i looked back at lucky </garnt>
<garnt> star and i never liked it originally but </garnt>
<garnt> i look back at some of the scenes i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this doesn't age well to me at all </garnt>
<joey> right exactly and that's why i </joey>
<garnt> never recommend lucky star to people </garnt>
<joey> today yeah because it has not aged one </joey>
<connor> the jokes have not achieved i have a </connor>
<connor> question </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is this show in the bottom </joey>
<joey> corner i've seen this swan the bottom </joey>
<connor> left yeah what is that shirt </connor>
<joey> what's the english name for that shirt </joey>
<joey> uh [ __ ] uh </joey>
<connor> god i haven't even i think i've watched </connor>
<connor> that show it's basically </connor>
<joey> it's basically like a comedy show that </joey>
<joey> throws in a lot of itchy jokes </joey>
<connor> i've watched the show and i don't </connor>
<connor> remember anything about it i 100 have </connor>
<connor> watched this show </connor>
<connor> and i i i'm one small girl the small </connor>
<connor> girl's angry that she doesn't have big </connor>
<connor> tits right a lot </connor>
<connor> right that's one of the jokes yeah he </connor>
<garnt> funny </garnt>
<garnt> okay why why is this in your three </garnt>
<joey> people three this is in my three by </joey>
<connor> three because a well first of all </connor>
<connor> i think it's [ __ ] hilarious b it kind </connor>
<joey> of encompasses </joey>
<joey> my love for comedy and my love for itchy </joey>
<connor> you have a broad term of what comedy is </connor>
<joey> yeah um lucky stuff what what what </joey>
<garnt> encompasses your love for </garnt>
<garnt> comedy uh what what about the show </garnt>
<garnt> encompasses your love for comedy i think </garnt>
<joey> it's [ __ ] hilarious </joey>
<joey> i mean i don't know what else what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] answer were you expecting no </joey>
<connor> it's because it's very intricate and the </connor>
<connor> jokes that constructed are very </connor>
<connor> like this this okay the reason why i put </connor>
<connor> this in </connor>
<connor> is because it encompasses my love for </connor>
<connor> trashy shows this show </connor>
<connor> is not good in any perspective i'm just </connor>
<connor> saying it right now all right </connor>
<connor> here's how you know that my three this </connor>
<joey> is how you know my three by three is </joey>
<joey> legit right </joey>
<joey> give me some of this </joey>
<connor> is not a good show it is trashy shitty </connor>
<connor> comedy with etchings </connor>
<joey> it's crap all right okay here's the </joey>
<joey> reason why i put it in </joey>
<garnt> important question then every show in </garnt>
<joey> here yeah would you rewatch it today </joey>
<connor> yeah you would i would you re-watched </connor>
<connor> lucky stuff </connor>
<connor> i i did i'm not just saying he literally </connor>
<connor> just said i was literally watching a </connor>
<connor> compilation two days ago i just thought </connor>
<connor> it was a lie honestly i just didn't </connor>
<joey> believe it </joey>
<joey> i would 100 re-watch all these shows </joey>
<garnt> today i gotta say i was like </garnt>
<joey> i didn't put it on but i was this close </joey>
<joey> to putting you hacker show away </joey>
<joey> i am glad that you put it i put your hot </joey>
<joey> show in because it represents </joey>
<connor> my love for sure i gotta be honest right </connor>
<connor> boys i legitimately tried to watch you </connor>
<connor> hack show </connor>
<connor> no less than a week ago right i put it </connor>
<connor> on first episode and i was like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i can't watch this like i thought </garnt>
<garnt> it was the dub and i was like the dub's </garnt>
<garnt> too awful i switched to japanese i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] it's awful as well i can't </garnt>
<garnt> stand why why don't you talk </garnt>
<garnt> great what are you talking about the </garnt>
<garnt> audio was driving me insane like i </garnt>
<connor> actually couldn't watch it </connor>
<connor> it was such bad quality i know that it's </connor>
<connor> old but like i actually couldn't sit </connor>
<joey> there so basically your review of you </joey>
<joey> hot show is where it's old </joey>
<connor> no no honestly like i feel bad that i'm </connor>
<connor> like that but like i was like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> actually i'll read the language </connor>
<connor> oh my god you're really gonna hit me </connor>
<garnt> with that audio problems </garnt>
<connor> what was your what was your problem with </connor>
<connor> the audio because like you hug show from </connor>
<garnt> what i remember was like one of my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite dubs </garnt>
<joey> it really i don't know i never watched </joey>
<connor> the dark side i swear </connor>
<connor> 10 seconds into the job i'm like [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> listen to the japanese i gotta say i </connor>
<connor> gotta send it i gotta turn this [ __ ] off </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> seriously yeah it was pretty good who </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] played yusuke because yusuke </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] like killed him this is probably </connor>
<connor> just a case of you know </connor>
<connor> you know watching it years later and </connor>
<connor> being spoiled for choice et cetera et </connor>
<joey> cetera i mean for me okay </joey>
<joey> like i put you hutcher there because hey </joey>
<joey> obviously i love </joey>
<connor> my shonen but i feel like i don't know i </connor>
<connor> have never felt </connor>
<connor> the same level of excitement that i felt </connor>
<joey> watching and writing </joey>
<connor> that i have from any other i'm i'm </connor>
<connor> envious i want that yuei hakusho has </connor>
<garnt> some of my favorite arcs in all of </garnt>
<joey> shonen the dark tournament arc </joey>
<joey> tuesday one of the best arcs in shonen </joey>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<garnt> the dark tournament arc is the best </garnt>
<garnt> tournament arc </garnt>
<joey> hands down of all time hands down and </joey>
<joey> this is this is a tournament arc that </joey>
<joey> came out [ __ ] 20 years ago now </joey>
<joey> like it it birthed the tournament arc </joey>
<joey> genre yeah the reason </joey>
<joey> why the reason why tournament arcs have </joey>
<joey> become a meme and </joey>
<joey> are so hyped is because of you it's </joey>
<garnt> because it's because of you </garnt>
<garnt> like dragon ball might have like </garnt>
<connor> popularized it but then new york should </connor>
<connor> perfect </connor>
<connor> it yeah it hasn't been perfected since </connor>
<connor> then but like </connor>
<connor> also like sensui is one of the best </connor>
<garnt> villains in all of shonen as well oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah and togaro as well </joey>
<joey> oh my god such a good character not </joey>
<joey> gonna lie growing up i wanted to be </joey>
<joey> he a so bad i was like i looked at hie </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like everything about this </joey>
<joey> guy </joey>
<connor> with the black hair </connor>
<joey> is so [ __ ] cool is there's a serial </joey>
<connor> experiment laying at the top yeah that's </connor>
<joey> the </joey>
<joey> top left why i think because like </joey>
<connor> well again i still think it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> insanely ahead of its time like this was </connor>
<connor> made back in like </connor>
<connor> the late 90s and it talks about [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> societal issues that are relevant today </connor>
<connor> right and that's i don't know i think </connor>
<joey> that's like a huge artist </joey>
<connor> what kind of stuff does it talk about in </connor>
<joey> the show what kind of society so </joey>
<joey> basically to </joey>
<joey> grossly oversimplify serial experiments </joey>
<connor> lane is essentially this idea that </connor>
<connor> your digital identity and your real-life </connor>
<connor> identity </connor>
<connor> sees no barrier okay and so basically it </connor>
<connor> follows </connor>
<connor> obviously lane who kind of goes through </connor>
<connor> this like discovery of herself </connor>
<connor> and the world in being like wait so we </connor>
<joey> can </joey>
<joey> create digital identities of ourselves </joey>
<joey> on the quote-unquote internet i mean </joey>
<joey> obviously back then it was very primal </joey>
<garnt> yeah right but it came out in like 1999 </garnt>
<joey> 98.8 </joey>
<connor> yeah just just didn't even have balloons </connor>
<connor> tower defense exactly </connor>
<connor> yeah this is the full flash player [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> but basically it's it's this idea that </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> wait so if things happen in the digital </garnt>
<garnt> world </garnt>
<garnt> then is there really no consequences of </garnt>
<joey> that in the real world and vice versa </joey>
<garnt> and they did that in 12 episodes and </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> i i i will attest that ex experience </garnt>
<garnt> lane is [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember well i watched it for </garnt>
<connor> the first time last year </connor>
<connor> so i watched it pretty much oh really </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah well because it was unlike to </connor>
<connor> watch this forever yeah and then i was </connor>
<connor> just like you know </connor>
<connor> i'm finally in the mood to watch this </connor>
<connor> i'll give it a watch and i remember </connor>
<connor> thinking man </connor>
<connor> this normally when you see a piece of </connor>
<connor> media that focuses around technology </connor>
<connor> and like stories around technology it </connor>
<connor> ages </connor>
<connor> horribly and i remember watching zero </connor>
<connor> experience lane i'm thinking </connor>
<connor> how is this how does this seem like it's </connor>
<joey> more relevant now </joey>
<connor> than it is when it first came out </connor>
<joey> overlapping </joey>
<joey> because like this shows 20 years low-key </joey>
<joey> foretold </joey>
<joey> the future of social media yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i think i think i can understand that if </connor>
<connor> you were really in touch with the </connor>
<connor> internet back then you could probably </connor>
<connor> see where it was going i think </connor>
<joey> and and i think and i think and </joey>
<connor> obviously i pick serial experiments </connor>
<connor> laying there obviously because i love it </connor>
<connor> but also </connor>
<connor> i love i mean the shows that make you </connor>
<joey> think </joey>
<joey> quite unquote yeah yeah that to dive </joey>
<joey> more into that kind of stuff like yeah </joey>
<connor> you know yeah make you thunk right like </connor>
<connor> ergo proxy is in the same field as that </connor>
<joey> yeah i love that show and uh you know </joey>
<connor> razorfan as well was in there as well </connor>
<connor> yeah and planet i mean i just think it's </connor>
<joey> good </joey>
<joey> maybe cry like you made me cry they both </joey>
<joey> it's seven episodes and it feels like a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] five hour long movie </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's a very dense show very i would </garnt>
<connor> say </connor>
<connor> it does not why does dents always just </connor>
<connor> sound like an insult </connor>
<garnt> it's a dense [ __ ] it's a </garnt>
<garnt> fictional what do you want to say no no </garnt>
<connor> it's it's a it's a compact show </connor>
<garnt> compact sounds less of an insult than </garnt>
<connor> dense dense sounds like it's like </connor>
<connor> like brick [ __ ] house like filled with </connor>
<joey> like garbage </joey>
<joey> okay it's it's a compact show no i'm </joey>
<connor> listening </connor>
<connor> there is like fully [ __ ] has 24 i </connor>
<garnt> would </garnt>
<garnt> say 24 episodes worth of material packed </garnt>
<garnt> into seven episodes i would agree with </garnt>
<garnt> that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it's good one of the best </garnt>
<garnt> soundtracks of all time soundtrack is </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing it's </joey>
<connor> pillows [ __ ] amazing yeah i have no </connor>
<connor> more questions you're free to go </connor>
<garnt> yeah okay no no no no no no no no no no </garnt>
<joey> no no no no no no no no </joey>
<joey> you had a choice of any anime movies and </joey>
<garnt> you pick </garnt>
<garnt> a ghibli movie i mean look man you gave </garnt>
<garnt> this a 10 out of 10 was it on your list </garnt>
<garnt> i mean </garnt>

<garnt> thought process </garnt>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>

<connor> put into like picking pictures because i </connor>

<connor> that i have re-watched okay because if </connor>
<connor> if i've rewatched something and this is </connor>
<connor> like re-watching not for my job but </connor>
<connor> re-watching for my own enjoyment </connor>
<connor> if i've re-watched something that means </connor>
<joey> there is something </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] special about that show that has </joey>
<joey> stuck with me that i've felt </joey>
<joey> like i've wanted to go out of my way to </joey>
<connor> re-experience i </connor>
<joey> agree with that and enough even even on </joey>
<connor> some shows that i think is [ __ ] great </connor>
<connor> like for example like stuff like monster </connor>
<connor> or like </connor>
<connor> highly critically you can claim shows i </connor>
<connor> do not want to re-watch no no like </connor>
<connor> exactly i i feel like it's had his time </connor>
<connor> in the sun but </connor>
<connor> in terms of like what i truly like enjoy </connor>
<garnt> to the core </garnt>
<garnt> i wouldn't go out my i at the moment i </garnt>
<garnt> wouldn't go out and re-watch monster you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> i i wouldn't do that no okay hold on but </garnt>
<garnt> i get that right yeah like i'm looking </garnt>
<garnt> at this right now being like yeah </garnt>
<joey> re-watch that re-watch that yeah </joey>
<joey> would you re-watch one piece i have </joey>
<garnt> re-watched one piece is it even possible </garnt>
<garnt> to re-watch okay okay i've i've okay </garnt>
<connor> here's the thing </connor>
<connor> i've got that steins gate time machine </connor>
<garnt> or some [ __ ] how are you doing okay i've </garnt>
<garnt> watched one piece or </garnt>
<garnt> basically up to up to the time skip all </garnt>
<joey> the way once </joey>
<joey> and then i've rewatched it again once uh </joey>
<joey> and then i've re-watched some of my </joey>
<joey> favorite parts </joey>
<joey> multiple times i [ __ ] know it is and </joey>
<garnt> this was back when i had time to watch </garnt>
<garnt> anime </garnt>
<garnt> and i would just like whenever i go </garnt>
<garnt> whenever i have time like i said when </garnt>
<joey> you said you really watch right i </joey>
<connor> thought you were talking about like oh </connor>
<joey> i've rewatched the water seven </joey>
<connor> i've re-watched alabaster i didn't think </connor>
<connor> you really watched you've really shown </connor>
<connor> your age you need years to re-watch that </connor>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> one day no wonder you're older than me </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] me you need like i love how i </joey>
<connor> love how you compensated me like no no </connor>
<joey> only up until the pre before the time </joey>
<joey> i'm like it's still like 400 percent </joey>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<garnt> which is why like i was having trouble </garnt>
<garnt> putting a shonen on because i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> is there any shonen that i actually </garnt>
<garnt> truly loved that i would you know </garnt>
<connor> think that i would go back any time </connor>
<connor> because i was going to put you hug show </connor>
<connor> and i was thinking </connor>
<joey> seven deadly sins come no yeah i'll come </joey>
<connor> here for 737 right </connor>
<joey> but like one piece to me will go down </joey>
<joey> when it finishes will go down as </joey>
<joey> one well it already is one of the </joey>
<joey> greatest anime slash manga series of all </joey>
<joey> time yeah of course but to me </joey>
<connor> when i think back and i think back </connor>
<connor> because one piece isn't the perfect show </connor>
<connor> right yeah i've rewatched one piece </connor>
<connor> does anyone claim it is yeah i know like </connor>
<connor> everyone everyone forgets about the lows </connor>
<connor> of one piece where everyone forgets </connor>
<connor> about like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> sky ellen sky island i wasn't a fan of </connor>
<joey> the foxy arc which was a filler cannon </joey>
<garnt> arc that everyone doesn't talk about </garnt>
<garnt> you know you know what i mean what are </garnt>
<connor> these names </connor>
<garnt> these things don't sound [ __ ] real </garnt>
<connor> was like </connor>
<garnt> um it was way too long it was dragged </garnt>
<connor> out to [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> but nothing in my opinion can touch </garnt>
<garnt> the highs of one piece when one piece is </garnt>
<garnt> at its best </garnt>
<garnt> right i i think it is the greatest </garnt>
<garnt> the greatest thing you can find in anime </garnt>
<connor> i will stand by and say even though i've </connor>
<joey> watched every minor june anime yeah i've </joey>
<connor> cried more times watching one piece </connor>
<connor> than any other [ __ ] when you have that </connor>
<connor> many episodes something's gonna hit </connor>
<joey> right yeah like [ __ ] me </joey>
<joey> but i mean i wasn't excited i mean like </joey>
<garnt> there's plenty of shows that have a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of episodes </garnt>
<connor> and haven't had the highs that one piece </connor>
<connor> happens because </connor>
<connor> how do you know anything about this </connor>
<connor> pokemon has some pretty high highs man </connor>
<connor> but like </connor>
<joey> what i find amazing about one piece is </joey>
<joey> it's been going on for like what 20 </joey>
<joey> years now </joey>
<joey> almost 30 now almost like i can't </joey>
<joey> remember when it's like i think it </joey>
<joey> started in the 1990s </joey>
<joey> 98 or 96 or something something like </joey>
<joey> that yeah </joey>
<joey> but i remember i've just caught up with </joey>
<joey> the manga with like what the wano arc </joey>
<joey> which is now one of the longest arcs </joey>
<joey> it's so long they has three parts </joey>
<garnt> and it still has moments that make </garnt>
<garnt> me feel [ __ ] magical this is like </garnt>
<garnt> like one piece </garnt>
<garnt> is like like i watch some of the best </garnt>
<garnt> moments in one piece and i get reminded </garnt>
<garnt> this is why i [ __ ] love anime this is </garnt>
<garnt> why i like [ __ ] love manga </garnt>
<garnt> this is why i love this medium did the </garnt>
<connor> author of one piece like intend for it </connor>
<connor> to be as long as it is it was just like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] it's just popular </garnt>
<garnt> i i i think he had planned because the </garnt>
<garnt> thing about one piece is that it's this </garnt>
<garnt> long and yet </garnt>
<joey> there are there's foreshadowings that </joey>
<joey> that's happened like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hundreds of chapters not from </joey>
<joey> this planet that that is that is that is </joey>
<joey> being explored now </joey>
<joey> right and i think he didn't expect it to </joey>
<garnt> be this long but he </garnt>
<garnt> but when he got popular he realized he </garnt>
<garnt> can explore basically every idea he that </garnt>
<joey> he </joey>
<joey> a lot of people a lot of people i feel </joey>
<connor> kind of undermine oda just because it's </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> you know he made one piece but whatever </connor>
<connor> it's so long blah blah blah but i think </connor>
<joey> people when you look deep into it people </joey>
<joey> really undermine his skill for </joey>
<connor> storytelling because yeah i mean again </connor>
<connor> let's be honest you have to be to keep </connor>
<connor> yeah how many how people like captivated </connor>
<joey> he's been number one on shonen jump for </joey>
<garnt> the past like 15 years yeah </garnt>
<connor> you don't do that by luck </connor>
<garnt> and like what i find amazing is it's </garnt>
<garnt> been going on this long and it's </garnt>
<garnt> not one no it's it's not only got still </garnt>
<garnt> got [ __ ] amazing moments and </garnt>
<garnt> even in some of the greatest uh in some </garnt>
<garnt> of the latest chapters and some of the </garnt>
<garnt> latest moments </garnt>
<garnt> but two no matter how far you go into </garnt>
<garnt> one piece </garnt>
<garnt> you feel like there's still an upswing </garnt>
<garnt> you still you still feel like he hasn't </garnt>
<garnt> peaked yet </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like how would you write a </garnt>
<garnt> story that's </garnt>
<garnt> like almost almost a thousand chapters </garnt>
<garnt> long and you still think </garnt>
<garnt> man there's an upswing coming there's </garnt>
<joey> there's something greater it's insane </joey>
<joey> every time a new </joey>
<connor> arc started yeah and i would keep up to </connor>
<connor> date with like what the manga </connor>
<connor> was saying everyone would be like how is </connor>
<joey> it that the next arc is even better yeah </joey>
<connor> how does it keep getting better yeah </connor>
<connor> how does that work i thought this was </connor>
<connor> the peak and then it just keeps getting </connor>
<connor> down how does the hot dog stand arc </connor>
<garnt> keep just blowing me away how does the </garnt>
<garnt> water park adventure </garnt>
<garnt> supreme arc keep blowing me away right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> the names don't make [ __ ] sense it is </connor>
<garnt> literally that pro cd video where he </garnt>
<connor> talks about anime arc names </connor>
<connor> and like any one piece fan who's watched </connor>
<connor> that video knows that </connor>
<connor> he's just calling out one piece fans </connor>
<connor> there because we were literally talking </connor>
<connor> about this video before the podcast </connor>
<connor> started and we were just </connor>
<connor> me and me and joey was just talking </connor>
<connor> about the big marmark yeah and then </connor>
<connor> connie </connor>
<connor> connor was just like oh yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah wait that's that's a reality </connor>
<connor> are you guys serious i thought they were </connor>
<connor> joking because it was like big mom's </connor>
<joey> house or something i thought it was just </joey>
<connor> the joke </connor>
<joey> like that but i felt that right like </joey>
<garnt> when i when i remember when i've watched </garnt>
<garnt> the alabaster arc in one piece </garnt>
<connor> i was like this is the greatest thing </connor>
<connor> ever made yeah and then water seven came </connor>
<garnt> out i was like how is that how is it </garnt>
<connor> getting better and then the white beard </connor>
<connor> came out </connor>
<garnt> because frankly i don't really want to </garnt>
<garnt> hear your opinions i honestly do not </garnt>
<joey> care </joey>
<joey> no i already know you okay i already </joey>
<joey> know your opinions on your name i </joey>
<connor> already have your hands on fate </connor>
<connor> bakano is like saying i like coming like </connor>
<connor> of course </connor>
<garnt> back and i was like i like sex of course </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just fun </garnt>
<connor> it's it's it's just fun and then we've </connor>
<connor> gushed over harihi obviously </connor>
<connor> right like how disappearance is [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> amazing horizon as well okay i'm very </connor>
<connor> i'm </connor>
<garnt> excited to see that yeah because like i </garnt>
<garnt> was thinking back to </garnt>
<garnt> because like obviously i'm the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> isekai man right i was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> like lock horizon is the isekai i come </garnt>
<connor> back to because it's it's the only </connor>
<garnt> isekai i've rewatched out of everything </garnt>
<connor> like re-zero i watched because it was my </connor>
<connor> job you know what i mean like that that </connor>
<connor> was literally the only reason i watched </connor>
<connor> zero lock horizon is the only iso i've </connor>
<connor> come back to be like man </connor>
<connor> there were some good [ __ ] moments in </connor>
<connor> this and i really wanted to </connor>
<connor> re-experience some of these ideas that </connor>
<joey> well </joey>
<joey> season three is uh out yeah i'm probably </joey>
<joey> gonna have re-watching now yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's out this season so i'm </joey>
<joey> probably gonna read like </joey>
<joey> like verizon's the only like pure isekai </joey>
<joey> right now that i can </joey>
<connor> like recommend without it's got no catch </connor>
<connor> like it's it's not like re-zero where </connor>
<connor> it's like oh it's </connor>
<connor> it's a time loop catch you know that's </connor>
<connor> that's the interesting thing about it </connor>
<connor> local ryzen it's just hey guys hey guys </connor>
<connor> yeah there's a gimmick michael ryzen is </connor>
<garnt> just an isakai that is a just a </garnt>
<connor> good iso guy no i agree it deserves to </connor>
<joey> be it hasn't </joey>
<joey> placed that idea yeah i just can't get </joey>
<joey> over the fact that you unironically like </joey>
<joey> orima </joey>
<joey> okay i just like for the longest time </joey>
<joey> what is urimo about i thought it was </joey>
<joey> like the chinese incest yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's it right it's it's not about </garnt>
<joey> insects it is about </joey>
<garnt> incest just happens in it it's not about </garnt>
<joey> it there's there's there's </joey>
<garnt> there's a key there's a key [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> difference between the two </garnt>
<joey> it is about incest and best girl getting </joey>
<connor> cocked that's what that shows about i </connor>
<joey> can't just say </joey>
<joey> there's incest in it like it's like like </joey>
<joey> like a scent of a flavor </joey>
<joey> you can't just drop that in there be </joey>
<connor> like oh there's also incest in it like </connor>
<connor> what </connor>
<connor> what do you mean is this a small thing </connor>
<connor> incest to you </connor>
<garnt> it is something okay so so let </garnt>
<connor> i don't care if this like watch this </connor>
<connor> clips get watch this clip get me </connor>
<connor> cancelled in like four years or like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] four years </connor>
<connor> watch this clip again for 40 minutes </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean okay everyone </connor>
<connor> forgets that orimo </connor>
<joey> was a legitimately good [ __ ] show </joey>
<joey> when it first aired i'm gonna have to </joey>
<joey> stop you right there </joey>
<joey> it was a i'm gonna have to show you </joey>
<joey> right there </joey>
<joey> like like everyone thinks i put orimo on </joey>
<joey> the same level or something like error </joey>
<joey> manga sense say no </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] error manga sensei was trash </joey>
<joey> from episode one </joey>
<joey> and it knew it was trash and it it every </joey>
<joey> manga sensei is what happens </joey>
<joey> when you take all the trashiest parts of </joey>
<joey> orimo and put that and put that into a </joey>
<connor> show </connor>
<connor> orimo was a nice wholesome look at otaku </connor>
<connor> culture </connor>
<connor> and with incest and the thing is </connor>
<connor> the thing is the thing is when it was </connor>
<connor> airing everyone was just like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> this is </connor>
<connor> this is a parody of all like the incest </connor>
<garnt> light novels and everything like that </garnt>
<connor> right this is this is just this is just </connor>
<connor> your honor it was but a parody yeah i i </connor>
<garnt> i every one </garnt>
<garnt> everyone thought everyone thought that </garnt>
<garnt> it was just taking the piss </garnt>
<garnt> out of like you know this the little </garnt>
<garnt> girl emoto </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] craze happening in in anime and </garnt>
<garnt> level and if if you </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't watch the final three </garnt>
<garnt> episodes you can watch the entire series </garnt>
<garnt> of </garnt>
<garnt> series of rmo and just think that um </garnt>
<garnt> and then the final three episodes </garnt>
<garnt> happened and it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that uh that that sparked an outcry </garnt>
<garnt> didn't it it's </garnt>
<garnt> it sparked an outcry right it it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<garnt> it definitely uh because the the reason </garnt>
<garnt> the reason it sparked an outcry was </garnt>
<garnt> because no one was actually expecting it </garnt>
<joey> yeah it went from like twenty percent </joey>
<joey> incest to </joey>
<garnt> ninety nine percent it was a hundred </garnt>
<garnt> percent it was a hundred there's </garnt>
<garnt> there was there was no there was no </garnt>
<garnt> percentage that could be shaved off </garnt>
<garnt> it went full incest so and it was </garnt>
<connor> unapologetic </connor>
<connor> fully admit that it went full incentive </connor>
<garnt> no no yeah yeah it's in your top </garnt>
<garnt> nine anime because the reason it's okay </garnt>
<connor> i've rewatched it because it is </connor>
<connor> re-watched it yeah </connor>
<connor> i've already said i've rewatched </connor>
<connor> everything on this list i don't i don't </connor>
<connor> even want to see it </connor>
<connor> because this this show like </connor>
<garnt> this show is the epitome of everything i </garnt>
<garnt> love about trashy harry manga and anime </garnt>
<joey> it's when you say that it just sounds </joey>
<joey> like satire </joey>
<garnt> sounds like sound it is not okay so </garnt>
<joey> remember when you </joey>
<joey> went through my anime list and i gave </joey>
<joey> ikitosin a two yeah so like back when i </joey>
<connor> was a teenager i was just like you </connor>
<connor> couldn't appreciate your interest yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm i'm better than this fan </connor>
<connor> service [ __ ] i'm i'm better than this </connor>
<connor> trashy anime </connor>
<connor> i'm i got a good [ __ ] taste right </connor>
<connor> this is the show </connor>
<joey> that [ __ ] changed all that when i was </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> why am i enjoying this so much why do </joey>
<joey> why do i like this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> filth trash show i mean look look i mean </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i mean look i look i have shows like </joey>
<connor> that yeah i kissed cis being a perfect </connor>
<garnt> example yeah i was about to </garnt>
<joey> put it in my [ __ ] three by three </joey>
<connor> though yeah just probably put an </connor>
<joey> in this [ __ ] top nine i will middle </joey>
<garnt> oh </garnt>
<connor> i will [ __ ] i that that was a </connor>
<connor> legitimate deliberate choice i put it in </connor>
<connor> the middle because i'm just like </connor>
<garnt> this is this show this single show has </garnt>
<garnt> probably had the biggest overall effect </garnt>
<joey> on my taste in modern anime you </joey>
<joey> literally [ __ ] made orima out to be </joey>
<joey> like the free space in a bingo card you </joey>
<garnt> know what </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like yeah of course i'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> open it i [ __ ] did it and </garnt>
<garnt> because it is yeah it is it is a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> trashy anime right </garnt>
<garnt> there there are trashy moments there but </garnt>
<connor> i i think </connor>
<connor> i will defend the point that orimo </connor>
<connor> wasn't complete trash there there were </connor>
<connor> some legitimately good </connor>
<garnt> heartwarming moments in there and it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't complete it wasn't all trash okay </garnt>
<joey> it was it wasn't iron margarita it </joey>
<connor> really was okay it wasn't harry potter </connor>
<joey> you're going to jail buddy era manga </joey>
<joey> sensei is ori emo reskinned </joey>
<joey> that's all it is and you have to admit </joey>
<garnt> to that no i don't </garnt>
<joey> you have to remember manga sensei is the </joey>
<garnt> trashiest part of orimo </garnt>
<garnt> concentrated it is it is dense iron </garnt>
<connor> you're honest </connor>
<connor> i didn't know she was 12. i'll be honest </connor>
<joey> your honor ladies and gentlemen this man </joey>
<connor> has the largest </connor>
<joey> anime youtube channel on the platform he </joey>
<connor> also this is what he said i'm </connor>
<garnt> i'm [ __ ] proud of this [ __ ] i put it </garnt>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> literally put this stuff front and </connor>
<garnt> center and i regret </garnt>
<connor> that nothing yeah i regret [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> nothing that is on my computer now and i </joey>
<joey> can't wait to use it as blackmail all </joey>
<connor> right let's check out corners </connor>

<garnt> just like yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is what what this is what </garnt>

<connor> this is legit my my favorite nine shows </connor>
<joey> okay well i mean obviously we don't have </joey>
<connor> to talk about hunter hunters </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing we've talked about </connor>
<connor> golden time golden time is like my </connor>
<joey> favorite talked about volcarano </joey>
<joey> yeah ping pong can you kick him can you </joey>
<connor> can you talk about ping pong </connor>
<connor> 100 right i love ping pong ping pong </connor>
<connor> right yeah </connor>
<connor> other than like mob okay that's also why </connor>
<connor> i love them all for similar reasons okay </connor>
<connor> like ping pong is like one of the only </connor>
<connor> animes right you get all these [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> stupid animes where the guys opie as </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like it no one [ __ ] gives a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> right like okay wow kirito is a giant </connor>
<connor> dick again right cool </connor>
<connor> we have another easter kai oh they're </connor>
<connor> overpowered oh they have an ability </connor>
<connor> that's unique to them </connor>
<connor> you know what real life sucks man no one </connor>
<connor> has a unique ability and i really like </connor>
<connor> there was a [ __ ] anime that was like </connor>
<connor> bro </connor>
<connor> life kind of sucks man sometimes people </connor>
<connor> just gonna be better at things that you </connor>
<connor> love </connor>
<connor> even if they hate it that's what that </connor>
<connor> was so real and it hurt man </connor>
<connor> it hurt because i've been on both sides </connor>
<connor> of the ping pong like animation like </connor>
<connor> the characters i've been talented at </connor>
<connor> something that i [ __ ] hated </connor>
<connor> and i felt bad for people who really </connor>
<connor> wanted to be good at that thing that i </connor>
<connor> was good at and i've also tried my </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hardest at something and you </connor>
<connor> speak japanese fluently at birth so </connor>
<connor> you know i've been on both sides of the </connor>
<connor> spectrum of pink on the animation so </connor>
<connor> you know i'm kidding no but i mean </connor>
<connor> really ping ping pong ping pong </connor>
<garnt> what what i call an what i call ping </garnt>
<connor> pong it's a life animal yeah </connor>
<connor> it it it hurt because i was like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you really had to like pull that out of </connor>
<connor> me yeah </connor>
<connor> that that made me a little like god damn </connor>
<joey> okay yeah you wait okay then i'm curious </joey>
<connor> have you seen </connor>
<connor> uh mosh comes in like a lion no okay </connor>
<connor> because i </connor>
<connor> think if you loved ping pong you would </connor>
<connor> love everyone has told me that yeah </connor>
<connor> because mars comes in like a lion is the </connor>
<connor> complete opposite </connor>
<connor> mars comes in like a lion is about a </connor>
<connor> genius who </connor>
<connor> can't understand the idea of losing yeah </connor>
<connor> right but that in itself is what's </connor>
<connor> causing him to lose in real life </connor>
<connor> yeah so it's literally the opposite of </connor>
<joey> ping pong but that's just like that's </joey>
<connor> just like the school when they're like </connor>
<connor> you're a gifted child and they </connor>
<joey> can't [ __ ] do anything later on right </joey>
<joey> exactly i mean and obviously like uh i </joey>
<garnt> don't want to know </garnt>
<garnt> why why is sakamoto there okay why why </garnt>
<connor> is that what is wow </connor>
<connor> why why is that a top night man that's </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] funny man </connor>
<connor> i'll have to stand with my </connor>
<connor> sakamoto is one of the funniest animals </connor>
<joey> sakamoto is so good </joey>
<connor> it's so funny it's so funny you can put </connor>
<joey> that [ __ ] on it's like the mr bean of </joey>
<joey> anime </joey>
<joey> it's like the mr bean of anime if mr </joey>
<connor> bean was like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like handsome millionaire who was </connor>
<connor> perfected anyway </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] so you really gotta diss me when </connor>
<connor> you just like were like yeah pedophilia </connor>
<joey> brotherly in love okay here's what i </joey>
<joey> don't understand though what </joey>
<joey> every three by three right as we've </joey>
<joey> established so far and every three by </joey>
<connor> three i've seen back when it was big </connor>
<connor> has at least one show that's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like universally right yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i think all these shows are [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> fantastic one which is why </connor>
<connor> it's simple which is why i suppress </connor>
<joey> extra doubt i just don't like [ __ ] shows </joey>
<joey> jerry </joey>
<connor> what do you think i'm gonna put like my </connor>
<connor> ho my ho demon or some [ __ ] in this no </connor>
<joey> that thing was made as [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i don't know like you don't have like a </joey>
<joey> do you have a guilty pleasure anime </joey>
<connor> honestly no not really </connor>
<connor> really i don't really watch anime ever </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> wow the grand reveal i i frankly </connor>
<connor> again i've revealed this before i never </connor>
<connor> i never [ __ ] want to re-watch anime </connor>
<joey> right so yeah </joey>
<connor> so you wouldn't re-watch any of these no </connor>
<connor> okay why would i be watching i've </connor>
<joey> already watched </joey>
<connor> because it's great because dude you </connor>
<connor> don't want to re-experience it not </connor>
<connor> really </connor>
<connor> i'll be honest with you i'd rather </connor>
<connor> experience something different so </connor>
<garnt> there's no show like you would never </garnt>
<garnt> like have you never gotten to the point </garnt>
<garnt> right where you're just you just </garnt>
<garnt> you're just tired of trying something </garnt>
<garnt> new and because </garnt>
<garnt> no no you're you're tired of trying </garnt>
<connor> something new why do you make it sound </connor>
<connor> so sad </connor>
<connor> i'm just tired of trying yeah i'm going </connor>
<garnt> to go back towards this because because </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you try something new and </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like man this just ain't </garnt>
<garnt> doing it for me you just want something </garnt>
<joey> you want something that's </joey>
<connor> it's comfort food yeah it's you know </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know for me that feels sad </connor>
<connor> it feels like you're trying to capture </connor>
<connor> something that's gone in your life you </connor>
<joey> know what i mean i don't know i feel sad </joey>
<joey> too i am in this photo and i don't like </joey>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> like i don't know like you're chasing </connor>
<joey> something that doesn't exist anymore in </joey>
<connor> my mind </connor>
<connor> why is melanie laughing at me because in </connor>
<joey> my mind right i'm gonna i could </joey>
<garnt> i could easily i would watch like any of </garnt>
<garnt> these yes </garnt>
<garnt> would i willingly do it at my own free </garnt>
<garnt> world no no because like i </garnt>
<garnt> to to bring it the other way like for me </garnt>
<garnt> watching new shows </garnt>
<garnt> is me chasing that high that that is me </garnt>
<garnt> chasing </garnt>
<garnt> that high that i felt with the shows </garnt>
<garnt> i've already liked but </garnt>
<garnt> the more anime you watch and just the </garnt>
<garnt> older you [ __ ] get that just gets </garnt>
<garnt> harder and harder </garnt>
<garnt> i don't watch my channel anymore and </garnt>
<joey> that's </joey>
<joey> that's the biggest like reveal of this </joey>
<joey> video god </joey>
<connor> doesn't watch anything no i do i watch </connor>
<joey> anime </joey>
<joey> i mean look honestly like i i i'm </joey>
<connor> feeling sauce about this three by three </connor>
<connor> just because again </connor>
<joey> because all nine of these shows are like </joey>
<joey> universally praised all right right it's </joey>
<connor> golden time universally praised yeah </connor>
<connor> i i i like ordinary </connor>
<connor> like in my mind it's like my two </connor>
<connor> favorite like romance or whatever </connor>
<connor> like yeah yeah yeah toradora and golden </connor>
<connor> time but golden time felt like the </connor>
<garnt> better because </garnt>
<garnt> golden time is my favorite romance of </garnt>
<garnt> all time i would think </garnt>
<connor> and yeah i thought that you guys didn't </connor>
<connor> like golden time </connor>
<joey> i love going on time okay okay i've met </joey>
<joey> less people who say they didn't like </joey>
<garnt> golden time yeah really </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like the thing about golden </garnt>
<garnt> time is that you know </garnt>
<connor> there are there were flaws because no </connor>
<connor> who the [ __ ] liked bannery as a </connor>
<connor> character </connor>
<connor> let's be honest like i just okay like </connor>
<connor> you talk talking about compressing your </connor>
<connor> memory like i i've only just remembered </connor>
<connor> that ghost binary was a thing </connor>
<connor> and that was just something i've just </connor>
<connor> like that was like a black spot yeah in </connor>
<connor> this like </connor>
<connor> amazing series that i seem to remember </connor>
<connor> golden time but like i think that's a </connor>
<connor> golden time i just think </connor>
<connor> this is this is how adult romance should </connor>
<connor> be this is this took </connor>
<connor> everything that was good as you said </connor>
<connor> about toradora and just made it better </connor>
<connor> yeah perfected it put it in university </connor>
<garnt> didn't make it like just this high </garnt>
<garnt> school romance had enough adult elements </garnt>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> didn't have an annoying ass [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> lolli </joey>
<joey> it's sad that no one gives a chance but </joey>
<connor> also weird that it's only in 720p </connor>
<connor> that's pretty [ __ ] weird no 480p i </connor>
<garnt> think or something really yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it was never released oh yeah yeah it is </garnt>
<connor> in 480p it's in 480p </connor>
<connor> and it's such a shame because like it's </connor>
<connor> it's such a [ __ ] good show </connor>
<joey> but it was either that or like one ounce </joey>
<joey> i really [ __ ] like one hour </joey>
<joey> but i mean i i don't know like there's i </joey>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> i guess it it looks very basic from the </connor>
<connor> outside looking no </connor>
<garnt> it's not basic it's not basically </garnt>
<joey> because it's it's not basic in the sense </joey>
<connor> where you thought we were putting on </connor>
<connor> nine favorite shows like oh like </connor>
<joey> no we were but what we're saying is that </joey>
<joey> like there isn't a single guilty </joey>
<joey> pleasure anime here </joey>
<connor> because obviously guilty pleasure anime </connor>
<joey> is bad or an emo that's more than a </joey>
<connor> guilty pleasure that's a criminal </connor>
<joey> pleasure joey i think </joey>
<joey> in my opinion the guilty pleasure is a </joey>
<joey> show that you love no matter what even </joey>
<joey> though </joey>
<joey> you know it is [ __ ] yeah okay but then i </joey>
<connor> when i was making this nine by nine </connor>
<connor> let's say dead man wonderland i love </connor>
<connor> dead man wonderland but it never </connor>
<connor> finished and it was you know it was kind </connor>
<garnt> of you know it was kind of made because </garnt>
<garnt> of it </garnt>
<connor> but like i don't think it's better than </connor>
<garnt> any of these shows for me perhaps </garnt>
<garnt> because like i've i've talked to you and </garnt>
<garnt> i know what your tastes are basically </garnt>
<connor> and i </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah like i i know you love like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] hardcore brutal shows </garnt>
<joey> like jojo bakki gantz i love </joey>
<joey> um i'm surprised that i thought becky </joey>
<joey> was gonna i thought bucky was gonna be </joey>
<connor> up there as well </connor>
<connor> well i mean i love baki as like there's </connor>
<connor> because there's a few episodes in </connor>
<connor> backyard like yeah it's like mid but </connor>
<connor> there was just so many [ __ ] funny </connor>
<connor> moments that like it all stand with me </connor>
<garnt> forever </garnt>
<garnt> here's the best way i can do this i know </garnt>
<connor> you like chad shows </connor>
<garnt> that's that's the best way to get like a </garnt>
<connor> chat that's the best way i can describe </connor>
<connor> honest taste like like it's it's like </connor>
<garnt> just it's just got chad characters isn't </garnt>
<garnt> it you know what i mean chad characters </garnt>
<joey> yeah that's that </joey>
<connor> that's why i really want connor to watch </connor>
<joey> or read fists than all stuff yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i know you would [ __ ] love that yeah </joey>
<connor> i like the right amount of chat </connor>
<joey> if there's just too much chat sometimes </joey>
<connor> a little too much you know it's like </connor>
<joey> sometimes </joey>
<joey> what do you mean you like jojo that's </joey>
<joey> like 100 </joey>
<connor> that's a different that's a different </connor>
<connor> that's a different kind of chat that's </connor>
<connor> like that jojo is like the built </connor>
<connor> different anime like that's in its own </connor>
<connor> league </connor>
<connor> as far as i can say like i think jody </connor>
<connor> shouldn't even be treated as anime it's </connor>
<connor> a lifestyle </connor>
<connor> yeah it's an artwork but like i don't </connor>
<joey> know like in first of the north star </joey>
<joey> when i see that i don't really find it </joey>
<connor> appealing because they're like they're </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> too macho i want a bit of weakness to </connor>
<connor> the character right i mean if you read </connor>
<connor> it you'll know </connor>
<connor> every character is weak as [ __ ] really </connor>
<connor> okay okay fine fine </connor>
<joey> i think you should read it you'll love </joey>
<joey> it yeah but yeah it pisses me off when </joey>
<joey> i'm watching an anime </joey>
<connor> and the main character is like a wimp </connor>
<joey> beyond com comprehension and just causes </joey>
<joey> any problems for himself because he's a </joey>
<joey> wimp and i'm like yeah listen </joey>
<joey> all you have to do is just say no and </joey>
<joey> you wouldn't have been dragged off to a </joey>
<joey> culture are you talking about deku </joey>
<joey> i don't know something else there's a </joey>
<connor> lot of shows where i'm just like this </connor>
<connor> literally could have been avoided if you </connor>
<connor> just like stood up to yourself for about </connor>
<connor> two seconds like this whole problem </connor>
<connor> you know i don't know man i'm not </connor>
<joey> satisfied </joey>
<connor> what do you want from me huh just some </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you know what i mean like you're </connor>
<joey> expecting me to have [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> this is like this is like this is like </joey>
<connor> too polished i i i i i have good taste </connor>
<garnt> what can i say i can i can make a better </garnt>
<connor> nine uh three by three </connor>
<connor> make my three by three for me okay it </connor>
<connor> would be like i was like i said i'll see </connor>
<connor> if it's fat it would be </connor>
<connor> jojo yeah but like </connor>
<connor> i love baki but it's not in my top nine </connor>
<connor> shows </connor>
<connor> but you talk about it so often yeah but </connor>
<connor> it like i love it but it's i wouldn't </connor>
<connor> put it </connor>
<connor> higher than any of these for enjoyment </connor>
<connor> in my mind but like </connor>
<connor> it's it's okay because shows that i love </connor>
<connor> and show that i want to talk about </connor>
<garnt> are like different i guess but it's okay </garnt>
<garnt> like this </garnt>
<garnt> this is like getting this we should have </garnt>
<connor> defined the rules more appropriately </connor>
<connor> right should be like connor give me the </connor>
<connor> nine shows that you think about keep you </connor>
<garnt> up at night </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah because that's what i did </joey>
<joey> i i did why didn't sorry they used to </joey>
<connor> put your nine favorite shows that </connor>
<joey> represent you well like </joey>
<joey> what i don't understand is you say that </joey>
<joey> like the shows i talk about and the </joey>
<joey> shows i like are not the same yeah why </joey>
<connor> would you talk about a show if it's not </connor>
<connor> your favorite </connor>
<connor> there's some shows where it's like well </connor>
<connor> ping pong right right it's all of it is </connor>
<connor> encapsulated in the show there's nothing </connor>
<connor> more to adam like just [ __ ] watch it </connor>
<connor> but like </connor>
<connor> it's like amazing love it i can't i </connor>
<garnt> can't improve it nobody's </garnt>
<garnt> talking about it that that's that's the </garnt>
<garnt> exact point right because you sometimes </garnt>
<joey> you see a good show and you're like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] me that was a good show like like i </joey>
<joey> need to talk about it yeah yeah but </joey>
<connor> sometimes you watch a show and you're </connor>
<connor> like man this is this is sticking with </connor>
<connor> me you know what i mean this is </connor>
<connor> i i i'm stuck with me huh yeah no i'm </connor>
<connor> not saying ping pong shouldn't be on </connor>
<garnt> this but like </garnt>
<connor> what shouldn't be on this hunter hunter </connor>
<connor> bro fight </connor>
<connor> dude honda hunter prove that [ __ ] that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] moved me </connor>
<joey> man i don't know </joey>
<garnt> i hear you talking more about bucky than </garnt>
<joey> hunter yeah that's because </joey>
<garnt> okay let's be like that's right psycho </garnt>
<garnt> and hunter i </garnt>
<joey> rarely hear you talking about that i </joey>
<connor> never talking about these okay </connor>
<joey> i talk about one punch man more than i </joey>
<joey> talk about mob psycho right in one punch </joey>
<joey> because i think mob psych is a better </joey>
<joey> show than one punch man well then why </joey>
<joey> wouldn't you talk about mob psycho if </joey>
<joey> it's a better show </joey>
<joey> well again because it's a bad show and i </joey>
<joey> feel like there's not much to say it's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing like just go watch it </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> but it's like like my favorite show i </joey>
<joey> love becky right where i have to sit </joey>
<joey> there and be like listen get to the part </joey>
<connor> where he [ __ ] someone and becomes </connor>
<connor> extra powerful like i love having that </connor>
<connor> conversation again if you haven't seen </connor>
<connor> becky there is a scene where he has </connor>
<connor> only one scene yeah honestly and that </connor>
<connor> one scene </connor>
<connor> is enough to be like anime of the year </connor>
<connor> in my mind just like </connor>
<garnt> give it another that's that's exactly </garnt>
<garnt> what i'm [ __ ] talking about </garnt>
<joey> that's a scene that's stuck with you and </joey>
<joey> you can bring up and you want to bring </joey>
<connor> up </connor>
<connor> so why would that not be in your number </connor>
<joey> three it's like the way </joey>
<joey> that i see it is that like let's say god </joey>
<joey> wants to take me to like an event and </joey>
<joey> he's like he has to specifically tell me </joey>
<joey> like connor don't bring up the backy sex </joey>
<connor> scene to like my friends </connor>
<connor> that's the level of like i just want to </connor>
<connor> talk about it like that it's not like it </connor>
<connor> defines my taste for some reason i just </connor>
<garnt> want to talk about that scene and how </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] weird because because like i </garnt>
<garnt> like kind of kind of talking to you i </garnt>
<garnt> know what </garnt>
<connor> what kind of shows you would like you </connor>
<connor> know you you look at someone's three </connor>
<connor> over three and you can like recommend </connor>
<connor> some shows that they would like for </connor>
<connor> example </connor>
<connor> like i knew for example that you would </connor>
<connor> love a show like dota head </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean because that that </connor>
<connor> that that is crazy it's grimy it's a </connor>
<joey> chad anime </joey>
<joey> you know what i mean it's just corner it </joey>
<joey> just you know it's it's like </joey>
<connor> if i i'm just gonna say if i didn't see </connor>
<connor> this three by three </connor>

<joey> show you would like what i love that </joey>
<joey> that's actually like top three </joey>
<garnt> foundation </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest the biggest one for me is </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> mob psycho and hunter hunter hunter is </garnt>
<connor> my favorite show </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] sorry hunt hunter is my favorite </joey>
<connor> showing of all time what about jojo </connor>
<connor> i don't really count that as a shonen it </connor>
<garnt> is a show </garnt>
<joey> but it is a show because it has to be </joey>
<connor> categorized but there's no there's no </connor>
<connor> jojo category but there should be as far </connor>
<connor> as i'm concerned </connor>
<connor> you know okay that's what is the jojo </connor>
<connor> category then i cause </connor>
<connor> jojo is like it's own beast right like i </connor>
<garnt> can't i there's nothing you can compare </garnt>
<garnt> jojo to no i i i agree with him a lot i </garnt>
<connor> i disagree i i compare jordan to </connor>
<connor> something right now do it bucky </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] off no no no no it's not it's not </connor>
<garnt> exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> it's not exactly i'm not saying they're </garnt>
<garnt> both the same thing right but they give </garnt>
<connor> off the same kind of </connor>
<connor> feeling you know what i mean where it's </connor>
<connor> just like there are some ridiculous </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] things happening and you're just </connor>
<connor> happy </connor>
<connor> good times yes but i'm not i'm not </connor>
<connor> saying that they're on like the same </connor>
<connor> level or anything </connor>
<connor> but they give off the same vibe is what </connor>
<connor> i'm talking about but </connor>
<garnt> i've always said that they're just both </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] insane but the thing is i reduce </garnt>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> a bunch of 80s and 90s shown in back </joey>
<joey> then </joey>
<joey> had this kind of feel to it yeah like </joey>
<joey> fist the nostar </joey>
<joey> also has scenes where it's just like </joey>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] did i just read </garnt>
<joey> and you just recommended them that to </joey>
<garnt> him because he said no that's yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's what that's exactly what i'm </connor>
<connor> saying </connor>
<garnt> jojo were like halfway through was like </garnt>
<garnt> right let's just be gay now like that </garnt>
<connor> that's </connor>
<joey> that's like i love that no trust me </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of gay parts in fizzling </joey>
<connor> is that really oh yeah i just thought it </connor>
<joey> was like the manliest manly anime </joey>
<joey> in existence like no i guess that's </joey>
<joey> pretty gay and that is pretty good </joey>
<joey> that's pretty good that's pretty gay </joey>
<joey> there's a thing called i don't know if </joey>

<connor> was expecting that because you've talked </connor>
<joey> about it </joey>
<joey> right you've even made a whole video on </joey>
<connor> bananafish so i expected that </connor>
<connor> but so you're complaining that i picked </connor>
<joey> good shows is that </joey>
<joey> yes because everybody's three by three </joey>
<joey> has to have at least </joey>
<connor> one show where it's like hold on </connor>
<connor> honestly let's see if i can put a bad </connor>
<connor> show that i like </connor>
<joey> in my three by three there's got to be </joey>
<joey> at least one guilty pleasure see </joey>
<connor> the money there's gonna be what i'm </connor>
<connor> saying is </connor>
<connor> every three by three has to have at </connor>
<joey> least one shitty show that you know is </joey>
<connor> shitty </connor>
<connor> look look honestly what is it uh the </connor>
<joey> world got in the nose that's a [ __ ] </joey>
