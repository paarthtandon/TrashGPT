<connor> - I was like, "Well, why the
fuck do we have a blowtorch? </connor>
<garnt> Why don't we have something
like a normal lighter </garnt>
<joey> or something.
- Like a match, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and he went to go point it </joey>
<joey> to start a fire </joey>
<connor> and the whole blowtorch just went on fire. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Uh, you
might wanna put that out." </connor>
<connor> (bright upbeat music) </connor>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host for today, Garnt, </garnt>
<garnt> and with me once again are the boys, </garnt>
<garnt> and we almost died! </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Not clickbait. </connor>
<garnt> - Not clickbait. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the title of this video. </connor>
<connor> That is the title of this video. </connor>
<garnt> We almost died camping, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, now we have to do it like... </garnt>
<joey> - Why did you say it so quickly? </joey>
<joey> Now no one's gonna watch
the rest of the episode. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Now we have to do like
the YouTuber thumbnail face </garnt>
<joey> of just... </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<connor> - All right, this is my 'nail face. </connor>
<joey> (Joey gasps) </joey>
<joey> - Audio-only listeners are
like, "What's happening?" </joey>
<garnt> - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - How long did it take you guys </garnt>
<garnt> to perfect the YouTuber thumbnail face? </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt, come on we can't tangent already. </connor>
<garnt> We've only just started the topic. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This isn't a Quentin
Tarantino film, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. Okay. That's the hook. </connor>
<connor> We'll start off with a tangent </connor>
<joey> and then we'll go back </joey>
<joey> to the topic of this video.
- We'll talk about that, </joey>
<joey> but in the meantime... </joey>
<joey> - But in the meantime, </joey>
<garnt> how long did it take you guys </garnt>
<garnt> to perfect your YouTuber thumbnail face? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> You're asking the wrong question, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Why? </garnt>
<connor> - It's how long did it take </connor>
<connor> before you stopped becoming
ashamed of yourself </connor>
<connor> doing the YouTuber thumbnail face? </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - How long has it been
since your soul died? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, this is a legitimate question </garnt>
<garnt> because I still suck
at it, because I do... </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean? You
just open your mouth big. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I do anime thumbnails, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so my entire career
has been anime thumbnails, </garnt>
<garnt> and so the few videos that
I film in live action, </garnt>
<garnt> I've just been like a fucking
sheep in headlights about it. </garnt>
<joey> - Your YouTube face is like... </joey>
<garnt> - My YouTube face is
just me looking depressed </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't know how
to make any other face. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] To be fair, you do it very well. </joey>
<connor> - I remember I got an angry email once </connor>
<joey> from someone being like, </joey>
<connor> "Why do you make your thumbnails </connor>
<connor> look like they're for 10-year-olds?" </connor>
<connor> "Why is your face open
and gasping like an idiot? </connor>
<connor> Do you have a penis in your
mouth or something like that?" </connor>
<joey> they were like. </joey>
<joey> - Because the general demographic </joey>
<joey> is a 10-year-old on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - So I was thinking, and
then the explanation is, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately, "You
guys won't click on it!" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - The sad truth is that it works </garnt>
<garnt> and it's something that you
have to come to terms with. </garnt>
<garnt> Someone asked me, "When you
take the thumbnail thing, </garnt>
<joey> do you just depressingly sigh afterwards, </joey>
<joey> after you make the pose?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Yes." </joey>
<joey> - Yes, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - You do. </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, I gotta massage the face. </garnt>
<joey> - There's no bigger "Black Mirror" moment </joey>
<connor> than when you finish shooting
that thumbnail face shot. </connor>
<connor> And then you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, okay, well now I
gotta go on with my life </connor>
<connor> knowing I just did that." </connor>
<connor> So it is depressing as fuck. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, to me, I just, </connor>
<connor> because with thumbnails, </connor>
<connor> I feel like you never
perfect it on the first go. </connor>
<connor> I feel like with
thumbnails you need 15 goes </connor>
<joey> before you know what your
thumbnail style is, right? </joey>
<joey> - Sounds like a rookie. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> For you, it's... </joey>
<joey> - One-take wonder, baby. </joey>
<joey> - For you, it's fucking easy. </joey>
<connor> - One take, no re-dos. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause now you've got
cartoony thumbnails, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's 50-50. </garnt>
<garnt> That's when I'm too lazy
and then I get them to. </garnt>
<garnt> But also there's some
thumbnails where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I can't possibly do a good
enough job capturing this." </garnt>
<connor> So I'll do some nice
little cheesy clickbait </connor>
<garnt> with a character and some drawings. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, what about you, Joey? </connor>
<connor> How long do you take on your thumbnails? </connor>
<connor> Do you make a specific face for that video </connor>
<connor> or is it just a random screenshot </connor>
<garnt> from the video you just filmed? </garnt>
<connor> - Do you think you make
the best thumbnails </connor>
<joey> out of Trash Taste? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Who do you think makes
the best thumbnails? </joey>
<joey> - Garnt. </joey>
<connor> - You think so? </connor>
<connor> I think me. </connor>
<connor> - Who's got the most views? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's... </garnt>
<garnt> - Different topics, though. </garnt>
<connor> - I definitely make the
worst; that's for sure. </connor>
<connor> - No, do you? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think so. </joey>
<joey> - I think 'cause you make them (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - I think my thumbnails fucking suck. </joey>
<joey> - I like mine a lot. I
like mine. I think I... </joey>
<joey> - Well, I like yours as well. </joey>
<joey> - I get criticized the
consistency isn't there. </joey>
<connor> I don't have a pattern, </connor>
<connor> but I also like that it's all
over the place a little bit. </connor>
<connor> I like that you get a different art style </connor>
<connor> every now and then. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] For me, I feel-
- I feel it's a bit </joey>
<garnt> of a double-edged sword
if you develop a pattern </garnt>
<garnt> because then your thumbnails
start to look same. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But that's the good thing, </joey>
<garnt> because actually, if you imagine, </garnt>
<garnt> you go, you've discovered
a YouTuber, right? </garnt>
<garnt> One of the biggest things
that puts me off is, </garnt>
<garnt> I've discovered a YouTuber,
his content's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I click on their channel </garnt>
<garnt> and it's all over the fucking place. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "What
is this channel trying to, </garnt>
<garnt> what is this channel's content?" </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of like an
Instagram page, right, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's not just about one photo. </garnt>
<garnt> It's about when people
click on your entire profile </garnt>
<garnt> and they see a portrait of
what your profile's about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Again, a perfect example
of why my thumbnails suck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, wait. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause they're all over the place. </joey>
<connor> - Okay first of all-
- [Garnt] No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Now I look like an
egoistical asshole, being like, </connor>
<connor> "I think mine are the best." </connor>
<garnt> I do like mine though. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - But that's 'cause I spend a
lot of fucking time doing it </joey>
<joey> and I have a bunch of people I consult. </joey>
<joey> We're like the council getting around it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, "What do you think?" </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, why do you think the
reason your thumbnail... </garnt>
<connor> Okay, I have several
questions I wanna ask you. </connor>
<connor> I didn't expect you to be
like, "My thumbnails suck." </connor>
<joey> Why would you upload them
if you think they suck? </joey>
<joey> - Because I can't make better ones. </joey>
<joey> - Why don't you hire someone? </joey>
<connor> - I mean... </connor>
<connor> - It's the same thing with editing. </connor>
<connor> - I could do it. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "I'm not
good enough at this. </connor>
<connor> Someone else can take my
jumbled mess of words. </connor>
<connor> I can work with them. </connor>
<connor> They can get used to my style
and then we can go about it." </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Then I feel it just completely detaches me </joey>
<connor> from my content, in a sense. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's an excuse. </connor>
<connor> - I think the thumbnail is
the last little bit of me </connor>
<connor> that I can put into it. </connor>
<garnt> And it's like- </garnt>
<connor> - You are the video, though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you are the video. </joey>
<connor> - That is true but- </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause your thumbnail style is you. </connor>
<joey> It's your face. </joey>
<garnt> That is part of your style.
- I think it's also because </garnt>
<joey> I don't even know what the fuck </joey>
<garnt> I'm doing with my thumbnails. </garnt>
<connor> I don't have a pattern
or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> I also switch between the cartoon, </connor>
<joey> my avatar version of me, and my face. </joey>
<garnt> - But is it a 50-50 clear split? </garnt>
<garnt> Or is it, I feel like- </garnt>
<connor> - No, it's mostly my face nowadays. </connor>
<connor> - It's mostly your face now, right? </connor>
<connor> - Is it the avatar when you, 'cause- </connor>
<joey> - Before, it used to be just my avatar. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think I understand, because one, </connor>
<connor> it's easier to rely on an avatar. </connor>
<connor> You have a lot more room to play with, </connor>
<joey> and the expressions are
set and it's cleaner. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - With your face, you
gotta worry about lighting. </connor>
<connor> You gotta worry about all that stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I get it. </joey>
<connor> Is it when you cannot get
a good one with your face, </connor>
<connor> you bring in the avatar? </connor>
<joey> - No, I just give up
and just use a shit one. </joey>
<connor> - Or if you're not happy with it? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I see, I see. </joey>
<joey> - I work with what I've got, basically. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you need get a
good artist or somebody. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause even with my photos now, </connor>
<connor> you'll notice that there's text in it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - All the text is hand-drawn. </connor>
<connor> Everything's all hand-done </connor>
<connor> 'cause I want to get it all to fit nicely. </connor>
<connor> When you fuck around with fonts, </connor>
<connor> yeah, you could probably do it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I wanna get everything perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'll talk with someone about, </garnt>
<garnt> "Let's reframe this picture. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's move things around." </garnt>
<connor> Gotta get just right, so it looks nice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because like you say, </connor>
<connor> you think you have the best thumbnails, </connor>
<connor> and I think you definitely do, </connor>
<connor> for the content you make. </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's why you've found success. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna suck my own dick here. </connor>
<joey> I feel like my thumbnails </joey>
<joey> are the most optimized they can be </joey>
<joey> for anime-style content. </joey>
<joey> - That's true, I guess it's a different- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's a different type
of style of content, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like if I'm cosplaying, </connor>
<joey> at the time of recording, </joey>
<joey> I recently used a cosplay video. </joey>
<connor> That's so easy to make a good thumbnail. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just literally get the
picture of the cosplay </joey>
<joey> and then just have
some, "Whoa, that's me." </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- That's what I did. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it works. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas for me, 90% of the time, </connor>
<connor> if you see a video recommended on YouTube </connor>
<connor> and it has, say, a waifu's face
plastered right on the front </connor>
<garnt> with a bunch of memes on the side </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna know it's my videos. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're not even gonna need to see </garnt>
<garnt> that it's my channel, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's a certain style </garnt>
<garnt> that I've built up over the years. </garnt>
<connor> - Can I backtrack, sucking my own dick? </connor>
<garnt> We all make the best
thumbnails for what we do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're all good gamers. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure somebody could
make better thumbnails </garnt>
<garnt> for doing the same thing. </garnt>
<connor> But that's the thing, though. </connor>
<connor> You can never think, "I've
got it. I've got it nailed." </connor>
<connor> You gotta think, "How
do I make it better?" </connor>
<connor> How do I improve this? </connor>
<connor> I wanna make it pop more. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I hate thumbnails. </connor>
<connor> - What is the worst thumbnail </connor>
<connor> you think you've made, </connor>
<connor> that you can remember? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, so many. </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever gone back </connor>
<joey> and changed the thumbnail, at all? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Never? </joey>
<joey> - I have... </joey>
<joey> - I'm too lazy for that. </joey>
<joey> Once I'm done, it's gone. That's it. </joey>
<connor> Once the video's live, </connor>
<connor> I do not wanna think about it. </connor>
<garnt> - I used to think like that </garnt>
<connor> until I saw that fucking
Veritasium video that... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That said he goes back
and changes the thumbnail. </connor>
<joey> I tried it, and it actually
makes a fucking difference. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Some videos that I changed
the thumbnail and title </joey>
<joey> actually have a second wind </joey>
<garnt> and they're doing way better </garnt>
<garnt> than even when they initially launched. </garnt>
<joey> - I've been thinking about doing it </joey>
<joey> ever since that Veritasium video, </joey>
<connor> but I just haven't been fucked to do it. </connor>
<connor> - I love it- </connor>
<joey> - I was like, "Yeah,
I'll get to it today." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. A lot of the older videos, </joey>
<joey> I genuinely don't want people to watch. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, "This, not the content I make. </connor>
<connor> I do not want you watching hours and hours </connor>
<connor> of Sebastian prank calling, </connor>
<connor> and then being like, 'When's
the next one coming out?'" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You know? It's not. It's not coming out. </connor>
<connor> It's never coming out.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not doing it anymore, </connor>
<connor> let me get out of this
nightmare situation. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You're not gonna add anything to that? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I was just like... </garnt>
<connor> - You looked like you were
about to say something, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - I was just like, "You know what? </joey>
<connor> I don't think I can relate." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - In my head, I was just like, </joey>
<connor> "Can I relate to this? </connor>
<connor> Can I relate to this? </connor>
<garnt> No, I can't relate to this."
- No, because most YouTubers </garnt>
<joey> who can relate to this... </joey>
<joey> - In my head, I was just like the avatar, </joey>
<joey> like, "That's rough, buddy." </joey>
<joey> That's all I can think. </joey>
<joey> - Most YouTubers who get to this point... </joey>
<garnt> - All I was getting in my mind was like, </garnt>
<connor> "I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that happened to you. </connor>
<joey> But I'm not reading that,"
or something like that. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I'm happy for you," </joey>
<garnt> or "I'm sorry for your loss, </garnt>
<connor> but I'm not reading all that." </connor>
<connor> - Because most YouTubers
who get to this point </connor>
<connor> have never had to deal with that </connor>
<connor> because that channel died. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true, because I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the biggest things you've done </garnt>
<garnt> is you've definitely changed
up your content a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> And you definitely, your style </garnt>
<garnt> and how you promote your videos, </garnt>
<garnt> and your thumbnails </garnt>
<connor> have definitely changed
along the way, right? </connor>
<connor> So it's a nice evolution, </connor>
<connor> but for me, I've been around for so long </connor>
<connor> that there are still
videos that I'm proud of, </connor>
<connor> that I made years ago. </connor>
<connor> Not every video, of course. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Anime Minutes? </connor>
<connor> - Anime Minutes? </connor>
<connor> Oh, that's definitely
coming back, eventually. </connor>
<joey> - Can't wait for it to come back, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - When's the next one, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - It's like my "Hunter
x Hunter", you know? </joey>
<joey> It's just on hiatus. </joey>
<joey> - It's your back pains. </joey>
<connor> - I've got back pains. </connor>
<garnt> I've got Trash Taste to
work on, guys, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you didn't know, </garnt>
<garnt> the mangaka of "Hunter × Hunter" </garnt>
<garnt> has back pains and hasn't
wrote in like over a year, </garnt>
<joey> I think, right? </joey>
<joey> Hasn't released one in over a year. </joey>
<connor> - It's like two years ago. </connor>
<connor> - Two years, Jesus. </connor>
<garnt> RIP "Hunter x Hunter" fans. </garnt>
<joey> - Before that, it was like six years. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> Now I just feel bad whenever
a manga is on hiatus </garnt>
<garnt> because of fucking "Berserk", </garnt>
<garnt> how big of a meme that is,
and what that turned into. </garnt>
<joey> - I saw an interview with Araki. </joey>
<joey> That man works every day of the week. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I bet. </connor>
<connor> - He's like 60. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Still looks 30. </connor>
<joey> - This man is never gonna stop. </joey>
<joey> - No, of course not. </joey>
<connor> - It was insane. </connor>
<connor> This man told his weekly schedule </connor>
<connor> and didn't mention a break anywhere. </connor>
<connor> He works from, I think, 10 AM to 11 PM </connor>
<joey> with one-hour break. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Bruh." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - "Bruh." </connor>
<joey> - That's what it takes, man, </joey>
<joey> to be the fucking top shonen person. </joey>
<connor> - But no wonder he has so
much musical reference. </connor>
<garnt> He doesn't have time to do anything else </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he's just listening
to music and drawing, </garnt>
<garnt> and doing stuff all the time. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I can't imagine
what the actual life </connor>
<connor> of a mangaka is like, </connor>
<connor> because you see some
YouTubers on the grind. </connor>
<connor> But at least with YouTube, </connor>
<connor> you can have some variety in there. </connor>
<connor> You can collab and you can do... </connor>
<connor> - I work them all.
- Types of content. </connor>
<garnt> - But I take breaks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, part of the
charm is that your breaks </garnt>
<connor> also happen to be monetizable, right? </connor>
<connor> Because that's like your
Twitch streams, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because for you, </connor>
<connor> that's your downtime, as well as work, </connor>
<connor> I guess, technically, but with mangakas, </connor>
<connor> you can't do anything but just draw </connor>
<connor> and work on your fucking series. </connor>
<joey> And I can't imagine being that one-tracked </joey>
<joey> and being that dedicated </joey>
<joey> to just a single thing in
your life for that long. </joey>
<joey> I can't dedicate a month
of my life to one project, </joey>
<joey> let alone five years or
10 years or 20 years. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Or your entire life, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I saw a Reddit post, it was like, </joey>
<connor> what's the guy who
wrote "Game of Thrones"? </connor>
<joey> - George R. R. </joey>
<joey> - George R. R. Martin. </joey>
<joey> He apparently begged HBO </joey>
<connor> to make 10 seasons of "Game of Thrones" </connor>
<connor> instead of the seven...? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Eight. </garnt>
<garnt> - Eight. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Eight. </garnt>
<garnt> - Eight? </garnt>
<garnt> - We forgot 8th season. </garnt>
<garnt> - I opened this thread. </garnt>
<garnt> I half expected, </garnt>
<connor> what did you think the
comments were gonna be </connor>
<connor> when you went to that thread, </connor>
<connor> what would you think people would reply? </connor>
<joey> - On what, him begging for 10 seasons? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, he apparently asked for the... </garnt>
<connor> - They would agree with him? </connor>
<connor> They would agree. </connor>
<joey> - Like, "Yeah, go, George." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah no, not at all. </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Well, if he wasn't </joey>
<joey> such a lazy piece of shit
and finished his books, </joey>
<joey> maybe they'd have
something to work off of." </joey>
<joey> Apparently... </joey>
<joey> - People suck. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I dunno, 'cause in some ways, </joey>
<joey> apparently, he, I can't
remember what exactly. </joey>
<connor> But apparently, he was helping write </connor>
<connor> some episodes initially. </connor>
<connor> And then later on, afterwards, </connor>
<connor> he wasn't helping write
any of the episodes. </connor>
<joey> - Isn't that the reason </joey>
<joey> why like the latest
seasons sucked so much? </joey>
<joey> Was that because he kind of like... </joey>
<joey> - Maybe? But...
- That was the theory, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's tough- </joey>
<joey> - I've never seen a single episode </joey>
<connor> of "Game of Thrones". </connor>
<connor> - We'll never know. </connor>
<joey> - And there was a lot of comments </joey>
<joey> and there's one or two </joey>
<connor> that I kind of half-agreed with, </connor>
<connor> where I was like, "Okay. If
you are not gonna do the job, </connor>
<connor> and you are the most
qualified person for the job, </connor>
<connor> and they're doing it, with or without you, </connor>
<connor> and you decide, 'No, I'm not doing it,' </connor>
<connor> and then it becomes shit, </connor>
<connor> can you then turn around and be like, </connor>
<connor> 'Oh, it's shit. They should
have just given it more time.'" </connor>
<connor> Because the argument was like, </connor>
<connor> "If the job's gonna get done, </connor>
<connor> you're not gonna do it,
then it's your fault." </connor>
<connor> It's kind of his fault,
people were saying, </connor>
<connor> because he should have... </connor>
<garnt> - It's not his fault, I mean... </garnt>
<joey> - Not entirely his fault. </joey>
<joey> - I can understand a little bit </joey>
<connor> where they were coming from. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure there's a certain
degree of responsibility. </joey>
<joey> But to say that it's all his fault </joey>
<joey> because he's the main guy, </joey>
<joey> is a little harsh, I think. </joey>
<connor> - A lot of people were
being very critical of him </connor>
<joey> in a sense that I
thought was a bit unfair, </joey>
<joey> but I understand. </joey>
<joey> - "Game of Thrones"
fans being critical, no. </joey>
<connor> - Well I think as "Game of Thrones" fans, </connor>
<joey> they've gone through all
the five stages of grief </joey>
<joey> with the books. </joey>
<joey> They've gotten to acceptance now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - They've accepted that
it's never gonna finish </joey>
<joey> and it's never coming out. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure it's over. </joey>
<joey> - Hatahata fans are like, "First time?" </joey>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure it's never coming out. </connor>
<connor> - As an anime fan, I'm a hardened veteran. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh, this series
isn't finished? Cool. </connor>
<connor> Give me the next isekai. </connor>
<garnt> Just give me the next finish isekai." </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the one time where
I opened a Reddit thread </garnt>
<connor> and I was genuinely 100% incorrect </connor>
<joey> on what I thought the
replies were gonna be. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause Reddit is
normally a really simple, </joey>
<joey> first thought that comes
to your head circle jerk. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Go for the low-hanging
fruit, get your karma." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone upvotes. </garnt>
<connor> But it wasn't. </connor>
<garnt> - But I also find with Reddit, </garnt>
<garnt> it also depends very much
on the board you're on, </garnt>
<garnt> because depending on the board you're on, </garnt>
<garnt> you can get very very different replies </garnt>
<connor> because it's all a circle jerk, </connor>
<connor> but it's a circle jerk of
people who think alike, </connor>
<connor> and not everyone on the
same board thinks alike, </connor>
<connor> because anyone who
doesn't just gets shunned. </connor>
<connor> You go on some Reddit threads </connor>
<connor> or some Reddit forums
and you see this thread </connor>
<connor> and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "I can't be the only one
who thinks this way." </connor>
<connor> And then you go on the Reddit thread </connor>
<connor> and everyone, seemingly
in the Reddit thread, </connor>
<connor> thinks the exact opposite of you. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "Am I the crazy one? </connor>
<connor> Am I the fucking crazy one?" </connor>
<connor> Then you see the same thing </connor>
<connor> being discussed on YouTube
or Twitter or something, </connor>
<connor> and it's a completely opposite opinion. </connor>
<connor> So I think it very much does depend </connor>
<connor> on what board you're on </connor>
<connor> and what group of people
you are talking to, </connor>
<connor> because I can't imagine
everyone would think that </connor>
<garnt> that is George's fault, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was thinking about it, </connor>
<connor> and as somebody does creative stuff, </connor>
<connor> obviously not to the same
level and same expectations, </connor>
<connor> but you don't... </connor>
<garnt> It sucks because there are probably </garnt>
<garnt> a bunch of creatives out there </garnt>
<garnt> who are legitimately just being lazy </garnt>
<garnt> and just chilling and not doing anything. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, "Whatever,
whatever," in making that, </garnt>
<garnt> and I guess in some ways
that raises the question of, </garnt>
<connor> "Do the fans have a right to
demand the work come out?" </connor>
<connor> If he doesn't wanna make it anymore </connor>
<connor> and it's halfway through, is that... </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, the issue is that </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of people don't really appreciate </garnt>
<garnt> how much time it takes to make good shit. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Right. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, Joey. I'm gonna do this again. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna bring up "Arcane". </connor>
<connor> Well, once again. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I thought you were gonna
say "Fate" there for a moment. </connor>
<joey> - I'm gonna bring up
"Arcane" once again, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Amazing, a masterpiece.
- Am I allowed to leave or? </joey>
<joey> - No, because that series
took six years to make. </joey>
<joey> From what I understand, </joey>
<joey> it took five or six years to make. </joey>
<joey> And it definitely feels </joey>
<joey> like it took five or six years to make, </joey>
<connor> because there's so much
attention to detail </connor>
<connor> and so many different aspects of the show. </connor>
<connor> So I can see that this
took six years to make. </connor>
<connor> At the same time, </connor>
<connor> would I want to wait six
years for a season two? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah.
- I don't think I would. </connor>
<connor> Here's the thing, </connor>
<connor> I dunno what I would rather. </connor>
<connor> Would I rather wait that
long for a better product, </connor>
<connor> or would I rather wait less time </connor>
<connor> for a decent product that
I can at least consume? </connor>
<connor> It's the fucking "Cyberpunk"... </connor>
<connor> It's fucking "Cyberpunk". </connor>
<garnt> - First of all, "Arcane",
10 out of 10. Go watch it. </garnt>
<connor> Weekly reminder to go and watch "Arcane". </connor>
<connor> Number two, fuck, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> That's tough because... </connor>
<garnt> - Would you think "Cyberpunk"
would've done better </garnt>
<garnt> if they waited another two years? </garnt>
<connor> - I think with a game, it's different, </connor>
<connor> because a game is normally one and done </connor>
<connor> like "Cyberpunk" would
be one and done, right? </connor>
<connor> It pretty much, it's over, right? </connor>
<connor> - Is it? </connor>
<joey> - No, because they can do updates. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but like, as in
the core of the game, </connor>
<garnt> there's not gonna be a "Cyberpunk 2". </garnt>
<garnt> If you've played it, there's
not gonna be a "Cyberpunk 2". </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - If they would, I don't
know what they would do, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's gonna be like a one thing. </garnt>
<connor> Whereas "Arcane" ended on a cliffhanger </connor>
<connor> of sorts, right?
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So when you're ending on a cliffhanger, </connor>
<connor> it's a different question </connor>
<connor> as opposed to when you're
done, it's completely wrapped. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that's why we can see reboots </joey>
<joey> like 10, 15 years later, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like, "Okay,
it's this thing that's done." </joey>
<garnt> Then, oh, 15 years later,
"You liked that thing?" </garnt>
<garnt> - "Cyberpunk 2078". </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, because it's done. </garnt>
<connor> It's done, so it's fine. </connor>
<joey> - Except it actually comes out in 2078. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it totally would.
- The year is 2077. </joey>
<connor> "Cyberpunk" 2077 is finally finished. </connor>
<connor> - It'll come out, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It'll will come out like a fucking patch. </connor>
<garnt> - The patch is 10 Petrabytes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking hell. </garnt>
<connor> If it's a seasonal thing
with multiple seasons, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna wait six years. </connor>
<connor> If it's one thing that I
don't know anything about, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I can wait 20 years </connor>
<joey> 'cause I don't give a shit about it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is. </joey>
<joey> Give me the thing that's
done and complete, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But now that we know </joey>
<joey> there's probably gonna be
season two of "Arcane", </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna wait six years. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I don't. I don't. </garnt>
<joey> - Even if it ends up being mediocre </joey>
<joey> compared to season one? </joey>
<connor> - I am fine with it going
down from a 10 out of 10 </connor>
<garnt> to 8 out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> If it means you can get it in two years. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because there's so much
potential to this story, </garnt>
<garnt> where I feel like it
would be so squandered </garnt>
<connor> if I'm 50 and I'm still like, </connor>
<connor> "Waiting for Part Four of "Arcane"." </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, 'cause I'm going through </garnt>
<garnt> the same dilemma now with "Mushoku Tensei" </garnt>
<garnt> because from what I've heard </garnt>
<connor> talking to people in the industry, </connor>
<connor> that took so many fucking years to make, </connor>
<connor> and it definitely shows </connor>
<connor> that it took that many years to make. </connor>
<connor> - That's 'cause of all
the business meetings. </connor>
<garnt> - And that too. That too, on top of that. </garnt>
<connor> - That was like 70%. </connor>
<connor> - [Nabi] The studio did say that </connor>
<joey> they estimate 2023 for
"Arcane" season two. </joey>
<connor> - 2023. That's reasonable. </connor>
<garnt> - [Nabi] It took six years
for them to learn how. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel like the
reason why they say six years, </joey>
<joey> because they probably have
those pre-production meetings </joey>
<joey> that last god-knows-how-many-years. </joey>
<connor> When you actually start
getting all the pieces moving, </connor>
<connor> it's probably a little faster. </connor>
<connor> Now that you have more
money and more manpower, </connor>
<connor> they know that it's a success, </connor>
<connor> we know that it's very
successful, it'll you know, </connor>
<connor> and the merchandising
is endless, probably, </connor>
<connor> with this, and the games. </connor>
<connor> I think we won't be having
any shortage of "Arcane". </connor>
<garnt> - They'll have enough resources, I'm sure. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure Riot's gonna
give them enough resources. </garnt>
<joey> But I think one thing
that isn't appreciated </joey>
<joey> is that you also need talent, you know? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yes.
- [Joey] They do. </joey>
<joey> - There's been enough anime projects </joey>
<joey> that have money thrown at it, </joey>
<joey> and it doesn't help </joey>
<connor> because there's just not enough talent. </connor>
<connor> All the talented people </connor>
<connor> are working on different projects. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it's a dilemma. </connor>
<connor> I don't have the right
answer to this question. </connor>
<connor> - Please be a 10 out of 10
season two, I'm begging you. </connor>
<connor> I'm begging you. I need it. </connor>
<connor> - Do you think "Cyberpunk 2077" </connor>
<connor> should have come out when it did? </connor>
<connor> Probably not. </connor>
<connor> But how long would you have waited for it? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember when they announced </connor>
<connor> they were delaying it. </connor>
<connor> They delayed it a lot, </connor>
<connor> like twice.
- People were like, </connor>
<connor> "King, take your time, bro. </connor>
<connor> Take your time to do it." </connor>
<connor> - First time they delayed it, </connor>
<connor> everyone's like, "You know
what, take your time." </connor>
<connor> You made "The Witcher 3". I'll allow it. </connor>
<connor> Second time, that was when people </connor>
<garnt> were starting to get aggy. </garnt>
<garnt> That's when patience was tested. </garnt>
<garnt> So if they delayed it a third time; </garnt>
<garnt> did they delay a third time? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think so. </garnt>
<connor> - I think the scope of the
game was just over-ambitious. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I think it was. </garnt>
<connor> - It was just too much.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like in this current day, </joey>
<joey> you can't make what
they were trying to make </joey>
<garnt> to the level that they were advertising. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Within a reasonable time. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you know the more
GUIs you sink into it, </garnt>
<garnt> there's only so many sales
you can get on a game </garnt>
<garnt> without DLC and battle
passes and all that. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just gonna be a
game with maybe DLC, right? </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe they'd get some
micro-transactions in there, </garnt>
<garnt> but realistically, it
wasn't gonna be anything </garnt>
<garnt> that would crush numbers
we'd never seen before. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like-
- [Garnt] I guess so, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like how do you
convince the investors </garnt>
<garnt> to stick around and be happy? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you gotta, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of pressures
from outside forces. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, it's a business. </garnt>
<garnt> We can't forget. </garnt>
<garnt> - And also, is it fair to ask people </garnt>
<garnt> to spend like 10 years of their life </garnt>
<garnt> on the same fucking thing? </garnt>
<garnt> In some ways I'm like, "I
guess they're being paid." </garnt>
<garnt> - Mangakas be like, "Just 10 years?" </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> - Well, mangakas are built different. </connor>
<connor> The Japanese work ethic is just something </connor>
<connor> that we just don't have in the West. </connor>
<connor> Those dudes are chill. </connor>
<garnt> - Those are rookie numbers.
Gotta pump them up. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they are. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, in the case of mangakas, </connor>
<joey> that's all they have. </joey>
<connor> - Even Araki said, who did JoJo, </connor>
<connor> he said that the reason why </connor>
<connor> he split it into parts of
generations is he said, </connor>
<connor> "I would get bored drawing
the same characters </connor>
<connor> for 35 years." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He had the foresight
to see that he would, </connor>
<connor> and I don't blame him. </connor>
<connor> Could you imagine you gotta
draw fucking Mickey Mouse, </connor>
<connor> like 150 times a day? </connor>
<joey> You'd blow your brain out. </joey>
<joey> You'd know like the exact </joey>
<joey> crotch size...
- That's what animes are, man. </joey>
<connor> - You'd know the exact
gootch size of Mickey Mouse. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you imagine if fucking Jonathan </garnt>
<garnt> was still the main character
of "JoJo" to this day? </garnt>
<connor> - You ended up not even
liking the character </connor>
<connor> you made after x amount of time. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - You'd lose your mind. </connor>
<connor> You'd go crazy. </connor>
<connor> - I can relate to, </connor>
<connor> because as a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> I always like working on something new. </connor>
<connor> Working on a new kind of content, </connor>
<connor> as I'm sure you guys do as well, right? </connor>
<connor> So I can't imagine </connor>
<garnt> also dedicating that much
time to just a single project. </garnt>
<garnt> I know there are people
who have done that, </garnt>
<garnt> especially in indie video games, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just a one-man team </garnt>
<garnt> working on this one game
for fucking years and years. </garnt>
<connor> - Google the Russian film </connor>
<connor> that's been in production
for like 50 years. </connor>
<connor> Just type that in. Type that into Google. </connor>
<connor> I watched this thing, </connor>
<connor> this video from Atrocity Guide. </connor>
<connor> It's about this video, </connor>
<connor> about this Russian animation producer </connor>
<connor> who hand-draws every single frame. </connor>
<joey> - Oh! I think I know who
you're talking about. </joey>
<joey> He's like the Walt
Disney of Russia, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He's super acclaimed and famous. </connor>
<connor> His animations are insane. </connor>
<connor> It's amazing. </connor>
<connor> But he's been working
on this one animation </connor>
<connor> for a ridiculous amount of years. </connor>
<connor> It's never gonna be finished at the rate. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he's like nearly dying. </connor>
<connor> He's very, very old. </connor>
<garnt> And he's not even halfway </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like 30, 40
years in or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Really long. </garnt>
<garnt> - What kind of movie is he making? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a- </garnt>
<joey> - It's animated. </joey>
<garnt> - It's an animated story about, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's called "The
Raincoat" or something. </garnt>
<connor> - [Nabi] "The Overcoat". </connor>
<connor> - "The Overcoat". That's it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, "The Overcoat". Is
that what it's called? </connor>
<connor> - [Nabi] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How many years it
been in production for? </connor>
<garnt> - 40 years?!
- 40 years. </garnt>
<connor> - It's been in production
has been for 40 years. </connor>
<connor> - Has he released previews? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Has he just said, </joey>
<garnt> "Guys, I'm working on this
video. It's coming out." </garnt>
<joey> - The yellow delay thing
comes out every 10 years. </joey>
<connor> It's like, "Guys, gimme another 10 years." </connor>
<joey> - Imagine if- </joey>
<connor> - People reply to it, </connor>
<garnt> "I took work off to watch
this, what the fuck?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine YouTubers being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Guys, I'm working on
something big. It's big." </garnt>
<garnt> Ten years later, "Guys,
I'm still working on it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gonna be something big." </garnt>
<joey> - Update video every 10 years. </joey>
<connor> - They've released portions of the film </connor>
<connor> that you can watch, and
it is very beautiful. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's also really
sad 'cause it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, this thing, this set of drawing </connor>
<connor> that has consumed this man's life </connor>
<connor> and that has drove this man to insanity </connor>
<connor> and ruined all of his
relationships and everything," </connor>
<garnt> 'cause he's also like a dick to everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> Because every director
ever is a massive dick. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and he's really
apparently very harsh, </connor>
<garnt> works insane hours, </garnt>
<garnt> makes his wife work like
crazy, as well and... </garnt>
<garnt> - How's he getting paid? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think donations. </garnt>
<garnt> - Kickstarter. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Kickstarter. </joey>
<joey> - Kickstarter, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Indiegogo, GoFundMe, and all the works. </connor>
<garnt> - God, he must have gone through </garnt>
<garnt> every donation platform known to man, </garnt>
<connor> if he started 40 years ago. </connor>
<garnt> - So they don't have any
technology in the studio. </garnt>
<garnt> They refuse to have any technology, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause of course they do. </connor>
<connor> They do it all by hand. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, at what point, </connor>
<connor> when you are making something for so long, </connor>
<connor> are you like, "Come on, fuck off. </connor>
<connor> You can't finish it. Stop
now, this is a joke." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - "Sort it out, mate. </garnt>
<connor> Sort your life out, come on." </connor>
<garnt> - There's more to life
than just this one project. </garnt>
<connor> - Well you know, it goes past the point </connor>
<connor> where you are just
letting this consume you </connor>
<connor> to a point where you're
not creating any more. </connor>
<joey> It's just taking a whole... </joey>
<joey> - It's just an addiction. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't healthy, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're not gonna finish it. </garnt>
<garnt> - At that point, no
matter what you release, </garnt>
<connor> is never going to be
worth the amount of hours. </connor>
<connor> - Forty years of your life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean there's only a few things </connor>
<garnt> that are worth 40 years of your life. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't get me wrong, it looks amazing. </connor>
<garnt> But it's also very sad
hearing the story of this guy </garnt>
<connor> and it just takes over his life. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, he must really love it. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure that's an
understatement of the year. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I feel like, </connor>
<connor> I think it's an obsession. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it desperation? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It's probably one of those things where </garnt>
<garnt> it's definitely not
healthy, whatever it is. </garnt>
<joey> It's not like a passion. </joey>
<joey> He has passion, but... </joey>
<joey> - I think it's only a passion. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's obsession. </garnt>
<connor> Obsession is different from passion. </connor>
<connor> - What's the longest you guys </connor>
<connor> have ever worked on a single project? </connor>
<connor> I mean, 'cause you recently </connor>
<connor> just uploaded your cosplay video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Very good, very good. </connor>
<connor> Because I remember every
few weeks or something, </connor>
<connor> you'd be like, "Yeah,
I'm going to a shoot. </connor>
<connor> It's the cosplay video." </connor>
<connor> I swear that went on for a
fucking year or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it took long time. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, it's all right, it was good. </garnt>
<connor> It's good fun. It wasn't too long. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Is that the
longest thing you worked on? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, not hours put in, </connor>
<connor> but as in time and number of shoots, </connor>
<connor> yeah it was the most. </connor>
<connor> It's fine. It wasn't too hands-on. </connor>
<connor> Just kind of getting the
edit down was difficult. </connor>
<garnt> - What's the most you've ever
put into one project then? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my gosh. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, I'll go first then. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Is yours the "Fate" one? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> The most I've ever put in was, </joey>
<joey> must be 10 years ago or something now, </joey>
<connor> I made this Top 20 list called </connor>
<connor> "The Top Coolest Anime
Characters of All Time" </connor>
<connor> or something along those lines. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds like a 2010 Gigguk video. </garnt>
<connor> - How did this take you years? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, so get this. It was eight parts. </garnt>
<joey> - (sighs) Okay. </joey>
<connor> - It was an eight-part series, </connor>
<garnt> because I would spend... </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Eight-part
featuring 10 characters. </connor>
<garnt> - No, 20 characters. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So every part would contain
two or three characters </joey>
<connor> and each part would be at
least 15 to 20 minutes long. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And I was working on
this one single project </connor>
<connor> basically throughout university. </connor>
<connor> I basically wasn't uploading anything </connor>
<connor> but this one fucking series. </connor>
<connor> And I realized, about two videos in, </connor>
<connor> after I'd spent months
just working on two videos, </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, "I've
made a massive mistake." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Did you finish it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I did finish it.
- [Connor] Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - It took me an entire year to finish. </garnt>
<garnt> And it took me an entire year to finish. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when I finished it, </garnt>
<garnt> was basically when I
graduated from university... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I put the script of this Top 20 list </garnt>
<connor> next to my dissertation. </connor>
<connor> The top 20 list was twice
the length of my dissertation </connor>
<connor> that I had worked my last year in uni on. </connor>
<joey> - Hell, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So my dissertation, </joey>
<joey> which I spent an entire year working on, </joey>
<joey> was half the length of this
fucking YouTube video series </joey>
<joey> that I'd worked on in that same year. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - So that was- </joey>
<joey> - That's so good. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. At some point, </connor>
<connor> it's not motivation
that's keeping you going, </connor>
<connor> because when you have a project that big, </connor>
<connor> you just wanna finish it </connor>
<connor> just so you can fucking finish it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - All through, you just wanna stop. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You can't; you've started. </connor>
<connor> The Yaoi audiobook, </connor>
<connor> which took me a month of probably
at least five days a week, </connor>
<connor> eight to 12 hours nonstop. </connor>
<connor> Reading this fucking book
over and over again nonstop. </connor>
<connor> Read that book so many times, I hate it. </connor>
<connor> I hate it now. I can't look at it. </connor>
<garnt> It drives me insane. </garnt>
<garnt> I like it. I like it a lot, but I hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause you get to about
50, 60% of the way in, </garnt>
<joey> and you're just like... </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] I'm done. </joey>
<joey> - This is shit. I'm done. </joey>
<joey> I'm not doing this anymore. </joey>
<joey> Then you're like, "But I gotta finish it." </joey>
<connor> There's just something about </connor>
<connor> having an unfinished project that just... </connor>
<connor> - 50, 60% in, you can't stop. </connor>
<connor> You have to. </connor>
<connor> - People are gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, where's EvAbridged 2.0?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "I did the first film. </connor>
<connor> That, to me, is a completed project." </connor>
<connor> Part of the big reason I
didn't wanna continue that </connor>
<connor> was because I didn't wanna
put that upon myself again, </connor>
<connor> to start a project that I knew </connor>
<connor> was gonna take fucking years to finish. </connor>
<connor> That's what excites me, </connor>
<connor> but that's what also scares me the most, </connor>
<connor> when it comes to taking on a big project. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I've got a lot of different ideas </connor>
<connor> for a lot of big projects
I eventually want to do. </connor>
<connor> But just knowing what it's like, </connor>
<connor> where you are excited, </connor>
<connor> you're motivated for the first half, </connor>
<connor> and then that just peters off </connor>
<connor> and you start hating your project
and start hating yourself. </connor>
<connor> And you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "I just want to get this done." </connor>
<garnt> That to me is such an awful grind. </garnt>
<garnt> - What about you, Joey?
What was your longest? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, I mean... </connor>
<joey> - Is there a video that
stands out as being grueling? </joey>
<connor> Or anything you worked
on music-wise, anything? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, music-wise, I guess. </joey>
<joey> My first album took me like two years. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause how long </garnt>
<joey> were you working on that album for? </joey>
<joey> - The first album, I took like two years. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] That's on-and-off, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, that was on-and-off </connor>
<joey> 'cause that was just like a side project. </joey>
<connor> - So you throw a little
bit here and there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, whenever I felt like doing it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's not really, </connor>
<joey> my career isn't dependent on my album. </joey>
<garnt> - When did you feel like it was ready </garnt>
<joey> to be released? </joey>
<connor> Because I've had side projects like that, </connor>
<connor> where you do a certain percentage </connor>
<connor> and then you realize, "Wait a minute, </connor>
<joey> I might actually get to the end of this. </joey>
<garnt> I might actually be able to finish this." </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, the first album
was like eight tracks </garnt>
<joey> and I think by track six, I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, is this enough for an
album or should I add more?" </connor>
<connor> Not sure. </connor>
<joey> Then after that, it was kind
of a rush of inspiration </joey>
<joey> because it's you start
to see the final product. </joey>
<connor> The goal is right there. </connor>
<joey> I just need to run to it now. </joey>
<garnt> - The last 5% is actually really fun </garnt>
<joey> when it all starts to come together. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> The last 5% is like, "Hell, yeah." </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> In terms of videos, not too sure. </garnt>
<joey> I think the reason why a lot
of my videos take so long </joey>
<connor> is because either me, with
whatever I'm working with, </connor>
<connor> takes a long time just come back to. </connor>
<connor> A lot of it is just waiting. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I did that video with Ladybeard </garnt>
<connor> where we run around the figurine factory. </connor>
<connor> When we did that video, </connor>
<joey> that video took like eight months. </joey>
<connor> - Oh god, counting time
just getting prepped, </connor>
<connor> it's a different thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Tell me you're a Japanese YouTuber </garnt>
<joey> without telling me you're
a Japanese YouTuber. </joey>
<joey> - That video took me eight months, </joey>
<garnt> but seven of those months </garnt>
<connor> was just waiting for
them to give me the okay </connor>
<connor> and give me a good date to start. </connor>
<garnt> Then the actual shoot took
like a day and a half. </garnt>
<joey> So I feel like, in terms of just </joey>
<joey> sheer working on a video time, </joey>
<garnt> maybe a month is max. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't tell you which video it is, </garnt>
<joey> but I have a couple of videos like that. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel that with Trash
Taste specials there as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like the lead... </joey>
<joey> - The specials, I think, yeah, </joey>
<joey> definitely the longest so far. </joey>
<joey> - The lead time for the
specials is just so fucking long </joey>
<joey> that sometimes you forget
that they're coming out. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Was this a good
special? I can't remember." </joey>
<joey> I remember seeing the first draft </joey>
<garnt> of the drifting special
and the cycling special. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember my first thought was, </garnt>
<garnt> "God, I can't believe
I wasted all this time </garnt>
<garnt> to record this shit." </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - By the time this episode comes out, </connor>
<connor> the cooking special's probably out, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I guess we can talk about that </connor>
<connor> because that, oh my God, </connor>
<joey> that first draft took like how long? </joey>
<connor> - That's just because I think
it was one of those situations </connor>
<connor> where Trash Taste takes priority. </connor>
<connor> And because we're not, </connor>
<joey> 'cause we know people are willing to wait. </joey>
<joey> It does take a while, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's not prioritized at all. </joey>
<connor> We don't say. </connor>
<joey> - And I guess we do
want it to be the best. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we don't mind making wait </connor>
<connor> 'cause so much work goes into the shoot. </connor>
<garnt> - It's the one thing I
don't want to compromise on </garnt>
<connor> in terms of quality. </connor>
<connor> Can we talk about the Kendo special? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] I guess.
- [Connor] Sure. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so we released a picture </joey>
<connor> of us filming a Kendo special. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] God, how fucking bad was that? </connor>
<connor> - That was months and
months and months ago. </connor>
<connor> A lot of viewers may have
just forgotten about it. </connor>
<connor> But I know I see some Reddit
posts every now and again, </connor>
<connor> bringing that special up. </connor>
<connor> Like, "When's the Kendo special coming?" </connor>
<connor> "When is it coming?" </connor>
<connor> We actually scrapped the special </connor>
<connor> because we filmed for an entire day. </connor>
<connor> We got all the source footage </connor>
<connor> and then Mudan edited a first draft </connor>
<connor> and we thought it was shit. </connor>
<connor> - It was shit. </connor>
<connor> - And we thought, </connor>
<connor> "There's only so much we can save </connor>
<garnt> through editing and voiceover," </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the source footage, </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately, just wasn't there. </garnt>
<garnt> So we had to make the decision, </garnt>
<garnt> "Do we try and maybe frame this, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe release this as a mini-special </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe something different? </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe it goes in the After Dark channel?" </garnt>
<garnt> But we eventually came to the decision </garnt>
<garnt> that we spent an entire day filming. </garnt>
<garnt> We hired three cameramen, four, maybe four </garnt>
<garnt> and Ashley as a sound guy, </garnt>
<garnt> we hired the Kendo people,
and we scrapped it. </garnt>
<garnt> We just scrapped. </garnt>
<joey> - But I think in general, </joey>
<joey> there was room for salvation, </joey>
<garnt> but I don't think it would've, </garnt>
<garnt> I think we can all agree </garnt>
<garnt> it wouldn't have been up to the standard </garnt>
<garnt> of where we see Trash Taste specials. </garnt>
<connor> - At best, it could've
been 10 or 15 minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it could have been </connor>
<joey> a decent vlog-style video
or anything like that. </joey>
<joey> But as a special, and especially
after the cycling special, </joey>
<garnt> we wanted to make something </garnt>
<joey> that was at that level
of quality or above. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - The Kendo special, no
matter how much we could do, </connor>
<garnt> no matter how much Mudan could do, </garnt>
<garnt> it just would not get to that standard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, that doesn't mean we're not going </garnt>
<joey> to do a Kendo special. </joey>
<garnt> Part of the reason we decided to scrap it </garnt>
<joey> was because we saw
potential to make it right. </joey>
<joey> - We learned a lot on that shoot. </joey>
<joey> - Well, we did learn a lot. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you don't learn
without failing, right? </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It fucking hurt 'cause I remember </joey>
<joey> we were discussing what
to do with this special </joey>
<joey> for so fucking long. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Do we release it? </joey>
<joey> Do we try and do something with it?" </joey>
<joey> And it was just on the back burner </joey>
<joey> for months and months. </joey>
<joey> It was a hard decision, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like it's moments like this </joey>
<joey> where you really really learn something. </joey>
<joey> Part of the reason I
think the cooking special </joey>
<joey> is going to be good </joey>
<joey> was because we took so many of the lessons </joey>
<joey> that we learned from this failed special, </joey>
<joey> which we may reboot to a proper special </joey>
<joey> that meets our standard, </joey>
<joey> but we took so much from
this one experience, </joey>
<joey> which was a very expensive mistake, </joey>
<joey> it was an expensive experience, </joey>
<joey> but that's kind of the quality, </joey>
<joey> the bar of quality we wanna set, </joey>
<joey> at least for our specials. </joey>
<joey> A fucking podcast, </joey>
<joey> we can just argue about bone-on chicken </joey>
<joey> or fucking whatever
shitty food take we get </joey>
<joey> for the millionth time, and that's fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but the special is something </joey>
<connor> we really wanna make
sure we hit the nail on. </connor>
<garnt> The cooking special will be out </garnt>
<garnt> by the time this episode comes out. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Nabi] It's the previous episode. </garnt>
<connor> It's the episode before this one. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's the episode before this one. </connor>
<connor> - [Nabi] This is 82, if I'm not mistaken. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Nabi] You want the cooking special, </connor>
<joey> 81 special. </joey>
<connor> - We hope you just enjoyed
the cooking special. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, by the time you
guys are seeing this, </joey>
<joey> you can see the cooking
special from last week. </joey>
<joey> But we don't know, as of
us recording right now. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, hopefully, you guys enjoyed that. </joey>
<joey> - Got robbed by Meilyne's bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - No you didn't. </connor>
<garnt> - I did. </garnt>
<connor> - You were never close to winning, Connor. </connor>
<connor> You were never close to win. </connor>
<garnt> - You were never going to win. </garnt>
<connor> - No doubt Meilyne kneecapped me. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Meilyne was an impartial judge. </garnt>
<garnt> She played her role perfectly. </garnt>
<joey> - She was the chaotic evil
that we needed in that video. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Impartial judge, bro. </connor>
<connor> Bro. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, dude, it's because of my sweat. </connor>
<connor> It tasted better. </connor>
<joey> Obviously, that was the reason. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this. You were missing this. </joey>
<connor> - If you haven't watched
it, watch the Trash Taste. </connor>
<joey> - Go watch the Trash
Taste Cooking Special. </joey>
<garnt> We did put a lot of work into it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But I think the aim for 2022 for us </joey>
<joey> is to maybe get a couple
more specials out. </joey>
<garnt> That'd be nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I mean that- </garnt>
<joey> - Without compensating quality, right? </joey>
<garnt> - We've got a few ideas, </garnt>
<connor> which I think are gonna
be really really good. </connor>
<garnt> They're gonna be big, as
well, so don't worry about. </garnt>
<connor> - It's all bad. We could have done more. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, we could have. We could have. </garnt>
<connor> - We could have, </connor>
<garnt> but it would've been really difficult </garnt>
<connor> in the year that we had, </connor>
<connor> especially with the restrictions. </connor>
<connor> - It was very difficult. </connor>
<connor> - Part of the reason was, </connor>
<connor> every time we'd come
up with a special idea, </connor>
<connor> we'd just go to Meilyne or GeeXPlus like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, can we get approval for this place?" </connor>
<connor> And they'd be like, "Nope,
everything's under lockdown." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - And that would just delay things </connor>
<connor> for another few months and
then the next few months. </connor>
<connor> And then that was just </connor>
<garnt> the first three-quarters
of the year, basically. </garnt>
<connor> - And then scrapping the one special </connor>
<connor> really set us back on the schedule. </connor>
<connor> It's a bit unfortunate, really. </connor>
<garnt> - So we could have had
two specials this year, </garnt>
<garnt> but we scrapped one special. </garnt>
<connor> - Ideally, want what, three a year? </connor>
<connor> Is that the soft thing
that we set? Three or two? </connor>
<joey> - I'd like at least two. </joey>
<connor> - I think three. </connor>
<joey> - I don't want to push too far. </joey>
<garnt> - As someone who just cut
back to two uploads a month... </garnt>
<joey> - Let's promise two-
- It was two months. </joey>
<connor> - Let's promise-
- I'm gonna say two a year. </connor>
<connor> - Let's promise two at least,
but let's try for three. </connor>
<garnt> Let's try for three. </garnt>
<connor> - We'll try for three, yes. </connor>
<connor> - Because some of the ideas we have </connor>
<joey> are going to take months
of fucking planning. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, haven't already.
- Two at least. </connor>
<connor> Three maybe. </connor>
<joey> - The optimistic side
of me says three a year. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But the realistic side
of me says two a year. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We got our streams too, </joey>
<joey> we got our streams we're
focusing on as well. </joey>
<joey> We've got this. </joey>
<connor> - And all three of us
- We'll get three. </connor>
<garnt> - We'll get three. </garnt>
<connor> - Fully HD. </connor>
<connor> - Let's do five. No, fuck
it, let's do one a month. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - One a month?! </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - You know, I remember when... </joey>
<joey> - So we are hiring about
20 content producer roles. </joey>
<garnt> - I remember when I started Anime Minutes </garnt>
<connor> and I promised one a month, </connor>
<connor> and look how that turned out. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's just clown. </connor>
<connor> That's clown buffoonery
right there, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Bro, how are you gonna schedule
voice acting sessions, bro? </connor>
<garnt> - I thought I'd min-maxed it. </garnt>
<connor> And then I realized that
I couldn't get it to the, </connor>
<connor> it actually wasn't the voice acting side. </connor>
<connor> It was just the scripting side, </connor>
<garnt> where I couldn't get it to the quality </garnt>
<garnt> that I wanted for every series. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's also just gonna
be hard to do three a year. </joey>
<joey> Not only because of, you know, </joey>
<joey> the After Dark stuff we're doing as well. </joey>
<joey> But also just the fact that </joey>
<garnt> I think on all our main
channels, we're just gonna, </garnt>
<garnt> 2022 is just like another
step in quality up. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And just time taken, so it's like, </garnt>
<joey> yeah, we need all the help we can. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Basically. </joey>
<joey> - Help me, please.
- Help us. </joey>
<joey> - Help, help, help. </joey>
<joey> - Please help. </joey>
<joey> - But I would like to, just for myself, </joey>
<joey> I would like to get at least
two out a year, I think. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, we could have
easily done it last year. </garnt>
<joey> And we did film two last year. </joey>
<joey> - We did do last two. </joey>
<joey> - So, if one wasn't a learning experience, </joey>
<connor> we would've had two. </connor>
<connor> So that I think that- </connor>
<connor> - If we didn't fuck up, you'd have two. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Unfortunate circumstances made us fuck up. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, it's whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - But speaking of something </garnt>
<garnt> that is not going to
be a special just yet, </garnt>
<joey> we almost died! </joey>
<joey> - Can we pee?
- Wow, callback. </joey>
<connor> - I have to pee if
we're getting into this. </connor>
<connor> - Whoa, Connor needs to pee. </connor>
<connor> What is going on? </connor>
<connor> - Keep this in, Mudan. </connor>
<garnt> This is rare evidence of Connor </garnt>
<garnt> asking for a toilet break </garnt>
<garnt> before me or Joey have even asked. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] I've never asked a pee before. </connor>
<connor> Let me have this one. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll take this rare
opportunity to also pee. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I might as well. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </connor>
<connor> - Watching Netflix
without using ExpressVPN </connor>
<connor> is like paying for a gym membership, </connor>
<connor> but only using the treadmill. </connor>
<connor> - I can relate. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - To elaborate on that
comment I just made, </connor>
<connor> ExpressVPN allows you
to change your location, </connor>
<connor> which means that you get access </connor>
<connor> to Netflix's full library of content. </connor>
<garnt> - They have over a hundred
different server locations. </garnt>
<garnt> So you can gain access to
thousands of new shows. </garnt>
<garnt> This works with many other
streaming services too, </garnt>
<garnt> like BBC iPlayer, YouTube, and more. </garnt>
<joey> - So on Netflix, I can't
watch "Saving Private Ryan". </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] What? </connor>
<connor> - One of my favorite war movies. </connor>
<connor> It's not available in Japan. </connor>
<connor> So what I do is I flick on ExpressVPN, </connor>
<garnt> move it over to a new country, </garnt>
<garnt> and bam, it's ready
and available to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - So simple. </garnt>
<garnt> - Plus it's compatible
with all your devices, </garnt>
<joey> phones, laptops, media
consoles, smart TVs, and more. </joey>
<garnt> ExpressVPN also encrypts all your data. </garnt>
<garnt> It has the added benefit
of encrypting your data </garnt>
<garnt> so you can browse the
web safely and securely. </garnt>
<joey> So don't be stupid; be smart. </joey>
<joey> Stop paying full price
for streaming services </joey>
<joey> and only getting access to
a fraction of their content. </joey>

<joey> - Back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> - And we are back from our piss break. </garnt>
<joey> - Why did you say that? </joey>
<joey> - Because it's kept in this time. </joey>
<garnt> So they knew that we
were having a piss break. </garnt>
<joey> - At least an ad in between
that or something, you know? </joey>
<joey> Just a break, otherwise,
it'd be very awkward. </joey>
<garnt> - No, we're either coming back </garnt>
<joey> from an ad break or piss break. </joey>
<joey> - A piss break, or
double, both, who knows? </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, as Garnt said, we almost died. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not really. </garnt>
<joey> - But not really. </joey>
<joey> It's I mean- </joey>
<joey> - It's a YouTuber "we almost died." </joey>
<joey> Under certain circumstances, </joey>
<garnt> I'm sure we could have died but... </garnt>
<garnt> - It felt like I was
dying. That's for sure. </garnt>
<garnt> So you guys probably saw on
our social medias that we- </garnt>
<garnt> - If you don't, follow us on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, please follow us all on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> and Trash Test as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But we posted a couple of
photos of us going camping. </garnt>
<garnt> So many people thought, </garnt>
<garnt> "Camping Special? Your Camping Special?" </garnt>
<joey> No, it's not.
- It's not a bad idea. </joey>
<joey> - It's not. </joey>
<joey> - It's not a bad idea, </joey>
<garnt> but we do like to hang
out as mates as well. </garnt>
<joey> - They're appalled that sometimes </joey>
<joey> we just hang out without cameras. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Holy shit. </joey>
<connor> - Are we allowed to do
that? Is that legal? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, we did take pictures. </garnt>
<joey> - We did. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Come on. </joey>
<garnt> - That's not part of my contract. </garnt>
<connor> - We've got cameras in there, come on. </connor>
<connor> - But we didn't film it. </connor>
<garnt> - I was going vlog it
for the second channel, </garnt>
<connor> but I was having too much fun, </connor>
<connor> where I was like, "Fuck it." </connor>
<connor> Maybe not. </connor>
<connor> - Vlog what? Us just getting smashed? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so basically Nabi, </connor>
<connor> who works behind the camera, </connor>
<connor> as well as a bunch of his
friends and the three of us, </connor>
<garnt> we went camping to Mount Fuji, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was fucking awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was awesome until... </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] It was awesome
until we almost died. </joey>
<joey> - Until we had to sleep. </joey>
<joey> It is the first time I've been camping </joey>
<joey> in these kind of weather situations. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Same. </joey>
<joey> - So it was the first time. </joey>
<joey> So camping in England, right? </joey>
<joey> The most you gotta worry
about is some mild rain </joey>
<connor> a lot of the time. </connor>
<joey> It's like a mild annoyance. </joey>
<joey> - I've camped in the
winter before, I think. </joey>
<joey> - In the UK? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I'm pretty sure,
but it wasn't that cold. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right? </connor>
<joey> How cold does it get in
the UK in the winter? </joey>
<connor> - It depends where you are in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause a lot of places snow, right? </joey>
<connor> In the UK? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, snow's fine though. </connor>
<joey> Snow's all right. </joey>
<joey> - Snow's all right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, snow that cold. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it wasn't even
snowing where we were </joey>
<connor> and it was fucking cold. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Everything was frozen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, frozen is worse than cold. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - When the grass is frozen, it's way cold. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when the snow's compact,
it doesn't feel as cold. </joey>
<connor> - Right.
- I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - But we basically went to
this place called Fumotoppara, </joey>
<garnt> which, if you've watched "Yuru Camp", </garnt>
<garnt> is the place where they're going to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that legitimately where they went? </garnt>
<connor> - Is it the actual Yuru Camp place? </connor>
<connor> - I think that's actually where they went. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's the actual location. </connor>
<garnt> - Bruh. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is why there's so
many Yuru Camp references. </joey>
<garnt> - They fucking lied to me.
They fucking lied to me. </garnt>
<garnt> They made it look comfy. </garnt>
<garnt> What's comfy about -5 degrees weather, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to sleep in a fucking tent? </garnt>
<garnt> There was nothing comfy about that. </garnt>
<connor> - Let me give you the low down. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, please. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Please do. </garnt>
<joey> - First of all, it began
in a group chat, right? </joey>
<joey> A camping trip. We're
gonna do a camping trip. </joey>
<joey> Group chat. I'm checking out immediately. </joey>
<joey> I'm that one friend that doesn't
read the group chat at all. </joey>
<joey> I don't look at it, whatever. </joey>
<joey> If you want something from me, message me. </joey>
<joey> I don't open group chats </joey>
<garnt> because the moment I see 20 messages, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "All right,
peace." I'm not reading 20. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gimme CliffsNotes. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm like, "Can
someone just tell me?" </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry for your loss,
but I'm not reading that. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I dunno about you boys. This is my POV. </joey>
<garnt> It's like a few days before, and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, shit, I don't have anything." </garnt>
<connor> I realized I didn't have anything. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh yeah,
I have camping stuff," </connor>
<garnt> thinking back to the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh shit, I
don't have camping stuff." </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought I had a sleeping bag. </garnt>
<garnt> I did not have a sleeping bag. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't bring a chair, forgot about that, </connor>
<connor> so I had to buy a chair last minute. </connor>
<connor> So I went on Amazon panickingly,
like two days before, </connor>
<connor> because they told me to buy stuff, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, "Oh
shit, I didn't buy stuff." </connor>
<connor> So I started looking, </connor>
<connor> and there was only one sleeping bag </connor>
<connor> that was available to be
delivered in time before I left. </connor>
<connor> I could have gone to a store. </connor>
<connor> I didn't wanna go to a store. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "I'll get one off Amazon." </connor>
<connor> I'm lazy. I bought a
chair, too, and it arrived. </connor>
<connor> The chair was very heavy, very big. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> - Too be fair, it was
worth it though, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, the chair came in. </connor>
<connor> I think I had the best
chair in the end, actually. </connor>
<connor> It was this chair that... </connor>
<garnt> - Because Joey's one had water damage </garnt>
<garnt> from the amount of times
he'd put it outside. </garnt>
<garnt> - This chair is quite
heavy, very big, I'd say. </garnt>
<joey> It's not that big,
actually, yours was bigger. </joey>
<joey> But it was a chair where the
back was connected to the legs. </joey>
<joey> So when you leaned on the
back, the legs popped up, </joey>
<connor> and I don't know, man.
It was so satisfying. </connor>
<joey> - It was like a reclining
chair, but camping. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Anyway, so I got all the stuff. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "All right, I've
been camping a ton before. </joey>
<connor> It's whatever, I don't
need to buy too much." </connor>
<garnt> It's one night. One night camping is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Bro, I could just do
that with my clothes. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll just sleep on the grass. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not a big deal, right? I'll be fine." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I've done that before. </garnt>
<garnt> We've like slept outside
with just sleeping bags. </garnt>
<garnt> - We have done that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly. No tent. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You've done that? </joey>
<joey> - I've done it too, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Is not a big deal. I
thought, "It'll be fine." </connor>
<joey> - If the weather's good
especially, which it was. </joey>
<connor> - Nabi was like, "Oh, did
you get thermal wear?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Get thermal wear?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I'm not getting thermal
wear, I mean, what the fuck. </joey>
<joey> I'm camping, I don't need thermal wear. </joey>
<connor> I'll wear a hoodie, bro. It's fine. </connor>
<joey> - Mind you, we went
first week in December. </joey>
<joey> So most places in Japan, </joey>
<joey> it hasn't quite gotten
to winter weather yet. </joey>
<garnt> - It definitely isn't that cold in Tokyo. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> He said that to me and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I'll look how cold it's gonna be." </connor>
<connor> It predicted like one degree. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, "One degree is fine. </connor>
<garnt> If I'm sleeping in my clothes, </garnt>
<garnt> in a sleeping bag, in a
tent, one degree is fine." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I had like a hoodie and a big coat. </garnt>
<garnt> I had a long sleeve T-shirt. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "I'll be fine, I'll be fine." </garnt>
<garnt> I was not fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, we're talking Celsius by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Celsius. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're talking of Celsius. </garnt>
<garnt> - For American, that's
four lollipops, actually, </garnt>
<joey> in case you're wondering about that. </joey>
<connor> Sorry. </connor>
<connor> - It's like 36 Fahrenheit. </connor>
<joey> - It's very cold. </joey>
<joey> So that's what we thought it was gonna be. </joey>
<joey> Anyway, we had a great time, right? </joey>
<joey> We got in the car. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Played some beats, we
had a nice car journey, </joey>
<connor> two-hour car journey to Fuji. </connor>
<joey> It's pretty chill from Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - Got the most insane views of Mount Fuji. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. It was clear. </joey>
<garnt> - My god, I mean you saw the
pictures, the fucking views. </garnt>
<garnt> The reason we went in winter was because </garnt>
<garnt> there's no mist, no cloud at all. </garnt>
<joey> It's just a clear picture of Mount Fuji. </joey>
<joey> Every picture I took of Mount Fuji </joey>
<joey> actually looks photoshopped. </joey>
<joey> It's un-fucking-real. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] We put that green screen to work. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] It was amazing. </joey>
<connor> There was not a cloud in sight. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was insane. </joey>
<joey> - On the car there, I was
getting kind of toasty. </joey>
<joey> I was getting a little bit too hot. </joey>
<joey> I just took my hoodie off. </joey>
<joey> - The sun was out, it was beaming. </joey>
<joey> - Beaming on me. I was one-layering. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Bro, this is gonna be easy." </joey>
<joey> Then, if all else failed,
I would have beer. </joey>
<joey> So if I got super cold, </joey>
<garnt> at least I would be moderately
drunk and I could sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> So I thought... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] That was also my strategy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mind over matter. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is a foolproof plan. </garnt>
<connor> Nothing could go wrong. </connor>
<garnt> - We've been camping before, me and Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> and we weren't going to
make the same mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> We bought way too many beers this time. </garnt>
<garnt> We bought two more crates of beers </garnt>
<garnt> than we actually needed in the end. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because I thought everyone </connor>
<joey> was gonna pull their weight. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, everyone had
around the same amount. </joey>
<connor> - Some people had one. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - Had one beer. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<connor> - From 72 beers that we bought. </connor>
<connor> That is not pulling your weight. </connor>
<connor> - I think we all had maybe
seven or eight beers at least. </connor>
<connor> - I was very drunk. </connor>
<joey> - It was like seven or eight beers. </joey>
<connor> - Imma say that some people, I heard, </connor>
<connor> weren't able to sleep during the trip </connor>
<connor> because it was so cold, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just saying I did sleep a bit. </connor>
<connor> I had some beers. </connor>
<connor> So what can you say?
What can you say, right? </connor>
<garnt> What can you say? Life-hack, life-hack. </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll get that POV later on. </garnt>
<connor> So we go to nearest
supermarket to this place. </connor>
<connor> We raid their entire beer stock, </connor>
<connor> their bread stock, their sausages. </connor>
<joey> Fuck, the sausages were so good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - There's just something about sausages </connor>
<joey> on a charcoal grill that
just hits different. </joey>
<garnt> - Just meat. Just any meat. </garnt>
<connor> - But sausage is the
best, I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I'm gonna say, </connor>
<connor> when we were buying sausages, </connor>
<connor> everyone's just like, "Oh,
just buy the original flavor." </connor>
<connor> - Buy more, buy more. </connor>
<connor> - No, you were saying just
buy the original flavor. </connor>
<connor> Just buy the original flavor. </connor>
<joey> I pick up the chili cheese
flavor and everyone looks at me- </joey>
<joey> - I don't want that shit.
- in such disgust. </joey>
<joey> Everyone looks at me with such disgust of, </joey>
<joey> "Garnt, what are you doing? </joey>
<joey> Get your trash taste out of here." </joey>
<joey> And then when we started eating it, </joey>
<joey> it was the sausage that went the quickest. </joey>
<joey> Everyone loved it. </joey>
<joey> - I like the other one the most. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I like the other one more. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck you, Joey. That's not
what you were saying earlier. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, because I was curious, </joey>
<joey> 'cause everyone around me was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, these chili cheese
ones are really good." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "All right, bet." </joey>
<joey> I had it and I was like, "Yeah,
that's pretty all right." </joey>
<joey> - But that's not what you
said. That's not what you said. </joey>
<connor> - You haven't had a good sausage, guys. </connor>
<connor> - I was probably three or four beers in? </connor>
<connor> So I was super optimistic
and so I was like, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah this is great." </joey>
<joey> - Your Honor, he was drunk. </joey>
<joey> My client... </joey>
<joey> - Your Honor, I was not
sober when I had those. </joey>
<joey> - He was inebriated. </joey>
<joey> - You think you can use that excuse </joey>
<joey> for drunk-trying sausages? </joey>
<connor> You think that holds up in a court of law </connor>
<connor> with drunk driving? </connor>
<connor> No, it doesn't, Joey. It doesn't. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Can't believe I
was get betrayed by this. </connor>
<connor> - He said it. It doesn't mean
it was a good decision, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't quite kill another person </connor>
<garnt> eating those sausages. </garnt>
<joey> - You killed my spirit, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - I killed my taste buds.
- When I heard that. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] I killed my taste buds. </connor>
<garnt> - You killed my spirit.
That's all that matters, man. </garnt>
<connor> - [Nabi] I'll send this for production. </connor>
<connor> - So we raid the supermarket. </connor>
<connor> We take everything, we get
every condiment known to man. </connor>
<connor> I was glad, you know. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes people, when they
buy all the meat and stuff, </connor>
<connor> they forget to buy the condiments. </connor>
<connor> But arguably, we bought
too many condiments. </connor>
<joey> - This bougie motherfucker
bought Dijon mustard. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't. That wasn't me. </joey>
<joey> - Who bought the Dijon mustard? </joey>
<joey> - Someone else put it. </joey>
<joey> - [Nabi] I did. </joey>
<joey> - So Nabi, you put Dijon mustard. </joey>
<connor> - Someone put Dijon mustard
when we were on a barbecue. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Bro, just get
the squirty, the other one." </connor>
<joey> - It was the one in the jar, </joey>
<connor> where you have to get it with a knife, </connor>
<connor> and there was no knives. </connor>
<joey> So I was like, "What do you
expect? Just fucking..." </joey>
<connor> - We're gonna get in
the Dijon on my hot dog. </connor>
<connor> By the way, there was no hot dog buns, </connor>
<connor> 'cause sometimes they
don't have hot dog buns </connor>
<joey> in the supermarkets in Japan. </joey>
<joey> So we did the Joey way of doing it, </joey>
<joey> which is folding a piece of bread- </joey>
<joey> - The Australian way. </joey>
<joey> The Australian way, it's also a sandwich. </joey>
<joey> - Getting one slice of
bread and rolling it. </joey>
<joey> - Folding it around,
that's the Australian way. </joey>
<joey> - It was kind of sad. </joey>
<joey> - That's the only way to do it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, it's fine. It tasted fine. </joey>
<connor> But it just looked sad, it looked sad. </connor>
<garnt> - It literally does the same </garnt>
<connor> purpose here.
- It does the same job. </connor>
<connor> - Actually, if anything
you get to eat more- </connor>
<joey> - All bread tastes the same. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - I would argue it's better, </joey>
<joey> because you eat less bread, </joey>
<garnt> therefore, you have
more space for sausage. </garnt>
<joey> - I agree. I never finished
the entire sausage- </joey>
<joey> - The hot dog buns are so thick. </joey>
<joey> - The entire hot dog bun. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause there's always more bread needed </garnt>
<garnt> than the sausage in it. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't believe these takes actually. </connor>
<joey> I'm not even, you know- </joey>
<joey> - Hot dog buns are overrated. </joey>
<joey> - I'm so done. That was such a shit take. </joey>
<joey> I'm not even... </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] What are you talking about? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not arguing this. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I mean, what
are you talking about? </garnt>
<connor> - I refuse to go down
to the level of clowns. </connor>
<connor> I'm not arguing this. </connor>
<connor> Let that take speak for itself. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna say I don't agree. </connor>
<connor> Respectfully, I disagree, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> I think the bread is the perfect amount. </garnt>
<garnt> Anyway. I can't believe you said that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in awe. I can't believe it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Imma say it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. Okay, okay. </garnt>
<connor> So we buy the all food </connor>
<connor> in the supermarket-
- It's too thick. </connor>
<garnt> - Stop. It's not. It's literally not. </garnt>
<joey> - On the chunk chart, it
is like the second half. </joey>
<connor> - It it's pretty thick, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like twice the thickness of- </connor>
<garnt> - People who love hot dogs here </garnt>
<garnt> are dying right now, dying inside. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I'm saying. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, so we spend $400 on this food </connor>
<connor> for nine, seven, eight of us. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, 400 bucks on food. It was good. </joey>
<connor> - And booze. It was mostly the booze. </connor>
<connor> - It was like half booze, actually. </connor>
<connor> - [Nabi] Meat. </connor>
<connor> - So we bought it all, </connor>
<joey> and we finally started
setting up our camp, </joey>
<joey> and getting the fire going, </joey>
<joey> which was the most important of all. </joey>
<joey> - We had two fire pits going. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and then we bought </joey>
<garnt> two little baby stacks of
plywood or whatever it was. </garnt>
<joey> It wasn't plywood, but it may
as well have been plywood. </joey>
<joey> - Like 2x4s. </joey>
<joey> - Luckily, the store there
sold a shit ton of firewood. </joey>
<connor> So we bought a fuckton of firewood. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, in Japan you
have to buy your firewood. </joey>
<connor> You can't just go into the bush. </connor>
<connor> - No, you can't. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] No. You gotta buy your firewood. </joey>
<joey> - Well, to be fair, in most places </joey>
<garnt> in most campsites, official
ones, you can't do that. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - In Europe as well. </joey>
<garnt> You can't just start chopping down trees </garnt>
<joey> unless the site says you can. </joey>
<joey> But most people don't know </joey>
<connor> how to chop down the tree, though, </connor>
<joey> and wouldn't know how to do it safely. </joey>
<joey> - But in Australia, we
don't like go around </joey>
<connor> fucking deforesting or anything. </connor>
<connor> But if you go out into the bush </connor>
<connor> and you see anything like-
- You can pick up </connor>
<connor> the dead leaves.
- Logs and dead branches </connor>
<joey> and stuff like that, you bring it back, </joey>
<joey> that's probably good. </joey>
<connor> - Problem is, though,
branches burn super fast. </connor>
<joey> - Right, that's why you gotta get </joey>
<joey> the thick, almost rotting wood. </joey>
<connor> - They sold these really thick pieces </connor>
<garnt> of oak that were great, wonderful. </garnt>
<joey> We start setting up a fire
and we started barbecuing. </joey>
<garnt> It was great, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was fantastic. </connor>
<connor> - We were having a fantastic time. </connor>
<garnt> It was a comfortable temperature as well. </garnt>
<joey> - It was probably like,
maybe five degrees-ish. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I would say it was
even warmer than that. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Maybe six, seven degrees. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty great time, start
cracking open the beers- </connor>
<garnt> - With amazing view of Fuji as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Started enjoying the food.
- That was brilliant. </garnt>
<joey> - Joey laughed at how I
ate a hot dog one time </joey>
<joey> or something, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> You were laughing your ass off </joey>
<connor> how I ate this hot dog one time. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> We were like five or six beers in </joey>
<connor> and Connor was obviously
getting a little bit tipsy </connor>
<connor> and he took, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> it just caught my eye-
- It was a hot dog. </connor>
<connor> - I just looked over and
Connor had this hot dog bite </connor>
<connor> and it looked like the hot dog </connor>
<connor> was trying to escape out of his mouth. </connor>
<connor> - Because I shoved half
the hot dog in my mouth. </connor>
<connor> - He shoved in his mouth and just went, </connor>
<connor> all I heard was this, </connor>
<connor> you know the fucking video </connor>
<joey> of the pufferfish eating the carrot? </joey>
<joey> It does the sound. </joey>
<joey> I heard that coming out of Connor's mouth </joey>
<joey> as he was shoving this hot dog. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Oh my God." </joey>
<connor> - Joey's like pissing himself. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I-
- I was laughing </joey>
<connor> for a good 15 minutes.
- I was like bending over </connor>
<joey> 'cause I-
- 'Cause there's a lot </joey>
<joey> of sauce on there. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the problem was
I did the rookie error </joey>
<connor> of putting way too much condiments, </connor>
<connor> and I knew the condiments
was gonna come out, right? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What had happened was </garnt>
<garnt> I think I had taken a bite that was so big </garnt>
<garnt> that I either committed </garnt>
<garnt> to putting it all in my mouth in one go </garnt>
<connor> or if I bit it and stopped, </connor>
<connor> the condiments would just go all over me. </connor>
<connor> So I bent forward and just
shoved it all in in one, </connor>
<connor> and all the condiments fell down. </connor>
<joey> - I was like, "Hey yo, </joey>
<connor> this boy's dicking down a hot dog." </connor>
<joey> - I was like raw dogging
it, I was taking it. </joey>
<joey> It was just so good, man. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what it is, </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason, with hot dogs, </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to barbecues, </garnt>
<garnt> I can eat two burgers
and I'm like, "Oh, fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hot dogs, I'm like, "Another
one. Another one, please." </garnt>
<joey> I'm like six in and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "Let's go. Another hot
dog? Another hot dog?" </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, those
sausages were really good. </joey>
<garnt> - I actually prefer hot dogs over burgers. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, me too. </joey>
<connor> - In a barbecue. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause in a barbecue, </connor>
<connor> you have one burger, and that's enough. </connor>
<connor> That's enough, that's enough. </connor>
<connor> If we're gonna go with how
courses are structured, </connor>
<connor> to me, the burger is the main course. </connor>
<connor> But I can eat so much of the
hot dog around the burger. </connor>
<connor> You start off with hot dogs,
and you have the burger, </connor>
<connor> and then, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> you can eat three more hot dogs sometimes. </connor>
<connor> It's like my stomach is an infinite hole </connor>
<garnt> when it comes to hot dogs. </garnt>
<joey> - We also had the skewers as well, </joey>
<joey> which just got demolished in five minutes </joey>
<joey> 'cause they were so good. </joey>
<joey> What is it about burgers </joey>
<joey> that is just like on a
different scale of filling </joey>
<joey> compared to everything else we bought? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know.
- [Joey] I don't get it. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's just because it takes </joey>
<joey> that much more effort to cook. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I guess, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you have to
build the burger as well, </joey>
<joey> and it's a lot bigger. </joey>
<joey> It's not just something </joey>
<joey> you can casually pick up off the grill </joey>
<joey> and just start eating.
- [Joey] That's true. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta make sure it's
a nice burger that you like. </joey>
<joey> You gotta make sure the
cheese is perfectly toasted </joey>
<joey> the way you want it to be toasted. </joey>
<joey> We tried to butter our bread </joey>
<joey> but the butter was so fucking cold </joey>
<joey> that I think it was Edo or something </joey>
<joey> who tried to put blocks of
butter on the burger bun. </joey>
<joey> So it was like squares of
butter on this burger bun </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was too cold to be spread. </joey>
<joey> - And then he just like
chucked it on the fire. </joey>
<joey> - He just chucked it on the fire </joey>
<joey> and all the chunks just fell down, </joey>
<garnt> and he was adamant that he could perfectly </garnt>
<garnt> butter this fucking burger.
- I was like what are you... </garnt>
<joey> I was watching the
entire time, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "What did you want to do?" </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] What were you
expecting to happen? </joey>
<joey> - He's just buttering the fire. </joey>
<connor> - In my mind, when
you're barbecuing stuff, </connor>
<connor> I expect the quality of this burger </connor>
<garnt> to not be as on par as a restaurant. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need my barbecued
burger buttered bun. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "You can just
toast it. It's fine." </connor>
<garnt> - But it wasn't even the worst idea </garnt>
<connor> that happened during the- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] This is a good idea. </connor>
<connor> I know what you're gonna say. </connor>
<connor> - You know when you're a few drinks in </connor>
<connor> and you do something that
you think is a good idea. </connor>
<connor> - Genius idea. </connor>
<connor> - So we also had eggs, </connor>
<connor> but we had nowhere to cook the eggs. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause it's a grill. </joey>
<connor> - We didn't bring pans or anything. </connor>
<connor> - No, no pans. </connor>
<connor> We just had a grill, a mesh grill. </connor>
<connor> So Connor comes up with the idea </connor>
<connor> of trying to cook this
egg on a burger bun. </connor>
<connor> - I really wanted an egg on my burger. </connor>
<joey> - So what he does is he
places the patty on the grill. </joey>
<connor> - No, it was the bun. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, sorry. It was the bun. </connor>
<joey> He places the bun on the grill </joey>
<joey> and then he cracks an egg on top of it. </joey>
<joey> Naturally, all the white of the egg </joey>
<joey> just fucking spills over
the edge and into the fire. </joey>
<joey> - I knew that would happen. </joey>
<joey> - All that's left is a fucking yolk, </joey>
<joey> and this yolk is, it's like ice hockey. </joey>
<joey> It was just like slippering
around on this thing, </joey>
<joey> and he's just like trying to control it. </joey>
<garnt> In the end, it spilled over. </garnt>
<joey> - Went in the fire. </joey>
<joey> - It was a very sad moment. </joey>
<garnt> - I was saying there's no way </garnt>
<garnt> you could cook a egg on
a burger bun on a grill. </garnt>
<garnt> There's so many things that can go wrong </garnt>
<garnt> and it did go wrong. </garnt>
<connor> - Here's what my thinking was. </connor>
<connor> Obviously, I was a few beers in, </connor>
<connor> but I thought that the flames
of the fire were so big, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was enveloping the bun. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "It'll reach
the egg. It'll cook the egg. </connor>
<joey> It'll do it. It'll do it. </joey>
<connor> It's hot enough. It'll do it." </connor>
<connor> - The entire time, as well, </connor>
<joey> he was like "Galaxy brain. Galaxy brain. </joey>
<joey> Watch this. Gamer moment. Gamer moment." </joey>
<joey> It's just like, "You are
wasting a perfectly good egg." </joey>
<joey> - No. I had an eggy bun, </joey>
<connor> and it gave the good
egg flavor to my burger. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<connor> There was like 1/5 of the yolk left. </connor>
<joey> - Hey, it was good. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] You just made eggy bread. </joey>
<joey> - Don't hate. I liked it. </joey>
<connor> I liked it. It was good. It was good. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the world's
shittiest French toast. </joey>
<connor> - It was amazing. I had a great burger. </connor>
<joey> - [Nabi] Wrap in aluminum foil. </joey>
<garnt> - You were so dedicated
to cooking this egg, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was like watching someone </garnt>
<garnt> try to solve that Zelda puzzle
in "Breath of the Wild". </garnt>
<garnt> We know how fucking shitty it is, </garnt>
<garnt> controlling that puzzle with
your Wiimote or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - You guys sit in your
comfort of knowing what works. </connor>
<connor> I am the daring type,
who tried something new. </connor>
<joey> I wanted to see if I could get an egg </joey>
<joey> to cook on a burger bun. </joey>
<joey> - I knew it wasn't gonna go well </joey>
<joey> because the whole ordeal started </joey>
<joey> with Connor going, "Watch this." </joey>
<joey> Anything that starts with
a confident "watch this" </joey>
<connor> five beers in, is not going to go well. </connor>
<connor> - "Hold my beer." Imagine
if it worked, though. </connor>
<joey> I'd have been a fucking god. </joey>
<joey> - I would've applauded you. </joey>
<connor> - I would've been a god amongst men. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - If I made that work, I would've. </connor>
<connor> That would've been amazing. </connor>
<connor> But like Icarus, I flew
too close to the sun. </connor>
<connor> I tried something that I shouldn't have. </connor>
<connor> What can I say? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Then you gave up and just
like flipped the burger, </joey>
<joey> and then the rest of the
egg slid into the fire. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, "If I can't have the egg </connor>
<joey> cook perfectly on the bun, </joey>
<joey> I'll at least have this
French toast flavor </joey>
<joey> to add to my burger. </joey>
<joey> It added the flavor profile </joey>
<joey> that I was quite happy with. </joey>
<joey> - Suffice it to say that
the dinner went well. </joey>
<garnt> Then, under the stars,
it was amazing starlight. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] View was amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Mount Fuji in the background. </connor>
<joey> We had a good time. </joey>
<joey> - There was a problem, though. </joey>
<connor> We were running out of wood,
and the store had closed. </connor>
<connor> - I was going to say, </connor>
<garnt> so we ate like kings
and we drank like kings. </garnt>
<garnt> We learned from the last camping trip. </garnt>
<garnt> We overstocked on pretty
much every fucking resource </garnt>
<joey> we could think of. </joey>
<joey> - Food we did perfectly. </joey>
<joey> - We had a bunch of food left. </joey>
<joey> - We still had a bunch of food left. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought we ate it all. </garnt>
<joey> - I ate it while you were sleeping. </joey>
<connor> - If somebody had told
me, I would've ate it all. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I would have been done with it. </connor>
<connor> - It's because we ran out of coal, </connor>
<connor> and we ran out of firewood. </connor>
<connor> In camping outside on a winter's night, </connor>
<garnt> we ran out of the one
resource that is essential </garnt>
<garnt> for basically human
survival, which is heat. </garnt>
<connor> - It kind of sucked, 'cause it was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, I'm pretty sure we
could still keep going." </garnt>
<garnt> But it got to about 11
PM and we could see then. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no. I remember. </connor>
<garnt> It got to about 9 PM. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember 'cause it got to about 9 PM </garnt>
<garnt> and we still wanted to
cook some more food, </garnt>
<garnt> but the wood just wasn't
bringing enough heat </garnt>
<joey> to actually cook stuff, </joey>
<joey> because it was just charring
it and then going out, </joey>
<joey> 'cause we needed coal for it. </joey>
<joey> So we decided to stop cooking </joey>
<joey> and just keep on drinking, as you do. </joey>
<joey> Keep going with the liquid dinner. </joey>
<connor> I remember it hit about 9 PM </connor>
<connor> and it started getting a bit nippy, </connor>
<garnt> it started going from a
comfortable temperature </garnt>
<garnt> to, "Okay, now I gotta
put on this winter jacket </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm actually
starting to feel this cold." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I went down to around
two, three degrees Celsius. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Then I remember
looking at the firewood. </joey>
<garnt> We had somehow gone through
about 70% of the firewood </garnt>
<joey> that we had bought previously. </joey>
<joey> I remember thinking, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck. How much longer is
this going to last us?" </joey>
<joey> I remember it was at that point </joey>
<joey> that I think we subconsciously
started to ration it, </joey>
<joey> because it got colder, </joey>
<joey> but I remember the fires </joey>
<joey> also started to get colder as well, </joey>
<joey> 'cause we weren't putting in the wood </joey>
<garnt> all willy nilly anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - I noticed that people </joey>
<joey> were slowly approaching the
fire pit, closer and closer. </joey>
<joey> - I was further away, initially. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I was like, "I
don't need that much. </connor>
<connor> I'm fine. I'm hot." </connor>
<connor> But then got to the
point where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I need the fire or I'm
actually gonna just die." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Our knees were
basically in the fire. </joey>
<connor> - Made me realize how shitty fires are. </connor>
<joey> They must have had to
literally sleep next to it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm like, "This shit is awful. </joey>
<joey> The range of this fire is terrible." </joey>
<connor> Air is a terrible insulator. </connor>
<joey> But I was like, "This is terrible. </joey>
<connor> I have to basically have
my hands in this thing </connor>
<joey> to be warm." </joey>
<joey> - I can't believe Nature
nerfed the AoE of fire. </joey>
<connor> - Can they fix that patch? </connor>
<connor> Can I have the range increase of fire? </connor>
<garnt> It was not good. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I dunno what
fucking Newton was thinking. </connor>
<connor> What's up with that? What's up? </connor>
<joey> - You could try wind nerfing the AoE. </joey>
<joey> It's too powerful. </joey>
<joey> - I remember the fire was hot
enough, being close to it, </joey>
<joey> but then my ass was freezing fucking cold. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So every so often, I'd
just have to put my ass </joey>
<joey> on top of the fire. </joey>
<joey> Joey was just farting nonstop </joey>
<joey> throughout the entire camping trip. </joey>
<joey> Every time he put his ass across the fire, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Joey, please
don't fart right now." </joey>
<joey> I held my breath, 'cause
I knew if Joey farted, </joey>
<joey> I swear to God, it would've used up </joey>
<joey> the rest of the firewood. </joey>
<garnt> - The fire just starts to... </garnt>
<joey> - No. No. First of all, when
you stand up for a moment, </joey>
<connor> the chair that you've been
warming up for 30 minutes </connor>
<connor> instantly becomes cold again. </connor>
<garnt> - It instantly freezes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which sucks. Which meant
you didn't wanna move, </garnt>
<garnt> but you had to pee. </garnt>
<connor> You had to also put stuff
on the fire or whatever. </connor>
<connor> So it was awful. </connor>
<connor> Also, one thing that
happened where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "We're gonna die," </connor>
<garnt> is that they try to
light the fire starters </garnt>
<garnt> with a gas fire. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> - So they tried to light, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the guys turned
on the gas for this, </garnt>
<garnt> what would you even call it? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Blowtorch. </garnt>
<garnt> - Propane torch. </garnt>
<garnt> - Blowtorch. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Why the fuck
do we have a blowtorch? </garnt>
<garnt> Why do we have something
like a normal lighter?" </garnt>
<joey> - Like a match. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. But we had
a blowtorch, and he lit it, </joey>
<joey> and he went to go and
point it to start a fire, </joey>
<joey> and the whole blowtorch just went on fire. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Uh. You
might wanna put that out." </joey>
<joey> The torch was catching on fire, </joey>
<joey> the gas canister's right next to it. </joey>
<joey> I'm like "Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Fire plus can pressure. </joey>
<joey> Uh-oh. Uh-oh." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "I'm getting away. </joey>
<connor> What the fuck? Put it out! Put it out!" </connor>
<joey> - But the thing is, we
were six or seven people. </joey>
<joey> Everybody else is just
kind of sitting there like, </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, it's on fire." </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember that exact moment. </garnt>
<connor> - I backed off. I was running away. </connor>
<garnt> People are just sitting there watching, </garnt>
<joey> not helping at all, </joey>
<joey> just watching this guy holding
this gas canister on fire. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "I'm running away." </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "What the fuck
are you guys doing? Run!" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember my exact POV was </garnt>
<garnt> I see it happen. </garnt>
<garnt> I see him pointing it towards the fire. </garnt>
<garnt> He presses the button and
then the gas just leaks </garnt>
<connor> throughout the entire can. </connor>
<connor> So the entire can is just covered. </connor>
<connor> Connor goes "fight or flight" mode. </connor>
<connor> He's just like when that one quiet kid </connor>
<connor> reached for his bag, you know. </connor>
<connor> He's half a mile down. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I'm not liking this. </connor>
<garnt> - Me, being six cans of
beers in, I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, fire." </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was only after Connor's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Guys, what the fuck are you
doing? We almost just died!" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "But
the fire. It's so pretty." </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> He was holding fire. That's so cool. </joey>
<joey> - These guys didn't even say anything. </joey>
<joey> They literally sat there like
stoners, just watching this. </joey>
<joey> - I literally saw him
holding this can of fire, </joey>
<joey> and I was like (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - The guy who was holding it, </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I can't remember who was holding it, </joey>
<joey> but I was like, "Turn it
off! Turn the gas off!" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Wayne was holding it. </joey>
<joey> Our friend Wayne was holding it. </joey>
<joey> He was like, "Oh." </joey>
<connor> - He didn't what to do. </connor>
<connor> - "What should I do?" </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, "Turn it off! Turn it off!" </joey>
<connor> - There was about to be an ass... </connor>
<connor> - I ran to a distance and then
I was giving instructions. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Now turn it off!" </joey>
<garnt> - I remember you running to a distance, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, "Guys, what
the fuck are you doing?! </garnt>
<connor> What are you doing?" </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Oh yeah, </connor>
<connor> I should probably care for my life." </connor>
<joey> I remember thinking that
and I'm just like, "Nah." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Either run or
help. You have two options. </joey>
<joey> - Should be all right.
Should be all right. </joey>
<garnt> - So, yeah. Don't do what we did. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor did the correct thing and panicked. </garnt>
<connor> - I could have helped, </connor>
<connor> but also I would've had
to run around the fire </connor>
<connor> and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know how dangerous this is." </connor>
<connor> My guess would've been, "How
about we leave it on the floor </connor>
<connor> and then all run." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that happened. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember if anything else happened </garnt>
<garnt> during the campsite. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure these
gas cans have fail-safes </connor>
<joey> so that even if they somehow
light on fire like that, </joey>
<joey> they don't... </joey>
<joey> - That's why I was so calm. </joey>
<joey> - But also I know that you can't </joey>
<joey> heat up a metal gas canister for very long </joey>
<joey> before it goes boom. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. That's true. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure the campsite
would've loved that. </connor>
<connor> - Well, we were all right. </connor>
<garnt> - We survived. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how we survived. </garnt>
<connor> - We didn't end up on r/WatchPeopleDie. </connor>
<joey> So don't worry. We're all good. </joey>
<joey> - All it took was a few
shakes and a bit of a blow. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't a big fire, </joey>
<connor> but it was just fire plus
gas canister, not good. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. That could have ended very badly. </garnt>
<joey> - Under any other circumstance, </joey>
<joey> I would've been in the same panic mode, </joey>
<joey> but kind of dunno why. </joey>
<joey> I was drunk, okay? I was very drunk. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Shockingly calm. </joey>
<joey> It was like, "Just put it out. </joey>
<joey> Just put it out." </joey>
<joey> - I remember the thought
going through my mind of, </joey>
<joey> "I should get up and run, </joey>
<connor> but the seat's so comfy right now </connor>
<connor> and it's really cold outside." </connor>
<connor> It was like your mom asking
you to get out of bed </connor>
<joey> when it's like 7:00 AM. </joey>
<connor> It is how people die. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Why people die in house fires. </connor>
<joey> - It is how people die. I was very stupid. </joey>
<joey> But at the time, it just felt
like the right thing to do, </joey>
<garnt> in my mind. Which it wasn't. It wasn't. </garnt>
<joey> I was very dumb. </joey>
<joey> - We could have died multiple times. </joey>
<garnt> This is like a double
entendre, this title. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - We almost died. We actually did. </connor>
<connor> - So then that happened </connor>
<joey> and then it got to around to 11 PM? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] 11 PM? I could
have still kept going. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, me too. </joey>
<joey> I wanted to keep going. </joey>
<garnt> - But it gets to the point where, </garnt>
<garnt> my entire life I've been
conditioned to think </garnt>
<connor> that no matter how cold it gets, </connor>
<connor> I can just drink more beer
and it will solve the problem. </connor>
<connor> This was the one time </connor>
<connor> when I was outside with a thick jacket on </connor>
<connor> and drinking more beer
didn't solve the problem. </connor>
<connor> Because I just kept getting colder. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "What's going on?" </connor>
<garnt> So I start trying to drink more beer. </garnt>
<connor> I just kept getting colder. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, "What is this?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, the thing with alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> is that you don't actually get warmer, </garnt>
<garnt> but your body just thinks you're warmer. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, you just
think you're getting warmer. </connor>
<connor> That's just a testament to how cold </connor>
<connor> it was actually getting </connor>
<garnt> rather than how cold </garnt>
<garnt> my mind was thinking it was getting. </garnt>
<joey> - At a point, I just wanted
to stop drinking the beer, </joey>
<connor> because I would pick it up, </connor>
<joey> and it would just
literally be freezing cold. </joey>
<connor> - It was not even nice to drink </connor>
<joey> 'cause of how cold it was, </joey>
<joey> 'cause outside was so cold. </joey>
<joey> - Would've been great in the summer. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, in the summer, I'd have loved it. </connor>
<joey> - It would've been amazing. </joey>
<joey> But when it's like zero degrees outside </joey>
<garnt> and you're drinking zero-degree beer, </garnt>
<joey> it's not that great. </joey>
<joey> - It was one of the few times </joey>
<joey> where you drink a beer and it gets colder </joey>
<joey> the longer you drink it. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - The beers would, 'cause
they're in a crate, </joey>
<joey> the beers would start off </joey>
<joey> at a reasonable amount of coldness </joey>
<garnt> and then they would get
to a reasonable coldness </garnt>
<garnt> to ice cold to almost frozen. </garnt>
<connor> - Also, the thing about
ice cold beers that's nice </connor>
<joey> is that you're not normally drinking it </joey>
<joey> in ice-cold conditions. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it warms up. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a nice temperature
and it's nice in your body. </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, this is refreshing." </garnt>
<connor> But when it's ice cold
in ice-cold conditions, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "This feels like a bad idea." </connor>
<connor> - It's torture. </connor>
<garnt> - "This feels like a bad combination." </garnt>
<garnt> Perhaps lukewarm beer would've
been better, or hot beer. </garnt>
<connor> That's why they drink hot wine </connor>
<connor> at the Christmas festivals. </connor>
<connor> - We did everything we
could to elongate this fire, </connor>
<connor> but nothing was working. </connor>
<garnt> There was only so much we
could ration out this firewood. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the last log
lasted us for a full hour. </garnt>
<joey> - There's only so many tiny little twigs </joey>
<joey> you find on the paddock right there </joey>
<joey> where it's like, "Yes, this will do." </joey>
<garnt> - I remember there was a
tree next to where I pissed, </garnt>
<garnt> and I picked up the leaves. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Okay, these
dead leaves, these'll work. </garnt>
<joey> And they gave us like
a microsecond of heat </joey>
<joey> and that felt, to me at the
time, like a full 10 minutes. </joey>
<joey> We start using the beer packaging. </joey>
<joey> So we had all the cardboard packaging, </joey>
<joey> and we went from using the beer cardboard </joey>
<connor> to rationing it as a big burst of heat, </connor>
<connor> because that would give us
a nice big burst of heat </connor>
<connor> for a good five seconds. </connor>
<connor> We'd all crowd around, and we were like, </connor>
<joey> "All right, boys, </joey>
<joey> when do we do the next one?
When do we use the next one?" </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I can't wait new longer. </joey>
<joey> - We eventually just didn't
even drink the beers. </joey>
<connor> But we'd still unwrap the beers </connor>
<connor> with all the packaging so
we could use it as fuel. </connor>
<connor> - Should have recycled,
but instead we needed heat. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Eventually, we ran
out of things to burn. </garnt>
<joey> I know guys, I know. </joey>
<joey> - Ran outta resources. </joey>
<connor> - So I put Garnt in the fire. </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately, he didn't burn. </connor>
<garnt> - So eventually, that was when we realized </garnt>
<garnt> we had to go to bed, </garnt>
<garnt> and so we packed everything up. </garnt>
<joey> - At this point, it was
maybe around -1, -2. </joey>
<joey> It was starting to get
pretty fucking cold. </joey>
<garnt> - It was starting to
get pretty, really cold. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> It was negative degrees. </garnt>
<joey> For you Americans, that's negative </joey>
<joey> from the freezing point of water. </joey>
<joey> So I dunno what the
freezing point of water </joey>
<garnt> is in Fahrenheit, but it was below that. </garnt>
<joey> - Below 32. </joey>
<joey> - Why is it 32? </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause 32 Fahrenheit
is zero degrees Celsius. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't know that. </garnt>
<connor> - I did not know that. </connor>
<connor> - That's 30-something. I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 33.8 is one degree Celsius. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 32 is zero. So it
was maybe 28 Fahrenheit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is when we came to realize how cold </garnt>
<garnt> it really was going to be, </garnt>
<garnt> without even like a piddly little fire </garnt>
<garnt> to heat us up. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember me and Connor
went into our tent first. </garnt>
<garnt> So me and Connor slept
with Nabi in his tent, </garnt>
<garnt> and Joey and Luke slept in another tent, </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone else slept in a third tent. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember Connor jumping in, </garnt>
<garnt> Connor jumping in and just realizing </garnt>
<garnt> how flimsy and thin his sleeping bag was. </garnt>
<connor> - I literally had gotten a raincoat </connor>
<connor> that had just been fashioned into... </connor>
<connor> It didn't have any padding or anything. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "This is what I get </connor>
<garnt> for ordering the only
available sleeping bag </garnt>
<joey> on Amazon next-day delivery." </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I remember it was like 20 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember, </connor>
<garnt> I think the warmest coat you have, by far, </garnt>
<garnt> is your Drip jacket, and
this was the one time </garnt>
<garnt> in the past month I've seen
you without the Drip jacket. </garnt>
<garnt> It would've been very,
very useful, I imagine. </garnt>
<connor> - The reason I didn't bring it </connor>
<connor> is because we were gonna
be burning a lot of shit. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't want to get this nice jacket </garnt>
<garnt> that I paid way too much money for </garnt>
<garnt> super-smoky, and it's
probably gonna be messy, too. </garnt>
<garnt> It was messy. I dropped
condiments everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "I'm gonna just leave that." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - So Connor gets in this sleeping bag </garnt>
<garnt> and soon realizes that
this is not going to be </garnt>
<garnt> warm enough at all. </garnt>
<garnt> He just gets over and he's like, </garnt>
<connor> "Garnt? Garnt, I give you
permission to cuddle me. </connor>
<connor> Garnt, we are cuddling tonight." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Connor, we
don't need to cuddle. </connor>
<connor> We don't need to cuddle." </connor>
<connor> Then I get into the tent and I realize, </connor>
<joey> "Fuck! We're gonna need to
cuddle tonight, Connor." </joey>
<joey> I take off my jackets,
as fast as possible, </joey>
<joey> then I try to get in the sleeping bag, </joey>
<joey> I zip myself up. I'm fucking freezing. </joey>
<joey> I saw like two caterpillars
next to each other, </joey>
<joey> like cuddling with each other. </joey>
<garnt> Then that still isn't warm enough. </garnt>
<garnt> So I realized pretty soon </garnt>
<garnt> that I have to sleep with my jacket on, </garnt>
<garnt> because even with my jacket off, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not going to be warm enough. </garnt>
<garnt> Luckily at this point, I
think we were pretty drunk. </garnt>
<joey> - I must say it was very
funny from the other tent, </joey>
<joey> when all I could hear was,
"Garnt, cuddle me, now! </joey>
<joey> Get closer to me." </joey>
<connor> - I was freezing! </connor>
<connor> - "I'll be the small spoon.
You be the large spoon. </connor>
<joey> Cuddle me now." </joey>
<connor> - Listen, I've seen enough
Bear Grylls to know what to do. </connor>
<joey> I knew what I needed to do. </joey>
<joey> - Drink my piss, now. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt, don't ask what I
fashioned my jeans into, </joey>
<joey> a piss filter. </joey>
<connor> I'm already drinking the
water. You can go next. </connor>
<connor> I've already pissed in it, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - I think I was wearing
like maybe six layers. </joey>
<connor> I had fashioned my spare T-shirt </connor>
<connor> and put it around my
neck as a neck warmer, </connor>
<joey> 'cause it was so cold. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. What was the
coldest part of your body? </joey>
<joey> What was the part that was hurting? </joey>
<joey> - [Both] My feet. </joey>
<connor> - It was the feet for me, too. </connor>
<connor> - I was wearing the FamilyMart socks; </connor>
<joey> that didn't help. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The one time I was like,
"Dammit, FamilyMart!" </joey>
<joey> - I was rocking a pair of jeans. </joey>
<connor> It was fine. My legs were fine, honestly. </connor>
<connor> That wasn't the problem. </connor>
<connor> I was wearing a long-sleeve thin shirt </connor>
<connor> with a big thick jumper. </connor>
<connor> I went to bed using my coat as the pillow, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I didn't have a pillow. </connor>
<connor> Woke up at like 2 AM, I
think, 'cause I was too cold. </connor>
<joey> I put the jacket on. It
didn't really help much, </joey>
<joey> 'cause by that point,
I was already too cold. </joey>
<joey> - Like the jacket was ice cold. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like... 'Cause I was too cold. </garnt>
<garnt> I wasn't heating up at
all. So it didn't help. </garnt>
<connor> But my feet were just too cold. </connor>
<garnt> - The tactic that I had in my head was, </garnt>
<connor> "Fall asleep before you really
start feeling the cold." </connor>
<connor> Before we went to the tent, </connor>
<connor> we just started downing
beers like nobody's business. </connor>
<connor> We're just like, "All right,
can we down a little bit? </connor>
<garnt> Let's do it. We fucking need
it to sleep in this weather." </garnt>
<garnt> So after we downed the beers </garnt>
<garnt> and I start cuddling Connor, it worked. </garnt>
<garnt> I fell asleep actually pretty fast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Me too. </garnt>
<connor> I got a good amount of sleep, I think. </connor>
<connor> Not good quality sleep. I felt rough. </connor>
<connor> - I got like a good three,
four hours of sleep, </connor>
<connor> because I remember waking
up at around 4:00 AM </connor>
<garnt> and that's when it
really started to hit me, </garnt>
<garnt> the fucking situation I was in. </garnt>
<joey> - That was like the minimum. </joey>
<connor> - What time did you wake
up? Or did you sleep at all? </connor>
<connor> - I slept. I probably slept
maybe about two or three hours. </connor>
<connor> Then I woke up around
four-ish, the same thing. </connor>
<connor> Then I was just like, "I can't. I can't." </connor>
<connor> I checked the temperature.
It was like -6 Celsius, </connor>
<joey> and I was like, "Fuck it." </joey>
<connor> - I know that if you wake up </connor>
<connor> and you actually start looking
at your phone and stuff, </connor>
<connor> you will wake up. </connor>
<garnt> So every time I woke up, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I woke up sporadically
throughout the night, </garnt>
<connor> I would just immediately force
myself to not do anything </connor>
<connor> and go back to sleep. </connor>
<connor> So I got to sleep until around
5:56, I think I remember. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I got out of the tent. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "I need to start walking." </connor>
<connor> - At that point, it was like
four or five degrees minus. </connor>
<joey> - I got out at like 4:00 AM, </joey>
<joey> with all the clothes I had on, </joey>
<joey> I was just like, "I'm
just gonna go for a walk, </joey>
<connor> 'cause this is the only
way I can be warmer." </connor>
<connor> - I was so much colder walking. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. 'Cause I had the
problem of what happens </connor>
<connor> when you drink too many
beers. You need to pee. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So I really, really needed to pee, </connor>
<garnt> and the toilet was very far away. </garnt>
<garnt> So I walked to it. </garnt>
<garnt> I bought a coffee from
a vending machine there </garnt>
<garnt> to heat my hands up, 'cause
I paid a dollar every time </garnt>
<joey> I needed to heat my hands up. </joey>
<joey> I was so cold. I didn't even give a shit. </joey>
<joey> I didn't drink the coffee. </joey>
<joey> I just used it as a hand warmer. </joey>
<joey> So it was saving my life.
It was like my lifeline. </joey>
<connor> I had gone through four
of these $1 coffees </connor>
<joey> just to keep my hands warm. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was like (shivering noises) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - It was awful. </connor>
<connor> It was dreadful. </connor>
<connor> I had to go pee, and peeing was painful. </connor>
<connor> But luckily, the one saving
grace of this campsite, </connor>
<connor> was at the toilet,
thank God, praise Japan, </connor>
<connor> had a bidet, and bidets have a heated... </connor>
<joey> - Heated toilet seat! </joey>
<joey> - So I sat on this toilet
seat for a good 15 minutes. </joey>
<joey> Just going (sighs blissfully), </joey>
<connor> just knowing that my ass
was being warmed gracefully. </connor>
<garnt> It was amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - One of my biggest fears
when it goes to camping, </garnt>
<garnt> is having to pee after
everyone's fallen asleep. </garnt>
<connor> Because I have the smallest
bladder in the world. </connor>
<connor> - Getting out of the tent. </connor>
<connor> - Getting out of the tent
and waking everyone up </connor>
<connor> as you are going out the tent to pee, </connor>
<connor> which sometimes, if I'm drinking, </connor>
<connor> I need to pee two or three times. </connor>
<connor> - Next time, I'm just
bringing adult diapers. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Luckily, they'll
warm you up, honestly. </connor>
<connor> - I'm bringing adult diapers next time. </connor>
<connor> - It would serve two things. </connor>
<joey> It would warm up my legs and
my lower half of my body, </joey>
<connor> and I wouldn't need to
worry about peeing anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Hold on, I gotta warm up. </connor>
<connor> - I actually remember,
even before we went to bed, </connor>
<connor> I remember telling these boys </connor>
<joey> about my irrational fears </joey>
<joey> when it comes to peeing when I'm camping. </joey>
<joey> Did you boys remember this? </joey>
<joey> - I remember stupid. </joey>
<connor> - Because we were talking
about horror movies before, </connor>
<connor> something to do with horror movies. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember; I was
pretty fucking drunk, </connor>
<connor> but anytime I pee in the wilderness, </connor>
<connor> like camping or whatever, </connor>
<connor> so you go up to a bush or something </connor>
<connor> and it's a bush that extends
as far as the eye can see. </connor>
<connor> Anything can be hiding in that bush. </connor>
<connor> I've seen enough horror movies to know </connor>
<connor> there could be a fucking monster
or Jason on the other side, </connor>
<connor> waiting to chop me up. </connor>
<connor> There could be anything. </connor>
<joey> So I have this irrational... </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry. What are you, five years old? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yes, Joey. I'm five years old. </garnt>
<connor> - Like Dexter's chilling in
the bush waiting for you? </connor>
<garnt> - He could be. So ever since I was a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> every time I would go up to pee by myself, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd hear the boys just
bantering in the background. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be about 20, 30
meters away, in the dark. </garnt>
<garnt> So they can't really see
me. But they know I'm there. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm peeing in this bush, </garnt>
<garnt> I always have this irrational fear </garnt>
<garnt> that something is going
to come out of this bush </garnt>
<garnt> and attack me or grab me, </garnt>
<garnt> or a creature's gonna chomp
me up or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that's what happens
in every horror movie, </garnt>
<garnt> it's always the guy taking the piss </garnt>
<garnt> next to the lakeside or the bush </garnt>
<garnt> that he never expects
it. He's a bit drunk. </garnt>
<garnt> That's when they die.
That's when they always die. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. You need to cut
down on the horror movies. </joey>
<garnt> - I think Sydney's making you watch </garnt>
<connor> one too many horror movies. </connor>
<garnt> - So every time I go pee, I'm eagle-eyed, </garnt>
<connor> looking for any movement. </connor>
<garnt> Any shake of the bush, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like ready to leg it the other way. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even care if my
dick's out at this point, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm legging it. </garnt>
<joey> - You should be thankful
that it was so cold, </joey>
<garnt> because if it wasn't that cold, </garnt>
<joey> I would've absolutely trolled you. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it was cold, here I am, </garnt>
<garnt> here I am, keeping an
eagle-eye out of any sign </garnt>
<garnt> of a possible monster that
could come out of the bush. </garnt>
<joey> But me being drunk, one of
you guys say something funny, </joey>
<joey> start laughing. </joey>
<joey> I look over, and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "The boys are just being boys." </joey>
<joey> I look back over and
I see someone's breath </joey>
<joey> going towards me. </joey>
<joey> - Like a white cloud. </joey>
<joey> - Like a white cloud. I'm like, "Fuck. </joey>
<joey> There's a monster hiding in that bush." </joey>
<garnt> Then I soon realized,
literally half a second in, </garnt>
<garnt> that it's just my piss steaming. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] So I gave myself, </garnt>
<garnt> my piss gave me a mini... </garnt>
<joey> - You got scared from your pee. </joey>
<joey> - I did. </joey>
<joey> - Idiot. </joey>
<joey> - My piss gave me a
mini-fucking-heart attack, </joey>
<garnt> because I thought there was
a monster hiding in the bush. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, that's the
funniest thing I've ever heard. </joey>
<garnt> - That already shows how
cold it was even before, </garnt>
<connor> even before we started sleeping. </connor>
<connor> So luckily, I'd held my
piss for as long as I could, </connor>
<connor> until I woke up. </connor>
<connor> I remember waking up and I was just... </connor>
<connor> - You can't get back in that
sleeping bag once you wake up. </connor>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> - It's not possible. </joey>
<joey> - I gave up. </joey>
<joey> - No. So I remember waking up, </joey>
<joey> and I tried to go back to sleep. </joey>
<connor> Of course, this was the exact moment </connor>
<connor> that Connor and Nabi decided
to have a snoring contest. </connor>
<connor> - [Nabi] It wasn't us. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. Yes. You guys definitely did. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why they
chose this exact moment, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I remember waking up. </garnt>
<joey> - Why do you think I
got my own tent, dude? </joey>
<connor> - Like you can't hear. </connor>
<joey> You were like four feet
away from me, Joey. </joey>
<connor> - I remember waking up </connor>
<garnt> and it was like dead silence. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I had about a good
10 minutes of dead silence. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember checking my bladder, </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, "Do I need to pee?" </garnt>
<garnt> No, thank God. I don't need to pee. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank God. My bladder's empty enough </garnt>
<garnt> for me to be able to go back to sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> So I turn over, try and find
a nice comfortable position, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I just hear Connor
next to me going (snores). </garnt>
<garnt> Then I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Connor, don't don't don't.
Don't you fucking dare." </garnt>
<garnt> Then he doesn't do anything more. </garnt>
<garnt> Then Nabi just goes (snores) </garnt>
<garnt> and then I'm just like,
"No, no, please no." </garnt>
<garnt> I get another five seconds of silence. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor turns over. (loud snore) </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, "For fuck's sake." </garnt>
<joey> - I'm trying to get the blood
flowing as much as possible. </joey>
<connor> I'm breathing. </connor>
<connor> - I do remember that moment actually, </connor>
<connor> because that was around the time </connor>
<joey> where I decided to wake up
and all I could hear was </joey>
<joey> what sounded like two
really old motorboats </joey>
<joey> trying to start up. </joey>
<garnt> (imitates motorboat) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was just like a feedback loop. </garnt>
<connor> You just kept feeding into each other. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, "Are they going?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't normally snore, </garnt>
<joey> but when I have to sleep on my back, </joey>
<joey> that's when I snore. </joey>
<joey> - Also, you guys were drinking, as well. </joey>
<joey> Naturally, you snore more when you drink. </joey>
<joey> - Well, that wasn't the only dilemma </joey>
<joey> I had to go through because now, </joey>
<joey> at this point, I had
sobered up a lot more, </joey>
<garnt> at least a lot more that I
could definitely feel the cold. </garnt>
<garnt> So I realized that being in a tent, </garnt>
<joey> you can warm up your body, </joey>
<connor> but the air in the tent is still cold. </connor>
<connor> It is still cold air. </connor>
<connor> So I was trying to
breathe through my nose, </connor>
<connor> and I swear to God, every breath I took </connor>
<connor> was like freezing the
moisture inside my nose. </connor>
<connor> - Are you saying you
became a mouth-breather? </connor>
<connor> - No. Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So while these guys... </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Stole my old
tactics, be a mouth breather. </joey>
<joey> - While these guys are
having a snoring contest, </joey>
<joey> I'm here trying to successfully
breathe through my nose </joey>
<joey> without it hurting. </joey>
<joey> After about five minutes, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I gotta become a..." </joey>
<joey> - What is this, "Demon Slayer"? </joey>
<joey> - I have to master the
breathing technique. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I'm going to
become the thing I detested." </joey>
<joey> I became a mouth breather. </joey>
<joey> But even that didn't help. </joey>
<joey> I tried breathing through my mouth, </joey>
<joey> but it was still too fucking cold. </joey>
<connor> So I had to take my jacket off, </connor>
<connor> and try to fashion this kind
of pillow-scarf kind of thing, </connor>
<connor> where my face was being covered. </connor>
<connor> So that I had enough air. </connor>
<connor> - Cosplaying "Dune" or something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of. </connor>
<connor> So I tried to masquerade this mask on me </connor>
<connor> where I had enough air to breathe, </connor>
<connor> but it was also insulating the cold air. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That didn't work, because then, </connor>
<connor> if anyone's tried to sleep </connor>
<connor> with the blanket over your head, </connor>
<connor> you soon realize that you
can't fucking breathe. </connor>
<connor> You can't breathe. </connor>
<joey> - It's very stuffy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. You're gonna get very stuffy. </joey>
<joey> You're probably gonna die
of carbon dioxide poisoning. </joey>
<joey> So basically, I had to make the choice </joey>
<connor> of trying to sleep suffocating
myself or freezing my lungs. </connor>
<connor> Neither choice sounded
like a good choice to me. </connor>
<connor> So here I am for 30 minutes. </connor>
<connor> I would put the cover over my head, </connor>
<garnt> try to breathe through
it for a good 30 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> Doesn't work, take it off.
Find another position. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sounds like you were one step away </garnt>
<connor> from just breathing your
own farts for warmth. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that might have
honestly been the best solution. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, I would've taken
any solution that worked, </joey>
<joey> but eventually me trying to go to sleep, </joey>
<joey> Connor eventually wakes up
and he goes out the tent. </joey>
<joey> So I try sleeping </joey>
<joey> for another half an hour to 45 minutes </joey>
<joey> before I just give up
and just try going out. </joey>
<joey> At that point, everyone's already out. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know what these guys were doing. </joey>
<connor> I thought Connor had gone
for a walk or something. </connor>
<connor> I thought maybe they'd
gone back to another tent. </connor>
<connor> I had no idea what they were doing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember them talking outside, </connor>
<connor> but when I went outside, nobody was there. </connor>
<connor> So, I remember trying to
find where everyone was </connor>
<connor> and then for some reason, I felt the car, </connor>
<connor> or I heard the car engine purring. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Why is the car
on? What's going on here?" </connor>
<connor> Keep in mind, I had
contacts on before I slept. </connor>
<connor> So I had taken them off.
I couldn't see shit. </connor>
<connor> So I was trying to feel my way through. </connor>
<connor> Everything was blurry for me. </connor>
<connor> So I go towards the car, </connor>
<connor> and I see Connor just
sleeping on the driver's seat. </connor>
<connor> These motherfuckers had gone into the car. </connor>
<garnt> - Big brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Had gone into the car, </garnt>
<garnt> turned the engine on, and
just slept in the car. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck the camping trip. </garnt>
<garnt> They had gone back to civilization. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, in my mind, I'm
like, "Listen, I've slept. </connor>
<connor> It's 6:00 AM. It's technically morning. </connor>
<connor> I've awoken. Now I want to get warm. </connor>
<connor> I'm going in the fucking car." </connor>
<connor> Because at that point I was like, </connor>
<connor> "What do we actually do?" </connor>
<connor> I don't know what to do. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, "I can't sit
on the toilet for hours." </garnt>
<garnt> We're not gonna leave
for a few more hours. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "There's nowhere
I can go to get warm. </garnt>
<garnt> No one can accuse me of not camping. </garnt>
<connor> I slept in the tent until 6:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> I'm now going in the car to heat up." </connor>
<joey> - I joined him, obviously,
to warm up a bit. </joey>
<joey> - Turned the engine on for a bit, </joey>
<joey> and then it got hot enough. </joey>
<joey> Then the sun was starting to come out, </joey>
<garnt> so we just turned it off. </garnt>
<garnt> Then we're just chilling in the car. </garnt>
<connor> I slept like four hours. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I'm giving them shit, </connor>
<connor> but the only reason I'm giving them shit </connor>
<connor> was because I saw Connor
sleeping in the car. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, "You fucking
genius. Big brain mode." </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "Galaxy brain". </joey>
<joey> - I excitedly open the
car door, being like, </joey>
<joey> "You fucking geniuses." </joey>
<garnt> Then I quickly see that
all the seats are taken. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - So originally, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Come on, Joey, let's go in the car. </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna go in the car." </connor>
<connor> I didn't want all this wasted
electricity that I'm using, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it is a massive
waste of electricity. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the time, I was
like, "I'm gonna die. </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna get in the
car. It's -4. Fuck this." </connor>
<connor> The other people were
taking photos of Fuji </connor>
<connor> and they were dying for their craft. </connor>
<connor> I salute them, but not me. </connor>
<connor> I had nothing to gain from that. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "I'm going in
the car, Joey, come on in." </connor>
<joey> And then slowly, everyone
started trying to get in the car, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they were also freezing. </joey>
<joey> - Then it basically turned into a sauna, </joey>
<joey> where people were coming in and out, </joey>
<joey> just trying to warm up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because I opened the car door, </garnt>
<garnt> and every fucking seat was
taken, and it wasn't filmed. </garnt>
<connor> I'm glad it wasn't filmed, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it would've quickly turned into </connor>
<connor> the saltiest moment of
Trash Taste this year, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, "Fuck these guys. </connor>
<garnt> Fuck these guys. Fuck them." </garnt>
<garnt> I went for a walk trying to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> how I'm gonna warm myself up. </garnt>
<connor> - It was great, 'cause the car </connor>
<connor> was slightly on a hill, as well. </connor>
<connor> So when reclined the chair, </connor>
<garnt> it was literally like a flat bed. </garnt>
<joey> The air blasting, 'cause it
doesn't really do anything </joey>
<connor> for the first 10 minutes, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause the car wasn't moving. </garnt>
<connor> So it was like, "What are we doing?" </connor>
<garnt> - So I'm still tired as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> I start walking around. </garnt>
<garnt> I try taking some nice photos of Fuji, </garnt>
<connor> but at this point, I'm fucking dying. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> You could have got in, </connor>
<connor> you know, could've squeezed in. </connor>
<connor> - There was literally no space. </connor>
<connor> - Could've got in the boot. </connor>
<joey> - Every space was taken. </joey>
<joey> - We could have stacked. </joey>
<joey> - I found my way, though. </joey>
<joey> I found a way to warm myself up. </joey>
<connor> So this was me using 100% of my brain. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm an engineer, </connor>
<connor> and what do engineers do? </connor>
<connor> We problem solve. </connor>
<connor> - I did that, too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you did. </connor>
<connor> I can't blame you for not problem solving. </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately, I couldn't
go for the same solution, </connor>
<joey> because Nabi was fast asleep. </joey>
<joey> So I couldn't be like, </joey>
<joey> "Nabi, gimme the car keys." </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] "Get the fuck out." </connor>
<connor> - "Get the fuck out.
Let's go into the car." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] "Give me the other car." </connor>
<connor> - So I walk over to take a piss, </connor>
<connor> to take a piss in the toilet, </connor>
<connor> and I see the vending machine. </connor>
<connor> Then like the fucking bulb
just lights above my head. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Guys, I figured this out." </connor>
<garnt> So I go back to my tent. I get my wallet. </garnt>
<garnt> I get my wallet and I just
start putting coins in. </garnt>
<garnt> I start buying coffee. 'Cause Connor... </garnt>
<garnt> - How many did you buy? </garnt>
<connor> - I bought six in the end. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<connor> That sounds more inefficient
than using the car. </connor>
<garnt> - Probably. It probably is. </garnt>
<connor> But that was the only
solution I could come up with. </connor>
<connor> - Why did you not just
jump in the other car? </connor>
<connor> We had two cars. </connor>
<connor> - It's canned coffees by the way. </connor>
<garnt> - So to explain, we had
a vending machine there, </garnt>
<garnt> and Japanese vending
machines have this option </garnt>
<garnt> where some of the drinks are warmed. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the only source
of heat I could find </garnt>
<garnt> in like a five-mile radius at this point. </garnt>
<garnt> So here I am, spending a
hundred yen for a coffee, </garnt>
<garnt> which to me are just
like heat packs, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I start packing them into my coat. </garnt>
<garnt> At this point, I actually
start rationing them. </garnt>
<garnt> So I start, so I take about six coffees, </garnt>
<garnt> rush back to the tent, </garnt>
<garnt> go back into my sleeping bag. </garnt>
<garnt> I throw two cans at my feet, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause my feet were the coldest. </garnt>
<garnt> The rest, I start packing
in my winter jackets. </garnt>
<garnt> I pack some in my bottom
pockets, some in my side, </garnt>
<garnt> my sleeve pockets, my side pockets; </garnt>
<garnt> have the best fucking
sleep of my life, man. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It worked. It actually worked. </garnt>
<garnt> I got some proper air circulation </garnt>
<garnt> in this fucking sleeping bag, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I felt so rough the next day. </connor>
<connor> I slept like 10 hours as
well. I just felt awful. </connor>
<connor> There's something about
eating just meat, as well, </connor>
<joey> that just makes me feel awful. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I get that. </joey>
<joey> - And a lot of beer. </joey>
<joey> - We didn't have the best
diet the night before. </joey>
<joey> - When I eat just meat, like only meat, </joey>
<connor> I feel like my body feels beaten up. </connor>
<connor> Like I need something else
to help stomach the blow. </connor>
<garnt> - So yeah. Moral of the story is... </garnt>
<garnt> - Be more prepared. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't underestimate the winter. </garnt>
<connor> I thought it would be fine. </connor>
<garnt> - Who gives a shit about
what Bear Grylls says, </garnt>
<connor> when you could just get warm coffee? </connor>
<connor> That's the secret. </connor>
<joey> - Just get in the car.
Just get in the car. </joey>
<joey> - Why did Bear Grylls not go
to the nearest vending machine? </joey>
<garnt> - All you need is a konbini. </garnt>
<joey> Just go to a vending machine. </joey>
<connor> - Get a vending machine. </connor>
<connor> - Pack yourself some warm fucking coffee, </connor>
<connor> and just use that shit. Warm yourself up. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why Russians are complaining. </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen Siberian winters. </garnt>
<connor> Just need a vending machine. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes their car engines freeze. </connor>
<joey> Don't they leave the cars on sometimes, </joey>
<connor> 'cause it freezes otherwise? </connor>
<connor> - Did you also watch that video </connor>
<connor> of the dude who went to Siberia? </connor>
<connor> - Was it really? </connor>
<connor> - It was that video that went viral. </connor>
<connor> It was on my recommended recently. </connor>
<connor> It's got like 30 million views </connor>
<connor> in six months or something, </connor>
<connor> of this dude who went
to Yakutsk in Siberia, </connor>
<connor> which is the coldest part of the world. </connor>
<connor> It's like -71 degrees or something. </connor>
<connor> - Colder that Antarctica? </connor>
<connor> - It's colder than Antarctica, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Gotta fact check that, Ashley. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. But it it's called Yakutsk. </connor>
<joey> Y A K U T S K. </joey>
<joey> Something like that. </joey>
<connor> - Where's the coldest place on Earth? </connor>
<joey> - But it's in Siberia, </joey>
<joey> and this dude does this
amazing mini-documentary </joey>
<joey> of him there and he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, so here I've got some
boiling water at 100 degrees, </joey>
<joey> and I'm gonna throw it out into the air </joey>
<joey> and it'll instantly freeze." </joey>
<joey> He just throws it. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I've seen that, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Instantly turns into snow, </joey>
<connor> because it's like -50 degrees. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "In normal circumstances, </connor>
<joey> if it's anywhere below zero degrees, </joey>
<joey> then school is canceled. </joey>
<joey> But here in Yakutsk, as
long as it doesn't hit -50, </joey>
<joey> kids are going to school." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> Yeah. It's insane. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I remember seeing videos like that. </garnt>
<joey> Let me see. Not just in Siberia, </joey>
<connor> but I think recently somewhere in America </connor>
<joey> had like a cold front where it was like... </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, Texas? </joey>
<joey> - Was it Texas? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. Texas had... </joey>
<joey> - Where I saw videos of
people doing the same thing, </joey>
<garnt> where they would throw out the water. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't quote me on this, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm not sure if it was Texas. </garnt>
<connor> - It was Texas. It was Texas. </connor>
<garnt> - Are you sure? </garnt>
<garnt> - The cold front? Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> The cold was 'cause all
the electrical grid broke. </joey>
<joey> - This guy Discover with
Cenet, 32 million views, </joey>
<connor> six months ago, -71 degrees
Celsius, -96 Fahrenheit. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - [Nabi] It's not the coldest
habitable place on Earth, </connor>
<joey> but it's probably one of them. </joey>
<connor> - It's one of them. It's up there. </connor>
<joey> - [Nabi] It's one of the coldest cities. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I'm pretty sure
that Antarctica is like... </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. Center of the Arctic Circle </connor>
<joey> is probably colder, but
no one's living there. </joey>
<garnt> - So I would see videos of people </garnt>
<joey> throwing boiling water out, </joey>
<garnt> and you'd see it freeze
and steam instantly. </garnt>
<joey> But my favorite thing was people </joey>
<joey> who didn't realize that boiling water </joey>
<joey> is still boiling water, </joey>
<joey> and if you chuck it on yourself, </joey>
<joey> even if it's like -20
degrees weather outside, </joey>
<joey> there's still gonna be some boiling water. </joey>
<connor> You're still gonna burn yourself. </connor>
<garnt> - Why were people
chucking it on themselves? </garnt>
<connor> They were chucking it on themselves? </connor>
<garnt> - They were chucking it in the air, </garnt>
<connor> and the water, you know, fell down. </connor>
<connor> - Fell down. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause how gravity works,
it would fall down on them. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, "Ah! Fuck!" </garnt>
<connor> - "Let's just scald myself." </connor>
<garnt> - The more you know. Boiling
water is still boiling. </garnt>
<connor> Cold things are cold. </connor>
<connor> Camping in -4 degrees weather... </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure there's gonna be </connor>
<connor> some pro camping people watching this, </connor>
<connor> cringing to death hearing all the fails, </connor>
<connor> but that's camping, innit? </connor>
<joey> Fucking everything up. </joey>
<garnt> - It was still fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's part of the fun. </garnt>
<connor> - It's still fun. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure there's gonna be </connor>
<connor> some people watching be like, </connor>
<garnt> "What? -6, -5, that's not cold." </garnt>
<connor> - Basic. Basic. </connor>
<garnt> - But that's how it always is in these. </garnt>
<garnt> They'll be like, "Oh, you
woke up at 4:00 AM, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> I wake up at 1:00 AM every day </garnt>
<garnt> and I inject meth into my eyes. </garnt>
<joey> You don't know what waking up early is." </joey>
<joey> - Weak morning routine. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Shut the fuck up. </joey>
<connor> Let people complain about
what is relative to them </connor>
<connor> for a moment, please." </connor>
<garnt> - Look, all I'm saying
is Yuru Camp lied to me. </garnt>
<garnt> They went camping in the winter, </garnt>
<garnt> and they didn't need to
go into the fucking car </garnt>
<connor> to warm themselves up. </connor>
<connor> They were comfy in their little coats. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna see that Yuru Camp episode. </connor>
<connor> - Where's the Yuru Camp episode </connor>
<connor> where they become mouth breathers? </connor>
<connor> If they don't become mouth breathers, </connor>
<garnt> then I don't think it's
accurate, honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do they have clearly defined nose? </garnt>
<connor> That could be mouth breathers. </connor>
<garnt> - No, they don't. </garnt>
<connor> - They might be mouth breathers, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - They probably are mouth breathers. </connor>
<joey> - They're pretty mouth breathers. </joey>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </joey>

<connor> I pretty much only shave with Harry's. </connor>

an ad, but it's real. </connor>
<connor> When I went back to the UK, </connor>
<connor> they actually sold Harry's in the UK, </connor>
<connor> and I put like five boxes
of the 12-pack razors </connor>
<connor> in my suitcase. </connor>
<connor> Genuinely, it's the cleanest shave. </connor>
<connor> I'm telling you, these razors are clean, </connor>
<connor> very good, and they last a while. </connor>

<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you guys have any irrational fears? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I don't know if I'm the only one... </garnt>
<joey> - How irrational? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I dunno. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. What is
your biggest fear, Joey? </joey>
<garnt> What is your biggest fear? </garnt>
<garnt> - My biggest fear? </garnt>
<garnt> - What is your biggest irrational fear? </garnt>
<garnt> - Not having a great beard. I'm kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> Actually go, sorry. Sorry
to bring up the camping. </garnt>
<connor> We'll go back to the irrational fears. </connor>
<connor> We'll go back to that. </connor>
<connor> The beard definitely helped staying warm. </connor>
<garnt> I gotta admit, now that
I've let it grow out. </garnt>
<garnt> My face was never cold. </garnt>
<garnt> - But didn't your snot freeze? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. So here,
'cause I had a cold, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was so cold. </garnt>
<garnt> My snot, obviously it must have dribbled </garnt>
<connor> while I was sleeping. </connor>
<connor> It froze on the arch of
my, underneath my nose. </connor>
<connor> - Ow. </connor>
<connor> - It was awful 'cause I
was like, "What is this?" </connor>
<connor> and flicked it and just
peeled off all my skin. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Ow. Ow." </connor>
<connor> But yeah, the beard otherwise is great. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think this is the
longest I'll let it go. </joey>
<joey> It's getting pretty long. </joey>
<joey> - Does it get any longer than that? </joey>
<joey> - It can do. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - I think it'll keep
going longer and longer. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, damn. </connor>
<joey> I kind of wanna see you
with like the longer... </joey>
<connor> - Part of me wants to
try it, but I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Maybe I should just save
that for when I'm bald." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - No, you gotta test it out
now, before you go bald. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. That's what I was thinking. </connor>
<joey> - See if it works. </joey>
<connor> - But I'm not gonna
lie, I don't know if... </connor>
<connor> There's probably a lot of
bearded people watching this. </connor>
<joey> It kind of is getting
somewhat itchier than usual. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I feel that. </joey>
<joey> - Do you get this? Do you
get this, bearded people? </joey>
<joey> - No, I get that. </joey>
<joey> - There are probably no solutions </joey>
<joey> that are like, "How you
maintain a beard perfectly." </joey>
<joey> Which I don't. </joey>
<joey> - One time, I grew it out
to as long as I could, </joey>
<joey> and I don't think it'll
ever get as long as yours, </joey>
<connor> but I remember one time it... </connor>
<connor> - I'm at the baby stages.
It's still growing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that length that you have, </connor>
<connor> is probably the longest it can go for me. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Because my Asian side forbids it. </joey>
<connor> - I will say that doing
this feels really nice. </connor>
<connor> Just be like, "Yeah." </connor>
<joey> - Have you gotten to the point, though, </joey>
<joey> where you're kind of turning in your bed </joey>
<joey> and your beard brushes
up against the pillow </joey>
<joey> and it starts to get a bit itchy? </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes, yeah. </joey>
<connor> The worst thing is, 'cause
we have to wear masks, </connor>
<joey> when it's getting thicker... </joey>
<joey> - With a mask is the worst. </joey>
<joey> - Masks suck. </joey>
<connor> It's like I'm breathing
into my own beard jungle. </connor>
<joey> I can feel it. </joey>
<joey> - It's ticklish, as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's like wet. It's awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - How long are you gonna grow it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm probably gonna shave it tonight. </garnt>
<connor> Not all off. I'm just gonna cut it, sorry. </connor>
<connor> I'll trim it down, 'cause
got a video shoot tomorrow. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be sad to stop letting it grow, </connor>
<joey> but maybe I'll try it again. </joey>
<joey> - You should try it. You should try it. </joey>
<connor> - I'll do it again sometime. </connor>
<garnt> - How come you wanted to
grow it out a bit longer? </garnt>
<connor> - I just wanted to see if
it looked better thicker. </connor>
<connor> I think it does look a
little better thicker </connor>
<connor> than normal. </connor>
<joey> - It definitely adds on
the age, that's for sure. </joey>
<connor> - I look older. I look more angry. </connor>
<joey> - Who doesn't look older
with a beard, though, </joey>
<joey> is what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> - I could probably look
my age if I grew a beard. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Probably. </connor>
<connor> - I could see Garnt in
10 years with a goatee. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna see that. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt with a goatee. I could see it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever seen you with, </joey>
<joey> have you ever grown out your beard </joey>
<joey> to see where the absolute limit is </joey>
<joey> before it stops growing? </joey>
<garnt> - No, because I don't like
how I look with a beard </garnt>
<joey> a lot of the times. </joey>
<joey> There's this... </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I want goatee Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - There's this perfect sweet spot, </connor>
<connor> and then it just kind of looks like pubes. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It goes from nine o'clock shadow to, </connor>
<joey> "Wow, you really should
trim that bush, mate." </joey>
<joey> So I always trim it when
it gets to that point. </joey>
<joey> So I don't know if I'm ever
gonna grow out the beard, </joey>
<joey> because Sydney's like,
"Yeah, it's a good idea. </joey>
<joey> It's a good idea." </joey>
<connor> Then I reached the pube stage. </connor>
<garnt> She's like, "Maybe you should trim it." </garnt>
<connor> - It's in-between phases that look bad. </connor>
<garnt> - After the pube phase is
when it starts to look good. </garnt>
<joey> - Commit, Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe I will, one day. </garnt>
<joey> - Goatee Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone has the pube stage. </joey>
<joey> You have to go beyond the pube stage. </joey>
<joey> - He wears turtlenecks. </joey>
<joey> He's literally made for goatees. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Goatee Garnt. Do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe, maybe one day. </garnt>
<connor> - Do it. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe when I reach my midlife crisis. </joey>
<joey> You know how like... </joey>
<garnt> - You'll be the first one there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I could do a goatee. </garnt>
<connor> I could just shave it all off and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hello, fellow goatee wearers." </connor>
<joey> - I did a goatee once when I was shaving, </joey>
<joey> and immediately, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh God, I look like I touch children." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Fuck, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - It was actually like I immediately, </joey>
<joey> I was immediately like, </joey>
<joey> "Nope, I'm not having this
on my face any longer." </joey>
<garnt> - Calling out anyone with a goatee. </garnt>
<connor> - As opposed to like Shinobu. </connor>
<connor> - It just doesn't work for me. </connor>
<connor> I realize I have one of those faces </connor>
<connor> that's just like it's
either beard or nothing. </connor>
<connor> Like goatee, mustache... </connor>
<connor> - Well, you're not helping yourself out. </connor>
<connor> - I tried the bootstrap beard </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that, with
the really thin beard. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I don't like those. </connor>
<connor> - That doesn't work for me. </connor>
<connor> Mustache doesn't work for me. </connor>
<connor> Goatee doesn't work for me. </connor>
<connor> It's either this or nothing. </connor>
<connor> I just have one of
those faces, I realized. </connor>
<joey> You just have to try it out. </joey>
<connor> - I wish mustaches were more "in". </connor>
<joey> I like mustaches. </joey>
<joey> - I wish I could rock a mustache. </joey>
<connor> - Mustaches look kinda sick. </connor>
<joey> - I wish I had the face for a mustache. </joey>
<garnt> They do look sick. </garnt>
<joey> - It just looks like you're
about to invent something. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You look like you're
about to pioneer somewhere. </joey>
<garnt> - Depends on what kind of
mustache you have, right? </garnt>
<joey> - You could work a mustache. </joey>
<connor> - I don't get, you know
that thing that people have </connor>
<connor> where you don't grow that
much hair in the middle? </connor>
<connor> You need it to grow more there. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think you would suit a mustache. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] No, I don't think so either. </connor>
<connor> - You don't think so? </connor>
<connor> I also think you'd look like
you touched short people </connor>
<connor> if you wore a mustache. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt! You're giving
people with a mustache </connor>
<connor> a bad rep here, boys. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some people can rock it so hard, </garnt>
<joey> and I'm so jealous of
people who can do that. </joey>
<garnt> - If he had a mustache
and those massive glasses, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Those massive glasses,
you would definitely... </garnt>
<joey> - You're calling out some of our viewers. </joey>
<connor> They're probably gone. </connor>
<joey> - No, but I'm sure they
don't look that bad. </joey>
<connor> - Saying it's just my face. </connor>
<connor> My face just looks hideous. </connor>
<joey> - For some people, it just works, </joey>
<connor> and there's no explanation for it. </connor>
<connor> - Here's a still image,
Mudan. Put a mustache on. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen dudes with just mustaches, </joey>
<joey> just goatees, just bootstraps, </joey>
<joey> where it's like, "Fuck.
You kill that shit." </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Put some glasses on him as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Put some big glasses. </garnt>
<joey> - Put some glasses and then you'll see </joey>
<joey> it just doesn't work for some people. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. Maybe it works. </garnt>
<joey> Maybe it's just my imagination. </joey>
<garnt> - Amazing. Bet it looks amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - If it looks amazing, you have to do it. </connor>
<connor> - I think I'd look like a '90s porn star. </connor>
<joey> - Is that a good thing or a bad thing? </joey>
<joey> - It's a great thing. </joey>
<joey> The 2000s porn stars, the Johnny Sins era. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, '90s is
mustaches, all that stuff. </joey>
<joey> - That's like '70s. </joey>
<connor> - '90s. </connor>
<joey> - '70s porn stars had
the thick thick mustache. </joey>
<connor> - That was a look. That was
a look. Bring it back, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe I will. Who knows? </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't imagine you with a mustache. </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt would look like
a detective if he did it. </connor>
<garnt> I wanna see Garnt with a fucking mustache. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, I dunno. </joey>
<connor> How long does it take for
you guys to grow out a beard? </connor>
<connor> How much commitment does it take? </connor>
<connor> - I dunno how long this has taken. </connor>
<connor> This is taking a while. </connor>
<connor> - My max, I think, is a
month and a half, two months. </connor>
<joey> Then it hits a point where it
just won't grow any longer. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a long time. </garnt>
<connor> - It takes a long time to grow a beard. </connor>
<garnt> - It takes a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Months that I don't have, </garnt>
<connor> and it looks scruffy in the middle parts. </connor>
<connor> When it's a full beard and
I can trim it properly, </connor>
<connor> yeah, it'll look good. </connor>
<garnt> - When I reach my midlife crisis, </garnt>
<garnt> that's when I'll grow a beard. </garnt>
<connor> - You're saying I reached
my midlife crisis? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Sorry? </connor>
<garnt> - Have I reached my midlife crisis? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, maybe you have, Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't got my
health check results yet. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I have. </garnt>
<joey> - So you might be at midlife. </joey>
<connor> - It could be three-quarters. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like growing a beard </connor>
<connor> or doing something crazy
with your facial hair </connor>
<connor> is the male equivalent of </connor>
<connor> when girls want a big change in their life </connor>
<connor> and they just cut their
hair off or something, </connor>
<garnt> it's like the male equivalent. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I broke up, I cut my hair. </joey>
<garnt> - We need... </garnt>
<joey> - I broke up. I grow a beard. </joey>
<garnt> - We need to change the stigma. </garnt>
<garnt> The stigma around it. </garnt>
<garnt> - We need to change the stigma. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you grow a beard at
any point in your life, </garnt>
<garnt> you're a sumo. You deserve it. </garnt>
<garnt> Go. You go, bro. Get a beard. </garnt>
<garnt> - What if you can't grow a beard, though? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sucks to be you, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some people just can't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Stigma. </garnt>
<garnt> - That doesn't mean you're
having a midlife crisis </garnt>
<connor> if you grow a beard, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Fuck you. </connor>
<connor> You can grow facial hair
if you want to, king. </connor>
<connor> Go ahead. </connor>
<connor> - I grew my beard out in my early 20s. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Midlife crisis. </connor>
<joey> - Midlife crisis, shit. </joey>
<connor> - In YouTuber years,
that is a midlife crisis. </connor>
<connor> - True. That is true. </connor>
<connor> - Utterly. </connor>
<garnt> - But anyway, going back
to irrational fears. </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember... </garnt>
<connor> - Have we said our fears
on a podcast before, </connor>
<connor> like our main fears? </connor>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> We did an episode where we
talked about our fears, right? </joey>
<connor> - Actually, it was a clickbait, though. </connor>
<connor> - No we talked about... </connor>
<connor> - What was I scared of? </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - What was I scared of? </connor>
<joey> - Tight spaces. Or I
remember we talked about </joey>
<joey> crawling into tight spaces. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. 'Cause you were
talking about the cave story. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember, I just realized this, </joey>
<joey> as I was taking another piss, </joey>
<joey> where most of my
irrational fears come from, </joey>
<joey> and it is from horror movies. </joey>
<joey> Specifically from horror movies </joey>
<joey> that I would watch as a kid. </joey>
<joey> I think that's why I detest horror movies, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I remember </joey>
<joey> most of the horror movies
I've watched in my life </joey>
<connor> are between the age of
five to 10 years old. </connor>
<connor> The reason for this is </connor>
<connor> every time I'd go to my cousin's house, </connor>
<connor> he'd put on a horror movie. </connor>
<connor> How it'd start is I'd go
around to my cousin's house </connor>
<connor> and be like, "Oh, can we
watch "Dragon Ball Z"? </connor>
<connor> Can we watch "Dragon Ball Z"?" </connor>
<connor> So they'd put on "Dragon Ball Z" </connor>
<connor> and I'd be into it, </connor>
<connor> then all the parents would go
off and do their own thing. </connor>
<connor> They would ask the older cousins </connor>
<connor> to take care of the kids. </connor>
<garnt> As soon as the adults left, </garnt>
<garnt> they were like, "Yo, you
wanna see a horror movie? </garnt>
<garnt> You wanna see someone get butchered?" </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "No, that scares
me. It gives me nightmares." </connor>
<connor> - How old are you? </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - How old are you? </connor>
<connor> - Between like five and 10 years old. </connor>
<connor> - Fuckin' hell. A little too young. </connor>
<connor> - So I remember, I think I
was seven or something... </connor>
<connor> So I'm gonna say the irrational fear. </connor>
<connor> Every time I approach my car </connor>
<connor> and it's just in a car park, </connor>
<connor> could be empty, could be full. </connor>
<connor> But I'm by myself and it's dark. </connor>
<connor> First thing I have to
do, check the backseat. </connor>
<connor> Make sure no one's in it. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Second thing I have to do, </connor>
<connor> I have to go under </connor>
<connor> and check that there's nobody
hiding underneath my car. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Do you check that every time? </connor>
<connor> - Like 90% of the time. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - I do it because I don't
feel safe unless I do it. </connor>
<connor> - What's gonna be under your car? </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Here's the reason. </joey>
<connor> - A monster. </connor>
<connor> - Here's the reason why. </connor>
<connor> So when I was about, I can't remember, </connor>
<connor> between five and seven. </connor>
<connor> I think I was seven years old. </connor>
<joey> I go to my cousin's house,
and of course, it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Garnt, it's horror movie time again." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No, please no." </joey>
<connor> We're putting in the horror movie. </connor>
<connor> This time, it's "Urban Legends". </connor>
<joey> - Is it good? </joey>
<joey> - I dunno if it's good. </joey>
<joey> Scared the shit out of me as
a kid, I'll tell you that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I bet. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never watched it since. </garnt>
<joey> - You might get PTSD if you watch it now. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Honestly. </garnt>
<joey> - You will overcome your fear. </joey>
<joey> - Well maybe, maybe. </joey>
<joey> It's a slasher horror movie. </joey>
<joey> So it was like '90s. </joey>
<joey> So that's when slasher
horror movies were in. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Like the "Scream" era. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. The "Scream" era. </connor>
<connor> That's the horror movie
era that I grew up with </connor>
<connor> and that's the kind of horror
movies that traumatized me. </connor>
<connor> I remember </connor>
<connor> it was this guy. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the exact
things that happened, </connor>
<connor> but I remember it was surprise, surprise, </connor>
<connor> about urban legends. </connor>
<connor> You'd have these urban
legends that were spread out </connor>
<joey> and sometimes these urban
legends would come true. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember what the
exact urban legends were, </joey>
<joey> but I remember this one scene. </joey>
<joey> It was a guy who was
basically dressed up as Death </joey>
<joey> and he had a scythe. </joey>
<connor> I think part of the urban legend was </connor>
<connor> that there would be this
guy in the back of your car </connor>
<connor> while you're driving. </connor>
<connor> This actually happened in the movie. </connor>
<connor> There was this person driving the car </connor>
<connor> and how he died was </connor>
<connor> someone emerged from the back </connor>
<connor> with a scythe and just
chopped him up to death. </connor>
<connor> Of course, as a kid, that terrified me, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I remember thinking, </connor>
<joey> "If I ever grow up and
get my driver's license, </joey>
<joey> at any point in the dark, </joey>
<joey> someone could come up from the back seat </joey>
<joey> and stab me in the neck
or slice my neck open." </joey>
<joey> - I kind of get that. </joey>
<joey> - So that is just ingrained into my mind. </joey>
<joey> But the second death in that movie, </joey>
<joey> or it might be the third or the fourth, </joey>
<joey> I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> So this rumor gets spread around, right? </joey>
<connor> That there's a guy in the backseat, </connor>
<connor> there's a serial killer, </connor>
<connor> and this is how this person died. </connor>
<connor> So, of course, the fourth guy, </connor>
<connor> he thinks he's better than this. </connor>
<connor> He goes towards his car. </connor>
<connor> He's a bit scared, but what does he do? </connor>
<connor> He checks the backseat. </connor>
<connor> Of course, he's like... </connor>
<connor> - I've beat the system. </connor>
<joey> - Ha. I beat the system. It's so dumb. </joey>
<joey> Out of nowhere, the guy is
hiding underneath the car </joey>
<joey> and slices his ankles. </joey>
<joey> He starts crawling away. </joey>
<joey> I remember this scene to this day. </joey>
<joey> That's why, if I ever approach a car, </joey>
<joey> I'm beating the system. </joey>
<joey> First thing I'm doing, </joey>
<joey> I'm checking underneath the car. </joey>
<joey> Second thing I'm doing, </joey>
<joey> I'm checking the backseat, right? </joey>
<joey> There's no... </joey>
<joey> - Then what if Death's like, </joey>
<joey> "Big plot twist, passenger seat." </joey>
<joey> - Look, look, look. If there's a sequel, </joey>
<joey> if there's "Urban Legends 2", </joey>
<joey> where someone adds on to this system, </joey>
<joey> I'm fucked. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Why? </connor>
<joey> - But until then, I'm checking </joey>
<joey> underneath every car I go to, </joey>
<garnt> and every backseat, if I'm by myself, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm not getting my ankles sliced. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll tell you that much. </garnt>
<connor> - How did this man, not to nitpick, </connor>
<connor> but how did he use a scythe in a car? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Was this like an SUV? </garnt>
<joey> - Mini-scythe. </joey>
<connor> - This must have been a big scythe, man. </connor>
<connor> You can't swing it in a car. </connor>
<connor> The scythes are not short tools. </connor>
<connor> Maybe a sickle, a sickle
might have worked. </connor>
<connor> - I like how that's your
first question and not, </connor>
<connor> "How did he get into the car?" </connor>
<connor> - The first thing I was
thinking when he said this, </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "How did this man
swing a scythe in a car?" </joey>
<connor> I can barely swing my arms in a car. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a good question. </garnt>
<garnt> I should have asked that as a kid. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe if he kind of put it forward </connor>
<garnt> and then brought it backwards. </garnt>
<garnt> But then how would you
slice it underneath? </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like </garnt>
<connor> there's a lot of ways this could go wrong. </connor>
<joey> - You're being a little
too realistic here. </joey>
<joey> We first have to question,
"Why is Death in my car?" </joey>
<connor> - That's why I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I was gonna be scared
until the many plot holes </connor>
<garnt> that were available. </garnt>
<garnt> I suddenly feel a lot safer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Irrational. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like, "This is good." </connor>
<connor> - I feel like, as an adult, </connor>
<connor> you can pick apart the plot holes </connor>
<joey> in a lot of horror movies, </joey>
<garnt> and they stop being scary. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] That's true. </joey>
<joey> - As a kid, you're like,
"(screaming) He's bleeding! </joey>
<joey> He's bleeding! What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> - I get that backseat bullshit, </joey>
<connor> because there's a lot of
Japanese horror films, as well, </connor>
<connor> where that's very cliche. </connor>
<connor> The other one that scares me is, </connor>
<connor> and I hated this because my new place </connor>
<joey> that I currently have has this, </joey>
<joey> but in the bathroom, </joey>
<joey> your mirror has a medicine cabinet. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's the thing of you're
brushing your teeth, </joey>
<connor> and the medicine cabinet's slightly open, </connor>
<connor> and then you close the medicine cabinet </connor>
<joey> and then the monster
is standing behind you. </joey>
<joey> Every now and then, I
have that thing where </joey>
<joey> if I'm in the dark and the
medicine cabinet is open, </joey>
<joey> before I close it, I just look behind me. </joey>
<joey> - Do you actually? </joey>
<joey> - Do you take a single
breath before you close? </joey>
<garnt> You're just like, "Okay." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm kind of like, I see it open. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, (breathes out
forcefully) "Okay, I'm good. </joey>
<joey> Okay guys, I'm good. Let's go." </joey>
<joey> I get that every now and then. </joey>
<joey> - I don't have any rituals like that </joey>
<connor> to stop me from being scared
of something like that. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I think to this day, </joey>
<joey> there's some part about
me where it's like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm still scared of the dark." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For whatever bullshit reason. </joey>
<connor> It's not because it's like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm afraid of the guy behind me </connor>
<connor> as I'm at the medicine
cabinet," or whatever, </connor>
<joey> but it's like, in the back of your head, </joey>
<connor> in the back of your fucked-up
imagination somewhere, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "This is a possibility." </connor>
<garnt> - It's like when you're sleeping, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, "Did
I leave my door open?" </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know you didn't, </joey>
<joey> but now you're gonna go check. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you're like, "I thought I did, </joey>
<connor> but I definitely didn't,
but I have to check." </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - It's kind of like that. </connor>
<garnt> Where you make yourself
think something is there. </garnt>
<garnt> So now you have to check. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Otherwise you can't
stop thinking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've had stuff like that with, </garnt>
<garnt> "There could just be a monster </garnt>
<garnt> on the other side of the
bed if I turn around. </garnt>
<connor> But I won't know unless I turn around. </connor>
<connor> Guess I won't turn around." </connor>
<connor> I have had thoughts like that. </connor>
<connor> But I never actually like... </connor>
<connor> - Put it into practice. </connor>
<connor> - Even when I think, "Oh, I could just die </connor>
<garnt> if there was a guy standing
in my hallway with a knife." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't actually think
that he's gonna be there, </garnt>
<connor> but I check. </connor>
<connor> - You check just in case. </connor>
<connor> - But I know there's no way
in hell someone's there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But you just have to confirm it. </connor>
<connor> I also get that every now and again, </connor>
<connor> where it's the most irrational thoughts, </connor>
<connor> where sometimes there's, </connor>
<connor> you close the door and you're like, </connor>
<joey> "Maybe there's a guy on the other side. </joey>
<joey> Maybe there's someone
in my house right now." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Especially in the nighttime, </joey>
<joey> and you hear something in
the middle of the night, </joey>
<joey> in your living room or something. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "I know
there's nothing in my house, </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - But what if? </garnt>
<joey> - What was that? </joey>
<garnt> - What if? I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> "I'm pretty sure there's
no ghosts in my house." </connor>
<connor> I'm confident in my belief of ghosts </connor>
<connor> that this place isn't haunted or whatever, </connor>
<connor> even if there might be </connor>
<connor> some haunted places in the world, </connor>
<connor> but I'm pretty sure this
place isn't haunted, </connor>
<connor> but then what the fuck was that noise? </connor>
<connor> It could be the wind.
Definitely not the wind. </connor>
<connor> No, definitely the wind. </connor>
<connor> Definitely not the wind. Could be. </connor>
<connor> You start second-guessing yourself. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. I feel that, </garnt>
<joey> especially recently with
some horror games I played, </joey>
<connor> I feel that just resurfaced. </connor>
<connor> It's not until you recently
consume content like that </connor>
<connor> that you start to realize, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yeah. I think I'm
still afraid of this shit." </connor>
<joey> I remember after I played
"P.T." for the first time, </joey>
<joey> that made me so... </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Hallways, lights on. </joey>
<joey> Everywhere I go. I'm not
turning this shit off. </joey>
<joey> Fuck that." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's so irrational. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Of course she's
not gonna be standing there </joey>
<joey> at the end of the hallway." </joey>
<joey> - Do you ever get the irrational fear </joey>
<connor> that someone who's close
to you is not okay, </connor>
<garnt> and then you just text
them, like, "Are you okay?" </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I get that. I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like, "I had this weird dream. </garnt>
<connor> Just checking in that you're all right." </connor>
<joey> - It's like, "You haven't
texted me in a while. </joey>
<joey> We good? You good?" </joey>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Sometimes I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you go to a night out </joey>
<joey> or hang out with someone,
and you're just like, </joey>
<garnt> "They said 10 words less
than what they usually said. </garnt>
<joey> Maybe there's something going on." </joey>
<joey> - "They were blinking
a lot more than usual." </joey>
<connor> - They were signaling something. </connor>
<connor> - Morse code, maybe? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think part of the reason </garnt>
<garnt> why I have so many lights on in my house </garnt>
<garnt> is because of irrational fears like this. </garnt>
<joey> My mom would bollock me as a kid, </joey>
<joey> 'cause every time my mom
and dad would go out, </joey>
<joey> they'd come home to a
house full of lights. </joey>
<joey> They were like, "Garnt,
stop wasting electricity!" </joey>
<connor> For the longest time, </connor>
<connor> I think they just thought I would forget </connor>
<connor> to turn off the lights. </connor>
<connor> I never just told them, "No,
I'm just actually scared. </connor>
<connor> But what if there's darkness? </connor>
<connor> And what if there's something </connor>
<connor> hiding in that darkness, Mom? </connor>
<garnt> You don't know. I'm in
this house by myself." </garnt>
<connor> - In "Squid Game", they died in the dark. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - You never know. </garnt>
<garnt> What if "Squid Game"
just happens in your room </garnt>
<joey> while you're sleeping? </joey>
<joey> You have to start defending yourself. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Try "Squid Game". </joey>
<connor> - So Trash Tastes camping. </connor>
<connor> It's when the lights went off. </connor>
<connor> - When the fire went out. </connor>
<connor> Everyone was like... </connor>
<connor> - Get to the corner! </connor>
<joey> - Closest weapon. </joey>
<garnt> - I did come to the realization, </garnt>
<garnt> not the realization, </garnt>
<connor> but the appreciation of lights. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Especially camping. Especially camping. </connor>
<connor> You really do appreciate lights and fire. </connor>
<connor> - The appreciation of light. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - You know, heat is pretty good. </connor>
<connor> Being warm is a vital part of life. </connor>
<garnt> - Light's pretty underrated. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Just some things you just... </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, clothes is
actually pretty useful. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Honestly, they're pretty hot. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no shit they are, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just saying, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never appreciated a hot shower more </garnt>
<joey> than after we came back
from that camping trip. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor and Joey] True. </joey>
<joey> - I could just turn on the hot water </joey>
<joey> and immediately just warm myself up. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, "Damn, man. </joey>
<joey> This shower is hitting different. </joey>
<joey> It is hitting different, man." </joey>
<joey> - That was the best shower
and sleep I had, though, </joey>
<garnt> when we came back. It was so good. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I actually think that
fixed my sleeping schedule, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've been getting
up at a reasonable time. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Dude, I knocked out at like
9:00 PM. I was so done. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, "I'm not
staying up. Fuck that." </joey>
<garnt> - Anything else you guys
wanna bring up or anything? </garnt>
<joey> - Nope. Just wanna let you
know that, no clickbait. </joey>
<joey> In this episode, we did
actually almost die twice. </joey>
<connor> Three times, if you include </connor>
<connor> the surprise attack from the bush. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt was this close to death </connor>
<connor> from a surprise Jason. </connor>
<joey> - Almost died from getting
scared by his own piss stream. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just saying, I love you, cuz, </garnt>
<garnt> but fuck you at the same time </garnt>
<joey> for literally giving me... </joey>
<joey> - You have an asshole cousin. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's so cruel. </connor>
<garnt> - I love my cousin. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was he a teenager? </garnt>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<garnt> - Was he a teenager? </garnt>
<connor> - He's seven years older
than me. So he's... </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, a teenager.
That's the asshole part. </joey>
<joey> - He's the closest thing I
have to an older brother, </joey>
<joey> and thinking back, that's a
very older brother thing to do. </joey>
<joey> - That is a very older
brother thing to do. </joey>
<joey> - I love you, cuz. </joey>
<joey> You are like an older brother to me, </joey>
<joey> but also fuck you for showing me </joey>
<garnt> all those horror movies as a kid. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, it's so terrifying. </connor>
<connor> - I remember one thing, </connor>
<connor> for some reason that sticks out my mind, </connor>
<connor> my older brother teaching me was like, </connor>
<connor> "You know what socks are for, right?" </connor>
<connor> I was like, "No, what are socks for?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "To clean up the messes </connor>
<connor> that you spill on the floor." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Oh, what?
That makes a lot of sense." </connor>
<joey> Like when you're holding a cup of tea </joey>
<joey> and you spill it on the floor. </joey>
<joey> - You just step on it? </joey>
<joey> - Step on it. Just use your sock. </joey>
<joey> I was like... </joey>
<joey> - I dunno if that's the dumbest thing ever </joey>
<joey> or if it's an actual life-hack. </joey>
<connor> - And I was like, "You know
what? That's kind of big brain." </connor>
<joey> - It's kind of big brain. </joey>
<joey> - If it's not a big spill. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, if it's big, don't
just start putting your... </joey>
<joey> - That's an awful piece of advice. </joey>
<connor> - No, it's not. It's a
little bit. Little spill. </connor>
<garnt> - If you have some thick socks, too. </garnt>
<connor> - There is nothing worse than wet socks. </connor>
<connor> - Well, for like a brief
moment. Your body heat... </connor>
<garnt> - How much water are we talking about? </garnt>
<connor> - A tiny bit of spillage, like
a cup of tea or something. </connor>
<joey> - Then you rub it on the carpet </joey>
<joey> to warm it up and dry it off. </joey>
<garnt> - If it's a spill that
you can actually feel </garnt>
<joey> on your foot, on the sole of your foot. </joey>
<garnt> - I do, for a brief moment. </garnt>
<connor> I still do it to this day. </connor>
<garnt> - But hey, the floor's clean. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like kicking ice under the fridge. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - When you spill ice, you
kick it under the fridge. </connor>
<joey> The ice thing. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I don't do it
anymore, but I used to. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't you put it in the sink? </garnt>
<connor> - If you drop the ice
while you're popping it. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it depends on
how much ice comes out. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, two or three cubes. </connor>
<garnt> Just kind of. </garnt>
<joey> - Get it under there. </joey>
<connor> - Just kick it under. </connor>
<joey> - Just damage the floor, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Did your brother teach you that as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I did that myself. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what you're gonna teach your kid </garnt>
<garnt> when you get home. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hope my kid never watches Trash Taste. </garnt>
<joey> - "Son, five-minute
life-hack, kick the ice." </joey>
<connor> - This is a Trash Taste life-hack. </connor>
<connor> - This is reverse
life-hacks, you shouldn't do. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You think I'm gonna ruin
FamilyMart socks like that? </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - You're gonna put them in the wash after. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - That's 'cause you have white. </connor>
<connor> I only have black socks. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's your
life-hack right there. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, just buy black socks. Don't think. </connor>
<garnt> - Does that mean you don't
own FamilyMart socks? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I don't. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey tsks) </garnt>
<connor> - I'm fine with not doing that. </connor>
<connor> I'm happy with my socks. </connor>
<connor> I like having black socks.
I don't have to think. </connor>
<joey> - If FamilyMart brought
out a black sock variant. </joey>
<joey> - Then I might. </joey>
<joey> - FamilyMart, I hope you're listening. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you do need some black socks. </joey>
<joey> Joey? Joey? </joey>
<joey> Looking at you, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - What? I have black socks. </joey>
<connor> - I know. You just never wear them. </connor>
<connor> - I never wear them. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I swear to God, every
picture that's been taken </connor>
<garnt> within the past month, I see
FamilyMart socks poking out, </garnt>
<joey> no matter the outfit. </joey>
<joey> - I deadass have about nine
pairs of FamilyMart socks, </joey>
<joey> and I just cycle through it every week. </joey>
<connor> - Their poor supplier of
socks is working overtime. </connor>
<joey> - Dude. They're amazing. </joey>
<connor> - Poor factory workers. </connor>
<joey> - Please bring out a black pair. </joey>
<connor> - Working overtime to have to
sustain Joey's sock demand. </connor>
<joey> - Just going back to a random thing, </joey>
<joey> I gotta ask you. </joey>
<garnt> So you hear something in
the living room, right? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe you're half asleep.
How does Aki handle that? </joey>
<garnt> - She's like, "Go to the living room." </garnt>
<joey> - She asked you to check it? </joey>
<joey> - She's like, "Sweetie,
can you go check it?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Woman, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> Why am I the one to go? </joey>
<joey> You're the one that's curious. You go." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I hate it. </garnt>
<connor> Because I'm not scared
until they ask me to check, </connor>
<connor> and I feel like their fear
gets transferred over to me. </connor>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Before that I was just like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, I guess something knocked
over in the living room." </connor>
<joey> - Just a piece of wind. </joey>
<joey> Then I hear, "Garnt!
Garnt, I hear something. </joey>
<joey> I hear something in the living room. </joey>
<joey> Garnt, go check it. Garnt." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Sydney, it's probably nothing." </joey>
<joey> "Garnt, I need you to go check it now." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Fuck me." </joey>
<joey> Now that I'm going to
check, now I'm like... </joey>
<joey> - Then "Resident Evil" music
starts playing in my head. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Oh my God, </joey>
<joey> there's a zombie in the living room." </joey>
<joey> - Then I have to, </joey>
<joey> if I'm going to check the living room, </joey>
<connor> even if I know it's nothing, </connor>
<connor> I have to find a possible
weapon, just in case. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Just in case. Just in case, you know? </connor>
<joey> I have to find something that I can smack </joey>
<joey> a possible animal or person with. </joey>
<joey> Just in case. </joey>
<connor> - Just in case. </connor>
<connor> - An animal? </connor>
<garnt> - You don't know what it could be. </garnt>
<garnt> - Smack a ghost. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it's an animal, I'm near certain </garnt>
<joey> you would hear a lot more noise. </joey>
<garnt> It would probably be breaking everything. </garnt>
<joey> - Maybe they're sneaky. I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - That's how I discovered
the cockroach from last week. </garnt>
<connor> - Do your houses have chimneys? </connor>
<connor> You ever slept in a house with a chimney? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - They make a lot of noise. </connor>
<connor> - Do they? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Unsettling noises. </garnt>
<garnt> - Howling. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had, </garnt>
<connor> I did live in house with
the chimney as a kid, </connor>
<connor> and it was blocked up, </connor>
<garnt> but it still made like the
(imitates wind howling). </garnt>
<connor> - When it's open, the
noises that those make </connor>
<joey> are fucking terrifying. </joey>
<connor> Like a wolf howling all the time. </connor>
<connor> (Joey howls) </connor>
<connor> - It's literally the
stereotypical ghost noise. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It could be pretty scary sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - What if it's not the wind? </connor>
<joey> What if it's just a bunch of ghosts? </joey>
<joey> - It could be. </joey>
<joey> - "Let me in." </joey>
<connor> "It's cold." </connor>
<connor> - It's from all the
ghosts from all the Garnts </connor>
<connor> that got killed in bushes. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor makes shivering ghost noise) </joey>
<connor> - I need the statistics of how many people </connor>
<connor> have been killed while
pissing next to a bush. </connor>
<connor> I just need to put my mind at ease. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna bet that most of the deaths </connor>
<connor> are from electric fences
and them peeing on them </connor>
<joey> or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Probably something like that, </joey>
<connor> or an animal coming out or something, </connor>
<connor> like a bear coming out. </connor>
<joey> - Animals comes through.
"What do you want?" </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. That's what
I'm worried about, Joey. </joey>
<joey> I'm worried about an animal
coming out or something. </joey>
<connor> - You'll hear it. You'll hear it. </connor>
<connor> - You'll hear it. </connor>
<connor> - If it's big enough to kill you, </connor>
<connor> you will hear it. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not gonna be like, "Mah." </joey>
<joey> - Okay, but how do I distinguish </joey>
<joey> between an animal ruffling the bushes </joey>
<joey> and just the wind? </joey>
<garnt> - The wind is very different. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's very different. </garnt>
<connor> - The wind is constant, </connor>
<joey> but an animal is like
(loud skittering sound). </joey>
<garnt> - You will see it violently moving. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You'll see it. </garnt>
<connor> Even though you are there,
you'll see it on the top. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, man. </garnt>
<connor> "Jurassic Park" has taught me different. </connor>
<connor> - "Jurassic Park" ain't shit, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> It's a great movie, </connor>
<connor> but it's not giving you survival tips. </connor>
<joey> - I don't go out into the bush and think, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, shit. What if a
Velociraptor comes out?" </joey>
<joey> - You think you'll find Jason in Hokkaido? </joey>
<joey> - Could be. I'm used to England, man. </joey>
<garnt> We have nothing to be
scared of in England. </garnt>
<garnt> Whenever I'm in another country... </garnt>
<garnt> - Japanese policeman, </garnt>
<garnt> randomly stopping you in
the middle of a field, </garnt>
<connor> asking you to be checked, as opposed to... </connor>
<joey> - I have an irrational
fear of Japanese policeman </joey>
<connor> coming out of the bush. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you can't be here." </connor>
<joey> - You have more chance
of a Japanese policeman </joey>
<joey> stopping you from peeing in a bush </joey>
<connor> than you do from an animal
or something killing you. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather get arrested </connor>
<garnt> than violently murdered by an animal, man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I'm saying. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't want to be
caught with your dick down </garnt>
<connor> and a flashlight shining on you. </connor>
<connor> That is not what you want. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That is true. </garnt>
<garnt> That's been our irrational
fears on Trash Taste today. </garnt>
<joey> - You know who hasn't died
from peeing in the bush? </joey>
<joey> Our patrons. </joey>
<connor> - Or they have been. We don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Look at all these people. </joey>
<garnt> Look at all these people
that haven't almost died. </garnt>
<connor> Maybe you have, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. Maybe something. </connor>
<connor> Maybe you've escaped death. </connor>
<garnt> - The backseat of the car. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tell us your near-death experiences </garnt>
<connor> in the comments down below. </connor>
<garnt> - Also, tell us your irrational fears. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you check the backseat
of the car before going in? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you check underneath the car? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Garnt's trying to find some way. </joey>
<joey> - Please. Please, I can't be the only one. </joey>
<joey> I can't be the only one </joey>
<joey> who has a weird ritual in my life </joey>
<garnt> just because of some movie I saw as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> that I can't forget. </garnt>
