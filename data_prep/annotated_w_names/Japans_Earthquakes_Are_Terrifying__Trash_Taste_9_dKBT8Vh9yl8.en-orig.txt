<joey> together we are the boys the boys </joey>
<joey> that was had to be one of the best </joey>
<connor> intros yeah i just you know when you </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you're auto piloting the intro and then </connor>
<connor> you just realize halfway through that </connor>
<connor> you're auto piloting the intro </connor>
<connor> you're like taking it over and you're </connor>
<garnt> like oh wait i should have just ordered </garnt>
<garnt> because like being on a podcast </garnt>
<garnt> um normally if i'm having a normal </garnt>
<audio> conversation sometimes and i know like </audio>
<audio> i know sometimes i know what when i </audio>
<audio> start a sentence i know how i'm going to </audio>
<audio> end the sentence but when you're on a </audio>
<audio> podcast </audio>
<audio> you always have to finish the sentence </audio>
<garnt> even if you kind of realize halfway </garnt>
<joey> through that you're not yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm just i'm just like okay i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> have to say something because i've been </joey>
<joey> silent </joey>
<garnt> for the past two minutes but i don't </garnt>
<joey> know how to start it or how to end it </joey>
<connor> where this is going </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right you're </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> so gentlemen i thought considering i i </connor>
<connor> believe we all watched </connor>
<connor> japan sinks recently a nice little </connor>
<connor> quinky dink there </connor>
<garnt> we all watched it separately i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> know you guys were watching it we all </garnt>
<connor> didn't we didn't make an effort to all </connor>
<connor> watch it we were all just like </connor>
<joey> oh we all just watched we all just </joey>
<joey> turned on netflix and it's like oh </joey>
<joey> okay it came out recently of the time of </joey>
<garnt> recording but so by the time you're </garnt>
<garnt> seeing this microphone </garnt>
<connor> like three or four days ago yeah </connor>
<audio> something like that yeah yeah for us um </audio>
<connor> but so to explain what uh japan is </connor>
<audio> uh since we're gonna be doing uh some </audio>
<audio> kind of discussion around it </audio>
<audio> it's the new masaki yuasa anime that was </audio>
<garnt> released on netflix </garnt>
<garnt> and it's basically about a giant </garnt>
<garnt> earthquake that happens in japan </garnt>
<garnt> um and after that earthquake happened </garnt>
<garnt> japan starts sinking i guess </garnt>
<joey> yeah so for people living in japan it is </joey>
<joey> anxiety </joey>
<connor> the anime essentially dude okay first of </connor>
<connor> all before we get into talking it the </connor>
<connor> in the very first episode they play the </connor>
<joey> actual the sound </joey>
<garnt> they play this sound that you're hearing </garnt>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> did we like i don't know if i changed my </joey>
<connor> phone yeah i checked my phone </connor>
<connor> i was like where's my phone and i turned </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] down because i was like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what if my neighbor's here </connor>
<garnt> they start freaking out like they're </garnt>
<connor> gonna think there's an actual earthquake </connor>
<garnt> the elderly you know below me yeah [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> that made me [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> that gave me so much anxiety the first </garnt>
<joey> episode of them portraying </joey>
<joey> the earthquake happening i was really </joey>
<joey> impressed that </joey>
<joey> how realistic it felt you know what i </joey>
<joey> mean because </joey>
<connor> i probably would have would have reacted </connor>
<connor> the exact same way it was all the </connor>
<connor> characters right </connor>
<connor> you know when you hear that earthquake </connor>
<connor> like notification now </connor>
<connor> and then you just kind of block it out </connor>
<connor> you're like oh whatever it's probably </connor>
<connor> yeah it's probably a small earthquake </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<garnt> once you've been through about 10 </garnt>
<garnt> earthquakes in japan which you will yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which which you will </garnt>
<garnt> you just you just you hear this </garnt>
<garnt> notification and it's just like another </garnt>
<joey> day of the </joey>
<joey> unfortunately though every time at least </joey>
<joey> i have heard that notification it's </joey>
<garnt> never been the case of ah </garnt>
<garnt> whatever it's probably just a small </garnt>
<garnt> earthquake because it always happens at </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> five in the morning yeah and it's the </garnt>
<garnt> thing i wake up to </garnt>
<garnt> imagine just having you're just having a </garnt>
<garnt> nice sleep </garnt>
<garnt> wherever you are and it's like 4 30 in </garnt>
<garnt> the morning and then suddenly you </garnt>
<joey> hear this absolutely anxiety-reducing </joey>
<garnt> alarm because </garnt>
<garnt> you just hear the siren but they don't </garnt>
<garnt> say like if it's strong </garnt>
<garnt> yeah if it's weak it just says he just </garnt>
<garnt> says brace yourself yeah </garnt>
<garnt> just basically brace yourself hold on to </garnt>
<garnt> your butt </garnt>
<joey> it might be strong and it's i already </joey>
<joey> hate waking up to the sound of an alarm </joey>
<connor> but when it's an alarm where it's like </connor>
<connor> oh i might die </connor>
<connor> yeah then it's it's the worst </connor>
<connor> i i had i was enjoying the first episode </connor>
<connor> so much because again there was this you </connor>
<connor> know as you said </connor>
<joey> it's a really realistic portrayal yeah </joey>
<joey> but the moment i hear that sound i just </joey>
<connor> i don't know i don't get anxiety often </connor>
<connor> but i went like the caveman spongebob </connor>
<connor> they do it like three times yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> would stop doing this </connor>
<connor> please use a like parody noise like </connor>
<joey> something like </joey>
<joey> could you imagine though like especially </joey>
<connor> in that first episode you know when that </connor>
<connor> second </connor>
<connor> big wave yeah yeah do you think </connor>
<joey> something like that </joey>
<connor> is going to happen well didn't they it's </connor>
<connor> like a lot of again i should have done </connor>
<connor> research for this episode but i swear </connor>
<connor> there's been a few scientific </connor>
<joey> predictions that are like there's going </joey>
<joey> to be a mega quake within like 30 or 50 </joey>
<joey> years </joey>
<joey> something like that i mean there has to </joey>
<joey> be right because yeah i mean we the </joey>
<audio> [ __ ] planet's like no planets the the </audio>
<audio> country's all pangaead away right that </audio>
<garnt> doesn't just happen </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah yeah there has to be stuff </garnt>
<connor> that's moving constantly so yeah and </connor>
<garnt> there's like </garnt>
<connor> something big is gonna happen inevitably </connor>
<connor> whether it's in our lifetime or like a </connor>
<connor> children's lifetime or [ __ ] great </connor>
<connor> great great grandchildren's lifetime </connor>
<connor> it's going to happen </connor>
<connor> somewhere like a mega quake like a mega </connor>
<connor> quake you know it's it's an interesting </connor>
<garnt> idea to explore that there's probably </garnt>
<joey> going to be </joey>
<garnt> some massive kind of event that's going </garnt>
<joey> to happen </joey>
<joey> sometime in there is there like i don't </joey>
<joey> know about i'm sure thailand has </joey>
<joey> earthquakes right </joey>
<garnt> not really i mean i think japan is </garnt>
<connor> literally on the fault line yeah the </connor>
<connor> whole </connor>
<connor> country is on your fault like okay do </connor>
<garnt> you guys remember your very first </garnt>
<joey> earthquake experience yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> that was because okay we're from the uk </connor>
<garnt> yeah it is literally the safest place on </garnt>
<joey> earth yeah yeah i was about to say you </joey>
<garnt> guys don't get earthquakes right yeah no </garnt>
<garnt> no we're like we are like the furthest </garnt>
<garnt> away from like any fault line of like </garnt>
<garnt> any country </garnt>
<garnt> like we like natural disasters in the uk </garnt>
<connor> is like non-existent it's like running </connor>
<connor> out of tea </connor>
<garnt> england is so [ __ ] safe you have to </garnt>
<garnt> try really hard </garnt>
<connor> to get yourself killed in england by </connor>
<connor> nature </connor>
<audio> because australia we don't have </audio>
<garnt> earthquakes at all or anything </garnt>
<audio> but everything else would just be we </audio>
<audio> have you know bushfires and stuff like </audio>
<connor> that and of course our </connor>
<connor> animals are just out for blood but you </connor>
<joey> guys don't even have dangerous animals </joey>
<connor> right no we don't right that's why i'm </connor>
<connor> convinced there's so many like famous </connor>
<connor> british explorers because they must have </connor>
<connor> been so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] bored of the uk like oh it's </connor>
<connor> another [ __ ] squirrel </connor>
<audio> talking to americans and canadians who </audio>
<connor> go camping and they have to worry about </connor>
<audio> bears and stuff like that and </audio>
<connor> i remember going camping in england and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like oh yeah like i guess we </connor>
<garnt> have to worry about deers </garnt>
<garnt> i guess deers can be dangerous and i </garnt>
<connor> feel like the biggest worry in the uk is </connor>
<garnt> how much alcohol do i bring </garnt>
<joey> like how much alcohol is the right </joey>
<joey> amount of alcohol how much alcohol and </joey>
<joey> toilet paper do i bring </joey>
<joey> yeah that's always the worry it's like i </joey>
<joey> gotta carry two liters of water </joey>
<garnt> ten liters of alcohol so we gotta try </garnt>
<garnt> and bounce this out </garnt>
<garnt> now yeah i don't know i remember my very </garnt>
<audio> first earthquake experience wasn't in </audio>
<audio> japan it was actually </audio>
<audio> in america during ax oh yeah </audio>
<garnt> it's 28 well not last year now yeah oh </garnt>
<connor> no it is last yeah last </connor>
<connor> year yeah last year's ax so 2019 ax and </connor>
<audio> i remember </audio>
<audio> i remember the first one yeah that was </audio>
<joey> like my very first really </joey>
<joey> yeah wow so yeah to explain when we were </joey>
<joey> at ax last year we went through a </joey>
<garnt> magnitude is it seven it was like </garnt>
<connor> six or seven but it was far away so it </connor>
<connor> wasn't awful but it was still </connor>
<garnt> i mean we were it still is the strongest </garnt>
<connor> earthquake i've been </connor>
<joey> in even after moving japan yeah and i </joey>
<connor> remember i was on like the </connor>
<joey> 64. and it's it's </joey>
<audio> it was like such a humbling experience </audio>
<audio> because at first </audio>
<audio> i didn't know what was going on because </audio>
<joey> i i i i remember standing up and i felt </joey>
<joey> a bit dizzy </joey>
<joey> and i was like what the [ __ ] going on </joey>
<joey> am i just like really fatigued am i </joey>
<joey> hungover what's going on </joey>
<joey> so i go i go up to the window right just </joey>
<garnt> imagine you're going up to the window on </garnt>
<garnt> the 64th floor of a skyscraper </garnt>
<garnt> and then you look down and then you see </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] building just shift yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like that and it was just like this </garnt>
<garnt> like i immediately i've never felt </garnt>
<garnt> vertical </garnt>
<garnt> so fast and i immediately just pinned </garnt>
<garnt> myself against the wall </garnt>
<garnt> just being like [ __ ] [ __ ] this is an </garnt>
<garnt> earthquake </garnt>
<garnt> i'm surprised you had the balls to go </garnt>
<garnt> towards the window </garnt>
<garnt> because i didn't know it was an </garnt>
<garnt> earthquake i just thought i was just </garnt>
<garnt> dizzy </garnt>
<connor> or drunk or something i mean the first </connor>
<connor> one because there was like </connor>
<connor> three that weekend yeah no that was two </connor>
<joey> two two in the </joey>
<joey> it was in the same day yeah so the first </joey>
<connor> one i was in the elevator while it was </connor>
<connor> happening </connor>
<connor> and the elevator was shaking a lot more </connor>
<joey> than i thought it should have been </joey>
<joey> shaking </joey>
<joey> and i'm pretty sure there's a japanese </joey>
<joey> woman in there who was from one of the </joey>
<joey> stanzas yeah </joey>
<joey> and she looked [ __ ] terrified oh yeah </joey>
<connor> and i was like </connor>
<connor> we're nearly near the bottom i'm sure </connor>
<connor> it'll be fine </connor>
<connor> we're like 10 floors i'm sure we got </connor>
<joey> this but then the second one was i was </joey>
<joey> with you yeah yeah that was so </joey>
<connor> funny do you want to tell that story you </connor>
<joey> used to tell you okay okay </joey>
<joey> so the second earthquake that happened i </joey>
<joey> think it was only maybe a couple of </joey>
<joey> hours after wasn't it yeah yeah i think </joey>
<connor> it was like rushed to your hotel room </connor>
<connor> because i was busy </connor>
<joey> that's right that was like that night </joey>
<garnt> yeah it was it was you me aki and our </garnt>
<connor> friend nabi </connor>
<garnt> and we were just chilling in our hotel </garnt>
<connor> room we were just talking about what we </connor>
<connor> were going to do that night because i </connor>
<connor> think </connor>
<connor> we're going to a party we're going to go </connor>
<garnt> to a party and so we were just chilling </garnt>
<garnt> before the party started </garnt>
<garnt> and you know the second earthquake comes </garnt>
<joey> through and it was i think it was </joey>
<joey> stronger than the first one wasn't it i </joey>
<joey> think so something like that but either </joey>
<joey> way very strong like at least magnitude </joey>
<joey> six </joey>
<garnt> from what i remember i think it was 7.1 </garnt>
<joey> though i think that was the seven wasn't </joey>
<joey> it yeah </joey>
<joey> and uh and of course it was an </joey>
<audio> earthquake i'm used to it uh </audio>
<audio> obviously everybody else wasn't yeah so </audio>
<audio> we quickly ran out and we were at the </audio>
<joey> very very top of the thing was like the </joey>
<joey> 68th or 69th yeah or something of that </joey>
<garnt> of that hotel </garnt>
<garnt> and and even amidst all the panic </garnt>
<connor> connor and my friend navi they were </connor>
<connor> eating uh i was thinking chick-fil-a </connor>
<connor> chick-fil-a </connor>
<connor> like chick-fil-a nuggets and connor and </connor>
<connor> nabi just kind of looked at each other </connor>
<joey> and went </joey>
<joey> well if i'm gonna die might as well </joey>
<joey> finish off these nuggets </joey>
<connor> like everyone was panicking i remember </connor>
<connor> there was literally that like </connor>
<connor> stereotypical american family there's </connor>
<connor> one dude one like white guy with like </connor>
<connor> three </connor>
<connor> daughters like get get down to the floor </connor>
<connor> get down to the bottom floor dardis i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna i'm gonna direct you and i'm there </connor>
<connor> with like my nuggets walking past him </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<garnt> if i'm gonna die at least i'm gonna die </garnt>
<connor> with nugs in my hands </connor>
<connor> rushing down the stairs we got like 20 </connor>
<connor> floors down and i was like i'm not you </connor>
<connor> know what </connor>
<connor> i i don't want to do any more physical </connor>
<connor> exercises i think </connor>
<connor> i think i've done enough so yeah i did a </connor>
<connor> move which is probably not a pro gamer </connor>
<connor> move i was like you know what </connor>
<connor> the shaking stopped like two minutes ago </connor>
<connor> i'ma get the elevator </connor>
<connor> there is 50 more floors and i would </connor>
<connor> rather die literally than get these </connor>
<connor> stairs </connor>
<garnt> and i went to the elevator but the weird </garnt>
<garnt> configuration of this hotel </garnt>
<garnt> you had to go back to the top yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so that means then i was like all </garnt>
<garnt> right well the elevators are still </garnt>
<garnt> working they should have been stopped </garnt>
<garnt> they were still working so i was like </garnt>
<garnt> okay so i go back from the 50th floor </garnt>
<joey> which i just walked down </joey>
<joey> from the 70th i walked all the way down </joey>
<joey> and i was like okay i'm going to go back </joey>
<joey> up to the 70th floor </joey>
<joey> i go to get the elevator to go all the </joey>
<joey> way down and they're blocking it off </joey>
<joey> yeah like you can't go until it's safe </joey>
<connor> and i'm like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] me well our other friend was just </joey>
<connor> like [ __ ] i'm gonna walk </connor>
<connor> all the way down all the way down he's </connor>
<connor> just waiting at the bottom and he calls </connor>
<joey> me he's like </joey>
<connor> where are you are you guys alive yeah </connor>
<joey> because i convinced them i'm like listen </joey>
<joey> guys you guys can keep walking i'm </joey>
<joey> getting the elevator and then they were </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> okay yeah i was like oh great we're back </joey>
<joey> i guess we </joey>
<joey> ran down 24's for no reason it was so </joey>
<connor> scary though because i remember </connor>
<connor> like i was a little i wasn't worried </connor>
<connor> because you know the doors were closing </connor>
<audio> and opening on their own i thought </audio>
<audio> that's okay i can deal with that </audio>
<audio> what i didn't like anticipate was when i </audio>
<garnt> looked out the building i could </garnt>
<garnt> literally see the </garnt>
<garnt> building opposite us we were going like </garnt>
<garnt> this yeah yeah like parallaxing yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah and i was like </connor>
<garnt> oh that's not right like </garnt>
<garnt> buildings shouldn't do that because i </garnt>
<garnt> remember it was it was like to me </garnt>
<garnt> it was a really humbling experience just </garnt>
<garnt> at that moment </garnt>
<garnt> i was like my life is not in my own </garnt>
<garnt> hands yeah like if this building </garnt>
<garnt> collapses </garnt>
<joey> there is literally nothing i can do </joey>
<joey> because you know when you feel like </joey>
<joey> something bad happens you feel like you </joey>
<joey> have some </joey>
<joey> some kind of control like you might see </joey>
<joey> a car coming and you you think you know </joey>
<joey> maybe i can jump out of the way of this </joey>
<joey> there was like if the building was just </joey>
<joey> like logically i knew this building was </joey>
<joey> designed </joey>
<joey> to withstand earthquakes but in my heart </joey>
<connor> i was like okay at this moment i'm just </connor>
<connor> putting my faith in the engineers and </connor>
<connor> the builders </connor>
<connor> that they've done their job [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> correctly because if they haven't i'm </connor>
<connor> dead </connor>
<connor> and there's literally nothing i can do </connor>
<connor> about it </connor>
<connor> and i i i guess that was like a first </connor>
<garnt> for me you know i i i'd never been in </garnt>
<garnt> that kind of situation where i had just </garnt>
<garnt> my my life was in the was in the hands </garnt>
<garnt> of like completely something some other </garnt>
<joey> external to be fair i've experienced a </joey>
<joey> lot of earthquakes in my life but </joey>
<connor> being on the 69th 17th floor was </connor>
<connor> definitely a first for me yeah </connor>
<connor> you know i've been on you know apart </connor>
<connor> i've been in apartment buildings that </connor>
<connor> are like </connor>
<connor> 10 20 floors high and that was still </connor>
<connor> scary because again the whole thing is </connor>
<connor> shaking i </connor>
<connor> have to keep telling myself it's good </connor>
<connor> that it's shaking it's good that it's </connor>
<connor> shaking </connor>
<connor> um but my first i think the scariest </connor>
<joey> earthquake experience i had was uh it </joey>
<joey> was in japan obviously </joey>
<joey> um and it was up north where my grandma </joey>
<joey> lives right um and it was where </joey>
<connor> you know the giant earthquake of 2011 </connor>
<connor> hit essentially so that is </connor>
<connor> that place is like a hot spot yeah </connor>
<connor> massive earthquakes um </connor>
<connor> and uh and i was there i was in some </connor>
<connor> kind of </connor>
<connor> like uh dvd rental place </connor>
<connor> like a really old dvd rental place near </connor>
<connor> there with my sister and </connor>
<connor> suddenly i think it was like an </connor>
<connor> magnitude seven and a half or something </connor>
<connor> like that </connor>
<connor> really really big it was so big in fact </connor>
<joey> that all of the dvds and books on the </joey>
<joey> shelves just </joey>
<joey> flew out oh wow and me and i had to like </joey>
<joey> grab my sister's hand and just [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> get the </joey>
<joey> hell out of there wow and but we </joey>
<joey> couldn't go all the way out because the </joey>
<joey> shop assistant was like don't go out </joey>
<joey> into the street because if </joey>
<audio> the street if a [ __ ] falls then you're </audio>
<connor> dead yeah so we had to kind of </connor>
<connor> stand in the door frame or the shop and </connor>
<connor> just kind of </connor>
<connor> wait for it to settle down and yeah that </connor>
<joey> was definitely a lot scarier because </joey>
<connor> being on i thought being on a building </connor>
<joey> was scary being on the ground floor </joey>
<connor> like on the street in something that big </connor>
<joey> is really scary because people running </joey>
<joey> out and i thought that's kind of dumb </joey>
<joey> because the building's </joey>
<joey> really safe yeah yeah yeah running out </joey>
<garnt> you don't know what kid like </garnt>
<garnt> exactly if a traffic light or a you know </garnt>
<joey> a street light </joey>
<joey> falls on you then you know i think it's </joey>
<joey> that sense of control </joey>
<joey> you know that you think you have even </joey>
<garnt> though statistically you you are </garnt>
<garnt> actually safer in the building yeah </garnt>
<connor> the buildings are designed at least the </connor>
<connor> newer ones i think like i mean that was </connor>
<connor> a </connor>
<connor> really big hotel and it's they're mainly </connor>
<joey> designed for like 13 magnitude </joey>
<connor> earthquakes </connor>
<joey> yeah like they're pretty [ __ ] sturdy </joey>
<joey> speaking of sense of control though </joey>
<joey> uh the characters in japan sinks have </joey>
<garnt> none </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god can we go back to that yeah no </garnt>

<joey> when she started to get a bit windy </joey>
<garnt> later on can i can i okay to get my to </garnt>
<garnt> get my opinions </garnt>
<garnt> out of the way um what do you guys think </garnt>
<connor> of the </connor>
<connor> series overall i'm glad that we finally </connor>
<connor> have some good propaganda for youtubers </connor>
<audio> i'm glad that </audio>
<audio> we need more youtube propaganda </audio>
<audio> youtubers are good </audio>
<garnt> more op youtubers dude i'm so glad i was </garnt>
<garnt> like wow he's a youtuber and he's not an </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] this is something no no no no </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> this is amazing okay so there's a </garnt>
<garnt> character in uh </garnt>
<garnt> in in japan sings that is just a </garnt>
<garnt> youtuber </garnt>
<garnt> and he's a youtuber who's a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> superhuman because he can do everything </connor>
<connor> he's magical </connor>
<garnt> we're just not gonna explain it </garnt>
<joey> the way that he enters in that [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> fan propelled </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah i know and he's just like yeah </garnt>
<joey> this is mine i bought it with my youtube </joey>
<joey> ad ram </joey>
<garnt> and it's like what videos are you </garnt>
<connor> uploading you're really telling me </connor>
<connor> you're going to film a video of okinawa </connor>
<garnt> sinking and that shit's going to be </garnt>
<garnt> monetized come on </garnt>
<connor> millions of people die they're monetized </connor>
<garnt> no way </garnt>
<garnt> can we just appreciate that the </garnt>
<garnt> character is basically felix pewdiepie </garnt>
<joey> he just like whiteheads </joey>
<garnt> it's like the idealized vision of </garnt>
<garnt> pewdiepie like this is </garnt>
<connor> this is his final form right just rocks </connor>
<garnt> we see pewdiepie i wouldn't be surprised </garnt>
<garnt> if he changes his profile picture to </garnt>
<garnt> that character next because it was ryo </garnt>
<connor> from yeah it's real it's real </connor>
<joey> it looks like rio yeah but i guess when </joey>
<joey> i saw that and as you said it was </joey>
<connor> probably one of the first times that a </connor>
<connor> youtuber has been kind of viewed in </connor>
<connor> a lot more positive life fashion it </connor>
<joey> really it goes to show me that i think </joey>
<joey> massachusetts is a fan of youtube yeah </joey>
<garnt> it just it just disappointed me that in </garnt>
<garnt> his final scene he didn't </garnt>
<garnt> he didn't send them off by going and </garnt>
<garnt> don't forget to like and subscribe </garnt>
<connor> yeah very unrealistic there was never a </connor>
<connor> poll </connor>
<audio> there was not one sponsorship right now </audio>
<audio> in the whole thing come on </audio>
<connor> no rage shadow i want to imagine </connor>
<joey> he comes in the trunk flying away like </joey>
<garnt> freezing half to death in the </garnt>
<connor> stratosphere and he's like </connor>
<garnt> spots my right shoulder </garnt>
<connor> out of 10 was it or was it good or bad </connor>
<joey> what are you guys okay </joey>
<joey> i'm not going to say that it was a 10. </joey>
<joey> i'm going to give it like a solid seven </joey>
<garnt> i thought it was like a four or five </garnt>
<garnt> really you didn't like it nah </garnt>
<connor> i didn't like it either okay here's his </connor>
<connor> i couldn't stop watching it </connor>
<connor> yeah but i i didn't so many things i </connor>
<garnt> hated </garnt>
<audio> right okay here's the thing this the way </audio>
<connor> this is like a proper mixed bag for me </connor>
<audio> yeah same the way i would describe it is </audio>
<connor> that it's a </connor>
<garnt> four out of ten series with uh some 10 </garnt>
<garnt> out of 10 scenes </garnt>
<garnt> okay it was really weird because some </garnt>
<garnt> scenes were [ __ ] amazing it was like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> peak yourself first two episodes </garnt>
<garnt> absolute bangers no exactly </garnt>
<garnt> right and like some of the scenes in </garnt>
<garnt> like the last two episodes absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> bangers as well like like the scene in </garnt>
<joey> the scenes with the youtuber and like </joey>
<joey> some some of the death scenes </joey>
<joey> oh the guy's running yeah yeah yeah i </joey>
<connor> think i don't i don't know what you </connor>
<garnt> asker has about that was amazing </garnt>
<connor> emotional running scenes yeah but it's </connor>
<connor> and the father's death </connor>
<joey> completely caught me off guard and i was </joey>
<joey> like oh cool the one character i liked </joey>
<connor> yeah is dead too i literally thought </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> wow this like after i finished episode </joey>
<joey> two i thought like this could be a 10 </joey>
<joey> out of 10 if they keep up with like how </joey>
<connor> good this is </connor>
<connor> and then and then we went into the </connor>
<connor> culture and they got to the cult and i </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> oh no this is awful this is actually </connor>
<joey> awful like </joey>
<joey> the the cult arc for me was so </joey>
<connor> bittersweet because as a massive fan of </connor>
<joey> us's stuff i'm like oh this is so young </joey>
<garnt> there's the scene what the [ __ ] was the </garnt>
<garnt> co-op </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] was it okay i gotta hit </garnt>
<garnt> the 360 no </garnt>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> i was just watching it dead serious and </connor>
<garnt> the kid just gets [ __ ] destroyed by </garnt>
<connor> this rock </connor>
<garnt> she just </garnt>
<garnt> it was so perfect comedic timing it was </garnt>
<garnt> just he turns around it's like </garnt>
<garnt> oh casa yeah it was like it was </garnt>
<garnt> like slapstick </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember i was like properly i </garnt>
<garnt> was properly invested in this </garnt>
<garnt> same my first two episodes i probably </garnt>
<garnt> probably invested and then like </garnt>
<garnt> some things just fell off like as as </garnt>
<joey> as the series went on right because like </joey>
<joey> i remember their father dying </joey>
<joey> and it was he'd he died in a really </joey>
<joey> horrific [ __ ] way </joey>
<joey> yeah and then nobody really just </joey>
<joey> acknowledged that they had like </joey>
<joey> just cuts doesn't it yeah they had like </joey>
<joey> one conversation it's like oh you you're </joey>
<joey> forgetting dad </joey>
<joey> and then they just like next scene like </joey>
<garnt> happy-go-lucky [ __ ] shopping </garnt>
<garnt> in in a supermarket i'm just like like </garnt>
<garnt> if if that was real </garnt>
<garnt> i wouldn't be able to say anything for </garnt>
<garnt> like the next five days yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> even think about it and yet for some </joey>
<joey> reason every other character that dies </joey>
<audio> after </audio>
<garnt> that they have like a full-on emotional </garnt>
<joey> scene but yeah it drags out like crazy </joey>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah it it something just felt off </garnt>
<garnt> about the characters i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know what it was about how they </garnt>
<garnt> were written but </garnt>
<garnt> it just didn't like sometimes they acted </garnt>
<audio> the way i would imagine </audio>
<audio> people would act and sometimes they just </audio>
<audio> acted in a completely random way </audio>
<audio> yeah and then the cult arc happened and </audio>
<audio> i was like </audio>
<audio> okay okay now now now we've gone from </audio>
<garnt> something feels off to </garnt>
<connor> this is just stupid so much needed </connor>
<connor> explaining about that like whole thing </connor>
<connor> where were they getting all of this food </connor>
<garnt> from where were they getting all of the </garnt>
<connor> weed </connor>
<connor> there's so much weed like it's just </connor>
<garnt> fields of weed </garnt>
<garnt> and like in japan like you're just gonna </garnt>
<garnt> grow fuel completely </garnt>
<joey> they never explained the fact that like </joey>
<joey> the the the grounds where the cult stood </joey>
<joey> wasn't affected by the tilting there was </joey>
<connor> just so much there was so much stuff </connor>
<connor> when it got to the cold arc where i was </connor>
<connor> like this is too much too many holes for </connor>
<connor> me to just like be like this is okay </connor>
<joey> because at the end of it all i think the </joey>
<joey> only </joey>
<connor> reason i was trying to figure out okay </connor>
<connor> what was the point of this called arc </connor>
<garnt> like like what were they trying to build </garnt>
<garnt> to </garnt>
<garnt> and i think the only thing that came out </garnt>
<garnt> of this cult arc was </garnt>
<joey> just the fact that they got that morse </joey>
<joey> code talking professor out of there </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> but why was he there none of this was </connor>
<garnt> explained </garnt>
<garnt> it was just a slapstick comedy like like </garnt>
<audio> i remember watching the coal talk and </audio>
<audio> you know that point when you're like </audio>
<audio> really invested in the show and then </audio>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> you go from being invested to just </connor>
<audio> laughing at how bad it's become </audio>
<audio> yeah that was the cold talk for me and i </audio>
<garnt> couldn't get invested back into the show </garnt>
<connor> after that </connor>
<connor> yeah it hurt too much after the cult </connor>
<connor> happened and the fact that they just </connor>
<connor> were like </connor>
<connor> okay if the old man is addicted to </connor>
<connor> morphine i'm fine with that </connor>
<connor> but they didn't even build up to that at </connor>
<connor> all they could have showed some kind of </connor>
<connor> you know right right like they could </connor>
<garnt> have maybe shown him taking some pills </garnt>
<joey> the fact that the old man shot that kid </joey>
<joey> at the end of episode </joey>
<joey> four yeah yeah and then they were like </joey>
<garnt> and then then he was like oh i'm sorry </garnt>
<joey> you know whatever i didn't mean to shoot </joey>
<garnt> you let me fix your game boy </garnt>
<garnt> dude you just [ __ ] shot my kid yeah </garnt>
<audio> with the intent to kill it </audio>
<audio> like if he didn't have his [ __ ] ds </audio>
<audio> like he he would be dead </audio>
<connor> and you're just gonna let him know he's </connor>
<connor> actually the last ps vita ever </connor>
<joey> at the end of episode four when the kid </joey>
<joey> got shot i was like oh thank god he's </joey>
<connor> dead </connor>
<connor> my god that kid was [ __ ] annoying </connor>
<connor> okay did you you what did you actually </connor>
<garnt> sub the dubbed </garnt>
<garnt> i watched both i watched sorry i like i </garnt>
<garnt> literally i was like i watched the dub </garnt>
<garnt> something fell off i watched the sub and </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time my [ __ ] life i </garnt>
<garnt> i could not stand like the voice </garnt>
<connor> lighting in the scene it was </connor>
<connor> really like i get it that they're </connor>
<connor> supposed to be like native in both </connor>
<connor> but then i feel like they should have </connor>
<connor> got people who are native and both it's </connor>
<connor> terrible </connor>
<connor> because when they whenever he said let's </connor>
<garnt> go it's just like that's not </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it sounds like yeah </garnt>
<connor> well they could have even have just </connor>
<connor> gotten someone with a similar voice type </connor>
<connor> who speaks english you know what i mean </connor>
<joey> what is it what is it about </joey>
<joey> you also did this in devilman crybaby as </joey>
<garnt> well where ryo's </garnt>
<garnt> english was just stop doing this stop </garnt>
<garnt> doing this </garnt>
<garnt> and yet somehow they can't get i made </garnt>
<joey> this joke on twitter but </joey>
<joey> i think it was the second to last </joey>
<audio> episode when they're in russia yeah and </audio>
<audio> they got those like three </audio>
<audio> nurses who could speak perfect russian </audio>
<audio> and yet they can't get a </audio>
<audio> single english voice actually yeah it </audio>
<joey> was like what why </joey>
<connor> how is it so hard because in the dump </connor>
<connor> how do they deal with the the </connor>
<garnt> do uh bilingualness they they didn't </garnt>
<connor> really the boy just always spoke english </connor>
<connor> so that's that's why they mentioned it </connor>
<garnt> at all that he could speak </garnt>
<joey> i mean like they kind of do i wanted </joey>
<joey> them to just be like i want to meet my </joey>
<joey> older son </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> it's just like a reverse is it like a </joey>
<connor> huge plot point because then later on </connor>
<connor> when the </connor>
<connor> like the barrage comes with the japanese </connor>
<joey> only </joey>
<joey> oh the japanese kkk which the the whole </joey>
<garnt> you know the the dynamics of that boat </garnt>
<garnt> just the engineering stands of it were </garnt>
<garnt> all </garnt>
<joey> horrific both yeah you couldn't handle </joey>
<joey> waves like waves could just come off it </joey>
<joey> literally burst into claims </joey>
<connor> no reason like oh my god sorry i just </connor>
<connor> got yeah it was the i've got </connor>
<joey> engineering the more the more we're </joey>
<joey> discussing this the more i'm regretting </joey>
<connor> giving it a seven </connor>
<joey> like the emotions it gave me were ten </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> like like let's let's let's not forget </connor>
<garnt> that they also added a </garnt>
<garnt> woman who could speak to the dead that </garnt>
<garnt> was just what's up </garnt>
<garnt> never explained </garnt>
<garnt> there was two points i burst out </garnt>
<garnt> laughing one one was the kid dying and </garnt>
<garnt> the second one was like the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> mexican standoff where she just brings a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] samurai </connor>
<joey> is this kill bill is this a kill bill </joey>
<garnt> that was such a quentin tarantino scene </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like </garnt>
<garnt> this there's a guy with a bag full of </garnt>
<garnt> gold bars with a gun </garnt>
<garnt> and she just rocks off with a samurai </garnt>
<joey> sword and the guy just walks up the </joey>
<garnt> stairs like </garnt>
<garnt> uh and i'm just like what am i watching </garnt>
<garnt> i thought i was watching like a disaster </garnt>
<garnt> movie </garnt>
<garnt> and it's turned into [ __ ] kill bill </garnt>
<garnt> it was just i couldn't stop taking sick </garnt>
<garnt> i couldn't stop laughing at that point </garnt>
<connor> what did you guys think of the last </connor>
<connor> episode </connor>
<joey> it was a really [ __ ] hated the last </joey>
<joey> step yeah the last episode just kind of </joey>
<garnt> dragged out for a little bit too </garnt>
<audio> last episode was uh remember when the </audio>
<audio> olympics was meant to happen right now </audio>
<garnt> well this is this is awkward don't </garnt>
<joey> forget the paralympics too </joey>
<garnt> just gotta make sure i mean i'm sure it </garnt>
<joey> would have hit harder because </joey>
<garnt> the olympics would be happening right </garnt>
<garnt> now yeah if this was released right now </garnt>
<garnt> i'd be like oh that's that's a pro gamer </garnt>
<garnt> move there you are so i see </garnt>
<garnt> i see you but but now that the olympics </garnt>
<joey> isn't happening it was just one giant ad </joey>
<joey> for the olympics oh no it wasn't </joey>
<connor> like i didn't want to say that but like </connor>
<joey> it definitely like felt a little </joey>
<connor> a little ad-like like look how amazing </connor>
<joey> the olympics are and it's like </joey>
<joey> yeah we know yeah we know how good the </joey>
<joey> olympics are or </joey>
<connor> how good it should have been because i i </connor>
<connor> didn't like maybe i </connor>
<connor> was i wasn't paying attention to this </connor>
<connor> but i saw a lot of people commenting </connor>
<garnt> saying that the show was like very </garnt>
<garnt> political </garnt>
<garnt> at times and i was thinking like i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know if it was that political people are </garnt>
<connor> trying to put that on it like i didn't </connor>
<garnt> get that did you get that vibe no not </garnt>
<joey> really </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean maybe they were talking </joey>
<joey> about the rap scene </joey>
<joey> uh maybe which i liked i like the </joey>
<joey> rapture i like the rap scene well that </joey>
<garnt> was a this </garnt>
<garnt> this doesn't this is a really random </garnt>
<garnt> scene but i'm all for it it was a good </garnt>
<connor> scene it was random though i was like i </connor>
<connor> don't know what this is </connor>
<connor> but we can keep doing it but it's such a </connor>
<joey> yuasa move where you know he was just </joey>
<connor> like okay i really want to tell </connor>
<connor> people how much i love japan but how </connor>
<joey> much japan </joey>
<joey> sucks but not make us super political </joey>
<joey> yeah freestyle rap baby let's do it </joey>
<garnt> yeah so originally was the rap in </garnt>
<joey> japanese in the japanese stuff yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah because like </joey>
<joey> i didn't notice because i at that point </joey>
<joey> i was just purely watching the english </joey>
<joey> dub </joey>
<joey> and it was all in english and it it was </joey>
<joey> really really done well so i </joey>
<joey> i didn't know if it was a case where </joey>
<connor> they just like had that one specific </connor>
<connor> scene in english </connor>
<connor> um but not like i really enjoyed that i </connor>
<connor> really enjoyed the last two episodes </connor>
<connor> not the last two episodes like episode </connor>
<connor> nine and the one before that yeah those </connor>
<connor> are two really strong episodes yeah </connor>
<connor> they had like like i said i wasn't </connor>
<connor> invested in the characters at that point </connor>
<connor> which is really weird because there were </connor>
<connor> some scenes that like i felt something </connor>
<audio> even though i had </audio>
<audio> zero investment in the story and the </audio>
<audio> characters but just because of like </audio>
<audio> the sheer brilliance of some some of the </audio>
<audio> ways these scenes were directed i was </audio>
<audio> like </audio>
<audio> yeah man i'm i'm i'm feeling something </audio>
<garnt> even though i really shouldn't be right </garnt>
<connor> now yeah </connor>
<connor> um did the mom have to die like i was </connor>
<connor> thinking like i was like did she have to </connor>
<connor> enter life here for this because they </connor>
<connor> kind of went like i don't know if they </connor>
<connor> probably went further but it was like </connor>
<connor> one minute on the boat oop it's out of </connor>
<joey> fuel </joey>
<joey> i think it was implied though that </joey>
<joey> because her like device hadn't run out </joey>
<connor> of battery life she was literally going </connor>
<connor> to die but then she had like a solar </connor>
<joey> panel </joey>
<joey> no no because like that thing hadn't </joey>
<connor> become busted oh it had </connor>
<connor> oh so the implication was that she was </connor>
<joey> going to die i didn't pick that up </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<connor> i thought is she just killing herself </connor>
<connor> for like the lulls here </connor>
<joey> she's just drowning for like i mean this </joey>
<joey> is like i have to fill in my one death </joey>
<garnt> per episode yeah </garnt>
<garnt> at this point it was just they were just </garnt>
<connor> killing characters that's what it felt </connor>
<joey> like it felt like they were like every </joey>
<joey> character was going to die now and we </joey>
<joey> were just trying to sit through it like </joey>
<joey> i didn't feel like it was </joey>
<joey> needed yeah and the one character that </joey>
<joey> should have died a million years ago </joey>
<joey> which is the crippled doctor </joey>
<joey> survived how somehow </joey>
<garnt> i don't know how no like yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> that was my biggest problem with it </garnt>
<audio> because it wasn't the fact that people </audio>
<connor> were dying it was the fact that </connor>
<audio> you just knew that someone was gonna die </audio>
<connor> like it was it was just okay </connor>
<connor> here's the scene where this person's </connor>
<connor> gonna die you know there's no </connor>
<garnt> tension or anything you're just okay </garnt>
<garnt> well they're gonna die </garnt>
<garnt> and they're dead and everyone's moving </garnt>
<garnt> on now and it's sad and you should be </garnt>
<connor> sad </connor>
<garnt> and japan's sinking yeah so like but </garnt>
<garnt> youtube are good </garnt>
<garnt> no it's really weird though because i </garnt>
<audio> was having this conversation with joey </audio>
<audio> earlier though i think we could we can </audio>
<garnt> end the spoiler discussion now no more </garnt>
<garnt> spoilers </garnt>
<garnt> unless unless there's anything else you </garnt>
<garnt> guys want to discuss about the series </garnt>
<connor> specifically </connor>
<connor> why of all pro games did he become a </connor>
<connor> league of legends pro </connor>
<audio> and totally unrealistic </audio>
<connor> and he's not a little [ __ ] i mean he </connor>
<connor> kind of was there actually maybe he was </connor>
<connor> yeah maybe he was a league player </connor>
<garnt> no but uh yeah it was it was really </garnt>
<garnt> weird because even though </garnt>
<garnt> it was like i would give like a four or </garnt>
<connor> five out of 10 at the end of the day </connor>
<connor> um i still ended up having like a good </connor>
<connor> time watching your netflix i don't know </connor>
<connor> i don't know i don't know why </connor>
<connor> i couldn't look away yeah it was great </connor>
<joey> like i don't know why where </joey>
<joey> where it's i i find it so easy to watch </joey>
<garnt> anime on netflix as opposed to watching </garnt>
<joey> anime on like any other platform </joey>
<joey> i've been saying this since early 2018 </joey>
<audio> ever since devil may cry baby and other </audio>
<garnt> well it was around the time when netflix </garnt>
<audio> just started to get their hands on a lot </audio>
<garnt> of anime ips </garnt>
<garnt> that with at least with stuff that comes </garnt>
<connor> out on netflix you know castlevania did </connor>
<connor> it really well </connor>
<connor> i think i think the reason why netflix </connor>
<connor> can kill it so hard with anime is </connor>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> they know that most anime viewers </joey>
<joey> including probably all three of us </joey>
<joey> we'd like to watch shows just in one big </joey>
<connor> chunk oh my god castlevania is so </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah because </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] so amazing right and i think </joey>
<connor> what it is is that because </connor>
<connor> whenever they release something new they </connor>
<connor> just go we know you can't wait </connor>
<connor> an entire week so we're just going to </connor>
<connor> give you the whole thing all in one go </connor>
<joey> and it's perfect because netflix is </joey>
<garnt> designed </garnt>
<joey> to binge it's just to be binged right </joey>
<joey> yeah it also feels like there's no </joey>
<garnt> seasonal pressure as well </garnt>
<garnt> no if there's just one big show that </garnt>
<connor> drops yeah don't watch it right it's </connor>
<connor> it's it's not it's not it's not under </connor>
<connor> any kind of like scheduling no it's not </connor>
<garnt> because i've had plenty of shows where i </garnt>
<garnt> want to binge them and i wait </garnt>
<garnt> like they're on crunchyroll or </garnt>
<garnt> funimation or whatever platform and i'm </garnt>
<joey> like okay i'm going to wait for this is </joey>
<joey> for this to be over and then i'm going </joey>
<joey> to binge it and then it's over </joey>
<joey> and then i don't binge it and i just </joey>
<joey> don't watch yourself because by the time </joey>
<joey> it ends there's another </joey>
<garnt> whole new batch of shows that you're </garnt>
<joey> interested in now </joey>
<garnt> you never have time to go back to it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then i've watched so many like </garnt>
<garnt> mediocre anime on netflix i have no idea </garnt>
<connor> why but like </connor>
<connor> you can download it it's super easy i </connor>
<garnt> remember watching </garnt>
<connor> i think be the beginning as well i was </connor>
<connor> like severely disappointed in how that </connor>
<connor> turned out </connor>
<connor> like i watched it i watched it all in </connor>
<connor> one night </connor>
<connor> and i still there are still many shows </connor>
<connor> on every other platform that i just </connor>
<garnt> still have not watched and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> are on my plan to watch </garnt>
<garnt> this so yeah i don't know what it is </garnt>
<garnt> about watching shows on netflix so it </garnt>
<garnt> just makes it so it's just painless like </garnt>
<connor> it's so easy to watch like they make it </connor>
<connor> way too easy for you to enjoy it the way </connor>
<joey> you want to enjoy it yeah right </joey>
<joey> they just they just know how the the </joey>
<joey> viewing habits of </joey>
<connor> people of our demographic and the app </connor>
<joey> works so well on your phone so it's so </joey>
<joey> easy to just chuck that [ __ ] on the </joey>
<joey> chromecast </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah like you know saves where </garnt>
<joey> you are it's so good we're not sponsored </joey>
<connor> by netflix </connor>
<joey> but if they want to hit if they want to </joey>
<connor> hit us up </connor>
<joey> okay how would you feel about the uh </joey>
<connor> skip opening button though </connor>
<connor> i love the skip opening button i i like </connor>
<joey> the option </joey>
<garnt> like i like i like having the option </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but like it's but i don't like how </garnt>
<garnt> the default is </garnt>
<joey> that yeah i don't like how the default </joey>
<connor> is skipping because wait they don't </connor>
<connor> they don't skip it straight away yeah </connor>
<garnt> they do the first time you watch it </garnt>
<garnt> you you don't have the option well you </garnt>
<garnt> do have the opportunity to skip it but </garnt>
<joey> it plays it for you automatically </joey>
<joey> but every time after that then yeah i </joey>
<joey> think they just assume that </joey>
<garnt> you're going to skip it which sucked </garnt>
<garnt> because when i was watching b stars on </garnt>
<joey> netflix </joey>
<joey> i was like i don't want to skip this i </joey>
<connor> mean yeah we're [ __ ] opening yeah b </connor>
<garnt> stars you watch but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have to do it so i had to keep </garnt>
<garnt> going to touch it joey it's there in </garnt>
<connor> case you don't want it </connor>
<connor> it's not like touch me touch me cherry </connor>
<connor> touch </connor>
<joey> speaking of masaki you also though like </joey>
<joey> how much us </joey>
<joey> stuff have you guys watched in the past </joey>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> i've watched most of this stuff except </garnt>
<connor> for probably </connor>
<audio> kaiba um is that his </audio>
<connor> yeah that's yeah devil man is here oh </connor>
<joey> he's a king as well i still </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's fun it's funny that i </joey>
<joey> still haven't watched a </joey>
<connor> ken yeah even though i've watched japan </connor>
<joey> sings which i feel like is going to be </joey>
<joey> worse than a </joey>
<joey> kid and he's against been out for a </joey>
<joey> while he's a kid he's done ping pong the </joey>
<joey> animation oh i love being </joey>
<connor> done kaiba he's done mind game mind game </connor>
<connor> is one of my favorites kick hearts as </connor>
<garnt> well which was the kickstarter one </garnt>
<joey> right um he's done a lot of uh indie </joey>
<audio> films </audio>
<garnt> as well he does yeah your way i haven't </garnt>
<garnt> seen i haven't seen i still haven't seen </garnt>
<audio> that </audio>
<audio> yeah i really need to watch that it's </audio>
<audio> about the it's like uh </audio>
<joey> girlfriend boyfriend dies they both love </joey>
<joey> the ocean and their boyfriend </joey>
<connor> reincarnates as a wave </connor>
<connor> yeah that's the only way to describe it </connor>
<connor> right that's the easiest way to describe </connor>
<garnt> it it's like a hentai yeah </garnt>
<connor> boyfriend resurrects as a water beast </connor>
<garnt> yeah essentially no because i think my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite yuasa work will </garnt>
<joey> like is at the moment ping pong the </joey>
<joey> animation oh my god yeah </joey>
<joey> ping pong's fantastic that hit me on </joey>
<connor> like a really [ __ ] deep level </connor>
<garnt> different yeah i really want to stop </garnt>
<garnt> saying that </garnt>
<garnt> every time we're on it's like oh this </garnt>
<garnt> this show just hits this dude </garnt>
<connor> and different i i guess because it's so </connor>
<connor> like relatable in some way like you've </connor>
<connor> probably been good at something without </connor>
<connor> trying and you've also probably </connor>
<garnt> not been i mean we had a lot of comments </garnt>
<garnt> last week that was </garnt>
<joey> yeah connor's chess story is basically </joey>
<joey> ping pong the animation just with chess </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah you know what i mean but the </joey>
<connor> way it just portrays </connor>
<connor> it because to me it's not a sports anime </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> to me ping pong the animation is a life </connor>
<connor> anime that happens to follow characters </connor>
<connor> around </connor>
<connor> one single one single sport because it's </connor>
<connor> it's such a good metaphor for life in </connor>
<audio> general when it when it comes to the </audio>
<audio> discussion of talent you know versus </audio>
<audio> hard work </audio>
<audio> and just basically how crushingly </audio>
<garnt> depressing </garnt>
<garnt> life can be sometimes life isn't fair </garnt>
<connor> yeah life life is not fair and </connor>
<connor> no one's entitled to anything </connor>
<joey> unfortunately i mean that's the whole </joey>
<joey> reason why i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] loved marsh comes in like elaine </joey>
<connor> because that's essentially the exact </connor>
<connor> same </connor>
<connor> thing that yeah that's not what you want </connor>
<connor> to see it's it is not a show about shogi </connor>
<connor> like you'll get into shogi </connor>
<connor> after watching it but much like ping </connor>
<joey> pong the animation it's just a story </joey>
<joey> about how </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter how good you are at </joey>
<joey> something you're still going to be </joey>
<joey> depressed as [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah i've been putting it off i'm like i </connor>
<joey> don't want to be depressed </joey>
<joey> it gets pretty easy i know it does i </joey>
<garnt> do you think japan syncs is his worst </garnt>
<connor> work that you've seen so far then </connor>
<connor> like the three i've seen yeah it's </connor>
<joey> probably i mean i haven't seen </joey>
<garnt> everything masakiosa has to offer yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i've seen a lot but </garnt>
<joey> i i'd probably say it's yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> probably his weakness yeah i think </garnt>
<garnt> definitely for me it was his weakest and </garnt>
<connor> it literally just removed the cult yeah </connor>
<joey> that's good </joey>
<joey> so many problems will be solved if he </joey>
<garnt> just had yeah i i </garnt>
<garnt> would say no not every problem would be </garnt>
<garnt> solved but a lot of it </garnt>
<garnt> it would be like a lot better because i </garnt>
<audio> still had problems with how the </audio>
<audio> characters were written </audio>
<audio> and how the story played out but </audio>
<connor> removing </connor>
<connor> removing the middle arc would have made </connor>
<connor> it like an easy </connor>
<connor> seven to eight out of ten yeah um </connor>
<connor> because there was still like i said </connor>
<connor> there were still some amazing scenes and </connor>
<connor> there was some planning amazing and it </connor>
<connor> was like peak you are certain if i was </connor>
<audio> actually invested </audio>
<audio> i i would think that this show had some </audio>
<audio> pretty amazing moments in it </audio>
<audio> um because i feel like just you got </audio>
<audio> bogged down by its story so much </audio>
<audio> yeah um whereas his other works i feel </audio>
<audio> it was it was like a nice combination </audio>
<audio> between this yuasa style of directing </audio>
<audio> because </audio>
<audio> he has a i don't know some of his scenes </audio>
<garnt> the way the way he </garnt>
<garnt> the way he portrays and directs </garnt>
<garnt> especially like the emotional scenes </garnt>
<garnt> they just </garnt>
<garnt> they they can hit really hard and i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know what he does she's so close </garnt>
<joey> shut the [ __ ] up </joey>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<audio> i definitely think that you also </audio>
<audio> regardless of how strange it is that the </audio>
<audio> way that he portrays </audio>
<garnt> you know character designs and just </garnt>
<connor> movement in general just animation </connor>
<garnt> just animating okay i'm one of those </garnt>
<connor> anime viewers who does not care who the </connor>
<connor> director is or any of that stuff </connor>
<connor> i just watch the show and that's how i </connor>
<joey> watch your anime i do that </joey>
<joey> with everything so i mean i could tell </joey>
<joey> it was from the same guy who did </joey>
<connor> devilman within like 10 seconds </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah just tell yeah </joey>
<joey> that's how i do because yuasa's </joey>
<connor> films and series have this really weird </connor>
<connor> thing where sometimes </connor>
<joey> you look at a character design obviously </joey>
<joey> wow that looks </joey>
<joey> pretty cool and then the next scene it </joey>
<joey> looks like it's written by </joey>
<connor> like the intern you know it changes i </connor>
<connor> think there was like a few frames in it </connor>
<connor> where it was like </connor>
<connor> characters talking and it was like bruh </connor>
<connor> like paint </connor>
<joey> you can take a screenshot of that and </joey>
<garnt> just be a pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> i will say out of like all his works i </garnt>
<joey> feel like japan syncs was his most </joey>
<garnt> like normal looking work in terms of </garnt>
<joey> visual style </joey>
<garnt> no no no no you like you compare ping </garnt>
<garnt> pong the animation and then you go to </garnt>
<joey> devilman crybaby and then japan </joey>
<joey> sinks i i would i would say he's </joey>
<garnt> progressively gotten </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of his big series yeah more </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> more like normal ping pong is one ugly </connor>
<connor> luck in show but </connor>
<garnt> in a great way in a great way like he </garnt>
<garnt> had a very unique art style and </garnt>
<garnt> some of the scenes were like they had a </garnt>
<garnt> very unique animation style and some </garnt>
<garnt> i would still say sometimes it works </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes it doesn't work so well </garnt>
<garnt> um but it was definitely a very yuasa </garnt>
<garnt> style i mean </garnt>
<connor> at least you know it's him yeah yeah how </connor>
<connor> many [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> of those generic isekai shows are you </connor>
<connor> like i are these all animated by the </connor>
<connor> same [ __ ] people they all look the </connor>
<joey> same </joey>
<joey> i can't tell you ask any soccer guitar </joey>
<connor> and they'll probably know it's like </connor>
<audio> this was directed i don't care like it's </audio>
<audio> like </audio>
<joey> i see an easy guy protagonist now and </joey>
<garnt> it's literally a carbon copy of kirito </garnt>
<joey> yeah i i remember doing like a copy and </joey>
<garnt> paste of </garnt>
<garnt> seven different like isikai protagonists </garnt>
<joey> and they all looked </joey>
<joey> exactly the same it was all that </joey>
<garnt> generally probably because they're all </garnt>
<connor> a1 </connor>
<connor> it's the exact same art style the exact </connor>
<connor> same animation all the time and it's </connor>
<connor> like it's such a breath of fresh air you </connor>
<connor> can get anything different </connor>
<joey> oh no that's what i love about masakusa </joey>
<joey> because he's just so </joey>
<joey> weird that it's just instantly </joey>
<joey> recognizable especially </joey>
<audio> you know japan sinks as you were saying </audio>
<audio> even though it looks the most normal </audio>
<audio> probably to the general anime viewing </audio>
<audio> audience they would look at those </audio>
<audio> characters and be like oh that looks </audio>
<audio> [ __ ] weird </audio>
<audio> but then you go back to massachusetts </audio>
<audio> catalog you watch something like kyber </audio>
<audio> yeah like that thing that doesn't even </audio>
<connor> look like anime yeah yeah that thing </connor>
<connor> looks like uh </connor>
<joey> you know some kind of like disney demo </joey>
<connor> that it was locked away in the disney </connor>
<connor> vault for a while </connor>
<audio> yeah the art style's weird i can't get </audio>
<connor> into it i'm like you'll know </connor>
<connor> you'll appreciate it it's an acquired </connor>
<connor> time once you acquire that taste </connor>
<garnt> taste acquired </garnt>
<joey> i was going to say i completely forgot </joey>
<joey> about the one shot and you're also </joey>
<joey> getting one show when we're talking </joey>
<joey> muscle like yo sir um to tommy galaxy </joey>
<joey> oh no tommy galaxy was [ __ ] a man </joey>
<joey> like you watched </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] amazing it's </garnt>
<joey> monogatari but on crap </joey>
<joey> it is like this this this will test your </joey>
<garnt> reading ability </garnt>
<joey> to the max if the monologue is so fast </joey>
<audio> that </audio>
<audio> japanese people struggle to keep up with </audio>
<audio> it </audio>
<connor> what the [ __ ] do you just go back the </connor>
<connor> i've never heard of monologue and just </connor>
<garnt> talking scenes </garnt>
<connor> that go by so god damn quickly yeah it </connor>
<garnt> is it is monogatari on crack essentially </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically like if you take one of </garnt>
<garnt> guitar but try to speed run the dialogue </garnt>
<garnt> and that's that's an episode of the </garnt>
<joey> tatami galaxy but it's [ __ ] great </joey>
<joey> yeah that and that's on top of the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] crazy mosaic you was a visual </connor>
<connor> yeah where it's just like i don't know </connor>
<connor> if this is like a dreamscape or if it's </connor>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> weird yeah yeah but it's great it's </joey>
<garnt> fantastic uh one thing i wanted </garnt>
<joey> one thing that we kind of like glossed </joey>
<joey> over in terms of japan things that i </joey>
<joey> want to talk about though </joey>
<joey> is the music i thought the music was </joey>
<joey> fantastic i thought it was phenomenal </joey>
<joey> and i i i think that definitely some of </joey>
<garnt> it made some it it was what helped make </garnt>
<joey> some of the scenes </joey>
<joey> that main track i think it played most </joey>
<audio> of the first episode </audio>
<audio> when the main character was running back </audio>
<audio> to a family that kind of slow piano </audio>
<audio> i think song i love that track because </audio>
<audio> it's really </audio>
<audio> positive sounding and yet putting it </audio>
<connor> next to </connor>
<connor> the absolutely devastating visuals yeah </connor>
<connor> it's just becomes </connor>
<joey> such a creepy song where it's like oh </joey>
<audio> everything and everyone is dead because </audio>
<garnt> like i think </garnt>
<garnt> well like what sold me on the first two </garnt>
<audio> episodes was just seeing seeing some of </audio>
<audio> these like horrific scenes horrific </audio>
<audio> landscapes and hearing this </audio>
<audio> beautiful piano track that just gave </audio>
<audio> this like juxtaposition </audio>
<audio> that just like it was really unnerving </audio>
<joey> but beautiful at the same time like i </joey>
<joey> the way i described it to sydney was it </joey>
<joey> felt like i was watching some </joey>
<joey> something that was horrifically </joey>
<joey> beautiful yeah and i </joey>
<audio> that that was it was like a beautiful </audio>
<joey> destruction yeah yeah exactly </joey>
<audio> and i don't know who the composer was it </audio>
<garnt> sounded very similar to </garnt>
<garnt> devman crybaby's soundtrack in some </garnt>
<garnt> scenes as well i don't know if it's the </garnt>
<garnt> same composer </garnt>
<joey> did i probably should have done my </joey>
<joey> research before talking about japan </joey>
<joey> sings on his podcast i mean i'm sure </joey>
<joey> it was done by science sarah who did you </joey>
<joey> know devil may cry baby so i assume it's </joey>
<joey> the same </joey>
<joey> guy but i i don't know i'm sure someone </joey>
<joey> in the comments can tell us about that </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<garnt> yeah i love that piano track because i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know it </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not gonna lie the first time i heard </garnt>
<garnt> it i it kind of reminded me of the </garnt>
<joey> minecraft soundtrack </joey>
<garnt> a little bit i was like if this played </garnt>
<joey> during minecraft i would not be </joey>
<garnt> phased in any way i thought [ __ ] damn </garnt>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> can someone in the subreddit take that </connor>
<joey> piece of music and </joey>
<joey> put it over minecraft let's play it and </joey>
<garnt> see if you can spot it </garnt>
<connor> it's like god this was such horrific </connor>
<connor> beauty this the juxtaposition was </connor>
<connor> amazing </connor>
<joey> joey minecraft it sounds like minecraft </joey>
<joey> that's what i was like oh minecraft i </joey>
<joey> don't know if i'm just dumb but i cannot </joey>
<garnt> remember any of the music you really </garnt>
<garnt> can't no i watched it all in one sitting </garnt>
<connor> though </connor>
<connor> yeah we all did yeah did you watch one </connor>
<connor> sitting yeah yeah yeah yeah oh okay i </connor>
<joey> don't remember [ __ ] we just have a </joey>
<connor> bigger brain </connor>
<connor> clearly i think i was preoccupied how do </connor>
<connor> they get a tank </connor>
<garnt> okay a question to you then what kind of </garnt>
<garnt> osts do you remember what sticks out for </garnt>
<connor> you then </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> uh anything where like the music is like </connor>
<connor> a huge selling point i guess </connor>
<garnt> what what what do you mean ah i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> don't want to be that guy but </garnt>
<garnt> like the one that sticks out immediately </garnt>
<joey> are you remember cowboy bebop like </joey>
<joey> yeah that's right like but i wouldn't </joey>
<connor> listen to jazz on its own i'm like so </connor>
<joey> i'm like this just sounds like a mess </joey>
<joey> i mean i've i've come to understand that </joey>
<audio> when it comes to music you're a little </audio>
<garnt> bit brain dead </garnt>
<audio> yeah yeah because you don't you don't </audio>
<garnt> really listen to because you know god </garnt>
<garnt> and i can have a conversation of oh this </garnt>
<garnt> band is the intellectual </garnt>
<audio> awesome and yet i i i remember i asked </audio>
<audio> connor once i was like who's your </audio>
<joey> favorite band and he was just like i </joey>
<joey> don't really have one i'm like </joey>
<connor> i like no i like daddy punk you know why </connor>
<connor> because it's just noise most of the time </connor>
<connor> like i i hate like i never listen to </connor>
<connor> lyrics like i i'll have like listened to </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i think i listened to like popped up </connor>
<connor> kicks like a thousand times or someone </connor>
<connor> was like it's about school shooting and </connor>
<connor> i actually listened to it yeah </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah i guess it is i don't know </connor>
<garnt> if i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> i don't know what's wrong with me you </connor>
<garnt> want monkey brain </garnt>
<connor> it's that monkey brain coming back man i </connor>
<connor> have like half a monkey brain half giant </connor>
<connor> brain depending on like what i can do </connor>
<connor> you know a single composer </connor>
<connor> kevin penkin aside from kevin franken </connor>
<garnt> because he's our [ __ ] mate </garnt>
<garnt> he's like he said he's not composing our </garnt>
<garnt> minds </garnt>
<joey> he's just a man do you know what he </joey>
<joey> composed other than made an abyss </joey>
<joey> uh yeah other than tal of god shield </joey>
<connor> hero yeah </connor>
<garnt> okay okay it's pretty the boy's not </garnt>
<connor> completely brain dude that's good </connor>
<connor> i guess because i focus more on voice </connor>
<connor> acting than anything and that's like </connor>
<connor> taking up all the noise input i can take </connor>
<joey> right like i don't really give a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> about the music </connor>
<connor> to me the music is just does the music </connor>
<garnt> not enhance your viewing experience </garnt>
<connor> the music to me is so [ __ ] important </connor>
<connor> no no not really like if if </connor>
<garnt> if uh if there's a shitty series with a </garnt>
<joey> good soundtrack </joey>
<joey> i'm still going to remember that i </joey>
<joey> absolutely agree to this day </joey>
<garnt> like i will never forget guilty crown </garnt>
<garnt> despite how </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] guilty crown turns into </garnt>
<connor> that like will invoke an emotion in me </connor>
<connor> from like if they've been a soundtrack </connor>
<connor> but </connor>
<joey> as far as it goes it's like but have you </joey>
<joey> never listened to a song on a soundtrack </joey>
<connor> and just gotten popped no </connor>
<connor> not at all like uh maybe at the gym like </connor>
<connor> i'll put anime soundtrack to get hyped </connor>
<connor> too and maybe a you know </connor>
<joey> okay but but say for example premiere </joey>
<connor> yeah you [ __ ] love that music right </connor>
<connor> it was a great movie do you remember the </connor>
<connor> soundtrack </connor>
<connor> no how what the hell </connor>
<garnt> how is it that the most in your face </garnt>
<garnt> composer that has ever existed in anime </garnt>
<connor> connor's like if you were like if you </connor>
<connor> were like no impression if you like like </connor>
<connor> describe a song to me from from that i'd </connor>
<connor> be like i have no [ __ ] idea </connor>
<garnt> no no no you you watch pro you watch </garnt>
<garnt> attack on titan yeah you uh what else </garnt>
<connor> what yeah </connor>
<connor> about the one that goes i i never wanted </connor>
<connor> from attack on titan i don't know what </connor>
<connor> to kill the kill you remember killing </connor>
<connor> yeah kill the kill either that's okay </connor>
<connor> that's yeah i remember like individual </connor>
<connor> songs but if you ask me like describe </connor>
<audio> them or what i like about them i'd be </audio>
<audio> like they're more like crayon colors too </audio>
<joey> like for all i care you could put like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] kevin macleod music whatever </connor>
<joey> kevin mccloud mcleod's </joey>
<garnt> there's like there's definitely been </garnt>
<connor> some generic sounding soundtracks that </connor>
<connor> but they're normally like for generic </connor>
<connor> shows right but yeah i don't know a </connor>
<garnt> soundtrack can </garnt>
<connor> easily sell me a series i wish i could </connor>
<connor> give a [ __ ] i don't know </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> i it's with music as well i love daft </connor>
<connor> punk i i just like wow the </connor>
<connor> the noise sounds nice like i like the </connor>
<connor> noise you know what i mean </connor>
<joey> is that weird is that weird yes it is it </joey>
<garnt> is very weird </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i know i think you just basically </garnt>
<garnt> described music </garnt>
<garnt> in in in the most like i think bare </garnt>
<connor> bones monkey breaks </connor>
<connor> a bunch of noises i think i actually am </connor>
<connor> like a caveman when it comes to music </connor>
<garnt> i'm like oh </garnt>
<garnt> the beeps and the boobs are very </garnt>
<connor> pleasing music goes boom </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean that's a huge reason </garnt>
<connor> when it comes to soundtracks that's a </connor>
<audio> huge reason why i love </audio>
<audio> anything made by uh key studios right </audio>
<audio> because yeah </audio>
<audio> jun is a [ __ ] amazing composer and </audio>
<connor> he's like </connor>
<joey> just subtle piano tracks or any of the </joey>
<connor> openings and endings just </connor>
<joey> it builds on the scene so [ __ ] nicely </joey>
<connor> and it adds like a whole </connor>
<connor> like totally like at least to me i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> maybe i'm the only one but i could just </connor>
<joey> listen to say </joey>
<joey> any track from clannad or air yeah or </joey>
<joey> little busters yeah and </joey>
<joey> it could be a specific song that can </joey>
<joey> evoke a specific scene and i could </joey>
<garnt> easily shut it </garnt>
<garnt> just from listening to it like his work </garnt>
<joey> is basically if you want to hit </joey>
<joey> the emotional g-spot yeah you know what </joey>
<joey> i mean like you you hear it and you're </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> oh oh [ __ ] no it feels like how does a </garnt>
<joey> single piano put </joey>
<joey> this much emotion behind it i have no </joey>
<audio> [ __ ] idea you're like the mike was </audio>
<audio> asking me more he's just standing there </audio>
<connor> right now </connor>
<connor> this conversation </connor>
<joey> i don't know you are the first person to </joey>
<garnt> ever describe darf punk is </garnt>
<garnt> noise it's like i'm just saying present </garnt>
<joey> noise </joey>
<garnt> is the way i like it you mean music </garnt>
<joey> interstellar </joey>
<garnt> three whatever it's called what is it in </garnt>
<garnt> stella five five five five five five </garnt>
<connor> that's great yeah i love that that's </connor>
<connor> great i love that </connor>
<garnt> has has the track never evoked emotions </garnt>
<garnt> from you though </garnt>
<garnt> like have you ever listened to actual </garnt>
<joey> evo emotion okay what's your favorite </joey>
<connor> dark punk track </connor>
<connor> oh that's hard i really like face to </connor>
<joey> face okay why is it your favorite track </joey>
<joey> oh my god is it because it evokes an </joey>
<garnt> emotion you've seen his face he's never </garnt>
<garnt> thought about this thing </garnt>
<garnt> before i don't know why this is my </garnt>
<connor> favorite song no i </connor>
<connor> i like all the sampling in it i think </connor>
<connor> it's like crazy how creative they are </connor>
<joey> with sampling </joey>
<joey> right so you're looking at them so is </joey>
<joey> there okay think about the one </joey>
<joey> daft punk song it doesn't have to be </joey>
<joey> dark just think about the one song that </joey>
<joey> has evoked like </joey>
<joey> any kind of emotion in you what song </joey>
<joey> would that be and what emotion would </joey>
<connor> that be </connor>
<connor> yeah i i don't think there is i don't </connor>
<joey> think there is a song that evokes </joey>
<joey> emotions in me </joey>
<joey> is that mad is that what does that mean </joey>
<connor> what does that mean about me as a person </connor>
<garnt> i'm talking to a [ __ ] brick wall here </garnt>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> it's like trying to explain to you know </connor>
<connor> peppa the android what music is </connor>
<connor> it's just like it does not compute it's </connor>
<joey> like i feel like i'm alien right now </joey>
<connor> what is </connor>
<connor> emotion what is culture </connor>
<connor> what is this i don't know i guess like </connor>
<garnt> for me i maybe that's why like i focus </garnt>
<garnt> i i'm i feel like i'm really uh strong </garnt>
<garnt> in being able to </garnt>
<garnt> uh really break down voice acting in </garnt>
<garnt> shows and really like </garnt>
<garnt> get into it but i think that's because </garnt>
<garnt> i'm completely [ __ ] ignorant but what </garnt>
<garnt> like brings </garnt>
<connor> emotions to you the story and the </connor>
<connor> characters </connor>
<joey> and the performances okay but does not </joey>
<joey> buzz but does voice acting not </joey>
<connor> give you emotion yeah the voice acting </connor>
<connor> does okay so how come music can't do </connor>
<joey> that </joey>
<connor> dude i don't know i guess i can't like i </connor>
<garnt> don't know it doesn't connect with me i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<connor> do you know a medium where you can feel </connor>
<garnt> emotion just by story </garnt>
<garnt> and characters books books </garnt>
<connor> you don't read books i don't want to </connor>
<audio> read the book i want someone to read it </audio>
<joey> for me </joey>
<joey> the music for me is something that like </joey>
<audio> ties it together and it's something that </audio>
<joey> if it's done well i don't notice and if </joey>
<joey> it's done badly i will notice </joey>
<joey> okay no i agree with that which is the </joey>
<connor> way i think that most people view </connor>
<connor> like voice acting no no i agree with how </connor>
<connor> if music is done well </connor>
<connor> i don't if it's done so well then </connor>
<connor> sometimes you can't notice it but </connor>
<connor> but then there's a level no because i </connor>
<connor> don't i don't look out for it like i i </connor>
<connor> don't see </connor>
<connor> no when i say when i say good i mean </connor>
<connor> like just it blends in perfectly yeah </connor>
<connor> satisfactory music you don't notice it </connor>
<connor> yeah but </connor>
<joey> you will definitely hear when a </joey>
<connor> soundtrack is really well there's a </connor>
<connor> track that they use in amazing ways i'll </connor>
<garnt> notice that track and i'll like have </garnt>
<connor> like a little </connor>
<garnt> logo right but does that not like your </garnt>
<garnt> emotions you've definitely heard </garnt>
<garnt> the sarino drop yeah yeah and i'm like </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah i get a little hype </connor>
<garnt> about it i'm like </garnt>
<connor> excited </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> go protagonist </connor>
<garnt> oh my god have you ever watched like </garnt>
<garnt> okay my my favorite soundtrack of what's </garnt>
<garnt> up is probably </garnt>
<garnt> zankye no tedda or terian resonance i </garnt>
<connor> remember enjoying that show a lot </connor>
<garnt> okay so i remember the music was sad i </garnt>
<connor> don't know </connor>
<connor> when you talk about music to me you need </connor>
<connor> to filter it through like the youtube </connor>
<connor> audio library </connor>
<connor> tags like genre and mood that's the only </connor>
<connor> thing i understand about music </connor>
<connor> tell me the genre of music and the mood </connor>
<joey> it was okay you watched </joey>
<joey> it yeah i love those guys okay it had </joey>
<joey> the whole icelandic </joey>
<joey> uh like kind of post rock drone rider </joey>
<garnt> the motorbike scene where they're on </garnt>
<garnt> like the motor and it's nothing </garnt>
<garnt> but just no doubt no dialogue just them </garnt>
<garnt> riding on a motorbike with </garnt>
<connor> beautiful visuals and beautiful music do </connor>
<connor> you remember that scene now </connor>
<connor> i remember them being terrorists this is </connor>
<garnt> i'm </garnt>
<garnt> feeling so [ __ ] frustrated now oh my </garnt>
<connor> god </connor>
<connor> i just remember them being like </connor>
<connor> terrorists right and it was fun anime </connor>
<connor> you remember them </connor>
<connor> i remember them blowing up [ __ ] that's </connor>
<joey> like saying attack on titans i remember </joey>
<connor> the being titans </connor>
<connor> yeah there's titan dude i remember </connor>
<connor> enjoying that show but like </connor>
<connor> when i finished like it's gone okay okay </connor>
<connor> okay then </connor>
<connor> let's let's steer away let's go down </connor>
<garnt> let's go down to the most like </garnt>
<joey> rudimentary level here let's let's go to </joey>
<joey> okay okay what is your favorite anime </joey>
<connor> opening </connor>
<joey> oh that's good i really like the kogius </joey>
<joey> one okay why </joey>
<joey> type is fun okay but what makes it like </joey>
<connor> like what emotions do you feel </connor>
<connor> when listening to it is it excitement is </connor>
<connor> it like are you excited yeah okay </connor>
<garnt> so how come you can put emotion into </garnt>
<garnt> that song </garnt>
<joey> but what what makes what makes that </joey>
<connor> memorable yeah what makes that matter </connor>
<connor> yeah the </connor>
<connor> the opening part is pretty high you know </connor>
<connor> the the the jumbo </connor>
<connor> that's just the meme yeah i love it </connor>
<connor> though it's good what else do i love i </connor>
<connor> mean the jojo the jojo opening type is </connor>
<garnt> fun </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay oh no no giona gianno's theme </garnt>
<garnt> okay why does </garnt>
<connor> as i said in i think i tweeted it i was </connor>
<garnt> like it's the bohemian rhapsody </garnt>
<garnt> what does that mean what does that mean </garnt>
<garnt> what is that because there's so much </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] going on it's like a five minute </garnt>
<connor> song and there's just like so many </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] things happening </connor>
<connor> and i'm like wow this is amazing </connor>
<connor> i don't know if it's the coffee or this </connor>
<garnt> conversation but i'm basically getting a </garnt>
<connor> headache </connor>
<garnt> i'm getting like a brain aneurysm right </garnt>
<connor> now i imagine the viewers at home are </connor>
<garnt> like what is wrong with this kid what's </garnt>
<garnt> wrong i'm like dying inside just </garnt>
<garnt> listening to this ah </garnt>
<garnt> have i never had this conversation with </garnt>
<connor> you before because every time you bring </connor>
<connor> up music i think i just go like yeah </connor>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> you if we went to school together you </joey>
<joey> would be that one kid who would wear a </joey>
<joey> cocobain t-shirt not knowing who nirvana </joey>
<joey> was </joey>
<joey> i mean like to be like yeah i like his </joey>
<garnt> face yeah look he's like </garnt>
<connor> that teen spirit song spirit yeah what </connor>
<garnt> is it </garnt>
<garnt> looks like teen spirit so </garnt>
<garnt> okay what else do you value anything </garnt>
<garnt> else in an anime </garnt>
<connor> aside from like story and characters </connor>
<connor> then um i mean the visuals are really </connor>
<connor> important </connor>
<connor> right like i feel that it's like it's </connor>
<joey> it's not so much that i don't appreciate </joey>
<joey> music it's again like i said like if </joey>
<joey> it's done well </joey>
<connor> it blends in and i don't really pay much </connor>
<connor> attention to it okay but you remember </connor>
<joey> the cowboy ball soundtrack yeah </joey>
<connor> okay why do you remember that i remember </connor>
<connor> it went like really well with all the </connor>
<joey> cardio like the </joey>
<joey> all the movements in that show like </joey>
<joey> blended so well yeah music and i </joey>
<joey> remember </joey>
<joey> it like made them both stand out more </joey>
<connor> than anything at the time when i was </connor>
<connor> watching right </connor>
<joey> because the choreo so your argument is </joey>
<connor> that because this </connor>
<connor> the feeling of the soundtrack is not an </connor>
<joey> argument so completely </joey>
<joey> i'm just saying like i'm not trying to </joey>
<connor> argue or anything i'm just saying that's </connor>
<joey> what i remember is because no no no </joey>
<joey> because because you kind of </joey>
<garnt> because you're logic from what i'm </garnt>
<garnt> understanding your logic is </garnt>
<connor> that again i don't think about this too </connor>
<connor> much yeah well your logic is that the </connor>
<connor> cowboy bebop soundtrack you remember </connor>
<connor> because the feeling and vibe you got </connor>
<joey> from the music was so different to the </joey>
<connor> visuals </connor>
<connor> right no no because i can't put the </connor>
<connor> visuals without the music there </connor>
<joey> okay so how come you don't remember </joey>
<joey> zankyeon ortera then </joey>
<connor> because it does the exact same thing i </connor>
<connor> remember like maybe like </connor>
<connor> two scenes from sankyonotera literally </connor>
<connor> and do they involve any music </connor>
<garnt> no i remember seeing the building </garnt>
<connor> explode </connor>
<garnt> i was about to say the only sound i </garnt>
<garnt> remember </garnt>
<garnt> i remember someone getting sniped and i </garnt>
<connor> remember being </connor>
<connor> sad by the sniped i i was expecting to </connor>
<connor> say that you were very impressed with </connor>
<connor> the no script i was very interested </connor>
<connor> with this man's aim in a helicopter very </connor>
<connor> impressed you know must have had some </connor>
<connor> very </connor>
<connor> background okay like when i watch a show </connor>
<connor> that was good but not like life-changing </connor>
<connor> it kind of just goes </connor>
<connor> in the back of my head and i remember </connor>
<garnt> like well apparently if you watch </garnt>
<garnt> life-changing shows you don't remember </garnt>
<garnt> the music anyway so </garnt>
<connor> it's like i remember the boca rano theme </connor>
<joey> i remember the pokemon </joey>
<joey> everyone knows that song though that's </joey>
<connor> all i remember from boca rato the music </connor>
<joey> though </joey>
<joey> so you don't remember the soundtrack no </joey>
<joey> not at all i remember the soundtrack </joey>
<joey> being pretty good to book arona </joey>
<connor> no clue um actually i don't remember </connor>
<joey> that yeah i i just remember the opening </joey>
<garnt> this man doesn't remember one single </garnt>
<connor> soundtrack because </connor>
<garnt> because after after last episode or </garnt>
<joey> sorry a couple of episodes back uh </joey>
<joey> i went and re-watched a couple of </joey>
<joey> episodes of volcarano just because i </joey>
<joey> hadn't seen it in such a long time and </joey>
<connor> the sound i remember the soundtrack i </connor>
<joey> was like wow this soundtrack </joey>
<connor> for sure really [ __ ] good it's like </connor>
<connor> for some reason i cannot for the life of </connor>
<connor> me </connor>
<connor> remember character names after the end </connor>
<connor> of the show like </connor>
<connor> i'm just like it's the blue haired one </connor>
<connor> and he does something </connor>
<joey> it's not even monkey breeze it's </joey>
<connor> goldfish i </connor>
<joey> genuinely like it's so weird because </joey>
<joey> i'll remember so many things vividly in </joey>
<joey> my life but when it comes to </joey>
<connor> entertainment and stuff that i consume </connor>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> it goes i mean i guess that's good </joey>
<joey> because you probably just </joey>
<connor> infinite rewatch ability right yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i can re-watch shows and not get </connor>
<joey> enjoyment out there </joey>
<joey> i forget what because i forget half the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] that i've seen right </connor>
<connor> like uh what are they we watched </connor>
<connor> something recently and i remember being </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> very impressed because i'm like i forgot </connor>
<joey> all right we watched breaking bad and i </joey>
<joey> was like i forgot </joey>
<joey> all of this [ __ ] yeah through seasons </joey>
<joey> one through five i don't remember </joey>
<joey> anything i mean that's a long show so </joey>
<joey> that makes sense </joey>
<joey> yeah but yeah that's i don't know is </joey>
<connor> that weird i'm sure there's people in </connor>
<connor> the comments who are the same were like </connor>
<connor> don't remember any characters i don't </connor>
<joey> remember the soundtracks i've i've met </joey>
<joey> i've met someone </joey>
<connor> why are you watching adam yeah i love </connor>
<connor> the experience like </connor>
<connor> leave me alone i get what i get out of </connor>
<joey> it you enjoy the experience that you </joey>
<garnt> don't remember after hands </garnt>
<garnt> do you remember this i've legitimately </garnt>
<garnt> never had this conversation </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like this this conversation is the </garnt>
<garnt> first to me i've never i've never had to </garnt>
<garnt> explain </garnt>
<garnt> to someone why music is like a good </garnt>
<connor> thing no no no no no in terms of </connor>
<connor> entertainment no i'm not i'm not arguing </connor>
<garnt> that it's not a good </garnt>
<garnt> thing i just don't remember it okay i'm </garnt>
<connor> convinced right that people </connor>
<connor> lie about like when you have discussions </connor>
<garnt> with them and you're like yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> remember the soundtrack i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> convinced that they're just like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah it was totally great i mean </garnt>
<garnt> like the sun there's </garnt>
<garnt> like definitely people who do that all </garnt>
<garnt> the time no but like to say there's like </garnt>
<garnt> not a single soundtrack </garnt>
<garnt> from like some of your favorite series i </garnt>
<garnt> can't remember anything </garnt>
<garnt> but if you hear it if i hear it i reckon </garnt>
<garnt> i'll be able to pull out that memory </garnt>
<connor> from the </connor>
<joey> dusty old cabinet right but then you'll </joey>
<joey> pull it out and what you'll pull out a </joey>
<connor> file that just says good </connor>
<connor> i'm like nice but it's like okay it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<audio> i can remember voice performances quite </audio>
<audio> well but that's because i </audio>
<connor> i take an active interest in really </connor>
<connor> learning those and really studying that </connor>
<garnt> so what do you sell makes a good voice </garnt>
<garnt> performance then </garnt>
<garnt> and is it something that has to be in </garnt>
<garnt> english or does it have </garnt>
<garnt> can you recognize it in like japanese </garnt>
<connor> yeah japanese too but i think that's </connor>
<connor> just from watching a lot of japanese </connor>
<connor> media </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's something that you can because </garnt>
<garnt> the way you deliver a line </garnt>
<garnt> anything right the way i visu a line </garnt>
<garnt> there's a uh when you deliver a singular </garnt>
<connor> line there's a visualization to it of </connor>
<connor> if you imagine the pacing and the pitch </connor>
<connor> like they should in my head </connor>
<connor> with a good line there's a set where it </connor>
<joey> should be delivered right and that's the </joey>
<connor> way the director wants it to and </connor>
<joey> i imagine like someone like quentin </joey>
<audio> tarantino has the same idea it's like </audio>
<audio> the line is delivered </audio>
<audio> the way i see it yeah right and so it's </audio>
<audio> like </audio>
<audio> i just visualize in my head the way it </audio>
<audio> should go like if you should raise your </audio>
<audio> voice how you should raise your pitch </audio>
<audio> and then </audio>
<audio> when you should take it down when you </audio>
<audio> should slow it down when you should out </audio>
<audio> of pause </audio>
<audio> and it's really interesting seeing how </audio>
<connor> like some of the actors will deliver a </connor>
<connor> certain line and where they'll choose to </connor>
<connor> take pauses </connor>
<connor> or how they'll choose to slow words down </connor>
<joey> i think that's really interesting </joey>
<joey> oh i'm the same like you know i haven't </joey>
<joey> done as much voicing yeah as you but </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i definitely take a keen eye to voice </joey>
<joey> acting as well because i also want to </joey>
<joey> get better at it yeah and i i i </joey>
<joey> totally get what you mean with the cult </joey>
<connor> curve there's the way i wish that like </connor>
<connor> i wish i had figured out a way where i </connor>
<joey> could definitively show people what i </joey>
<joey> mean in my head </joey>
<joey> right yeah about that because if you put </joey>
<joey> the line on like an axis of y and </joey>
<joey> like x you know they would it would go </joey>
<connor> like that right yeah </connor>
<connor> it would be like right you need to pause </connor>
<connor> here you need to take a break here slow </connor>
<garnt> down this word this word's in italics so </garnt>
<garnt> please put emphasis on it but not too </garnt>
<garnt> much emphasis yeah very bold </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's like really loads of nuances </garnt>
<audio> that we don't see as the audience that </audio>
<garnt> i'm trying </garnt>
<garnt> in my head when i'm listening to </garnt>
<garnt> something i'm imagining how they saw the </garnt>
<garnt> script </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm trying to think back to what </garnt>
<garnt> they were thinking so like </garnt>
<garnt> depending on what medium we're in now </garnt>
<garnt> like and also </garnt>
<joey> ever since i got way too into voice </joey>
<joey> acting i see so much adr and it puts me </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] off in films when you can hear </joey>
<joey> one line that's delivered in the room </joey>
<joey> yep and one line whether you get it in </joey>
<joey> post </joey>
<joey> yeah it's so grating when you hear </joey>
<garnt> because like so many sitcoms do this </garnt>
<garnt> where they like have the line done in </garnt>
<garnt> post yeah you don't realize how many </garnt>
<connor> movies are done in post as well i don't </connor>
<garnt> know a lot of you have done so well then </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah i've definitely noticed it </connor>
<connor> recently when i was like </connor>
<connor> yeah like when you noticed it once you </connor>
<garnt> can't stop noticing it </garnt>
<connor> i noticed and and that's the problem i </connor>
<connor> have with um </connor>
<audio> watching shows that are dubbed in </audio>
<audio> languages like </audio>
<audio> uh you know italian or whatever or or </audio>
<audio> dutch normally </audio>
<joey> they're they have to dub so many shows </joey>
<joey> where they're just pumping this out and </joey>
<joey> there's not really much given to the </joey>
<connor> sound of it and it sounds like </connor>
<connor> everyone's </connor>
<connor> in a studio every single tv show they're </connor>
<connor> in no matter where they go </connor>
<connor> when i hear this italian or this dutch </connor>
<connor> guy speak it always sounds like they're </connor>
<audio> in a studio when they're outside it's </audio>
<audio> like what the [ __ ] i hate that </audio>
<audio> so much and that's the reason why when </audio>
<audio> people are like oh i watched </audio>
<audio> i had a german friend who watched game </audio>
<audio> of thrones in dutch or a german sorry </audio>
<audio> dubbed </audio>
<audio> and i was like why it sounds like </audio>
<connor> everyone's in a studio they want a </connor>
<garnt> battlefield no </garnt>
<garnt> it's exactly the same as thai dubs when </garnt>
<connor> i was talking about </connor>
<garnt> dubs and they just don't know audio </garnt>
<garnt> mixing so instead of like making it </garnt>
<garnt> sound like they're in the environment </garnt>
<garnt> they're in </garnt>
<garnt> it's always in the same studio and </garnt>
<garnt> instead of like mixing in the voices </garnt>
<joey> they just like quiet </joey>
<joey> every other voice and every other sound </joey>
<joey> every other sound so the voices are just </joey>
<joey> like 10 times louder than every sound </joey>
<joey> effect every time someone talks and then </joey>
<joey> the sound effects get louder again oh my </joey>
<joey> god it's like the worst kind of audio </joey>
<connor> mixing </connor>
<connor> that's lazy as [ __ ] yeah i mean now </connor>
<connor> i'm not sure if they did it back then </connor>
<audio> but now commonly the japanese uh </audio>
<audio> studios will just give uh basically a </audio>
<joey> track with just </joey>
<audio> the voices taken out yeah and they're </audio>
<joey> like here's everything we've done it all </joey>
<joey> for you </joey>
<joey> just add the voices yeah normally quite </joey>
<joey> easy um but yeah but the </joey>
<connor> in terms of dubbing or voice </connor>
<connor> performances in anime </connor>
<garnt> cartoons that's a whole different like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i feel like i feel like one </garnt>
<garnt> unsung hero in terms of like voice </garnt>
<connor> acting and dubbing is the voice director </connor>
<connor> because i i feel like obviously you know </connor>
<connor> actors get </connor>
<connor> a lot of the credits but i feel they </connor>
<audio> also get all the [ __ ] they always get </audio>
<audio> all the [ __ ] </audio>
<audio> and i feel like the a voice director has </audio>
<audio> so much control </audio>
<audio> over how good this voice performance is </audio>
<audio> going to be because i've definitely </audio>
<connor> worked with voice actors and actresses </connor>
<connor> in my own bridge series </connor>
<connor> where they've done a great [ __ ] job </connor>
<connor> and then i i see them voicing like other </connor>
<connor> projects </connor>
<garnt> and it's terrible it's it's bad yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> hurts me because i know </garnt>
<garnt> the potential that these voice actors </garnt>
<connor> have um and i know that </connor>
<connor> it's probably just bad voice direction </connor>
<connor> you know and they're gone </connor>
<connor> and a lot of people don't think about </connor>
<garnt> that or don't know that because they </garnt>
<garnt> just think oh that </garnt>
<joey> it's a shitty voice actor you know yeah </joey>
<joey> it's a real shame </joey>
<connor> it's difficult because unless you've </connor>
<audio> been in an environment where you've </audio>
<audio> worked with a director </audio>
<audio> or had someone directing you in any way </audio>
<garnt> it's really hard to understand the role </garnt>
<garnt> of a director </garnt>
<garnt> yes i didn't quite get it until i had </garnt>
<garnt> worked in that space </garnt>
<joey> and it's kind of the person who like </joey>
<joey> because when you're doing it for </joey>
<joey> yourself and you're acting </joey>
<audio> you're in your own head you're your </audio>
<joey> worst enemy because you're like [ __ ] i </joey>
<audio> should've done it this way </audio>
<audio> because when i've recorded for one of my </audio>
<joey> own videos 20 takes </joey>
<joey> i record for someone else with a </joey>
<joey> director one or two texts yeah because </joey>
<joey> they tell me what they want and they </joey>
<joey> help me get there and a lot of people </joey>
<joey> like there's ten percent of voice actors </joey>
<joey> who can deliver lines </joey>
<joey> amazingly without a director yeah but </joey>
<joey> then there's like 50 who need a director </joey>
<connor> yeah and there's like 30 40 percent who </connor>
<connor> let's be honest </connor>
<connor> but it's one of those things where you </connor>
<connor> do need like a good ear somewhat it's a </connor>
<joey> skill </joey>
<joey> absolutely it's definitely a skill </joey>
<joey> because i personally think i'm a much </joey>
<joey> better voice director than i am a voice </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> even though i've done both i try to like </joey>
<joey> insert my own voice as little as </joey>
<connor> possible whenever i'm </connor>
<connor> doing kind of any kind of voice work </connor>
<connor> that i've done before </connor>
<connor> but i really enjoy directing because </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's definitely </connor>
<connor> a unique skill because i've seen how </connor>
<connor> other people direct </connor>
<connor> their their work as well and it's </connor>
<audio> everyone has a different style </audio>
<audio> some are just not effective at all some </audio>
<audio> some </audio>
<audio> some voice directors you know they they </audio>
<audio> have no idea what they want no </audio>
<audio> you know and yeah it's just on the voice </audio>
<audio> actor to save </audio>
<audio> to save the performance somehow even </audio>
<audio> though the director has no idea what </audio>
<audio> they want </audio>
<audio> um do you ever get that moment though </audio>
<garnt> when you're directing someone </garnt>
<garnt> and you they've not delivered the line </garnt>
<garnt> exactly the way you want it and so you </garnt>
<garnt> have to explain it to them </garnt>
<garnt> and you get to the third point yeah the </garnt>
<garnt> third it's </garnt>
<garnt> the third time the third time you've </garnt>
<garnt> tried and they still </garnt>
<garnt> haven't done it the way you want it to </garnt>
<garnt> do </garnt>
<garnt> do you continue like do you do you </garnt>
<garnt> continue trying to explain it to them or </garnt>
<connor> do you just go with one of the takes </connor>
<connor> normally i will do i would try my best </connor>
<connor> to explain it to them </connor>
<connor> yeah um worst case scenario i'll do </connor>
<audio> a line read which line read is uh you </audio>
<audio> don't normally do it it's kind of </audio>
<audio> it's not unprofessional but it wastes a </audio>
<audio> lot of time which is where the director </audio>
<audio> will deliver the line </audio>
<joey> and he'll be like just copy what i just </joey>
<audio> did yeah and that's what i'll do on the </audio>
<joey> worst case scenario </joey>
<connor> and if they can't do that then it's like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<audio> this is going to be bad like if they if </audio>
<connor> they can't hear want like </connor>
<garnt> what i just did yeah and they can't </garnt>
<garnt> replicate it that means that they have </garnt>
<garnt> no idea what i just did yeah </garnt>
<garnt> in my head i'm like okay they don't even </garnt>
<garnt> see what i did they don't know what </garnt>
<garnt> they're doing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's the worst feeling in the world </garnt>
<connor> isn't it </connor>
<connor> it's pretty awful today's video is </connor>
<garnt> sponsored by xenonsard zenonsart is a </garnt>
<garnt> unique ai based anime card game for the </garnt>
<garnt> mobile that's just been recently </garnt>
<joey> released </joey>
<joey> so do you guys know what the ai card </joey>
<garnt> game is i have no idea what ai </garnt>
<joey> so basically the ar card game so in the </joey>
<joey> game you get an ai buddy that you can </joey>
<joey> choose from and and the choice of the a </joey>
<joey> but i think there's 16 different ai </joey>
<joey> characters that you can choose from and </joey>
<joey> it's based off of this interview that </joey>
<joey> you do at the beginning of the game that </joey>
<joey> dictates your personality and right you </joey>
<joey> pick the ai that best suits your </joey>
<joey> personality but basically </joey>
<connor> you have an ai buddy that plays along </connor>
<connor> and helps you strategize </connor>
<connor> to play zenon's which is this card game </connor>
<connor> and the ai buddy like gives you </connor>
<connor> legitimate advice on the games like how </connor>
<connor> you can beat the game and like different </connor>
<connor> strategies and </connor>
<connor> you don't have to follow the ai but you </connor>
<connor> know a lot of the ais are </connor>
<connor> acute girls and sometimes they're just </connor>
<connor> like really cool characters and you're </connor>
<connor> like okay you know what you're you're an </connor>
<joey> ai </joey>
<connor> i'll listen to you yeah yeah yeah so as </connor>
<connor> i understand it there's also </connor>
<connor> 500 different cards with seven different </connor>
<connor> categories and i've also seen a few </connor>
<connor> clips of the game and the visuals </connor>
<connor> look pretty damn impressive for a mobile </connor>
<joey> game so the actual gameplay involves </joey>
<joey> three phases you have the mono movement </joey>
<joey> phase the flash phase and the main phase </joey>
<joey> and the unique feature about zenon zod </joey>
<joey> is the mana movement system where you </joey>
<joey> can </joey>
<joey> move summoned minions to and from mana </joey>
<joey> in kind of a </joey>
<joey> really interesting recycling mechanism </joey>

<joey> cards thank you to xenozap for </joey>
<joey> sponsoring today's episode </joey>
<connor> and back to the video i did a video </connor>
<connor> series where i like fixed </connor>
<connor> uh games hentai anime i redid all the </connor>
<connor> voice acting from the ground up um and </connor>
<connor> the only rule was that </connor>
<connor> i wasn't allowed to change uh i was i </connor>
<connor> wasn't changing anything </connor>
<connor> about the voice acting the whole point </connor>
<audio> of that was to like prove to the viewers </audio>
<audio> that like </audio>
<audio> listen you could you can fix the bad </audio>
<audio> voice acting but more often than not </audio>
<audio> it's </audio>
<audio> not the bad voice acting that is </audio>
<audio> terrible about this series or </audio>
<audio> thing that you watch like it's normally </audio>
<audio> just because like everything else is </audio>
<audio> terrible yeah and the one thing that </audio>
<audio> stands out is this dude who's delivering </audio>
<joey> a line [ __ ] like yeah yeah </joey>
<audio> but that's normally as a result of </audio>
<audio> everything else being [ __ ] because voice </audio>
<audio> actors are the last priority for most </audio>
<audio> things </audio>
<audio> because they're normally the thing that </audio>
<audio> you do at the end and some games and </audio>
<audio> stuff like games </audio>
<audio> are normally the worst uh worst culprit </audio>
<audio> of terrible voice acting </audio>
<audio> oh no no especially japanese games that </audio>
<connor> get translated into english </connor>
<connor> normally have god [ __ ] awful voice </connor>
<joey> actions </joey>
<joey> a lot of those games as well just have </joey>
<joey> absolutely horrible </joey>
<joey> localization just the dialogue clearly </joey>
<joey> the person who was translating it </joey>
<joey> does not have the firmest grasp of both </joey>
<connor> languages and it's because normally </connor>
<connor> they're not given like </connor>
<connor> like an amazing budget to do it no these </connor>
<connor> games are long </connor>
<joey> pretty underpaid unfortunately yeah so </joey>
<connor> they're just like whatever i'll just do </connor>
<audio> the </audio>
<audio> minimum run it through google translate </audio>
<audio> if need be you know [ __ ] it no one's </audio>
<connor> going to notice the voice things </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] anyway who cares the japanese word </connor>
<garnt> in with like okasan you know </garnt>
<joey> yeah means mom in japanese </joey>
<joey> all according to keikaku like speaking </joey>
<audio> about voice actors and voice acting </audio>
<connor> like the only person who's actually been </connor>
<joey> in an anime here is you joe yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm like an actual japanese anime like </joey>
<joey> what was the experience like for you </joey>
<joey> then </joey>
<garnt> that was really cool because you want to </garnt>
<garnt> explain like you're on pop team episode </garnt>
<joey> yes </joey>
<joey> yeah so i just purely by coincidence i </joey>
<garnt> got to voice in pop team epic </garnt>
<garnt> uh even though all my lines i did were </garnt>
<garnt> in english it was technically </garnt>
<garnt> it was technically the japanese i'm in </garnt>
<garnt> i know because funimation dubbed pop </garnt>
<joey> team epic </joey>
<connor> and they didn't use me i don't think </connor>
<connor> they're allowed to though </connor>
<joey> no they weren't but you know </joey>
<garnt> fundamentally you could've hit me off </garnt>
<garnt> my dms were open my dms were we follow </garnt>
<garnt> each other on twitter </garnt>
<audio> you could have dm me anyway so i voiced </audio>
<audio> uh </audio>
<audio> this it was this entire episode that was </audio>
<joey> voiced in english because pogba maybe </joey>
<joey> it's just </joey>
<joey> crazy no rules right um and it was </joey>
<garnt> really cool because </garnt>
<garnt> uh i got to voice act with the guy who </garnt>
<audio> voiced rio in devilman crybaby </audio>
<audio> oh awesome because he's also fluent in </audio>
<joey> english he's pretty </joey>
<joey> good at english oh wow yeah so he and he </joey>
<joey> delivered obviously in the english part </joey>
<joey> as well </joey>
<joey> and it was really cool because it you </joey>
<connor> know it's a lot of the portrayals is </connor>
<connor> of voice acting is that you know one </connor>
<connor> person goes into the booth they do their </connor>
<connor> lines </connor>
<connor> next person comes in it's normal that's </connor>
<connor> normally how it is but i don't know if </connor>
<connor> this is only in the japanese industry </connor>
<connor> but at least with the anime </connor>
<joey> they put all the voice actors that are </joey>
<joey> in the one </joey>
<joey> episode all into the same room and there </joey>
<joey> are four or five microphones lined up </joey>
<garnt> yeah i i saw i saw that with some like </garnt>
<joey> behind the scenes documentary yeah </joey>
<joey> i think how i understand the dubbing in </joey>
<garnt> like the english speaking world is that </garnt>
<garnt> you get one booth </garnt>
<joey> one one one after the other one but in </joey>
<audio> anime it's </audio>
<audio> you they do it all in one go so if </audio>
<audio> there's a current scene </audio>
<joey> where there are four voice actors then </joey>
<joey> all four voice actors will go up to the </joey>
<joey> mics and </joey>
<joey> basically while holding them the the </joey>
<joey> script in their hand take it in turns to </joey>
<joey> deliver their line and when they're not </joey>
<joey> doing their line they pull away from the </joey>
<connor> microphone i think </connor>
<connor> all cartoons used to be that way in the </connor>
<joey> world yeah i think recently it's changed </joey>
<garnt> i think so i think one series you </garnt>
<connor> definitely see that effect in </connor>
<audio> is conoceber where you can you can tell </audio>
<connor> that all of the characters are just like </connor>
<connor> bouncing off each other oh yeah </connor>
<connor> so much yeah and like the dub the dub </connor>
<connor> for conor super is actually great </connor>
<connor> and i commend them for being able to </connor>
<garnt> like recreate this energy while not </garnt>
<garnt> being in the same room because because </garnt>
<garnt> you can definitely feel that energy in </garnt>
<garnt> the japanese dub i mean connoisseur oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah that's what makes one of it's </joey>
<joey> that that's why it's so good because you </joey>
<joey> can tell that these aren't just </joey>
<joey> characters that are [ __ ] around with </joey>
<joey> one another but yeah </joey>
<joey> voice actors that are just having a </joey>
<joey> great time yeah exactly and you need </joey>
<joey> that dynamic in a show like that yeah </joey>
<joey> and but it was really cool because with </joey>
<joey> pop team epic </joey>
<joey> uh you know we would all come on to one </joey>
<garnt> scene you know there was me </garnt>
<garnt> you know the main voice actor and then </garnt>
<garnt> there was like three or four voice </garnt>
<garnt> actors who were doing </garnt>
<garnt> you know just side characters yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> it was really cool because once a scene </garnt>
<garnt> would finish </garnt>
<garnt> then if one of us needed a retake or it </garnt>
<audio> was really cool because all of the voice </audio>
<audio> actors would come together and basically </audio>
<audio> critique </audio>
<audio> what we all just did in that one song </audio>
<audio> that's cool so that we would all come </audio>
<joey> together and i would get </joey>
<joey> you know professional advice from the </joey>
<joey> the voice actor or being like </joey>
<joey> okay that lion deliver was really cool </joey>
<garnt> but maybe if you deliver this next line </garnt>
<garnt> like this </garnt>
<garnt> then i could respond in this kind of way </garnt>
<garnt> oh okay and while all of this </garnt>
<garnt> conversation is happening </garnt>
<audio> the voice director is also listening in </audio>
<joey> so he can put in the input of his right </joey>
<joey> if need be </joey>
<joey> um so i mean i didn't have to do too </joey>
<joey> many retakes with pop team epic because </joey>
<joey> the voice actor was just like yeah </joey>
<joey> that's good he just did not give a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> right he was just like yeah good enough </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] whatever i mean like you you're </garnt>
<garnt> speaking in english so he was like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this this probably sounds better than </garnt>
<joey> right most of the english voice actors </joey>
<joey> the only time that the voice actor asked </joey>
<garnt> me to do </garnt>
<joey> the voice director asked me to do </joey>
<joey> something super specific was when i had </joey>
<audio> to do </audio>
<audio> the narrator voice uh for the guilty </audio>
<audio> gear parody scene where i had to say </audio>
<audio> heaven or hell </audio>
<audio> like in guilty gear and he was like no </audio>
<audio> no because the voice director was like a </audio>
<joey> massive fan of guilty </joey>
<joey> so he's like no no that's not how you </joey>
<joey> say it you have to say like this and you </joey>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<joey> boom it over the pr system all </joey>
<joey> okay i'll do it like that i guess that </joey>
<connor> sounds like such a fun experience oh it </connor>
<garnt> was super fun </garnt>
<garnt> were you nervous doing it oh hell yeah </garnt>
<joey> because </joey>
<audio> literally everybody else around me are </audio>
<audio> professional japanese voice actors </audio>
<audio> but it was really cool because all of </audio>
<connor> the voice actors were like wow how long </connor>
<connor> have you been doing voice acting i was </connor>
<connor> like i </connor>
<connor> this is my first day technically </connor>
<garnt> speaking this is my first gig </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like you're really [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> good i was like well </joey>
<connor> call your boy back and then everyone </connor>
<connor> cheered </connor>
<connor> everyone lifted joey up </connor>
<joey> i was like subscribe damn dude i do i've </joey>
<joey> had some terrible [ __ ] clients </joey>
<joey> did a lot of commercials because they </joey>
<joey> would bring in like a business executive </joey>
<joey> right to come in and critique and they </joey>
<audio> don't [ __ ] know anything </audio>
<audio> right and they would i remember one time </audio>
<audio> there was a guy and </audio>
<audio> i did this whole take and i thought i </audio>
<joey> killed it </joey>
<joey> and he was like yeah something's like </joey>
<joey> off with it this wasn't the director </joey>
<joey> this was just the guy who was paying for </joey>
<joey> it to be made </joey>
<joey> and he was like yeah could you just try </joey>
<joey> something different i did the exact same </joey>
<connor> thing again </connor>
<connor> no different and he was like that was </connor>
<connor> perfect and i was like i was like i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] knew it </connor>
<connor> because like i know okay i in my head </connor>
<connor> i'm like i know i can get away with </connor>
<connor> doing the same thing </connor>
<connor> one more time but like maybe not a </connor>
<connor> second time so i was like i'll just try </connor>
<connor> once see if he notices he had no idea </connor>
<connor> yeah at that point onwards any time he </connor>
<connor> said anything i would just look at the </connor>
<connor> voice director </connor>
<connor> over there i would look at him i'm like </connor>
<joey> should i listen to this </joey>
<connor> like he was the engineer and the </connor>
<joey> director of the thing right yeah </joey>
<joey> which he so he normally does the deliver </joey>
<joey> uh the way i the way it was set up for </joey>
<audio> me was he normally directed me and the </audio>
<audio> client would just stand there and go </audio>
<audio> like </audio>
<joey> yes yes like because i was always doing </joey>
<joey> business stuff </joey>
<joey> right it was like it was like </joey>
<connor> perseverance inspiration </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] like that you did like a gillette </joey>
<joey> commercial right or it wasn't </joey>
<joey> like a like a shaving cream commercial </joey>
<connor> whatever it was something </connor>
<connor> it was ages ago i was doing like </connor>
<connor> boats for like a year you did both i did </connor>
<connor> like uh </connor>
<connor> there was some i can't i don't know what </connor>
<connor> the corporation is and i also don't know </connor>
<connor> if i should say i don't know if i'm </connor>
<connor> allowed i don't know what i signed i </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> once a week i would go in for three </connor>
<connor> hours and i would talk about </connor>
<joey> boats wait how old were you this was </joey>
<joey> like last year oh really </joey>
<connor> every week i went in and talked about i </connor>
<connor> was in london right yes it was in london </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i got paid like [ __ ] like how much </connor>
<connor> was it they were paying me </connor>
<connor> 250 pounds an hour oh wow uh which is </connor>
<connor> like 300 something bucks </connor>
<garnt> yeah just talk about boats which is </garnt>
<garnt> probably like a lot better than what </garnt>
<garnt> voice actors get paid to voice an anime </garnt>
<connor> yeah definitely uh yeah anime rates </connor>
<connor> aren't that great i mean i don't i don't </connor>
<joey> know if </joey>
<joey> you know i'm gonna i'll just say like i </joey>
<joey> mean i definitely didn't get paid </joey>
<joey> i've heard things and uh i you know you </joey>
<joey> get paid on </joey>
<joey> funimation from what i've been told i </joey>
<garnt> don't know if this is true i don't know </garnt>
<connor> i'm allowed to say this but it's not </connor>
<connor> it's not great it's not </connor>
<garnt> i feel less than what i was getting yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i it's like i think it's always </garnt>
<connor> just been known that the voice </connor>
<connor> acting industry in anime specifically </connor>
<connor> just like paid the least </connor>
<connor> yeah you get paid the lease out of any </connor>
<connor> commercial which is why you see a lot of </connor>
<joey> dubbed voice actors going on to do </joey>
<connor> gaming now yeah </connor>
<connor> industries the the way it goes is like </connor>
<connor> it's like uh </connor>
<connor> normally commercials pay the most </connor>
<joey> because commercials you get paid </joey>
<joey> normally a premium and then you also get </joey>
<joey> what's called a buyout fee </joey>
<joey> so if your ad is going to be played over </joey>
<joey> x amount of places with radios tv that </joey>
<audio> gets calculated in the cost yeah and you </audio>
<audio> could get like </audio>
<audio> one commercial that takes you 20 minutes </audio>
<audio> which it often did because commercials </audio>
<audio> are </audio>
<audio> 30 seconds long mostly and i would never </audio>
<connor> be there for more than 30 minutes </connor>
<joey> but they would maybe pay you like 15 </joey>
<connor> grand for the biopsy </connor>
<joey> so your session fee was like 250 pounds </joey>
<connor> yeah but then you might get 15 grand or </connor>
<connor> 10. </connor>
<connor> depending on where they play it and how </connor>
<connor> much because i know the guy who did </connor>
<joey> mcdonald's ads in the uk that was his </joey>
<joey> whole career yeah he's doing mcdonald's </joey>
<joey> really yeah because you got </joey>
<joey> he got paid so far oh yeah it is </joey>
<joey> mcdonald's game like six figures every </joey>
<joey> commercial </joey>
<connor> because you know that's luckily how the </connor>
<connor> industry was that you got paid if your </connor>
<joey> voice was being could you imagine </joey>
<joey> getting paid six </joey>
<connor> figures by going but i wish right </connor>
<garnt> that's the thing he was like imagine how </garnt>
<garnt> much how much money mcdonald's made off </garnt>
<connor> of </connor>
<connor> because normally how it is with </connor>
<connor> commercials is that if you're </connor>
<connor> normally with voices if a corporation </connor>
<connor> gets one voice actor it's normally </connor>
<connor> always that one voice actor who does </connor>
<connor> everything so </connor>
<connor> in the industry where i when i was in </connor>
<connor> london it was mainly commercial stuff so </connor>
<connor> it came up a lot and it was always like </connor>
<connor> people were competing </connor>
<connor> to get that one commercial gig that kept </connor>
<connor> coming yeah and so i got this boat gig </connor>
<connor> and i didn't think of anything of it um </connor>
<connor> because i didn't audition they like </connor>
<connor> requested me so i went in i did a read </connor>
<connor> for it and i was talking about </connor>
<connor> um i had to explain a ton of different </connor>
<connor> things about large ships </connor>
<connor> for a corporation okay and i had to go </connor>
<connor> in every week and do something </connor>
<garnt> ballasting that was what i did like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] four weeks of thing called </garnt>
<garnt> ballasting right </garnt>
<garnt> ballasting is a thing and i know this </garnt>
<garnt> because i did four scripts </garnt>
<garnt> sell us a bit what what is ballasting </garnt>
<garnt> sir he was like it was like it was like </garnt>
<garnt> god i wish i remembered the words </garnt>
<audio> and i remember every time i would go in </audio>
<audio> to deliver it because my accent is </audio>
<audio> is english right but it's not uh receive </audio>
<audio> pronunciation which is the </audio>
<audio> typical accent which is i say grass but </audio>
<connor> it's grass </connor>
<audio> so every time i would do anything he's </audio>
<joey> like you didn't you didn't say the the </joey>
<joey> received pronunciation </joey>
<joey> do it again i'm like oh yes of course </joey>
<joey> ballasting you know is the you know like </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> and it was basically where water goes in </joey>
<garnt> the ships and they dunk it dump it out </garnt>
<garnt> later on okay but there was like so many </garnt>
<audio> scientific words and i was like </audio>
<audio> it was the the sodium hydrosis oxide </audio>
<connor> oxygenation thing and i was like all </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> the hard thing about that is that you </connor>
<joey> could do a thing called line reading </joey>
<joey> where </joey>
<connor> they're paying you to get this right the </connor>
<joey> first time yeah so the first time i see </joey>
<joey> the script is when i go in there </joey>
<joey> yeah and i'm sure that was at the same </joey>
<connor> for you with popped humans you could see </connor>
<joey> it beforehand </joey>
<joey> with pop team epic i got sent not only </joey>
<connor> the script about </connor>
<connor> three weeks before i went in yeah but i </connor>
<connor> also got a cd </connor>
<connor> with [ __ ] the actual visuals that's like </connor>
<garnt> amazing </garnt>
<joey> so i can practice ahead of time and </joey>
<joey> apparently that's normal in the anime </joey>
<garnt> industry </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's just like the japanese </garnt>
<joey> trust system yeah i mean like it's like </joey>
<garnt> we </garnt>
<garnt> trust that you will not leak this that </garnt>
<joey> just sounds like a leak waiting to </joey>
<garnt> happen because i didn't any other i </garnt>
<joey> didn't sign a contract </joey>
<garnt> either yeah they just got sent this </garnt>
<joey> without an ending </joey>
<joey> they just sent it to me hoping that i </joey>
<connor> wouldn't leave this bro i </connor>
<connor> i i can maybe count on my hands the </connor>
<joey> amount of time </joey>
<joey> i received the script before i got there </joey>
<joey> like yeah it was like </joey>
<joey> never really yeah and so i would get the </joey>
<joey> script in front of me i'd maybe have two </joey>
<joey> minutes to quickly go over it </joey>
<joey> but they immediately expected me to like </joey>
<joey> nail it first time and again there's </joey>
<joey> words </joey>
<connor> i've never even seen the english </connor>
<connor> language they come up in these scripts </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> i don't know what these words are but </connor>
<connor> i'm expected to like nail it whilst i'm </connor>
<connor> also reading it for the first time </connor>
<connor> and that's what they're paying you an </connor>
<garnt> absurd amount of money like i know </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] people who run like official </garnt>
<connor> discords for like bandai or something </connor>
<garnt> you have to sign ndas </garnt>
<connor> yeah and here you are just actually </connor>
<joey> voice </joey>
<garnt> getting it the entire script is episode </garnt>
<joey> nine </joey>
<audio> six months before it comes out good luck </audio>
<joey> no it was crazy like i got it in the </joey>
<audio> mail they didn't even tell me they were </audio>
<audio> going to send it because i was also </audio>
<connor> assuming that i was going to see the </connor>
<connor> script and everything yeah </connor>
<connor> when i got that's not how it is yeah </connor>
<connor> right that's what i heard about dubbing </connor>
<connor> do that as well </connor>
<connor> yeah that's what i heard but not only </connor>
<joey> that but when i when i also cameoed uh </joey>
<connor> in the uh grissiah phantom trigger </connor>
<connor> game yeah they also sent me the script </connor>
<connor> like two weeks beforehand as well </connor>
<connor> they didn't send me the visuals but they </connor>
<joey> sent me the script like the physical </joey>
<connor> script and i had to go in with my </connor>
<connor> physical script i think the difference </connor>
<connor> is </connor>
<joey> normally in the western industries </joey>
<joey> they're still editing the script like </joey>
<joey> the day off </joey>
<joey> yeah like so normally the script that </joey>
<connor> you get might not even be the final </connor>
<garnt> draft </garnt>
<garnt> also people don't trust anyone in the </garnt>
<connor> world which is which is </connor>
<connor> of course you know this is this is the </connor>
<connor> country the way you can leave like your </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] laptop in the middle of a diner </garnt>
<garnt> go to the bathroom and then come back </garnt>
<garnt> and just trust that nobody's gonna take </garnt>
<connor> it yeah </connor>
<connor> you know i just wanted to leak the boat </connor>
<joey> stuff i don't even care i just want to </joey>
<joey> leak it </joey>
<audio> no one can i just want to leak it don't </audio>
<joey> get it don't tell anybody but they use </joey>
<joey> sodium hydroxide </joey>
<connor> yeah that it's crazy but i mean you know </connor>
<joey> did you get paid well for the both thing </joey>
<connor> though oh yeah i got paid really well oh </connor>
<joey> yeah but that's like that's like the </joey>
<joey> voice actors stream is </joey>
<joey> i didn't i didn't i didn't do it for the </joey>
<joey> money i should because it was fun yeah </joey>
<joey> well that's yeah same with me like </joey>
<garnt> i i feel like people who go into </garnt>
<garnt> especially like the anime industry to </garnt>
<garnt> who wants to be a voice actor </garnt>
<connor> they do it for the passion you get paid </connor>
<audio> nothing for those sessions </audio>
<audio> i mean maybe unless you're a sag actor </audio>
<audio> yeah you get paid a decent amount i </audio>
<connor> think it's 250 dollars minimum for a </connor>
<connor> session two-hour session </connor>
<connor> um but yeah it's you get the notoriety </connor>
<connor> which allows you to do a lot </connor>
<garnt> yeah right yeah i don't know because i </garnt>
<audio> feel like nowadays </audio>
<connor> there's less notoriety and like big </connor>
<audio> voice acting names yeah </audio>
<connor> in dubbing at least than than they're </connor>
<connor> used to true they used to be cons right </connor>
<audio> that's what you wanted </audio>
<audio> yeah yeah yeah exactly but now like if </audio>
<audio> even if you get to voice a dub in like a </audio>
<joey> huge huge show there's like you still </joey>
<joey> don't get as much notoriety as like say </joey>
<joey> um back in like the mid-2000s where you </joey>
<joey> had voice actors like steve bloom johnny </joey>
<joey> bosch chrisman freeman who just like </joey>
<joey> those those like the triple a </joey>
<joey> yeah everybody knew who they were yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly but it's it's a lot </joey>
<joey> harder in this climate in the industry </joey>
<connor> just because there's </connor>
<connor> there's so many dubs now yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> everything gets slimed </connor>
<connor> like if it's on funimation it's probably </connor>
<connor> going to be slime or dubbed and </connor>
<connor> everyone watches anime in like very </connor>
<connor> different ways now </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean like like even even going </connor>
<joey> back to japan since where </joey>
<joey> i i didn't know who any of the voice </joey>
<joey> actors who voiced in this anime were </joey>
<joey> because i was like </joey>
<joey> i was literally switching between dub </joey>
<joey> and sub depending on which one i like to </joey>
<joey> listen to </joey>
<joey> um because i feel like the voice acting </joey>
<joey> for dubs in general has has gotten into </joey>
<joey> like like possible quality </joey>
<joey> in almost every show like there are </joey>
<connor> there are some shows that are like </connor>
<joey> this is this is just a funny dub you </joey>
<joey> know for the most part </joey>
<joey> if i want to just shut my brain off and </joey>
<connor> just listen to the language that i want </connor>
<connor> that i speak then i just i'll just put </connor>
<connor> on dub and i can i have the trust that </connor>
<connor> it will be </connor>
<garnt> like a decent experience yeah dubs have </garnt>
<joey> definitely gotten to that point yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah there's there's certainly no like </connor>
<joey> 90s quality like hilarious dub </joey>
<connor> no no no no yeah i feel like the whole </connor>
<connor> argument of sub versus dub is kind of </connor>
<garnt> like you to this point i feel like the </garnt>
<garnt> counterpoint to that is that </garnt>
<garnt> there are less dubs that just stand out </garnt>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i i think of some of my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite dubs right something like </garnt>
<garnt> baccano that's best time </garnt>
<garnt> you know cowboy these are dubs that </garnt>
<garnt> stand out like literally like </garnt>
<garnt> i i remember how good they were just </garnt>
<garnt> because of how their quality but </garnt>
<garnt> nowadays i don't know i can't think i </garnt>
<garnt> can't think of like many dubs that </garnt>
<garnt> literally just </garnt>
<garnt> okay this everything's good everything's </garnt>
<garnt> off decent quality but i can't think of </garnt>
<garnt> anything that like </garnt>
<garnt> truly stands out this is a dub </garnt>
<joey> experience to me the last </joey>
<joey> i think the newest the newest quote </joey>
<joey> unquote anime where the dub was like </joey>
<garnt> wow was probably panty and stalky yeah </garnt>
<joey> but that was like 2008 yeah </joey>
<joey> that's what i'm saying newest in </joey>
<joey> quotations </joey>
<joey> it's how the industry was back then </joey>
<joey> right you had like two weeks to just </joey>
<joey> cast people like you had two weeks just </joey>
<connor> for that let alone everything else but </connor>
<connor> now it's </connor>
<connor> you have two weeks to not even two weeks </connor>
<connor> like one week so </connor>
<connor> cast translate and get these actors in </connor>
<connor> the booth and get recording like it's </connor>
<connor> you you can't expect anything good to </connor>
<connor> come out of that you you can </connor>
<connor> we get the good products right it's </connor>
<connor> decent but we're not gonna get anything </connor>
<connor> that blows us away from it </connor>
<garnt> i think the last current industry the </garnt>
<audio> last dub that blew me away was probably </audio>
<audio> stein's gate because yeah it's it was </audio>
<audio> one of those shows where i actually </audio>
<connor> i could appreciate the work that went </connor>
<connor> into translating and just scripting it </connor>
<connor> yeah not just like the voice acting but </connor>
<garnt> like everything was just </garnt>
<garnt> really polished i didn't believe that </garnt>
<connor> was scripted by </connor>
<garnt> marketing yeah yeah oh really yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah which is which is why he </garnt>
<audio> absolutely killed it uh as well so like </audio>
<audio> because i think with the era of cyber </audio>
<connor> dubbing </connor>
<garnt> it's just it's a lot harder to recreate </garnt>
<connor> that same quality at the same height </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> they just don't have as much time </connor>
<connor> anymore i also think at least for </connor>
<garnt> funimation i think when sony took over i </garnt>
<connor> think they restructured a lot of it </connor>
<connor> to make it less focused on giving </connor>
<connor> uh riders time and more giving like </connor>
<connor> getting the whole thing out sooner </connor>
<connor> yeah which you know is understandable i </connor>
<connor> guess but also at the same time you kind </connor>
<connor> of lose a bit of that magic that </connor>
<connor> you know maybe a dub would be whoa you </connor>
<garnt> know what i mean yeah </garnt>
<garnt> actually here's here's a question for </garnt>
<garnt> you joey because you you could probably </garnt>
<garnt> judge us the best but </garnt>
<garnt> ever since the beginning of time there's </garnt>
<garnt> always been this debate of subs versus </garnt>
<garnt> dubs you know </garnt>
<garnt> the japanese japanese voice acting is </garnt>
<garnt> always great </garnt>
<garnt> has there been any show or any anime </garnt>
<garnt> from your experience that it's just </garnt>
<garnt> bad voice acting from like a japanese </garnt>
<joey> side of things </joey>
<joey> man that's hard to say because at least </joey>
<audio> with voice from my understanding in my </audio>
<audio> experience </audio>
<audio> at least japanese voice acting in anime </audio>
<audio> yeah has just </audio>
<connor> had an insanely high bar to jump over oh </connor>
<connor> now </connor>
<connor> even ever since even you know like i </connor>
<joey> could obviously go back to you know an </joey>
<joey> anime from the 70s </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and probably find some bad </joey>
<joey> voice acting there but that's because </joey>
<joey> it was a medium that was still getting </joey>
<audio> refined since the 60s right yeah </audio>
<audio> but i think honestly every anime i've </audio>
<audio> seen </audio>
<audio> since you know the late 80s early 90s </audio>
<audio> i don't think there's been a maybe </audio>
<audio> there's been like one or two bad voices </audio>
<audio> or one or two maybe like </audio>
<garnt> under qualified voices compared to </garnt>
<garnt> everybody else in that same show but </garnt>
<garnt> i wouldn't say there's an entire show </garnt>
<garnt> that has like bad voice acting being the </garnt>
<garnt> same way that there are bad dubs </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly but and i don't know maybe </garnt>
<joey> that's like a cultural thing maybe </joey>
<connor> i think it's because they've set up a </connor>
<audio> system here that ensures they're getting </audio>
<audio> voice talent right yeah </audio>
<joey> yeah they have schools specifically for </joey>
<joey> voice action yeah yeah we don't really </joey>
<joey> have that in the world </joey>
<joey> it's you go to acting school and maybe </joey>
<joey> you stumble into voice over right if </joey>
<connor> that's what you like </connor>
<joey> there's not really a system but their </joey>
<joey> entire you know like four year </joey>
<connor> universities no right exactly </connor>
<connor> say yes it's the same reason why like </connor>
<joey> korea are normally amazing at esports </joey>
<joey> they have the infrastructure there to </joey>
<joey> support </joey>
<joey> like making this talent yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> you know in japan obviously you </joey>
<joey> they've been having those schools for a </joey>
<joey> while where the bar is getting pushed </joey>
<joey> constantly and constantly </joey>
<joey> yeah whereas it's not really like that </joey>
<joey> in the west exactly </joey>
<joey> and and you know the the great thing as </joey>
<joey> well with the structure of at least the </joey>
<joey> japanese voice acting in anime is that </joey>
<audio> if there is a new voice actor or actress </audio>
<audio> that comes into the industry </audio>
<connor> they usually start them off with very </connor>
<audio> very small roles maybe like one line or </audio>
<connor> even just background noise to kind of </connor>
<connor> get them used to that environment </connor>
<audio> and give them as much experience as </audio>
<audio> possible and then maybe after they do </audio>
<audio> you know </audio>
<audio> ten roles of playing you know person </audio>
<audio> passing behind </audio>
<audio> the main character after the tenth time </audio>
<audio> then they can give them </audio>
<connor> overall awareness it's very japanese </connor>
<connor> yeah there's two more lines </connor>
<connor> okay the next one will give you five </connor>
<connor> lines yes we'll give you ten lines and </connor>
<connor> then it just builds and builds from </connor>
<joey> there unless </joey>
<joey> if it's someone that just has insane </joey>
<joey> amount of talent from the get-go </joey>
<joey> yeah they're just confident enough to </joey>
<joey> put them into a show and then they make </joey>
<connor> a name for themselves because </connor>
<connor> some of the best dub performances have </connor>
<connor> been from actors where like they weren't </connor>
<connor> acting in any other animated shows oh no </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i i think i think um i think johnny and </garnt>
<connor> bosh </connor>
<connor> like stumbled into his first dub role by </connor>
<audio> accident </audio>
<audio> um i think same with steve bloom as well </audio>
<connor> uh yeah i think so </connor>
<connor> from what i found out it's been a while </connor>
<audio> since i heard the stories </audio>
<connor> like both fantastic voices yeah god </connor>
<audio> i think oh was the guy who did light in </audio>
<connor> the death note dub he did a lot of the </connor>
<connor> ocean dubs in canada he did like yeah </connor>
<garnt> because he did rock from black lagoon as </garnt>
<connor> well </connor>
<garnt> i think he was doing my little pony </garnt>
<garnt> before really </garnt>
<connor> don't think you've done anything i know </connor>
<connor> the guy voices lad rousseau in baccano i </connor>
<garnt> hadn't done any animation no no i </garnt>
<garnt> remember a lot of like back then a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of the </garnt>
<connor> voice actors who voiced in baccano was </connor>
<connor> that was like their first role </connor>
<connor> yes everyone [ __ ] killed it you know </connor>
<joey> yeah it was really there's a lot of </joey>
<joey> unknown voice actors </joey>
<connor> uh and actresses in that in in that show </connor>
<joey> great show yeah questions </joey>
<connor> questions to you guys then we've so with </connor>
<connor> the ridiculously high bar </connor>
<connor> that japanese voice acting has what are </connor>
<connor> what are some shows that </connor>
<joey> eat you know that even stand up for you </joey>
<joey> with like the </joey>
<joey> japanese voice talent and voice acting </joey>
<joey> i'll tell you the show that stands out </joey>
<joey> to me most recently yeah and that's b </joey>
<joey> stars </joey>
<joey> oh yeah b stars has absolutely like </joey>
<connor> insane voice acting </connor>
<connor> and it's very different because it </connor>
<joey> doesn't it doesn't it didn't sound like </joey>
<joey> your typical </joey>
<garnt> anime kind of voice acting it sounded </garnt>
<joey> very grounded </joey>
<joey> i don't know who the voice actor for </joey>
<garnt> lego c is but his his acting was </garnt>
<garnt> so good like lego and luis yeah </garnt>
<audio> was like they both had like the voice </audio>
<joey> acting performances of that year oh any </joey>
<joey> anime easily easily in in my in my </joey>
<joey> opinion like eve </joey>
<joey> even with shows like attack on titan </joey>
<garnt> three coming out that had some great </garnt>
<garnt> voice acting </garnt>
<garnt> i still think b stars was like just a </garnt>
<joey> cut above the rest </joey>
<joey> i think it's just because b stars as a </joey>
<connor> show was just a cut above the rest </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah like it was just such a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing show i'm trying to think </connor>
<connor> of any japanese shows that really blew </connor>
<connor> me away with voice actors jojo </connor>
<connor> i mean my mandio kills it </connor>
<connor> like that perform i i spoke about this </connor>
<connor> before like his performance like this </connor>
<connor> dear like i'm not memes aside like </connor>
<joey> it's [ __ ] amazing oh yeah he's </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] great and </connor>
<joey> everyone in part five i would argue as </joey>
<connor> well has fantastic voices </connor>
<joey> i think i think the thing with japanese </joey>
<connor> voices was that </connor>
<connor> they can just do casting so well yeah </connor>
<connor> they get it yeah </connor>
<connor> they understand how important casting is </connor>
<connor> for a character oh </connor>
<connor> i'm working on a video right now and </connor>
<connor> like i watched the clan ad dub and </connor>
<connor> there's just one scene where a female </connor>
<connor> teacher is just </connor>
<connor> voiced by a dude what really yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i'm i'll it's i obviously can't show </connor>
<connor> this but i'll show you guys later at all </connor>
<connor> i mean this is why i didn't watch a dog </connor>
<connor> it's just like a scene i </connor>
<connor> watched it dumb so i don't remember this </connor>
<connor> but i watched someone sent me the clip </connor>
<audio> and i'm like </audio>
<audio> that's just a dude hi boys </audio>
<connor> it's like what how did this pass </connor>
<garnt> i mean there was a lot of weird things </garnt>
<garnt> that happened with dubbing back in the </garnt>
<garnt> day if we're going to talk about bad </garnt>
<joey> dubs </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly you know we have to talk </joey>
<garnt> about you know like ghost stories </garnt>
<garnt> ghost stories is that a bad dub or is </garnt>
<joey> that it's so </joey>
<joey> bad that it's good people people always </joey>
<connor> act because when i when i tweet out be </connor>
<connor> like hey i'm going to fix bad anime </connor>
<garnt> scenes for a youtube video people always </garnt>
<garnt> be like yeah fix ghost stories i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> what is it </garnt>
<connor> there's nothing to fix this is amazing </connor>
<garnt> it's [ __ ] great </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's just because i from what i've </garnt>
<joey> heard about how ghost stories came to be </joey>
<joey> made it was ghost stories just sold </joey>
<joey> horribly in japan so when they licensed </joey>
<joey> it oh license they're over they were </joey>
<joey> like yeah </joey>
<joey> do what you need to do to make this sell </joey>
<joey> yeah like dude </joey>
<joey> you have there was so much creative </joey>
<joey> control yeah there were some rules but </joey>
<joey> you basically you basically had full </joey>
<joey> creative control </joey>
<audio> and from what i heard like they were </audio>
<audio> just the voice actors would just </audio>
<audio> try to rush in the booth first and they </audio>
<audio> would just like ad-lib the scenes yeah </audio>
<audio> and everyone else would have to like </audio>
<garnt> play off what they said yeah </garnt>
<joey> it was like the first of bridge yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah essentially i mean </connor>
<joey> yeah it's it's weird to think right that </joey>
<joey> dubs back in the 70s </joey>
<audio> were done where there was no email </audio>
<audio> like how did they do this they were </audio>
<audio> literally a guy was given this dvd and </audio>
<joey> they just kind of </joey>
<joey> made it i know they just and the </joey>
<joey> japanese just hoped they did it well </joey>
<joey> like you know </joey>
<joey> it's weird right do you think there was </joey>
<joey> even then it was a trust system yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah they're like i guess just take </connor>
<audio> this dvd and </audio>
<garnt> go home yeah vhs </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<audio> it's weird but even i think that's also </audio>
<audio> why some dubs now are a bit strange </audio>
<audio> because </audio>
<audio> they were still done on that system </audio>
<joey> where if you go first </joey>
<audio> you dub it and then the person who comes </audio>
<joey> next has to dub </joey>
<joey> but they get to hear just your character </joey>
<joey> who's been before you so right yeah that </joey>
<joey> was last normally is the easiest time </joey>
<joey> right yeah and that because they have to </joey>
<connor> kind of go along with oh they perform </connor>
<connor> this character in this way so i kind of </connor>
<joey> have to do it the same </joey>
<connor> but if the first one sucks it's a bit </connor>
<connor> unfortunate because i think it makes </connor>
<connor> this weird kind of feeling sometimes by </connor>
<connor> accident but this is again why a </connor>
<connor> director should be on top of that [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's what that's why like the </garnt>
<audio> director has control </audio>
<audio> over how this sounds because there are </audio>
<audio> definitely some dubs where it definitely </audio>
<garnt> sounds like people aren't having a </garnt>
<connor> conversation </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i've always said i think a </connor>
<connor> director's job is like 10 to get the </connor>
<audio> best performance out of you and like </audio>
<audio> 90 to make sure everyone sounds like </audio>
<audio> they're in the same world like that's </audio>
<connor> the hardest part </connor>
<connor> because you're constantly thinking like </connor>
<audio> okay that was a great line but does it </audio>
<audio> fit with what the other person just </audio>
<connor> delivered yeah like i need to think </connor>
<audio> about that yeah </audio>
<audio> it's a really hard skill it's it's it's </audio>
<audio> definitely hard because you have to be </audio>
<audio> on top of what everyone is saying and </audio>
<audio> how everyone sounds and </audio>
<audio> it's it's definitely like you can </audio>
<audio> definitely see some of the new answers </audio>
<audio> that </audio>
<garnt> people don't normally think about but if </garnt>
<garnt> you if you play a conversation and it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like man these people just sound </garnt>
<garnt> like they're reading lines to each other </garnt>
<garnt> and not actually having a conversation </garnt>
<garnt> and it's really it just sounds yeah it's </garnt>
<joey> that uncanny valley yeah </joey>
<joey> it sounds like they're kind of talking </joey>
<joey> through dimensions </joey>
<joey> one's living in one world and the other </joey>
<joey> was living in the other world and the </joey>
<joey> rift just happened to open up where it's </joey>
<joey> like oh hello </joey>
<joey> oh hi mark hi mark god man </joey>
<connor> i could see her and talk all day about </connor>
<garnt> dubbed anime and voice acting and all </garnt>
<garnt> that because </garnt>
<joey> obviously that's what i'm cripplingly </joey>
<connor> addicted to </connor>
<joey> apparently not music yeah not music </joey>
<joey> we're gonna get this boy on some like </joey>
<joey> we gotta make him understand emotions i </joey>
<garnt> never thought i'd say that </garnt>
<garnt> i just i wish like i wish kevin was here </garnt>
<garnt> i wish kevin was like guessing in this </garnt>
<connor> one </connor>
<connor> kevin </connor>
<garnt> his reaction when you were just saying </garnt>
<garnt> all this stuff as a [ __ ] composer </garnt>
<garnt> kevin if you're watching this i want you </garnt>
<joey> to just like if </joey>
<garnt> we ever get kevin on the show and we </garnt>
<garnt> will get kevin on the show just </garnt>
<garnt> i want to just hear the conversation </garnt>
<garnt> look him in the eye i want you to </garnt>
<joey> look him in the eye and just be like </joey>
<joey> made an abyss soundtrack made me feel </joey>
<joey> good </joey>
<garnt> i'll do it just dead-ass look in the </garnt>
<garnt> video and just be like i don't remember </garnt>
<garnt> any of your music but it made me feel </garnt>
<joey> good </joey>
<joey> i heard the sounds i mean i i feel like </joey>
<audio> i have the opposite brain to like a </audio>
<audio> composer though in like every aspect </audio>
<audio> like when i talk to kevin </audio>
<audio> i feel like i'm on like the complete </audio>
<audio> opposite </audio>
<connor> mind in every way it's crazy it's so </connor>
<connor> weird i think i'd have that that kind of </connor>
<connor> mind that isn't isn't like that </connor>
<joey> i mean if we can't even like relate to </joey>
<connor> we're not exactly composers </connor>
<connor> i feel like you're you're very musical </connor>
<joey> though right i mean yeah </joey>
<connor> but i'm no kevin penkins no right but </connor>
<connor> you have an appreciation for music </connor>
<joey> something that i don't have </joey>
<joey> yeah i i can't make music it doesn't </joey>
<joey> make sense to me i don't understand any </joey>
<connor> of that </connor>
<connor> like i tried to learn drums as a kid and </connor>

<garnt> it's got to be some like we don't know </garnt>

<garnt> yeah actually very specifically then </garnt>
<garnt> do you ever okay do you ever notice that </garnt>
<garnt> moment </garnt>
<garnt> in any anime where it's a really hyped </garnt>
<garnt> scene and they play the opening </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah okay good if you notice that </garnt>
<garnt> then you're not </garnt>

<connor> the show to me </connor>
<connor> it's like i loved like i don't know why </connor>
<connor> it always works right but it's not a </connor>
<connor> type </connor>
<connor> it's hype you you play the opening song </connor>
<garnt> in any hype scene and it just </garnt>
<connor> brings it from like a 10 to a 20. </connor>
<connor> it's pretty [ __ ] hype they're about </connor>
<audio> to pop off yeah yeah </audio>
