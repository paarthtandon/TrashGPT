<joey> - Cinema rules, turn your phone off </joey>
<joey> or put it on silent mode. </joey>
<joey> That includes you viewers </joey>
<connor> - Viewers type too loud as well Meilyne </connor>
<connor> 'cause like last week, I didn't want to say anything </connor>
<joey> but I was like, fucking all I could hear was you typing </joey>
<joey> when (laughter drowns out speaker) </joey>
<joey> - Sounds like you're playing guitar here by the way. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> (soft music) </joey>
<connor> - Welcome to this episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> It's a little darker than usual </connor>
<joey> 'cause one of our lights decided to yeet out </joey>
<joey> as we used it earlier- </joey>
<joey> - Just randomly, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just started strobing and it was not a pleasant feeling. </joey>
<garnt> So it's a little darker than normal, </garnt>
<garnt> but don't worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's audio only- </garnt>
<garnt> - And I believe none of us have photosensitive epilepsy </garnt>
<connor> 'cause that was like dangerous. </connor>
<garnt> - That was strobing, like crazy. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it was full on strobing. </joey>
<joey> So we're very lucky that none of us is suffering from that. </joey>
<joey> But anyway boys, how are you doing today? </joey>
<joey> - I'm doing all right. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I'm feeling very energized right now. </joey>
<joey> - Why is that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, just I'm. </joey>
<joey> I had Mexican. </joey>
<joey> No, I didn't have Mexican food. </joey>
<joey> I had Thai food and my stomach was dying </joey>
<joey> and I thought I was going to die. </joey>
<connor> And then I went to the toilet and now I feel like a 10. </connor>
<connor> - You took like two- </connor>
<connor> - Thai food does do that to you. </connor>
<connor> - You took two shits in the span of an hour. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> That's pretty, it's pretty remarkable. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not proud of it Joey, I'm not. </connor>
<joey> - It happens man, don't worry. </joey>
<connor> You know that like Curry place near our house, </connor>
<garnt> like literally every time I come home, after that </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, I immediately have to take a shit </garnt>
<joey> and then I'll wake up in the middle of the night </joey>
<connor> and have to take another shit. </connor>
<connor> - It's unfortunate being like a white guy </connor>
<garnt> who loves spicy food because my body does not agree with it </garnt>
<garnt> but I love the taste of it and I suffer the next day. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like being whites, being Southeast, Asian, </garnt>
<connor> being anything your body just doesn't love spicy food like- </connor>
<connor> - Oh really, you get that as well? </connor>
<connor> - No, I can handle spicy food, </connor>
<connor> but my stomach doesn't like it. </connor>
<connor> Like every time, like every time I fucking </connor>
<connor> like chow down on a massive fat Indian, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like a ticking time bomb, okay. </connor>
<connor> I know- </connor>
<connor> - Why'd you describe it like a fat Indian. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> But I know exactly what you mean. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's a massive thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - You never just have like a smaller- </garnt>
<garnt> - True thing, I've never had, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never ordered Indian food </garnt>
<connor> and been like, man, that was just too little. </connor>
<joey> - It's going to be a fat cor, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And it's a fucking ticking time bomb. </joey>
<joey> Like I know 'cause there's a local Indian place I order from </joey>
<joey> then they do it like proper spicy. </joey>
<joey> And depending on what time of the day I eat it in, </joey>
<joey> like there's a timer where I have to wait six hours </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like going to be like, okay, </joey>
<joey> this hour, I'm going to be just like </joey>
<joey> incapacitated on the toilet. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> That's just the way it's going to be. </joey>
<joey> And like sometimes when I have it for dinner, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> Oh no, I'm going to wake up at like 3:00 AM sometimes </joey>
<connor> because my stomach just needs to go now. </connor>
<joey> - Oh man, I always... </joey>
<connor> Oh, go, go on. </connor>
<connor> - I was just going to say, </connor>
<connor> I hope you're enjoying this podcast guys. </connor>
<joey> Where the first 10 minutes of talking about violent shits. </joey>
<connor> - I just thought it's very relatable content. </connor>
<joey> Hashtag relatable </joey>
<garnt> - Hashtag painful shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hashtag relatable took a painful shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Question, do you think it's weird </connor>
<connor> that we like listen to ourselves often? </connor>
<connor> Like, 'cause we have to hear our voice all the time. </connor>
<joey> Do you think that's weird? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it was weird when we first started off. </joey>
<connor> - Because, people at home, </connor>
<connor> have you ever listened to your, like your voice recorded? </connor>
<connor> You probably hate it, right? </connor>
<connor> I'm assuming, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I've never grown out of that. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you still hate it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you're still... </joey>
<joey> If anyone should be grown out of it, it's you. </joey>
<garnt> - I hate looking at my own, like hearing my own voice, </garnt>
<garnt> looking at my own content. </garnt>
<joey> Like whenever I do a collaboration with someone, </joey>
<joey> I watch like the bare minimum just to get what's going on. </joey>
<joey> Like, I watch every moment of that collab that I'm not in. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, oh, I'm in it, skip, skip, </joey>
<garnt> then oh, okay, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - You're like in the comments timestamps, </connor>
<connor> please tell of when I'm not on it. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> So why though? </connor>
<connor> Like why can you like, I mean, okay. </connor>
<connor> Maybe it's the better question to ask, </connor>
<connor> why can we stand on our own voice? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that's pretty the weirdest side. </connor>
<joey> - Probably because we just got used to, right? </joey>
<joey> I mean like- - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think anyone grew up, right. </joey>
<joey> And like, ever went into that situation. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure every family had it where, </joey>
<joey> your parents would just be like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> There's nothing really to watch. </joey>
<joey> Oh, I found some home videos. </joey>
<joey> We can watch those. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, no, thank you. </joey>
<joey> Because I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I always fucking hated when my parents </joey>
<connor> would play home videos in front of me. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah same. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause it was always me being a fucking idiot. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> But it's also like the... </joey>
<joey> I used to have like a fucking squeaker voice </joey>
<connor> when I was like five years old. </connor>
<connor> I legitimately used to sound like </connor>
<connor> "Hi guys." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> I legit used to have that voice. </connor>
<connor> And my dad would always fucking rag me on me. </connor>
<connor> Like, man, your balls really dropped all of a sudden, </connor>
<joey> didn't they? </joey>
<joey> And I fucking hated that. </joey>
<joey> Because when you're a kid, </joey>
<joey> you're not aware that you have that voice. </joey>
<connor> - No. - Right? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause everyone has the same voice around you. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly! Exactly! </joey>
<joey> And you grow with your voice </joey>
<joey> so you don't suddenly be like, Oh my voice got deeper. </joey>
<joey> Unless it's like a really rapid growth like- </joey>
<garnt> - I had that. - You had that, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - When you're just like your balls just fucking dropped. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought when it happened, </garnt>
<joey> I thought it was going to go back. </joey>
<joey> I thought I was like, I thought I was sick or something. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<connor> - And everyone at school didn't believe me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But that's because your balls dropped </joey>
<joey> like a fucking cannon more, right? </joey>
<garnt> Like mine kind of dropped- </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, mine kind of dropped like you know, </garnt>
<connor> like putting like a rock in water. </connor>
<connor> It's just a very slow drop. </connor>
<connor> - That's a very slow Joey. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Well, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's like, because you grow with it, </connor>
<joey> especially if it's a natural drop </joey>
<joey> then you don't realize that, Oh, I went from </joey>
<garnt> fucking Alvin and the Chipmunks to the fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - We really talking about this beat a bull drops now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So you don't watch the podcasts at all? </connor>
<connor> After we... </connor>
<garnt> - I like the- </garnt>
<connor> - You don't want to Trash Taste? </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - I watch like some highlights, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like I... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like with me I'm just super self critical </connor>
<connor> and I've always been this way </connor>
<connor> whether it be with my work or myself. </connor>
<joey> And that's why like, </joey>
<joey> I'd say like I've seen, </joey>
<joey> anytime I see like criticisms of my videos of my work. </joey>
<joey> I'm just, I'm more fine with it because </joey>
<joey> there hasn't been something that's been said about me, </joey>
<joey> that I haven't already said about myself </joey>
<joey> in some way, shape or form. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] I feel that. - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - So unless I'm like super proud of a video, I really, </joey>
<joey> I find it difficult to watch it </joey>
<connor> because I see all the things that </connor>
<connor> I kind of could improve on it </connor>
<connor> or that I fucking hate about it. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just out there. </garnt>
<joey> I can't like- </joey>
<joey> - So you're too much of a perfectionist basically. </joey>
<garnt> From what I'm getting. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate the word perfectionist- </garnt>
<joey> - But you are a perfectionist. </joey>
<joey> (both laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - I prefer the term self critical. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - A self critical perfectionist is what you're essentially. </joey>
<joey> Because like you have an editor, </joey>
<joey> but you also edit your own stuff too, right? </joey>
<connor> Like every- - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You always do like the finishing touches. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I always do the finishing touches. </connor>
<joey> - So wait, so- </joey>
<joey> - And like when there's a collab where I have zero control </joey>
<garnt> over it, that's just like, I wake up in a cold sweat. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, (Joey and Connor laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Well, what if I just look like an asshole in this one. </garnt>
<joey> - So wait, so then how do you get through your </joey>
<joey> editing process? </joey>
<joey> Because you have to listen to yourself, right? </joey>
<joey> Over and over and over again. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - So are you just like cringing internally </garnt>
<joey> as you're like, oh, I need to edit this part out. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know... </connor>
<connor> ' Cause you you're doing like, </connor>
<connor> you got jokes, you had punchlines. </connor>
<connor> Do you not like think, </connor>
<connor> darn! That was a good delivery. </connor>
<connor> I nailed that delivery. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes I listen to a joke </garnt>
<garnt> and I edit it for like three hours. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna just like, the joke's not funny anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) And I just cut it. </garnt>
<garnt> And, it's a weird thing where depending on how my mood is, </garnt>
<garnt> my video could just be completely different. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I could just be watching myself </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, I hate this part. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to just rerecord this entire segment </garnt>
<garnt> even though it's going to add like </garnt>
<garnt> two, three hours to my fucking video making process </garnt>
<joey> and then I do it. </joey>
<joey> - See, that's why I'm glad </joey>
<joey> that I'd got an editor that has complete, </joey>
<joey> that I gave complete creative freedom. </joey>
<joey> So 'cause I'm pretty sure you were talking </joey>
<joey> about this earlier, but like at least with my editor </joey>
<joey> he leaves in shit that I would have otherwise cut out. </joey>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> That's what I, like, I tell anyone I had edit for me. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, I don't care how bad it makes me look. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - Just make it funny. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - Like please make it funny. </connor>
<connor> - Because, at least, right? </connor>
<connor> You're going to get the draft, right? </connor>
<connor> And you're going to check it </connor>
<connor> and if it's really fucking bad </connor>
<connor> then you can just tell them to cut it out. </connor>
<garnt> But a lot of the times it's like, Oh, </garnt>
<garnt> in my head, I thought this was not </garnt>
<garnt> going to make it into the video </garnt>
<garnt> but he kind of twisted it in a way where it's like, </garnt>
<connor> Oh, you know what? </connor>
<joey> That's kind of a funny bit, I never thought about. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like where I like fail a joke and I'm like </connor>
<joey> let me do that again. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And he leave that in. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's just a joke. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like the fuck. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I guess it's like the difference between like </joey>
<joey> heavily scripted content and more like improvised content. </joey>
<joey> Because there are times when I think </joey>
<joey> I have like a fucking banger of a joke </joey>
<connor> and then I watch it like 30 times as I'm editing it </connor>
<connor> and I have to like question </connor>
<connor> whether it was funny in the first place </connor>
<joey> or whether I've just seen it so many fucking times </joey>
<garnt> that it's just lost all like comic, comedic effect to me. </garnt>
<connor> - But the reason I asked that question earlier was </connor>
<connor> because I saw a video. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it was a Ted talk. </connor>
<connor> It sounds like a Ted talk topic, right. </connor>
<joey> It was something like, people, </joey>
<joey> everyday people should just like </joey>
<joey> record their voice and listen to it </joey>
<joey> so they can improve their speaking in general </joey>
<joey> to be more confident. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because their theory was that, </joey>
<joey> your overall general quality of life </joey>
<joey> and like doing anything in daily life, improved drastically </joey>
<joey> if your speaking is more confident. </joey>
<joey> Like if your voice is more confident. </joey>
<garnt> - I agree with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would agree with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think in general, definitely like, </garnt>
<joey> if there's been the one big thing in my life </joey>
<joey> that has done me solids </joey>
<garnt> it's the voice and talking. </garnt>
<joey> - For sure, for sure. </joey>
<joey> - Just going at it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know and I maybe think a lot. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, huh? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I guess I've never really thought about, </joey>
<joey> I mean obviously yeah, </joey>
<joey> people say, Oh, you have a nice voice and shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Not to stroke my fucking dick but, </joey>
<joey> and that's the compliment I get the most, right? </joey>
<joey> And I thought- </joey>
<joey> - I put VA in my name for a reason, right? </joey>
<joey> - You do have VA in your name, right? </joey>
<joey> - But I mean, it's the reason I became a voice actor </joey>
<joey> because people were telling me like, </joey>
<connor> Hey, you have a nice voice </connor>
<joey> and I thought ah, maybe (murmurs). </joey>
<connor> - Fuck you know your what? </connor>
<joey> You're right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, damn! </joey>
<joey> I do kinda, I'm kidding. </joey>
<joey> Because when I first recorded myself, </joey>
<joey> I thought it sound like shit. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone's thinks like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> But then it's one of those things where I think that, </garnt>
<garnt> it's definitely helped me a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> because not only have I improved </garnt>
<connor> my annunciation and just general patterns of my speech </connor>
<connor> it just made my whole life more confident by doing that. </connor>
<joey> - Because you have general self-confidence. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because if I'm hearing it, I'm like, damn! </connor>
<garnt> I sound good. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, is that considered as fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, it's just, </connor>
<garnt> you just do get a skill set by practicing it, right? </garnt>
<connor> I mean, like- </connor>
<connor> - And you get happy with the </connor>
<connor> ability that you have to like </connor>
<connor> change it and make it sound the way you want, I think. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I feel like even just being </garnt>
<garnt> on Trash Taste and just like, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I don't watch every episode that I'm in </garnt>
<joey> but like I still have to watch like certain clips </joey>
<joey> just to check in everything like that. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like, especially my speaking skills </joey>
<joey> has gotten a lot better, </joey>
<joey> gotten a lot better. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> Of course I fuck up as soon as I said that. </joey>
<garnt> Goddammit! - A solid point. </garnt>
<joey> You really drove that point over Garnt, thank you. </joey>
<joey> No, I agree. </joey>
<connor> I used to fucking hate public speaking. </connor>
<connor> Like in school it was- - Oh, me too, me too. </connor>
<garnt> - The worst thing. </garnt>
<garnt> And which was weird because, </garnt>
<joey> I used to be part of my school's debating team. </joey>
<joey> Like we had like a debating team and </joey>
<joey> it was like groups of three and you usually go </joey>
<connor> against all the schools or whatever the fuck it was. </connor>
<joey> - We do not have this in the UK, I don't think. </joey>
<joey> Unless you're in Oxford, Cambridge I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> We definitely didn't have this where I grew up. </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah I mean, </connor>
<connor> it was literally just the three of us that day. </connor>
<connor> And so I was, I decided to join that </connor>
<connor> because I realized how much I fucking hated public speaking </connor>
<connor> and how bad I was just speaking in general. </connor>
<connor> So I was like- </connor>
<connor> - How old are you, when you decided to do this? </connor>
<connor> - This was in, actually this no, </connor>
<connor> this was an elementary school. </connor>
<connor> So this was like- </connor>
<connor> - Goddamn! </connor>
<joey> - Fifth or sixth grade. - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - So like 11, 12 year old Joey, was like, you know what? </joey>
<connor> I have a deficiency I would like to improve. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to do that. </connor>
<joey> - You know what, like watching all those </joey>
<joey> like squeaker family videos, man, I was just like, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I need to prove my voice man, </joey>
<joey> I don't want to sound like Alvin. </joey>
<garnt> So basically, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I joined this debating team </garnt>
<garnt> and of course like I was in it for like two years </garnt>
<garnt> but I was still nervous as shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I was very fiddly and kind of, </garnt>
<joey> I had this really bad habit of swaying, as I talked. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like you don't realize </joey>
<garnt> how many subconscious things you do until you get filmed. </garnt>
<joey> - This is why you should record yourself. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> No and that's what we did, all right. </connor>
<connor> So my parents sometimes would come </connor>
<connor> to these debating things with other schools </connor>
<connor> and of course they would record it just for memory's sake. </connor>
<joey> And of course, I'd be forced to watch it </joey>
<joey> during our family fucking, family video session. </joey>
<connor> - Put it on the 4K monitor will you Joey? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> And so I'll watch back on and be like, Jesus Christ. </connor>
<garnt> I looked like fucking schizophrenic patients. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm just fucking fiddling like, </joey>
<connor> (stutters) </connor>
<joey> so my conclusion is... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but you were 12 dude, </connor>
<connor> I would have shit my pants to that situation. </connor>
<joey> - No, but here's the thing all the other </joey>
<garnt> schools we went up against, </garnt>
<garnt> were just fucking shut as shit. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like, </garnt>
<garnt> yes, your honor let me defend myself </garnt>
<garnt> and my colleagues right here. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, - [Connor] yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And meanwhile, I'm just like, you have a point, </garnt>
<garnt> but no. </garnt>
<garnt> It was that level. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> It was fucking horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> But then, so, I tried to use that skill </garnt>
<garnt> when I first started doing YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But of course, like everyone's first YouTube videos, </garnt>
<garnt> it's shit. </garnt>
<garnt> It fucking sucks. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, I had that, </garnt>
<garnt> I still have this problem to this day </garnt>
<connor> where I say like, and you know, way too much. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, same. </garnt>
<garnt> - And people on Trash Taste have a point of that being like, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Take a shot every time Joey says like, or, you know </joey>
<joey> and you'll be dead in the first five minutes. </joey>
<garnt> - You have like a lot of like everyone subconsciously </garnt>
<garnt> has a lot of filler words that you don't normally </garnt>
<joey> hear yourself saying, because it's filler words. </joey>
<joey> When you say it, you kind of like </joey>
<joey> fill in the gap yourself. </joey>
<joey> And there are times when I say like a lot, </joey>
<garnt> and then there are times when I just swear a lot as well. </garnt>
<joey> - It's either like, you know, or fucking. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> That's my three filler words. </connor>
<connor> - But also, I'm assuming that, right. </connor>
<connor> I'm a viewer, right? </connor>
<joey> Who am I to be like, accomplishes like too much. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> As if they have like the most immaculate speeches. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah right? </joey>
<joey> That's right, that's right. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> It's like, who are you? </joey>
<joey> Who are you to judge? </joey>
<joey> It's like, do you go around, </joey>
<joey> not saying the word, like ever in your speech </joey>
<joey> like with any other people, like- </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I guess it's 'cause is it, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't get it. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I understand that everyone has shit that they do, </garnt>
<joey> they might want to change, but... </joey>
<joey> Fuck there's something in my eye. </joey>
<joey> Fucking. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Why did you need to feel the need to like </joey>
<joey> tell people I guess. </joey>
<joey> Wow, there's really something in my eye. </joey>
<joey> - Are you alright? - You good? </joey>
<joey> - Keep talking. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But... </joey>
<joey> What were we talking- </joey>
<connor> - We were talking- - Oh yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> So like, YouTube videos fixing your speech puddles. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I feel like when people see, </garnt>
<garnt> when people see doing stuff on YouTube nowadays, </garnt>
<joey> it's like the expectation is that, </joey>
<joey> for some reason the expectation is </joey>
<joey> they must know what they're doing. </joey>
<joey> They're professionals. - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And it's really weird because, </joey>
<joey> I remember the first time I felt this </joey>
<joey> was when I started to get asked to do like panels and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was thinking to myself, </joey>
<joey> I've never been good at public speaking </joey>
<joey> my entire fucking life. </joey>
<joey> And just because I have this audience, </joey>
<joey> this virtual audience of YouTube, </joey>
<joey> like conventions and stuff, </joey>
<joey> expect you to like, </joey>
<joey> be in like a top tier panelists and stuff. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, this is a skill I had to like </joey>
<joey> learn trial by fire. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause my first few panels were fucking shit. </joey>
<joey> And I felt like shit because I was shit at public speaking. </joey>
<joey> But because you were forced to be put, </joey>
<joey> to put that, they force you to be put in that situation, </joey>
<joey> you just had to learn it on the fly. </joey>
<joey> But I do find it funny that just because we're on YouTube </joey>
<joey> people do have this expectation of just like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, they must be really confident </joey>
<joey> and have this professional kind fucking background and- </joey>
<joey> - Otherwise how would they get all these subs, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, you couldn't talk properly. </joey>
<joey> - And they seem to forget that </joey>
<joey> we all started in same place. </joey>
<garnt> Making videos in our uni bedroom or our parents' bedroom </garnt>
<joey> parents' basement or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Although to be fair in my case, </joey>
<joey> it's a little bit different because I hated public speaking, </joey>
<connor> but I was always okay in front of large crowds, </connor>
<connor> which is weird. </connor>
<connor> You'd think it's kind of counter-intuitive- </connor>
<connor> - Isn't that literally public speaking? (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - No, no, but, but. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laughs) </connor>
<garnt> No, but here's the thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it private speaking if it's- </connor>
<connor> - No, that's the thing though, </connor>
<connor> it's like when I was doing the debating team stuff </connor>
<connor> the most we would ever talk in front of was maybe 30 people. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<joey> - And there's some weird, it's really counter-intuitive but </joey>
<connor> a lot of the times I'm more nervous </connor>
<joey> in front of a small crowd than I am a large crowd. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's more intimate. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Like it's, if you have to do </joey>
<joey> in front of people, you know, especially </joey>
<connor> I think it's a little harder. </connor>
<joey> - Because I've done like, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I used to do classical piano </garnt>
<connor> and I played live at like the Sydney opera house once </connor>
<connor> in front of like a thousand people. </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit, man. </connor>
<connor> - Stop dropping that like it's nothing like, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I guess I did you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - That came out of nowhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So basically I used to do like music, like properly </garnt>
<connor> and I got the chance to perform at the Sydney Opera House </connor>
<connor> in front of like a thousand people. </connor>
<connor> - How old were you? </connor>
<connor> - 14, 15. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh wow. - Fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, it was just like, </garnt>
<joey> yeah, you're playing at the Opera House. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, like the Opera House. </joey>
<connor> - That's the Asian parents dream right there, goddamn! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, oh true. </joey>
<joey> My mom has never been more proud of me. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> That's all- </joey>
<joey> - That's never coming off the fridge. </joey>
<garnt> That's for sure. </garnt>
<connor> - Extra rice for you tonight. </connor>
<joey> - Did your mom fucking film it and then like frame it- </joey>
<joey> - Of course she did. </joey>
<joey> - And then frame it then they put in like </joey>
<joey> the safe and stuff and just like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, of course she did. </connor>
<garnt> Of course she did. </garnt>
<connor> - I think one thing that really helped me realize that, </connor>
<connor> start not giving a fuck is that, </connor>
<joey> and this is just a general life as well is that like, </joey>
<joey> I don't remember who told me this. </joey>
<joey> They were like, everyone is always way more worried </joey>
<joey> about themselves than they ever are about you. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so like, if you just think about it like that </joey>
<joey> and think about how you think about it </joey>
<joey> when someone is public speaking, </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking care if they're shit. </joey>
<joey> I'm just, most of the time I'm just sitting there anyway. </joey>
<joey> Like they can just say anything </joey>
<joey> and I'll probably be like, Oh cool. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, all right. </joey>
<joey> Like, unless they like literally shit their pants on stage, </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to think anything bad of them. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So if you go into that mindset of, </joey>
<joey> okay, I'm going to talk in front of these people. </joey>
<connor> None of them care really, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> How can I fuck this up? </connor>
<connor> I could be terrible. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but speech I feel is a little bit different </joey>
<joey> because even if you do fuck up, </joey>
<joey> you can very quickly try and fix it, right? </joey>
<connor> It's a little bit different when you're </connor>
<connor> playing solo piano in front of a crowd. </connor>
<connor> - No, dude you play jazz, pure jazz. </connor>
<connor> Just do it. (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> - It's not classical anymore it was jazz now. </joey>
<joey> - When you go on stage, </joey>
<garnt> do you remember the stuff you do and the stuff you say? </garnt>
<joey> Cause I don't remember that shit. </joey>
<garnt> Like, because- </garnt>
<joey> - Sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - Do you still get nerves </joey>
<garnt> when you have like a big panel or a big event that- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, I don't. </garnt>
<joey> - I get nerves right up until I'm on stage. </joey>
<garnt> - Same here, same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like on the, like up the stairs going onto the stage, </garnt>
<joey> I'm fucking nerves and shit. </joey>
<joey> - It's the anticipation. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, I just want to get this over with </joey>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to get on stage and just do my shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, the reason why is because </connor>
<joey> you know if you're doing a debate thing, </joey>
<joey> no one cares about who you are, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But when it's your panel, right? </joey>
<joey> All the people come for you. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, I can sit there and insult them for 20 minutes, </joey>
<joey> they'll probably be like, </joey>
<joey> damn! Connor is exactly like he is on camera. </joey>
<joey> Hell yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm kidding- - Just as much of an asshole. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I mean, </joey>
<joey> that's how you deal with like hecklers, right? </joey>
<joey> Like you just give them shit. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's like, Oh, that was funny. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever had hecklers at a panel? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, one time. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah, they were like- </joey>
<garnt> - Well, what happened? </garnt>
<garnt> - So, Oh God, it was at a fucking Hentai panel and- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that's the problem. - Of course, of course. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, RA team panels, I've never done one </joey>
<connor> because everything I've heard about it, </connor>
<joey> it's a fucking horror story. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! I call if I didn't mention this </joey>
<joey> in like the convention story. </joey>
<joey> So I do, I offer to like conventions. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, Hey do you want me to run a hentai dabbing panel? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And essentially what it is is I just get a bunch of hentai </garnt>
<garnt> and I blow out the subtitles and I'm like wing it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<joey> - Just make shit up. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - People are fucking terrible at it. </joey>
<joey> And that's, what's funny. </joey>
<joey> But eventually you'll get like one person </joey>
<joey> who's actually like really fucking funny </joey>
<joey> and that's what it's for. </joey>
<joey> But I think one time I was doing it </joey>
<joey> and there's this dude in the back, </joey>
<joey> he must've been like 30 something, just on his own. </joey>
<joey> And he was just shouting cringe, cringe </joey>
<joey> cringe the whole time. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "do you want to come up?" </joey>
<connor> And he's like, "no." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "well get the fuck out then." </connor>
<connor> And everyone was like, (claps) </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) - Golf claps. </garnt>
<connor> - And then late claps. </connor>
<joey> So everyone cheered. - No joke, no joke. </joey>
<joey> - No because at panels there's always that one guy </joey>
<joey> who thinks that like the panel was a YouTube comment section </joey>
<joey> and they always try to like be that fucking smart ass, </joey>
<garnt> like throw out that smart ass comment </garnt>
<garnt> and it never fucking, it's never fucking funny. </garnt>
<garnt> You know who you are. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, I must be blessed </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've never had that at a panel of mine. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, normally those types of panel, </joey>
<connor> the people, lot of people are good </connor>
<connor> 'cause you just bring them up when you do it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, if I ever put into that situation </joey>
<connor> I'd do exactly the same thing, all right? </connor>
<connor> - God, it was terrible. - I'd tell them to fuck off. </connor>
<joey> - One time there was this hentai </joey>
<joey> and it was brother and sister. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And a brother and sister came up to dub it </joey>
<joey> and it was the most worst thing I'd ever done in my life. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. - Oh God. </joey>
<joey> - It was terrible. </joey>
<joey> - That's cursed. </joey>
<garnt> - It was so cursed, </garnt>
<garnt> I regretted it. </garnt>
<garnt> And, you know, when you do something you're like </garnt>
<garnt> this sounds hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it starts, you're like, Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no, please stop. </garnt>
<garnt> Please stop. </garnt>
<joey> - Is just like immediate regret. </joey>
<joey> - They offered and I was like, Oh God. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, this sounds funny. </joey>
<joey> And no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been tempted to do an RA team panel. </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> I've only seen like bad things happen to RA team panels. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I've only seen and heard the worst things happen. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause here's the thing, </joey>
<joey> like if you come to my panel </joey>
<joey> like I'm usually open to any kind of fucking question it is. </joey>
<joey> But it seems like when people see RA team in a panel </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've been to RA team panel. </joey>
<joey> They ask shit that is not like, </joey>
<garnt> it's bad in any kind of context. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's not a question it's just dub hentai, </connor>
<joey> don't fucking do anything weird </joey>
<joey> and if you do- </joey>
<connor> - No, but what I'm talking about </connor>
<connor> is like the RA team, like Q&A panels. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, those are fucking weird, I don't get those. </connor>
<connor> - Like I don't know what it is, </connor>
<connor> some people just think, Oh it's RA team, </connor>
<joey> therefore I can ask them the most like private shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That they otherwise wouldn't say I'm like, </joey>
<joey> no, motherfucker. </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to tell you private shit </joey>
<garnt> just 'cause it's RA team. </garnt>
<joey> I don't care. </joey>
<garnt> - Like motherfucker even my therapist doesn't ask this </garnt>
<garnt> and here you are just asking about </garnt>
<garnt> the most intimate fucking details of my life. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> I've never been on an RA team panel </garnt>
<garnt> but I've seen some of the question that has, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the questions that have been asked on RA team panel. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's horrible. </garnt>
<connor> It's horrible. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It depends on the crowd, doesn't it really? </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you get real like, Oh God! </connor>
<joey> and sometimes they're quite funny. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, that's the thing it can be funny </connor>
<joey> but there are just some people who don't know what funny is. </joey>
<joey> Like, it's funny to them, but then the moment it comes out </joey>
<joey> everyone's like, yikes, you shouldn't have said that. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, that's like discord humor, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's like funny between you and your friends </garnt>
<garnt> but not funny to everyone else in the room. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Most of the time. </connor>
<joey> - So sometimes it's like online humor just doesn't </joey>
<joey> translate into real life situations, </joey>
<joey> especially with a lot of discord humor. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - And you can tell when someone's been on discord </joey>
<garnt> a little too much. </garnt>
<garnt> When they ask questions like that, it's like, </garnt>
<joey> hmm, okay you need some real interaction. </joey>
<connor> - Man! </connor>
<connor> I saw this tweet and it made me think about discord. </connor>
<connor> I know, I keep searching topics here but </connor>
<connor> there is someone who was like, </connor>
<connor> you can't be well adjusted </connor>
<connor> if all your friends are only on discord. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> What do you think about that statement? </garnt>
<garnt> - That is a take. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I thought about it </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> and when I read that, I'm like that seems way too harsh. </garnt>
<joey> But the more I thought about it, </joey>
<joey> the more people I know who are kind of like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> And when I was the same, when I had friends online </joey>
<joey> I don't think I was very well adjusted, </joey>
<connor> when I only had friends online. </connor>
<garnt> - Dude, do you know what I've imagined right now, </garnt>
<joey> you know the picture of that stick guy who's just like, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That was my exact reaction. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it sounds too much. </connor>
<connor> - Like that's a bit of a generalization </connor>
<joey> but at the same time, I'm thinking, huh, </joey>
<joey> of the people I know who only have friends on discord. </joey>
<joey> As in like only have friends on discord </joey>
<joey> who I've probably like, </joey>
<joey> especially people who have not seen </joey>
<joey> the anime conventions and stuff. </joey>
<joey> It's like always people who </joey>
<garnt> are a bit weird in terms of like </garnt>
<garnt> how they are socially adjusted and everything like that. </garnt>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Honey. </joey>
<garnt> - Imagine this, you make a list of gifts </garnt>
<garnt> you're going to buy for holidays and then someone </garnt>
<garnt> randomly gives you the money to help you buy one. </garnt>
<garnt> Sounds good, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Well that is what Honey's doing. </garnt>
<garnt> - No fucking way. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is exactly what Honey is doing. </garnt>
<connor> - They're helping pay for $1 million worth of gifts card. </connor>
<garnt> - Even Santa could not do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - A whole million. </garnt>
<connor> - They say no more either, this is the money. </connor>
<connor> The real gold. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] You're probably wondering is this the same Honey </joey>
<joey> that automatically searches for promo codes online. </joey>
<connor> - Yes it is, yes it is Joey, of course it is. </connor>
<connor> Why would you even say that. </connor>
<garnt> - I can confirm that it is </garnt>
<garnt> because the script says so. </garnt>
<connor> - With Honey, you can also make a list </connor>
<connor> of all the holiday gifts you want from certain stores </connor>
<connor> and Honey will email you when the price drops </connor>
<connor> on anything on your list. </connor>
<garnt> - Just add Honey to your computer </garnt>
<garnt> create a free account and throw some holiday gifts </garnt>
<garnt> from your drop list for a chance to win. </garnt>
<garnt> To win, what? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I'm glad you asked Garnt, </connor>
<connor> because Honey will select winners </connor>
<connor> and give them money to help buy something on that list. </connor>
<garnt> - You gonna win the money. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are we winning son? </garnt>
<garnt> Are we actually winning son? </garnt>
<garnt> - You are winning son. </garnt>
<connor> If you use Honey. </connor>
<connor> - Joey, what are you going to add </connor>
<connor> to your drop list this Christmas? </connor>
<connor> - I want a PS5. </connor>
<connor> - Understandable, have a nice day. </connor>
<connor> No purchase necessary. </connor>
<connor> You need a PayPal account to redeem the price. </connor>
<joey> - It's only valid in the US until December the 21st, 2020 </joey>
<joey> so get in quick. </joey>
<joey> - So you can get Honey for free </joey>
<garnt> @joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </garnt>
<joey> That is joinhoney.com/trashtaste </joey>
<joey> for all your Christmas needs. </joey>
<garnt> Fuck Santa, go to Honey. </garnt>
<garnt> - Epic. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like there is a difference </garnt>
<joey> between online friends and let's say real friends, okay. </joey>
<joey> Because you know, I say this as someone who </joey>
<joey> has met most of my friends online </joey>
<joey> and has found my fiance online, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like I will say that they didn't feel like real friends </joey>
<joey> like until I saw them in real life. </joey>
<joey> I feel like that's like sealing the deal. </joey>
<joey> Because there's something about having online friends where </joey>
<joey> there's always that wall of like, </joey>
<joey> how well do I really know this person? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And you could, there has been like plenty of times where </joey>
<connor> I've like connected with them immediately, </connor>
<connor> you guys being like some of them. </connor>
<connor> And then there are equally as many times </connor>
<connor> when I've meet them in real life </connor>
<connor> and they're just like, </connor>
<connor> wow, you were not how I imagined you to be </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> and this is weird now and I feel uncomfortable. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we've all been there. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And I feel like if you just have that first step </joey>
<connor> where it is just the online relationship </connor>
<connor> you're missing out on a big part of what it is to </connor>
<garnt> be friends and be social and everything like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I've always been since like fucking age 12, </connor>
<connor> I would happily get on fucking voice chat </connor>
<connor> and talk to like fucking 30 year old, man. </connor>
<joey> Why did I do that? </joey>
<joey> That's a- - Yeah, that's- </joey>
<connor> - That sounds- </connor>
<garnt> - I wouldn't know 11 and 12 year old who do that. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, what was the context of this? </joey>
<garnt> (all chuckle) </garnt>
<garnt> So he invited me to the- </garnt>
<connor> - Sounds like a beginning- </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> It sounds like the beginning to a Chris Hansen episode. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, when you feel like cold Zombies, right? </joey>
<joey> I would gladly get on the mic and like, </joey>
<joey> I would like bully these 30 year old men. </joey>
<joey> Like (indistinct) like I didn't give a fuck dude. </joey>
<joey> When I was 12, I would gladly like shout at people. </joey>
<joey> Like I would be- </joey>
<joey> - Nah, I didn't have that man. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I like the- </joey>
<joey> - This is your anger fucking coming out there. </joey>
<joey> - Like the comments said dude, </joey>
<connor> I'm a walking coin flip, someone said. </connor>
<garnt> - I think you asked for Danny J yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, you asked for Danny, </garnt>
<garnt> you coming out of bottom again. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> I love that meme. </joey>
<joey> No joke, right? </joey>
<joey> My little brother was too scared </joey>
<joey> to argue with people online. </joey>
<joey> So when he did start to argue with people online </joey>
<joey> and I was in the other room, I'll be like, </joey>
<joey> Owen, give me the fucking headset, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to argue, you play. </joey>
<connor> So I would fucking shout at them for him </connor>
<connor> because he couldn't do that good. </connor>
<connor> And he would lose the arguments. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you're not losing the arguments on my account. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> Over my fucking dead body. </connor>
<joey> - Do you think I would allow you to lose that? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I would just 'cause </joey>
<joey> it's one of those things right where, </joey>
<joey> I would not fall for shit when I was like 12 or 13. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The shit that they would try and pull. </joey>
<joey> For some reason I knew what was happening </joey>
<garnt> most of the time when I was aware. </garnt>
<garnt> Because even from like age- </garnt>
<garnt> - What was happening? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was just fucking playing zombies </garnt>
<garnt> with them most of the time, </garnt>
<garnt> most of the chill. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, it was all good. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was weird back then because it just started </garnt>
<joey> when everyone started voice chatting, </joey>
<joey> I think it was new and it wasn't really weird yet. </joey>
<joey> Now it's weird if you do. </joey>
<joey> I think it's super weird. </joey>
<garnt> But back then, I didn't think of it as that weird </garnt>
<connor> when I was a kid, but maybe try to- </connor>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, back then it was like this new thing </garnt>
<garnt> and now we've so many fucking weird stories coming up. </garnt>
<connor> You gotta be- - Yeah, now it's not... </connor>
<garnt> If I had a 12 year old kid </garnt>
<garnt> and I heard him talking to a 30 old man, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be like, what the fuck you doing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> But like, I get why people </connor>
<connor> have a lot of online friends it's because </connor>
<connor> most of the time people search for online friends </connor>
<connor> because they don't find that connection in the people- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, totally no, I did. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I did, yeah I totally felt that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's the same thing I would say is like, </joey>
<joey> when you, you can have like the best friend in the world </joey>
<connor> but as soon as like you move in with each other </connor>
<connor> and live in the same house </connor>
<connor> that like can change a lot of dynamics. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Especially, you know, you meet somebody, </connor>
<joey> especially in fucking uni, </joey>
<joey> you meet some people you think are chill </joey>
<joey> as soon as you move in with each other </joey>
<joey> you start hating each other. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, it's true, it's true. </joey>
<joey> - And you see all their little fucking ticks and stuff </joey>
<connor> that just get on your nerves so... </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there was like a... </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I've basically been raised </connor>
<garnt> like on the internet, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like ever since like age 11, </connor>
<connor> I was playing Runescape, I was doing show on Miniclip like. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I always did not mind talking to strangers. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I always thought like, </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to give out any personal information. </joey>
<joey> I know I never did. </joey>
<joey> For some reason I was smart enough </joey>
<joey> to never do anything like that. </joey>
<joey> And there must have been a good cha... </joey>
<joey> Maybe like a year in my life </joey>
<joey> where I pretty much only spoke to online people </joey>
<joey> like friends that I felt were like my friends. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, it must've been maybe first year of university. </connor>
<joey> - It's really weird, I never had a concept </joey>
<connor> of an online friend until I started YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like I never would get on to, like- </joey>
<connor> - I feel like we were two different sides of the coin </connor>
<connor> because I was always like, I would always go on- </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause in my head I was like, </joey>
<joey> why would I talk to this random person online </joey>
<joey> when I have IRL friends to talk to. </joey>
<connor> - Well, that's the- - That's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> - Well, there you go Joey, here is where it gets sad, </connor>
<joey> it didn't at the time. </joey>
<joey> And the thing is, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that you think, Oh, this is, </joey>
<joey> like 'cause I used to see those things on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause back then you should see this things </joey>
<joey> like online friends are real friends. </joey>
<garnt> Mom, you don't get it. </garnt>
<garnt> Back when Tumblr was like peak Tumblr. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I used to totally agree with that. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was like, I was 16 and that's all I had. </joey>
<joey> And then after I like actually got real friends I was like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, this is what normal friendships are. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like, it's like totally different. </joey>
<joey> It's something that like, </joey>
<joey> I don't think you realize kind of affects you </joey>
<joey> 'cause you totally think you're fine </joey>
<joey> and I think you can be well adjusted </joey>
<joey> sort of if you have only online friends, </joey>
<garnt> but it's a lot harder. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like having that IRL </joey>
<joey> kind of interaction to ground you and make sure </joey>
<connor> you're not doing weird things and </connor>
<connor> that you're interacting in a healthy way, right. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, 'cause the thing about only having online friends </garnt>
<garnt> is that inevitably you are just living in your own bubble. </garnt>
<connor> It is an online bubble, right? - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> And you live through what you present to them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, right? </connor>
<connor> You're only presenting one side of yourself </connor>
<connor> or the best side of yourself, </connor>
<connor> you're not seeing every side of a person. </connor>
<connor> So inevitably if you just live in a bubble, </connor>
<joey> you might luck out and be like, </joey>
<joey> okay this is actually a healthy, nice, </joey>
<joey> nicely balanced bubble. </joey>
<joey> But you know, most of the time </joey>
<joey> you're missing some kind of that social interaction. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Social connection that you just don't get online </joey>
<connor> unfortunately. </connor>
<garnt> - And I also think because </garnt>
<joey> I made a lot of the friends through gaming. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of the time how you were as friends </joey>
<joey> was dependent on how you were in the game. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And obviously, I was definitely really good at the games. </joey>
<joey> So I was normally like, yeah, I'm kind of cool. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> And it was one of those things where online </joey>
<joey> when I switch this people, like I was like, </joey>
<joey> to those friends I was respected and they thought, </joey>
<joey> wow, this guy is so cool he just does his own thing. </joey>
<joey> But in real life I was a fucking loser. </joey>
<joey> (all chuckle) </joey>
<joey> And it kind of made this dichotomy in my head </joey>
<joey> where I'm like, yeah, I'm funny, yeah, I'm charming </joey>
<joey> and then I'd go meet up with people and I fucking struggle. </joey>
<joey> Like I couldn't, I didn't know how to </joey>
<joey> 'cause I hadn't really, I wasn't very well adjusted. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it made me think a lot </joey>
<joey> and it makes me look back and I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's like, how do you convince someone </joey>
<joey> when they're in there to see it. </joey>
<joey> Like, where in that sense of, I only have online friends. </joey>
<joey> How do you make them see that maybe that </joey>
<joey> it's not a healthy relationship. </joey>
<connor> Like it's not very healthy </connor>
<connor> because to them they might be perfectly happy and fine. </connor>
<joey> - Right and that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> I think it's just a matter of perspective, right? </joey>
<joey> Because to them, that's all they know. </joey>
<joey> So I don't think </joey>
<joey> until they actually experienced the other side </joey>
<joey> of like trying to begin and start and maintain IRL friends. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They just won't know. </joey>
<joey> They'll be like, Oh, why would I do that? </joey>
<joey> When this is so much easier and more comfortable. </joey>
<connor> - And also I realized as well that like, </connor>
<joey> when I was predominantly spending all my time online, </joey>
<joey> it felt like I could never make any progress in my life. </joey>
<garnt> Because I was not investing anything in real life. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I'd go to work and I'd go home </garnt>
<joey> but that was about it, right. </joey>
<joey> I never made any investment elsewhere. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And I felt like my life stagnated because of that, </joey>
<joey> because I didn't... </joey>
<joey> I think when you make friends IRL- </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you didn't seek out something else. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> Because when you make friends IRL </joey>
<joey> it's not just that it's like you miss out </joey>
<joey> on a lot of opportunities in general. </joey>
<joey> Like, because you're not putting yourself out there. </joey>
<joey> You're not, </joey>
<joey> maybe other jobs you might hear about. </joey>
<joey> You miss out on a lot of things I think. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's not just as simple </joey>
<joey> as having friends and having friends it's like, </joey>
<joey> there's a lot of stuff that comes with having IRL friends. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's really made me think a lot recently </joey>
<connor> especially 'cause like moving to Japan as well, </connor>
<connor> it's really made me think a lot. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause it's been a year, right? </joey>
<joey> Since you guys moved. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's been a goddamn year since we moved here. </joey>
<joey> My God! </joey>
<joey> - Already. </joey>
<garnt> - This is not felt like a year at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 2020 has been fucking weird though to be fair. </connor>
<connor> But how was it for you guys, your first year here in Japan? </connor>
<joey> It's been, I mean, to be fair, it's probably, </joey>
<joey> pretty abnormal year for people who moved around this time </joey>
<garnt> 'cause of the rona but- </garnt>
<joey> - It's been a strange year all around. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think, </joey>
<joey> I don't feel like I've spent a proper year here in Japan, </joey>
<joey> mostly because like I felt like part of the </joey>
<garnt> experience I was expecting from Japan was </garnt>
<garnt> to have people visit me. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> And I had a lot of friends who </garnt>
<garnt> had planned to come visit us in Japan </garnt>
<joey> and it just- </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly that's half the fun of living in this country. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, it's like being like, Oh man, </garnt>
<garnt> I've always wanted to visit Japan </garnt>
<joey> or like I'm coming to visit Japan. </joey>
<joey> And you're just like, </joey>
<garnt> My boy, I got you bro. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanted to be on the other side of that, </joey>
<joey> on the other side of that fence. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've been on the visiting side </joey>
<joey> and I remember how amazing shit was when I first moved here </joey>
<joey> and everything was so bright eyed and you could take me </joey>
<connor> to a fucking family Mart or a Konbini and be like, </connor>
<connor> yo, yo, you eat this like katsu Curry every day </connor>
<joey> with this fried chicken, yo- </joey>
<joey> - And you got sandwiches, what the fuck? </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Just watching those interactions is like so fucking fun </garnt>
<garnt> because to you now it's just so normal </garnt>
<connor> but to them, it's just so fucking alien. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, I remembered like I was at the supermarket </joey>
<joey> and I would just thought to myself, </joey>
<joey> man, I remember when I used to think </joey>
<joey> this shit was like insane. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like, now I feel like there's nowhere else left </joey>
<connor> on earth where I'm ever going to go </connor>
<connor> and it's going to feel magical. </connor>
<connor> And it felt kind of sad for a second because- </connor>
<joey> - Japan is the final boss of countries. </joey>
<joey> - Because I had been hyping up Japan my whole, </joey>
<joey> like teenage to adult life. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was the one place that I always really wanted to go. </joey>
<joey> So I went to America and it was amazing. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. - Yeah, I loved it </joey>
<joey> because I'd always hyped of America to myself. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then Japan was the last place that I hadn't been to. </joey>
<joey> That was like, I really want to go here </joey>
<joey> 'cause my parents took me to Europe all the time </joey>
<joey> and I was kind of sick of it. </joey>
<joey> That's sounds so fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Privileged. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I was sick and tired of traveling Europe. </joey>
<joey> I mean, my parents took me to like France every single year </joey>
<joey> and I was like, dying to- </joey>
<joey> - That sounds like a luxury dude. </joey>
<joey> - We were camping in like tents </joey>
<joey> and I just liked playing video games </joey>
<joey> and I couldn't play video games for three weeks. </joey>
<joey> So it was basically being like forced to be a caveman </joey>
<garnt> for three weeks and like swim. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, Ugh! Okay, I swim every day, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, it was basically the last place I wanted to go. </garnt>
<joey> And I remember the first time I landed here, </joey>
<joey> even though I hadn't slept for like 20 hours, </joey>
<joey> I was so fucking hyped. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was just, this is fucking insane. </joey>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> I can get vending machine, what? </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - It's vending machines and they work. </joey>
<joey> - I thought I would like, </joey>
<garnt> I remember when I came in for the first time </garnt>
<joey> I thought if I ever move here </joey>
<garnt> I'm going to get vending machine coffee every fucking day </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause this shit is awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I can't fucking stand vending machine coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Literally every- </garnt>
<garnt> - Get that shit outta here. </garnt>
<garnt> Just give you my Starbucks like I do everywhere else. </garnt>
<connor> - When you first come here, </connor>
<joey> every vending machine you like, I guess I'm getting coffee. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> It's hot coffee, baby. </joey>
<connor> But yeah, now you have it and you're like this is the worst. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you remember when we first moving here </garnt>
<garnt> and you get like (indistinct) which is all you can drink. </garnt>
<garnt> Like was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - Colds life to earth. </garnt>
<joey> - It was like a God sense. </joey>
<garnt> Like whenever we'd go here and we'd go to like the Zacchaeus </garnt>
<garnt> and we thought we'd be going to like Keno Kuda </garnt>
<garnt> every fucking day. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It's there gnome hoda? </connor>
<joey> Not even a question, of course </joey>
<joey> - Keno Kuda is essentially worth the sprint. </joey>
<joey> I think we said that before, but it's very cheap, </joey>
<joey> very cheap. </joey>
<joey> It's like 15 bucks all you can drink for two hours. </joey>
<joey> It's nuts. - [Joey] Yeah, </joey>
<joey> something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but then you realize </joey>
<connor> Oh, shit I actually like my liver a little bit </connor>
<connor> and I don't want to fucking ruin it. </connor>
<garnt> - And I also liked good food as well. </garnt>
<joey> And there's no got bad food </joey>
<joey> but you just get better- </joey>
<joey> - It's very average food. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> You just get better food elsewhere. </joey>
<joey> Because I remember like coming to Japan, like everything... </joey>
<joey> In my eyes all food in Japan was amazing </joey>
<joey> and then I lived here </joey>
<joey> and now I've realized that it's all good </joey>
<joey> but there are different tiers of how good it can be- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm going to wonder what it's like when I </joey>
<joey> whenever I go back to England or something </joey>
<garnt> where good food is just so much harder to find </garnt>
<garnt> than it is here, where it's just readily available. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I'm getting pot noodle the moment I get back. </connor>
<connor> Bombay bad boy pot noddle. </connor>
<joey> - You should just like do the opposite. </joey>
<joey> You should just fucking commit and just go to a Wetherspoons </joey>
<garnt> and just be like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I love Wetherspoons food. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well then there you go but- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's got shit taste. - Let's how it is. </garnt>
<joey> Let's see how it is after you- </joey>
<joey> - I fuck with Wetherspoon's food. </joey>
<joey> What I don't understand is Connor's fucking obsession </joey>
<connor> with the Tesco- </connor>
<connor> - Meal deals. </connor>
<connor> - Tesco meal deals. - What's that? </connor>
<garnt> - You had one. - You had one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I forced you to. </garnt>
<garnt> So Tesco meal deals, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's a thing in the UK for three pounds </garnt>
<garnt> which is about maybe just under $4, $4. </garnt>
<joey> You get a nice sandwich, a big bag of crisps </joey>
<joey> and like one of the premium drinks. </joey>
<joey> You can get like a smoothie, </joey>
<joey> you can get like an energy drink. </joey>
<joey> - Did I have that? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I took you because you've got the big sandwich </joey>
<joey> and it's quite big and get a big bag of a crisp. </joey>
<garnt> You fucking loved it. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember you were like, </garnt>
<garnt> yo, is all this for three pounds. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, yeah, it's insane, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I think I'm vaguely remembering. </joey>
<connor> - And I really like the sandwiches they make. </connor>
<joey> - I remember I had the Wetherspoons that I had on </joey>
<joey> in some kind of train station and I was like- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That was pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> I took Joey to the Wetherspoons of Victoria station </connor>
<connor> it was terrible. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't think Wetherspoons is terrible. </garnt>
<joey> I like what's- </joey>
<joey> - It depends on the pub though. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it does, it does. </joey>
<garnt> But for the most part Wetherspoons is like pretty, </garnt>
<garnt> pretty decent for the price you get. </garnt>
<joey> - The one there though was, we were, </joey>
<connor> I think we were struggling to find a clean table. </connor>
<connor> Like longer than actually deciding what to eat. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was gross. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember when Joey was coming to visit </garnt>
<joey> me and Connor were like discussing, </joey>
<joey> Oh, what should we do here? </joey>
<joey> What should we show him? </joey>
<joey> Connor was like Tesco meal deal. </joey>
<connor> Tesco meal deal. </connor>
<connor> I'm getting him a Tesco meal deal. </connor>
<connor> I'm like Connor, for fuck's sake nobody gives a shit </connor>
<connor> about your three pound Tesco meal deal, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, I don't care if I become a billionaire </garnt>
<garnt> you bet I'm going to be eating McDonald's </garnt>
<connor> and fucking Tesco meal deals until the day I fucking die. </connor>
<connor> That shit is value and I won't hear otherwise. </connor>
<connor> And it tastes amazing, okay? </connor>
<connor> It tastes good. </connor>
<connor> - I genuinely don't remember eating it. </connor>
<joey> Like I feel like, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - I'm hurt Joey. </connor>
<garnt> I'm hurt, I really I'm. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, after living in like, after living in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and like living in Asia where convenient stores just have </garnt>
<garnt> in my opinion, just good food to choose from- </garnt>
<connor> - I think the sandwiches in Tesco are better than Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, sandwiches have like mayonnaise </garnt>
<connor> and like Ketchup and all that shit in it. </connor>
<joey> I don't need that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, you're out of the question. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Where does all the crust go in Japan? </joey>
<joey> Where is it? </joey>
<joey> Where's all the crust gone? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, probably just thrown out. </joey>
<joey> - For some reasonable sandwiches don't have crusts on them. </joey>
<garnt> Where is it? </garnt>
<garnt> Give me my fucking crust. </garnt>
<connor> I love the crust in sandwiches. </connor>
<garnt> - I think though sometimes the sandwich- </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually that's the reason I like Japanese sandwiches. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, in some- </joey>
<connor> - You're like a 12 year kid. </connor>
<connor> Like you can't have Mayo, you can't eat the fucking crust </connor>
<connor> on your, this man doesn't like- </connor>
<garnt> - It's still bread. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah man, what's the problem? </connor>
<garnt> It tastes good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just wasted. </garnt>
<connor> Wasted bread that's like tasteless- </connor>
<garnt> - Wasted bread, it's the good- </garnt>
<garnt> - It tastes like bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yo, it's the flavor, dude. </garnt>
<connor> It's the best part of the bread. </connor>
<joey> - What's so good, it's tastes like cardboard. </joey>
<connor> - No, it doesn't. </connor>
<connor> No, it doesn't. - What? </connor>
<joey> It tastes exactly like the bread that's attached to it. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the crust on pizza, okay. </joey>
<joey> Why does crust on pizza exist </joey>
<joey> and why does everyone pretend that- </joey>
<joey> - It tastes good. </joey>
<joey> - No, it doesn't. </joey>
<connor> You eat the pizza for the fucking bread, cheese </connor>
<connor> and tomato sauce combination. </connor>
<connor> - You're literally a 12 year old kid. </connor>
<connor> - Why would I want to eat pizza, </connor>
<joey> that is why would I just want to eat </joey>
<joey> the bread part of the pizza where I wanna have pizza, </joey>
<joey> I want the pizza part of the pizza. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> That's because your eating it wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're going right up to the crust mainly, </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta save a little bit of the sauce and cheese- </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly then they go on the side. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> People think I'm a fucking psychopath when I eat pizza, </connor>
<joey> the way I actually eat pizza at home which is crust first. </joey>
<joey> I eat the crust first because </joey>
<joey> I get the taste of shit out of the way. </joey>
<joey> So I'm only left- </joey>
<joey> - Then how do you hold the pizza? </joey>
<garnt> - I just hold it like a, like... </garnt>
<connor> - What the fuck are you doing bro? </connor>
<joey> You're holding it like L dude, like is it fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Look, look, look. </joey>
<garnt> I just save the best part till last. </garnt>
<garnt> Why would I save the tasteless part till last? </garnt>
<joey> I don't enjoy eating the crust. </joey>
<joey> - You're making it tasteless by only eating the crust. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you need to combo it, dude. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> If you save a little bit of the sauce </garnt>
<garnt> that sauce could be with the actual pizza. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - But the pizza has plenty of sauce. </joey>
<joey> - It's like eating the fucking, </joey>
<garnt> it's like when you're having a nice fucking meal </garnt>
<garnt> and you eat your broccoli and vegetables first </garnt>
<garnt> and you have like your chicken or your steak afterwards </garnt>
<connor> you save the best parts for last. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, do you always everything's separate? </connor>
<garnt> - Not always. </garnt>
<garnt> If it like synergizes perfectly, if it's- </garnt>
<connor> - Like you would know. </connor>
<connor> Like you would fucking know Mr. Harmbody. </connor>
<connor> - The crust synergizes with the pizza. </connor>
<connor> - No, it doesn't. </connor>
<joey> The crust just takes the pizza taste out. </joey>
<joey> - I go fucking Italian HAM on this bitch like </joey>
<joey> it synergizes. </joey>
<connor> - When you get those shitty frozen pizzas, right. </connor>
<joey> That are like $1 a pound, right? </joey>
<garnt> They're the ones with no crust. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know those fucking fake deep dish pizzas </garnt>
<garnt> that are just all bread and like the finish- </garnt>
<garnt> - They're fucking horrible. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like his fucking dream it must be without crust. </connor>
<connor> - My fucking dream is like proper thin crust, </connor>
<connor> Italian pizzas, where like </connor>
<connor> the pizza goes right up to the crust </connor>
<connor> and it's because it's so thin it doesn't take, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't get in the way of the actual pizza itself. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't get into the way of the slice. </connor>
<connor> Sorry. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta grip on something. </connor>
<joey> - I don't give a shit about greasy fucking hands </joey>
<joey> if the pizza tastes better. - I do. </joey>
<joey> - That's just optimizing the pizza. </joey>
<joey> There is so much wasted space on pizza, </joey>
<garnt> that's it's, like the crust gets in the way </garnt>
<garnt> of the pizza taste. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, then okay, why don't you do this then, </joey>
<joey> when you get the pizza next time, right </joey>
<joey> and there's a thick crust, </joey>
<joey> just fold that bitch in half. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because that's like, that means- </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like you're making a problem out of this </connor>
<connor> that doesn't need to be there. - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Just roll up the pizza so that it's all in one thing </connor>
<joey> and then just- </joey>
<connor> - I just assume, right? </connor>
<joey> Whenever I see anyone who leaves the crust on a sandwich </joey>
<joey> or leaves the crust on a pizza I'm like, </joey>
<connor> your parents clearly didn't like beat it into you </connor>
<joey> to eat that shit dude. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - 'Cause my- </connor>
<connor> - If I left crust on bread my mom would beat my ass. </connor>
<connor> - She'd murder me. </connor>
<joey> - She'd be like, why are you wasting food? </joey>
<connor> And I'll be like- </connor>
<connor> - I got away with a lot of shit </connor>
<connor> but leaving food was not one of them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - No, that's why if I have to eat pizza, </joey>
<garnt> I eat it crust first. </garnt>
<connor> Like when- </connor>
<connor> - He's just there (wailing) </connor>
<joey> - You make it sound like a fucking torture man. </joey>
<garnt> It's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is torture for me because </garnt>
<garnt> you're ruining this good fucking food </garnt>
<connor> with just tasteless bread. </connor>
<connor> - There was only one time where it's acceptable </connor>
<joey> to leave the crust on a pizza </joey>
<joey> and that is a buffet of pizza </joey>
<joey> where it's like I got to optimize this shit. </joey>
<joey> I don't want none of this shit. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's always shit crust. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<joey> - But if you just have dominoes, </joey>
<garnt> then you have the crust. </garnt>
<garnt> - And also and like crust just takes extra room. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just extra room in your stomach </garnt>
<joey> that can be filled with nice tasty pizza. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to get filled up with like tasteless crust- </joey>
<joey> - How small is your fucking stomach? </joey>
<garnt> - I want that fucking pizza, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - How small is your stomach? </garnt>
<garnt> Or I guess this tiny bit of crust here is going to- </garnt>
<garnt> - I know I'm right. </garnt>
<joey> I am not the crazy one here. </joey>
<joey> - How did we get on pizza. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I've been quiet about this for too long. </joey>
<garnt> Crustless gang, where you at, where you at crustless gang. </garnt>
<connor> - All the ten-year-olds raised their hands. </connor>
<garnt> - Me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Point is, where is the crust Japan? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't like it if they take it from me </joey>
<joey> because sometimes I think the best part of the sandwich </joey>
<garnt> is like the give, the crust adds to it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You gotta bite it a little bit, </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta target a little bit. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sometimes it just crumbles apart without the crust, </garnt>
<connor> it's like the integrity of this sandwich has been ruined. </connor>
<connor> - It's been optimized. </connor>
<connor> - It is not been optimized. </connor>
<garnt> - You cut off all the useless pieces- </garnt>
<connor> - Although, </connor>
<connor> I will say sometimes 711 is by far the guiltiest of this, </connor>
<joey> you'll get a sandwich from 711, right? </joey>
<joey> And they'll show you the sandwich, </joey>
<joey> it looks like fucking packed in the front dude. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This thing is like quadruple ham slices, right? </joey>
<joey> You open up the sandwich then you get it out you're like, </joey>
<joey> Oh my God, it's thick. </joey>
<joey> And then as you realize you grabbing your hand </joey>
<connor> you're like, huh, it's pretty thin, </connor>
<connor> pretty thin at the end you peel it up and there's no ham. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - At the other half of the sandwich </connor>
<connor> and you're like, I've been fucking played. </connor>
<joey> - You got fucking clique baited by sandwich. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then you have to like, weirdly like curl the bread up </connor>
<joey> so you can get like an even bite of bread. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking. </joey>
<joey> 711, can you fucking sort that shit out. </joey>
<joey> And everyone says that food is the best </joey>
<joey> but it's honestly the worst one out of the... </joey>
<connor> Ah no, Family Mart is, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - No, Family Mart is the worst. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I have to stand with Family Mart. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I'm a 711 simp man. </garnt>
<connor> - You're a Lawson simp, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I love Lawson. </garnt>
<joey> We're just looking at the Konbini. </joey>
<joey> We'll save for the Konbini. </joey>
<garnt> - We're going to leave this for the Konbini </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll do it. </garnt>
<garnt> We need to just you ask a- </garnt>
<connor> - There are three genders. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> (laughter drowns out speaker) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - No, it's like the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between fucking Tesco's, Sainsbury's and co-op, right? </garnt>
<joey> You know, they- </joey>
<joey> - I don't know but I'll just agree with you in that case. </joey>
<garnt> - What did they have in fucking Australia? </garnt>
<joey> - What, in terms of convenience stores? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Carbot, chipublic. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, no one goes to a convenience store in Australia. </joey>
<joey> It's all just supermarkets. </joey>
<connor> - Spike bottlers, as they say. </connor>
<connor> - No that's a liquor store. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Expect that is your lunch. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I don't want to buy food from a liquor store. </joey>
<connor> - I will say probably the thing that I </connor>
<connor> very quickly got adjusted to </connor>
<joey> that I think that will hit me like whiplash when I return </joey>
<joey> is deliveries here. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. - Because- </joey>
<joey> - Are you speaking of optimized? </joey>
<joey> - You get so used to it here because what happens is, </joey>
<joey> have we spoke about this on a podcast before? </joey>
<joey> I don't think we have, have we? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> - So when you get a delivery in like </joey>
<joey> I guess any other country, </joey>
<joey> it's like will arrive between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM. </joey>
<joey> And you just got to be home on a Tuesday, </joey>
<joey> hope you listen out, you know? </joey>
<joey> And then you fucking miss it. </joey>
<joey> - For a single knock on the door. </joey>
<joey> - And they didn't knock on the door, </joey>
<joey> they say that they were there and it's like bullshit. </joey>
<joey> No, you didn't. </joey>
<joey> And then it's this whole fucking pain, </joey>
<joey> then you got to try and reschedule like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, we can come back in four days. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> I pre-ordered this game. </joey>
<joey> I wanted it today. </joey>
<joey> But in Japan, when you miss a package, </joey>
<joey> not only can you reschedule on that day </joey>
<joey> within a two hour time slot. </joey>
<joey> So if you miss it between like 8:00 and 12:00 AM </joey>
<joey> which is the only four hour time slot. </joey>
<joey> - You can get it redelivered between 12 and two, </joey>
<joey> four and six, six and eight, nine to- </joey>
<joey> - Like the same day delivery. </joey>
<joey> - Literally the whole day </joey>
<joey> and you can pick the two hour, it's nuts. </joey>
<connor> And on Amazon, when you do it </connor>
<connor> you can also pick the two hour time slot. </connor>
<garnt> It's nuts. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so insane and it works. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there are also like, </garnt>
<garnt> what is it, where the UK and stuff, some places have like </garnt>
<connor> in London I have like Amazon now or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we do have that. </connor>
<garnt> - That's insane to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I spoke about that on the podcast before </garnt>
<connor> when I ordered like Mario party and shit. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's when it arrives literally a few hours </joey>
<connor> after you order it. </connor>
<garnt> - Why don't we have that, man? </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised </garnt>
<connor> if Japan gets into something. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I would love that because- </garnt>
<joey> - I would never leave my house if there was that. </joey>
<joey> I just fucking get- </joey>
<joey> - Well, it was made for groceries mainly. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, right? - It just happened to have, </joey>
<garnt> like products. - Which is weird. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I was thinking back to our podcast last week </garnt>
<garnt> with the Lexion and I remember thinking to myself, </garnt>
<joey> man, how would I have survived in Japan </joey>
<joey> and got set up if Amazon didn't exist? </joey>
<joey> Like he did. </joey>
<joey> Like when he first moved here and I was just thinking, </joey>
<joey> man, so much of my life has revolved around Amazon in Japan </joey>
<garnt> that if I didn't have it, I would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> life would be 10 times harder. </garnt>
<connor> - It does become, when something is on Amazon </connor>
<joey> I've noticed it becomes about 10 times more difficult </joey>
<joey> to get the thing that I want and delivered the- </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you have to walk it up </connor>
<joey> and being like, all right, where's the closest store </joey>
<connor> and then you have to find out when the stores open </connor>
<joey> and then you have to go in and fucking look for it. </joey>
<connor> It's just- - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's a mess. - Moving, gross. </joey>
<connor> - But I also think I would still feel kind of sad </connor>
<connor> because I feel that because everything is so easy </connor>
<joey> and I got comments, a couple of comments complaints </joey>
<joey> about not knowing Japanese and living in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Not complaining, I'm just fucking British </joey>
<joey> and I'm just complaining about the things </joey>
<joey> that I complain about. </joey>
<joey> I know it's my fault for not knowing Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he's British. - I'm not a fucking idiot. </joey>
<joey> I know who that is probably not a good idea </joey>
<joey> to not speak Japanese till you get your back, right? </joey>
<joey> But a lot of people do come here to learn, right. </joey>
<joey> And I do think that if I was forced to, </joey>
<joey> say 10 years ago or 15 years ago, </joey>
<joey> I think that I would have been forced to learn a lot more </joey>
<joey> because I would have no choice, right? </joey>
<joey> Right now, I don't need to do anything. </joey>
<joey> Google maps tells you where to go, </joey>
<connor> Google maps tells me the restaurants. </connor>
<connor> I Google translate every webpage. </connor>
<connor> Like it's pretty much all sorted for me. </connor>
<joey> - It's catering more towards foreigners definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - It also doesn't help that this is basically </garnt>
<garnt> a society that has optimized like- </garnt>
<joey> - Not talking to people. </joey>
<joey> - Getting the least amount of human interaction posture. </joey>
<joey> You go to a restaurant and you have a tablet </joey>
<joey> and you order your stuff. </joey>
<garnt> So most of the time you don't even need to talk to anyone. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Which is what, I like, I get, </connor>
<garnt> you must get this a lot, right? </garnt>
<connor> Do you get comments asking you like, </connor>
<connor> how's your Japanese coming along? </connor>
<connor> How's your Japanese coming along? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah Garnt, how is it coming? </joey>
<joey> - It is, </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Is it Josie? </garnt>
<garnt> - It is, I've already gotten Josie a few times. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It's difficult, right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's hard to explain. </connor>
<garnt> Because essentially, I think people have a misconception </garnt>
<garnt> of how much we interact with Japanese people. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I talk to a Japanese person </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm forced to speak Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> most often at the Konbini or at the Danny's or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> like at a restaurant or a store. </garnt>
<garnt> Those are the three most common times. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's a script. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I know exactly what they're going to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - They always say the same things. </connor>
<connor> - I know exactly what you mean </connor>
<connor> 'cause we were getting coffee </connor>
<connor> like I think it was last week or something </connor>
<garnt> at the book walk offices and Connor ordered the coffee </garnt>
<garnt> and it almost sounded like fucking fluent </garnt>
<garnt> with all the responses he was making. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was just, I think it was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I know how it is where you've ordered something enough times </garnt>
<garnt> that you just know the question that you get asked. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I've perfectly optimized ordering coffee. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, when you watch a movie and you see the line </joey>
<garnt> before the actors say it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I know what you're going to say. </joey>
<garnt> - I know where the, if that script is like varied </garnt>
<garnt> like in the slightest, you just go, you just go, like </garnt>
<connor> I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Because what happens is I'll be ordering coffee, right. </connor>
<connor> And here's the order every single time. </connor>
<garnt> You go in there, you say what you want, </garnt>
<connor> they'll ask you, do you want it to stay or to go. </connor>
<garnt> So your gonna say to go. </garnt>
<connor> And then they'll ask you, do you want a bag? </connor>
<connor> You say, no, you don't want a bag. </connor>
<connor> And then you just say how you want to pay. </connor>
<connor> So you can just say that, right. </connor>
<connor> And it's always how it is. </connor>
<connor> And every time it goes wrong and if Joey's with me </connor>
<connor> I'll just slowly turn to Joey and be like... </connor>
<joey> (Joey chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - There's only two times I've seen a slow head turn </joey>
<connor> and that's in a horror movie and when I'm with you guys </connor>
<joey> and it's out of the script, it's just very slow like, help. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't want to go, Joey help. </joey>
<joey> I just wanna be like, </joey>
<garnt> dozo Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll leave it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's actually funny when you're not there </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause when it's, there have been times </garnt>
<joey> when it's just me and Connor </joey>
<garnt> and we're at like a restaurant ordering something </garnt>
<garnt> and then we get something off script </garnt>
<garnt> and it's both of us trying to like, </garnt>
<garnt> cumminisively figure out which one of us knows like </garnt>
<joey> as much Japanese as each other. </joey>
<joey> Like, we're trying to like combine </joey>
<joey> our Japanese knowledge to be like, okay, you know this word, </joey>
<joey> I know that word so we can, </joey>
<joey> let's try and figure out what were saying. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's combine these two words together. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the thing though like, that's like one... </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm such a fucking sadist but like, </garnt>
<connor> that's the one thing I fucking love when </connor>
<connor> friends who can't speak Japanese, I'm hanging out with- </connor>
<connor> - But are assholes. </connor>
<connor> - And we go to like a restaurant or something </connor>
<connor> or we go out somewhere or we go traveling somewhere is that, </connor>
<garnt> because I don't look Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> people don't expect me to know Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I love every now and then going to a restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> with like a bunch of non Japanese friends </garnt>
<garnt> and pretending I can't speak a word of Japanese </garnt>
<joey> and just letting them be. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, (speaks in a foreign language) </joey>
<joey> and there just like, fuck you. </joey>
<connor> Fuck you Joey. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, outside of those situations, </connor>
<connor> we pretty much don't really speak to Japanese people. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Although to be fair you've been recently </joey>
<joey> fucking interacting with like- - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Japanese people on Apex, right? </joey>
<connor> - Well, so I thought to myself, right? </connor>
<connor> I'm taking these Japanese classes two times a week, </connor>
<connor> problem is I'm not really doing much outside of that </connor>
<connor> and then people will be like, Oh, why don't you study more? </connor>
<connor> I mean, the work schedule that we have is already </connor>
<joey> pretty fucking hectic. </joey>
<joey> - And there's only so much studying </joey>
<joey> before you have to actually use it in practice. </joey>
<connor> - I think like, no matter how much study I do </connor>
<joey> if I'm not using it. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like practically, it's not going to help. </joey>
<garnt> So yeah, I just decided, fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, you know what? </garnt>
<joey> I'm going to stream talking to Japanese people on Apex. </joey>
<joey> Just trying to make friends. </joey>
<joey> I wanna just to make some friends pretty fucking fast. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Even though most people do not want to talk. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I was tuning into one of your streams </connor>
<connor> and you were like interacting quite well. </connor>
<connor> - I can speak super, super basic and- </connor>
<joey> - But they were getting it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> They can normally understand what I'm trying to say. </joey>
<joey> The best thing is is that if I don't know something, </joey>
<joey> I'm like chat, chat, what is this word? </joey>
<joey> How do I say this thing? </joey>
<joey> And then they tell me, and I don't forget it </joey>
<joey> because I'm using it. </joey>
<garnt> Like immediately over and over. </garnt>
<joey> And so that's been a really helpful. </joey>
<joey> And if you want to go and watch those, you can watch them </joey>
<joey> on the highlights, whatever (murmurs) </joey>
<joey> But yeah, that's been super helpful. </joey>
<connor> But outside of that, like we don't fucking use it. </connor>
<joey> Like- - I mean, </joey>
<joey> you can use, I can talk to you guys in Japanese. </joey>
<connor> - But it's, okay Joey, it's different 'cause- </connor>
<joey> - It's different Joey. </joey>
<connor> - Because you know how bad we are </connor>
<connor> and it's embarrassing right? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, okay, okay. </connor>
<joey> You have to throw that aside because like- </joey>
<connor> - I'm fine doing it in front of 2000 people live. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But not in front of me? </joey>
<joey> - No, not in front of you. - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Because- </joey>
<joey> - I'm not going to judge you. </joey>
<garnt> - Joey's a smart motherfucker. </garnt>
<joey> - We know, that's not the point </joey>
<joey> we judge ourselves when we're with you. </joey>
<joey> It's like a subconscious thing where I'm just like- </joey>
<connor> - I don't want you to be disappointed in me Joey. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm not going to be disappointed. </connor>
<garnt> - I want to just impress you, man. </garnt>
<joey> I want to impress you, okay? </joey>
<garnt> I just want to get new hunger Josie by you man, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> But I know how Josie your Japanese is, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't reach that level right now, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like trying to impress your dad is like, </garnt>
<joey> come on man, this is the only time I go get my dad's love. </joey>
<joey> - Because, </joey>
<connor> I don't know what it is about talking to a Japanese person, </connor>
<connor> even though it's even more awkward </connor>
<joey> 'cause if they don't understand me, we're fucked </joey>
<joey> but it's less awkward because they </joey>
<joey> inherently expect me to be fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So it's like when I do do good, it's like, Oh awesome. </joey>
<joey> Like it's good but- </joey>
<joey> - So why don't you just put that on me? </joey>
<connor> - Because you can pretty figure out what I'm trying to say </connor>
<connor> and you can be like are you trying to say this Connor but... </connor>
<joey> - But I can also just pretend to be like, </joey>
<connor> - I guess maybe. </connor>
<joey> (speaks in a foreign language) </joey>
<joey> The point is in general, </joey>
<joey> we don't really get to talk to as many </joey>
<joey> Japanese people as I think people expect us to. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Right, right, right. </joey>

<joey> It's a welsh town name. </joey>
<joey> Look at this on screen. </joey>
<joey> Okay, let's try to pronounce this. </joey>
<joey> Ichimangosenyonhyakukyuujuuhachi-kei </joey>

<garnt> It was perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause it's numbers, right? </garnt>
<connor> Ichimangosenyonhyakukyuujuuhachi-kei </connor>

<joey> - That's actually a very nice feeling, dude. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's like the pillow you wish you had </connor>
<connor> like it was made of- </connor>
<joey> (laughter drowns out speaker) </joey>
<joey> - It's like a hotel pillow, Connor you're right. </joey>

<joey> - What is this? </joey>
<joey> The Tommy galaxy. </joey>
<garnt> - Back to the video. </garnt>
<joey> - That was, you could understand everything, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Did you think you were going to talk more Japanese, </joey>
<garnt> like be forced to when you moved here? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - You said that with such remorse, like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because, it's so, it's weird, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I think everyone in my life expected me to </joey>
<joey> as did I, but what ends up happening is that </joey>
<joey> I realized, okay, I work from home, </joey>
<joey> I go to a language school where all the staff speak English </joey>
<joey> all my friends speak English. </joey>
<joey> Oh no, I stream, I speak in English. </joey>
<joey> I go to the gym, I don't talk </joey>
<joey> because who the fuck am I going to talk to? </joey>
<joey> Unless that whole guy talks to me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> The fucking massive challenge. </joey>
<joey> - Have I told that story? </joey>
<joey> I think I have, right? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So yeah, there's actually like </connor>
<connor> pretty much no time where I- </connor>
<joey> - Although to be fair I'm kind of the same as well like- </joey>
<connor> - Right, well, how often do you speak Japanese </connor>
<connor> people outside of business? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, </joey>
<joey> because of COVID I haven't been able to see my family, </joey>
<connor> like at all. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, yeah that as well as maybe even worse </connor>
<connor> because strangers don't want to talk to foreigners. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> I mean like our neighbor, next to us, </joey>
<joey> is like really fucking cool old couple </joey>
<joey> and like every time I see them like, </joey>
<joey> I'll talk to them in Japanese, but </joey>
<joey> I always get so nervous because </joey>
<joey> the moment I start talking to them, </joey>
<joey> I can hear it in my inflection that like, </joey>
<garnt> Oh no, I'm fucking like losing touch on this shit like. </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't been speaking it enough. </garnt>
<joey> Because I haven't been speaking enough. </joey>
<joey> Cause all, 'cause the only time I'll ever speak is like, </joey>
<joey> with my mom, like an occasional Skype call or fucking. </joey>
<connor> - It's weirder you live in Japan and you're like, </connor>
<joey> you're losing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm losing it. </joey>
<connor> So I have to, you know </connor>
<joey> I have to like consciously fucking keep </joey>
<joey> figuring out ways of like, okay, </joey>
<joey> how can I use this language? </joey>
<joey> Because if there's one thing I don't want to lose </joey>
<garnt> it's my Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Of course. - Yeah, of course, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing about languages is that </garnt>
<joey> if you don't use it, it'll get rusty. </joey>
<joey> And that's true with like my Thai as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Now that I'm living out of Thailand, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> there's sometimes I'm trying to remember a Thai word </joey>
<connor> when I'm speaking to my mom </connor>
<joey> and sometimes I get like the Japanese word instead </joey>
<joey> because that's something I've been studying more recently. </joey>
<garnt> It's really... </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah and it's weird to think how little I can have, </garnt>
<garnt> how little I can use Japanese and also live here. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you kind of subconsciously find a way </garnt>
<garnt> to make it easy for yourself. </garnt>
<joey> - Not going to lie the one, </joey>
<joey> actually like one thing I have been starting to do recently </joey>
<garnt> is like every time I read Mongo or a novel, </garnt>
<garnt> a Japanese novel or something I read it out loud. </garnt>
<garnt> Just because if I read in my head, </garnt>
<joey> like of course I'm going to understand it. </joey>
<joey> But it's completely different </joey>
<garnt> like reading and speaking skills it's completely different. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So I've liked just kind of very quietly read it to myself. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just to remember like, </joey>
<joey> okay, that's how you pronounce that word. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like that for me, like reading Welsh </connor>
<joey> it's like getting confusing now </joey>
<joey> because I haven't done it in a long time. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you've seen the Welsh language, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's fucking jumble of sounds. </joey>
<connor> It's like, all right fucker- </connor>
<connor> - That's why I don't understand </connor>
<connor> people who know like fucking eight languages. </connor>
<connor> - Some people just have it, man. </connor>
<joey> It's just a capacity, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't think inherently </joey>
<garnt> I would ever learn more than one language </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm lazy as fuck I'll be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I mean the thing is- </garnt>
<garnt> - But the fact I'm try to pick up a third it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> fuck, my brain is like Connor, we're really, </garnt>
<connor> we're really going on limit here, man. </connor>
<connor> We're really pushing it. </connor>
<garnt> - But I don't think learning languages is hard per se. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's just like, okay, if we just all quit </garnt>
<connor> YouTube tomorrow for like a year </connor>
<connor> and just focused all our time </connor>
<connor> on actually learning this language. </connor>
<connor> I feel like we'd made like so much progress, </connor>
<connor> but what's hard about it is trying to learn a language </connor>
<joey> and fit it within our already current lifestyle </joey>
<joey> where we already busy as fuck. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> I feel like that's the real problem </joey>
<joey> because it's like, I'm trying to find time where </joey>
<garnt> time doesn't fucking exist nowadays, </garnt>
<garnt> where like it takes a lot of fucking time and dedication </garnt>
<garnt> to learn a language. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's a long line between </joey>
<garnt> being able to speak a language conversationally </garnt>
<joey> and being fluent in the language. </joey>
<garnt> - The only time I've actually gotten like able to being </garnt>
<garnt> get proper Japanese practice </garnt>
<joey> is when we're fucking out on the lash or something. </joey>
<joey> We're at a random bond with like </joey>
<joey> where we were fucking pissed out of our heads </joey>
<joey> and there was just a random Japanese bloke </joey>
<joey> who's as pissed as us. </joey>
<garnt> That's pretty much been like the best language </garnt>
<garnt> practice I've gotten since I've moved here. </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> That probably is the best way to do it </garnt>
<garnt> because if you're like a little intoxicated </garnt>
<joey> then you're going to be less nervous about trying out. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude, I swear to God, I speak any languages </garnt>
<joey> like 10% better when I'm drunk, except for English. </joey>
<joey> - Except English, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Except English. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> Fuck man. </connor>
<connor> - But I mean like languages from what I've learned is like </connor>
<garnt> learning a language and learning music or like an instrument </garnt>
<garnt> is the exact same part of the brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Fuck. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they say like, it's exact same with any instrument </garnt>
<garnt> or language, but the second one is always going to </garnt>
<garnt> be the most difficult. </garnt>
<connor> And then from the third onwards, </connor>
<connor> it just gets easier and easier and easier. </connor>
<connor> And I guess for all, for all three of us, </connor>
<connor> the advantage is that, </connor>
<garnt> we already know two languages quite fluently. </garnt>
<garnt> So that's why, and you guys are learning a third, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So it just puts pressure on me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like maybe I should learn a third language as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's weird because I don't feel like </joey>
<joey> I ever learned two languages. </joey>
<joey> This is the first time I've felt like I've learned </joey>
<joey> trying to learn actively learn something where, </joey>
<joey> rather than just like, </joey>
<joey> Hey, this is I just knew this as a kid. </joey>
<joey> I didn't really have to think about it. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you don't think about it </joey>
<joey> in your head when you speak Thai or Welsh. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause the thing is, it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> it is very much like learning an instrument, </garnt>
<connor> it's just a lot of it's like muscle memory. </connor>
<garnt> - It is pure muscle memory. </garnt>
<connor> I do not remember how I learned it, </connor>
<connor> I don't remember learning it. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I Just know that I've always been able to understand it </connor>
<connor> and speak it. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I hate it when people ask me like, </joey>
<connor> Japanese language questions. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I don't fucking know how I know this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's also like when I... </joey>
<connor> And also when you learn a language natively </connor>
<joey> I think you learn it wrong. </joey>
<joey> You learn it locally and in a native way- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - People will ask me, </joey>
<joey> some people would ask me questions about Welsh </joey>
<garnt> and I'd be like, I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> I just knew from speaking it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know any of the rules. </joey>
<connor> I couldn't do half of them correctly. </connor>
<joey> - Oh that's why they say like the best way to </joey>
<joey> learn any language is to live in the country that speaks it. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> It's, yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> And I think I get a lot of questions about like </connor>
<joey> Oh wait, wait, which languages do Connor speak. </joey>
<joey> Well, it's 'cause like I don't really get much </joey>
<joey> use out of Welsh. </joey>
<joey> I don't really show it off much unfortunately </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's only spoken in Wales </joey>
<joey> and one part of like South America. </joey>
<joey> - Is that really? - There's a really small </joey>
<joey> place in somewhere in South America </joey>
<joey> where they speak Welsh like a town. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Weird, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Bachelor of Welsh shirtless went there </joey>
<joey> and were like, fuck it let's just a make a town. </joey>
<joey> Let's just do it. </joey>
<joey> It's such a nice language, it's so beautiful. </joey>
<joey> - I fucking love the Welsh language, man. </joey>
<joey> It's so cool. </joey>
<joey> - It's always fun hearing people pronounce </joey>
<joey> the names of the towns. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Isn't that, that Buzzfeed video </connor>
<joey> with like all the Welsh names and it's fucking horrible. </joey>
<joey> - They sound as cool as they look as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because like my dad can't speak Welsh, </joey>
<joey> my mum can speak Welsh. </joey>
<joey> So my dad fucking butchers </joey>
<joey> the names and I always just correct him. </joey>
<joey> It's fine, I just want to be an ass and like... </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I do that to my dad with Japanese as well. </connor>
<joey> And I fucking love doing it. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, it's the same situation. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, he's like, shut up son. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Going back to the whole like trying to fit in </connor>
<connor> around your lifestyle. </connor>
<connor> There is such a big part of me that's like, fuck man. </connor>
<connor> I wish I could just take a year off YouTube and like do it. </connor>
<connor> - Like perfect a skill. </connor>
<connor> - Just do Japanese class five days a week. </connor>
<garnt> - I've like felt that definitely recently where </garnt>
<joey> like my entire life has just revolved around YouTube </joey>
<joey> for like the past four, five years. </joey>
<joey> And then I kind of realized this last year, especially, </joey>
<joey> it was just like, Hey, there are other things I can do </joey>
<joey> with my life other than YouTube </joey>
<joey> and learning Japanese is definitely one of them, </joey>
<joey> but I've really only have time to do one </joey>
<garnt> without making like substantial progress on the other </garnt>
<garnt> or just like making them almost zero progress. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean this COVID situation definitely </garnt>
<joey> hasn't helped considering that's really limiting </joey>
<joey> where we can go, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I feel travel as well, </joey>
<joey> even if you're traveling with like a bunch </joey>
<joey> of like English speaking people in Japan, </joey>
<garnt> you just get into, you can put yourself into situations </garnt>
<garnt> where you have to interact with the locals. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, just travel is such a nice way </garnt>
<garnt> of just meeting people </garnt>
<garnt> and like getting to use the language as much as possible. </garnt>
<connor> Because like, I feel there's less stress </connor>
<connor> using a language you're trying to learn </connor>
<connor> while you're traveling because at the end of the day, </connor>
<joey> you're never going to meet this person again. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I would have no qualms about </joey>
<connor> like butchering Japanese to an old lady who's selling- </connor>
<joey> - And you get fucking nervous as shit </joey>
<joey> trying to use Japanese at your local Konbini. </joey>
<joey> Because it's like, </joey>
<connor> I'm going to see you again probably tomorrow same time. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - And I don't want to be remembered </joey>
<joey> as like guys who can't speak Japanese, right. </joey>
<connor> - As much as there's a part of me that wants to do that, </connor>
<connor> I'm like at the same time </connor>
<garnt> I feel like I'm enjoying YouTube now more than ever. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm enjoying everything about it and it's going so well </garnt>
<joey> that it would make no sense to like stop doing, right. </joey>
<joey> Like, 'cause taking a year off YouTube, </joey>
<joey> although I could probably come back from it. </joey>
<joey> I probably could. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But is it worth the risk? </joey>
<connor> Like no, probably not. </connor>
<connor> I can always learn Japanese later on in life </connor>
<connor> which sucks that I wouldn't have it now </connor>
<joey> and I would rather have it now </joey>
<joey> but I can always- </joey>
<joey> - Why not mix the two worlds together? </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like- </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean by that? </connor>
<garnt> - Like make some kind of YouTube content </garnt>
<joey> about you learning Japanese. </joey>
<connor> - I considered that </connor>
<connor> but I thought that'd be such a big undertaking </connor>
<connor> and I've seen language channels and they had like drama </connor>
<connor> because they would like not end up learning the language. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) No joke. </connor>
<connor> Like there was this video where a guy made </connor>
<joey> like an apology video. </joey>
<joey> - But it sounds like technical drama. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you know when those videos went around </joey>
<garnt> where it was like, dude speaks 15 languages- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like, well that's just absurd. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> But then I, sort of watching a lot of those videos </garnt>
<joey> and I found like people who were like, </joey>
<joey> their whole channel was about them starting from zero </joey>
<joey> and then learning the language. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And there was like drama with this one guy </joey>
<joey> because he was learning two languages at once. </joey>
<joey> I think it was like, I can't remember it was like, </joey>
<joey> it was very different languages as well. </joey>
<joey> And about halfway through like a year in </joey>
<joey> and he's like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I'm quitting Swedish. </joey>
<joey> I realized that it's just hampering my progress </joey>
<joey> trying to learn two languages at once. </joey>
<joey> - Right. And although, it was like the, </joey>
<joey> all the comments were like, what the fuck man? </joey>
<joey> I can believe. </joey>
<joey> - I believed in you. </joey>
<joey> - Like your Swedish was so good, man. </joey>
<joey> Why are you... </joey>
<joey> - Like, and I was like, Whoa, whoa! </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, anything can be drama now. </joey>
<joey> - And I just thought like, </joey>
<joey> if anything, it would be a thing where, </joey>
<garnt> I would be like, okay, let's see how much I can learn </garnt>
<garnt> in three months doing X a week, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I would not announce it, </garnt>
<joey> not make it a prop, not make it a series just, here we go. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But at the same time, it also is a lot of pressure </joey>
<joey> that is like, okay, I've got to worry </joey>
<joey> about making other videos </joey>
<joey> and also actually learning Japanese. </joey>
<joey> Otherwise this video is going to be a little awkward </joey>
<connor> if it's like three months in I learn nothing. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) Fuck! </joey>
<joey> - But that would be funny, right? </joey>
<joey> Like it would be like a funny conclusion </joey>
<joey> to the video as well. - Wouldn't it though? </joey>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<garnt> - I just wasted three months of my life </garnt>
<joey> and I learnt nothing. </joey>
<garnt> - I did it for good content though. </garnt>
<connor> - Wasted 30 minutes of your life watching this video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, fuck dude. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I had this video idea where it's like, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I've always wanted to like </connor>
<joey> improve more on my Japanese as well. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, I can't just like commit </joey>
<joey> like outside of YouTube or like outside </joey>
<joey> of what I do on all these side projects I do </joey>
<joey> because I'm just way too busy now. </joey>
<joey> Which sucks because I really do want to like, </joey>
<joey> hone in on my Japanese a lot more. </joey>
<joey> So I thought about like, </joey>
<joey> there's like the Kanji proficiency test. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I've got like, </joey>
<joey> I got like the third highest on that. </joey>
<joey> But like that was back in like high school. </joey>
<connor> But I'm like, I wonder if I can like go for the highest one. </connor>
<connor> - How many counters do you go? </connor>
<connor> - For the highest one? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I believe it's 3000. </connor>
<joey> And I think only 0.4% of the population has it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's very like prestigious. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I thought like what if I did a video where I- </joey>
<garnt> - Is there a Kanji for cultural cons- </garnt>
<joey> - I guarantee there is, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> There's a Kanji for everything man, don't worry. </garnt>
<garnt> But I thought to myself, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder if I did a video where I just like </garnt>
<joey> dedicated like a year to just document myself </joey>
<joey> like learning that and trying to attempt for the test. </joey>
<connor> - But isn't that scary though, </connor>
<connor> because what if you don't make any progress </connor>
<joey> like six months in. </joey>
<joey> - That's the only thing that's stopping me. </joey>
<connor> - That is like fuck. </connor>
<connor> - And it's also like in order for me, </connor>
<joey> in order for this video to be successful </joey>
<joey> I've got to fucking grind this shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And if I do this and then the video flops, </joey>
<joey> then that's just like, </joey>
<joey> cool, I wasted a year of my life </joey>
<joey> for a flopped video and a test that I failed in. </joey>
<connor> - I think unlike the actual Japanese language, </connor>
<connor> I think you actually can like game-ify and speed run Kanji. </connor>
<garnt> Like I think Kanji is speed runnable. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know man. - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> Dude, totally. </garnt>
<garnt> - Explain, explain. - Explain. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you can, this there's like little apps </garnt>
<garnt> that will like fucking whip you if you get it wrong, right. </garnt>
<connor> So I I've speed learned </connor>
<connor> like 100 Kanji in like a day by doing that </connor>
<connor> and I know all of them now I can use them. </connor>
<joey> - But if I sat you down and told you to write it out, </joey>
<connor> could you? </connor>
<connor> - Write it out, some of them. </connor>
<joey> - Right, that's the thing. - Or read them. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, Japanese- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, and read them. </joey>
<joey> Would you be able to read a hundred Kanji if I showed you? </joey>
<garnt> - A hundred percent, </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - A hundred percent. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, now I'm tempted. </garnt>
<joey> Now I'm tempted. - Challenge, </joey>
<connor> challenge accepted. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm tempted to do it. </garnt>
<joey> - We do a live stream. </joey>
<joey> We'll both stream, you could fucking do- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, and I'll do a Kanji test on you. </joey>
<connor> - The basic Kanji? </connor>
<joey> - The hundred Kanji you know. </joey>
<connor> I'll do a test. </connor>
<connor> - A hundred percent we'll do it. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, okay. - Easy. </joey>
<connor> Because- - Sounds like a video already. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - Because right, you can gamify it like, </connor>
<connor> and then you can start picking up patterns. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like the way that you can, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> At least when I was, when I was learning Kanji, </connor>
<joey> I could easily pick up Kanji like I guess, </joey>
<joey> 'cause especially living in Japan, right? </joey>
<joey> Because it wasn't like, living in the UK, sorry. </joey>
<joey> Where will you learn this Kanji you would leave your house, </joey>
<joey> you wouldn't see it. </joey>
<joey> When you leave your house in Japan, </joey>
<joey> even if you didn't talk to anyone </joey>
<joey> you see the Kanjis everywhere. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So you could keep practicing </joey>
<joey> because you keep seeing them like, Oh, I know that. </joey>
<connor> Oh, I know that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you do do that after like every like </joey>
<connor> Trash Taste session we be catching the train, </connor>
<garnt> you'd be like, what's that sign say? </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen that one before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I feel like that's how though </garnt>
<joey> that's the way you got to do it, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that's how a kid learns </joey>
<garnt> just like through quizzes differently. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Problem is, is where it starts getting </garnt>
<joey> into like this four Kanji with four different </joey>
<joey> or the same Kanji with like 10 different pronunciations. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, oh, oh, this is- </joey>
<joey> - Which is like 30% of all Kanji. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I love the ones with like two I'm like nice. </joey>
<joey> Question for you boys, </joey>
<joey> 'cause we've been living here for a year now. </joey>
<joey> How long do you think you'll be staying here for? </joey>
<connor> - That's the question I want to ask you too. </connor>
<garnt> - What's my five-year plan? (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Chris Broads is a fucking liar. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Chris Broads said he wasn't going to live here </garnt>
<joey> for like five years and he's still here. </joey>
<connor> Motherfucking liar. </connor>
<connor> - He's been here for eight years I think. </connor>
<garnt> - What a fucking liar. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I'm approaching my fifth year. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, time just moves fucking fast, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't even feel like I've been here a year. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought, yeah, I'll live here for like two years max, </garnt>
<joey> I'm halfway through, I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> I've hardly even spent any time and I feel like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> And like I always thought to myself, I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> I thought about it I was like, </joey>
<joey> Oh my God, I've been here for almost five years. </joey>
<joey> - Five year old. </joey>
<joey> - Like, since I moved out and moved out </joey>
<joey> of my parents and like actually leaved in Japan on my own. </joey>
<joey> I was like, it does feel like five years </joey>
<joey> Which is why, like, the question of like, </joey>
<joey> what do you see yourself doing in five years? </joey>
<joey> It's starting to sound less and less absurd to me </joey>
<joey> because back, you know </joey>
<joey> when I was in my teenage years, the people were like, </joey>
<garnt> where do you see yourself in five years? </garnt>
<joey> Like five years is so far. </joey>
<joey> - You've be doing something fucking different every year. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Back at that age. </joey>
<joey> But now it just feels like it's you can have like a- </joey>
<joey> - Difference- - Routine and monotonous. </joey>
<joey> - Now we just sound old, man. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - We are, man, we are. </joey>
<joey> - Depending on how long </joey>
<joey> a big fucking question mark obviously is, </joey>
<joey> how long will Geex+ allow us to be here because we're- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Meilyne. - Yeah, Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> I'ma calling you out right now. </joey>
<joey> - How long? </joey>
<joey> - So I'm going to say, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to say this louder. </joey>
<garnt> So it all depends on how long Geex+ will be around </garnt>
<garnt> because our visa depends on Geex+. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] No, no, it depends on Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) - Wow. </garnt>
<joey> - This (indistinct) takes so many fucking sponsors </joey>
<joey> by the way, we can give Geex+ money. </joey>
<joey> - So that we can susciate how fucking like loads. </joey>
<connor> - Overloads. </connor>
<connor> How many sponsors can we fit? </connor>
<joey> 10 an episode. </joey>
<connor> Say no more. - Doable, doable. </connor>
<joey> - Man, I mean- </joey>
<joey> - But I mean, like the question though, </joey>
<joey> I think, and this is kind of goes back to the root of it all </joey>
<joey> having been here for a year, are you guys enjoying it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> There's been, I think I flip flop a lot </connor>
<connor> in the first six months. </connor>
<joey> The first six months I was like, </joey>
<joey> I would have one week where I'm like, I hate it, </joey>
<joey> I plan to go back in two months. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I obviously not. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like there's some weeks where I think especially where, </joey>
<joey> and I said this in my video about my... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I made a video about one year living in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think the big point I tried to mention was like </joey>
<joey> you have to make like, you have to force yourself </joey>
<joey> to like actively go out your way to make friends here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It is not a country where friends just come along. </joey>
<joey> You don't just bump into people and you're like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, let's hang out. </joey>
<joey> It's like, you act like you have to go out of your way </joey>
<joey> to do the whole, like, when are you free? </joey>
<garnt> What's your calendar like, </garnt>
<garnt> let's make the solid, not a bullshit thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's do it otherwise, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not going to see anyone for two weeks. </garnt>
<joey> Expect for you guys, right. </joey>
<garnt> And like having this podcast has really helped because </garnt>
<joey> before it was like, okay, we might hang out every day </joey>
<joey> but then we also might not see each other </joey>
<joey> for like a week and a half. </joey>
<joey> And then I realized I haven't left the house in four days, </joey>
<joey> fuck, I'm starting to feel lonely. </joey>
<garnt> And I live alone </garnt>
<garnt> and I've never lived like alone, alone. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've always had a roommate or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've always had a roommate or something. </garnt>
<joey> And I didn't realize like how much I like relied on that </joey>
<joey> to like kind of keep me a little bit sane. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because you know sometimes my fucking roommate </joey>
<garnt> Xina, I love you but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You fucking, you drive me up the wall, right. </garnt>
<joey> But that's not, that's also not like her fault, </joey>
<joey> it was like just a thing of life. </joey>
<joey> - That comes with just having a roommate. </joey>
<joey> - Eventually you just, you live with someone long enough </joey>
<joey> you're like, I fucking hate just a little thing that you do. </joey>
<joey> And I have no idea why and I thought I can live alone. </joey>
<connor> And then I like one week into living alone I'm like, </connor>
<joey> fuck, it's quiet in here, right. </joey>
<joey> Jesus! </joey>
<connor> - I was so fucking depressed </connor>
<joey> when I started living alone here. </joey>
<joey> Like before Archie moved in with me, I was like, fuck man. </joey>
<joey> I haven't been out of the house in two weeks, </joey>
<joey> I'm so fucking lonely right now. </joey>
<garnt> And like- - Oh my. </garnt>
<garnt> Am I the only true introvert here? </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - I like my time alone, don't get me wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> I like my time alone. </garnt>
<garnt> But there's only so much time I like alone. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Before I'm like, I require the touch of a human skin. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, no. </garnt>
<joey> I'm the same. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember before I moved to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> I basically lived alone for </garnt>
<garnt> like three four months. </garnt>
<garnt> Because Sydney was in America at the time </garnt>
<garnt> and we were sorting out our visa stuff with Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> So that was just like, like a fair few month period </garnt>
<joey> where my only social life would be </joey>
<joey> when we be able to like hang out in London. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know if it's just because </joey>
<joey> I've been in a relationship for like four years, </joey>
<joey> it was just like nice having, </joey>
<joey> like just living alone and just seeing friends </joey>
<joey> and seeing people when I wanted to, </joey>
<joey> because I guess the big difference between Japan </joey>
<connor> and when I was living in England is that </connor>
<connor> I could see someone whenever I wanted to in England </connor>
<connor> if I really wanted to, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you could just message me </connor>
<connor> and we could just hang out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> Exactly, I feel like </connor>
<connor> if it was the case of, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know when I'm going to see someone next </garnt>
<garnt> then I would be a way more lonely- </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I'm like constantly just like filling in plans </joey>
<garnt> like ahead of time just being like, yo, </garnt>
<garnt> you want to hang out? </garnt>
<garnt> You want to hang out? </garnt>
<garnt> You want to hang out? </garnt>
<joey> Otherwise you're going to find yourself in this kind of like </joey>
<joey> dead space of just no interaction whatsoever. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because like when I first moved here </connor>
<connor> and I didn't really have anything in my house </connor>
<joey> and yeah I was just going on Tinder dates, </joey>
<joey> just because I was lonely. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't, like, it sounds so sad but what I did- </joey>
<joey> - I didn't think people could do that man. </joey>
<joey> - And when I didn't have anything to do </joey>
<joey> I would just go to your house. </joey>
<joey> But then I felt bad, you know? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I didn't want to go to their house every day. </joey>
<joey> - No, that's fine. </joey>
<joey> - I know you didn't mind, but I also didn't, </joey>
<joey> like I felt like I was intruding. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - So, </joey>
<joey> and it was just sad, you know? </joey>
<joey> And it took me a while to get used to it </joey>
<joey> and getting used to being alone. </joey>
<joey> Fuck, that sounds so sad. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> No, I mean living alone, sorry. </connor>
<connor> Not being alone. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I just have to get used to just being in my soul- </joey>
<joey> - Just crying. - Just crying like it. </joey>
<joey> - No, I've I figured it out now. </joey>
<joey> I figured out how to have a healthy balance of everything. </joey>
<joey> But it took me a while because I wasn't used to it. </joey>
<joey> I always had someone in my house </joey>
<joey> that I could always be like, yo, you want to watch TV? </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - So is this your subtle way of asking us </joey>
<garnt> to come house more often? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no. - Please. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - So like, okay. </joey>
<joey> So we're going back to our original fucking topic </joey>
<joey> of this video of like online friends and everything. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - When did you guys realize that online friends </joey>
<joey> just wasn't enough? </joey>
<connor> They couldn't feel that whole, </connor>
<garnt> that having real physical friends that you can see, like... </garnt>
<joey> - After I had like a really healthy friend group I think. </joey>
<joey> - An IRL friend group? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah after you have like an actually good </joey>
<joey> IRL friend group that like, you just, </joey>
<joey> you would rather hang out with more than like anyone. </joey>
<garnt> I feel like there's no going back. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I feel that as well. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I found like my first proper true friend group, </garnt>
<garnt> like at the age of like 23, 24 </garnt>
<connor> that's when it kind of started. </connor>
<garnt> And I remember like my mom had like up my entire perception </garnt>
<garnt> because my mom had raised me for like 18 years </garnt>
<joey> to be like, don't give a shit about your high school friends </joey>
<joey> that your real friends for life, </joey>
<joey> your actual real friends will come in university. </joey>
<joey> So I go to (clears throat) </joey>
<joey> I go to university and I'm just there with like </joey>
<joey> my housemates, my course mates I'm just looking around </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like I hate everyone around me. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - You're like Michael Zlasky's just like, </joey>
<joey> where are the friends? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you're just like, </joey>
<joey> where are the friends? </joey>
<joey> Mom? </joey>
<joey> Why would you lie to me, mom? </joey>
<joey> Why would you lie to me? </joey>
<joey> So, yeah, I'm not in contact with like anyone </joey>
<joey> from like my university days. </joey>
<joey> Like some more so in my high school days </joey>
<garnt> where the university was just, university was just </garnt>
<garnt> like a fucking cesspool where I was. </garnt>
<joey> - I definitely have more in contact </joey>
<joey> with my high school friends than I do my uni friends. </joey>
<joey> Like not to say I don't have any uni friends, </joey>
<joey> like I've, you know, some of my uni friends are fucking </joey>
<joey> best friends forever, but- </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know like, </joey>
<joey> I think that whole thing of like, </joey>
<joey> Oh don't worry about high school </joey>
<joey> 'cause they won't be a friends for life. </joey>
<joey> I think that's kind of bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - I think you'll you'll know </connor>
<connor> if you've made a friend for life. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. - I think so. </garnt>
<joey> I think so. </joey>
<joey> - There is no designated time </joey>
<garnt> when you will make friends for life, </garnt>
<joey> it will happen along the way. </joey>
<joey> But I remember like finding my first friend group </joey>
<joey> and now I was just realizing, </joey>
<joey> Oh, so I don't have to pretend to be </joey>
<joey> someone likable to be around you guys </joey>
<joey> 'cause you guys just kind of liked me for the person I am. </joey>
<garnt> And that was just like, so mind blowing for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck is that all about? </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) - I know. </joey>
<joey> - It's like having friends that are like, just like, </joey>
<connor> even though there's like a lot of people it's just like, </connor>
<connor> everyone's there to help each other. </connor>
<connor> Like if you're having a low point. </connor>
<joey> - It's the whole philosophy of God, you're a con, </joey>
<connor> but I love you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, is that </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and just like mates that are just there for you. </joey>
<joey> Like, regardless of like, what's going on. </joey>
<joey> Like, and I really, really, really value that. </joey>
<joey> And it's a shame as well because </joey>
<garnt> I fucking hate texting so much. </garnt>
<garnt> I absolutely despise texting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I pretty much the only people I text, </garnt>
<garnt> are like people I know that I'm going to meet up with </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> When we meet out what's happening? </garnt>
<garnt> Like or it's like business or anything. </garnt>
<joey> But outside of that, </joey>
<joey> I avoid it like the plague because I just hate it. </joey>
<joey> - Why do you hate it? </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't feel genuine. </joey>
<joey> And it takes so long. </joey>
<connor> It's like, I'd rather have a 30 minute call </connor>
<connor> than text for like a whole day back and forth. </connor>
<connor> - All right, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Same here. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I mean, I'm sure you both know </garnt>
<connor> I'm fucking awful at replying- </connor>
<connor> - Oh Garnt is fucking worse bro. </connor>
<connor> - And that's because like, </connor>
<joey> for me it takes like so much mental energy to like be on it- </joey>
<joey> - I get it, I get it. - And look at notifications. </joey>
<joey> I just have to like have a dedicated time </joey>
<joey> when I check messages, otherwise one, </joey>
<joey> I just get distracted from whatever I'm doing. </joey>
<joey> And I much rather, I value so much having like a </joey>
<garnt> just an in-person or like an in voice </garnt>
<connor> like actual communication, because there's so much </connor>
<connor> that I can't communicate when it's just </connor>
<garnt> during texts that I just rather talk to people. </garnt>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<garnt> I feel that so much. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I get that, I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like </garnt>
<joey> a lot of context is almost lost as well when you're </joey>
<joey> just texting as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It can't be like all the emotions can't be like, </joey>
<joey> portrayed properly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I kind of realized as well </joey>
<joey> that the friends you'll have in life, </joey>
<joey> the ones that like, I might not text right now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like the real friends are the ones where </joey>
<joey> it doesn't matter. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking need to text them. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like even for a year or two. </garnt>
<garnt> But when I go back, I have nothing- </garnt>
<connor> - And it's exactly. </connor>
<connor> It's exactly the same. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's exactly the same. </joey>
<joey> The way I see it is like, </joey>
<joey> it's kind of like a family reunion. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And I didn't fully understand the term </joey>
<joey> where it was just like friends are the family you choose </joey>
<joey> until I had a proper friend group. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I was just like, I remember hearing that </joey>
<joey> for like my entire life and thinking that's such a bullshit. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> That's like this like cheesy Disney movie, </joey>
<connor> (indistinct) that isn't actually real. </connor>
<joey> It's a fucking urban myth. </joey>
<garnt> It's a fucking urban legend. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It wasn't the destination, </joey>
<garnt> it was the friends that I made along the way. </garnt>
<joey> (harmonizes) </joey>
<joey> - So, with that being said back to the question at hand </joey>
<joey> which was, how long are you gonna stay in Japan for? </joey>
<joey> What do you think? </joey>
<joey> What do you think boys? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I think right now my main thing is that like </joey>
<joey> at the end of the day, with all my gripes that I had </joey>
<connor> and I I've made them very known, </connor>
<connor> as the comments like to point out </connor>
<connor> that they think I despise Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm very critical to everything in life. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And at the end of the day, Japan, </connor>
<connor> the standard of living is just much higher at the moment. </connor>
<garnt> - Especially when you're British </garnt>
<garnt> you just learn to complain about all the little. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, a lot of people just think that </connor>
<connor> I really see a lot of comments like, </connor>
<connor> Connor's so fucking rude about Japan. </connor>
<joey> Like, no I'm just British. </joey>
<connor> - No, it's just being real, bro. </connor>
<garnt> It's just being real. - It's just being British. </garnt>
<joey> - There's no perfect country out there man. </joey>
<joey> - We complain about everything. </joey>
<joey> And, okay, here's the question to you guys. </joey>
<joey> So, we all are living in the place </joey>
<joey> that is not where we were born. </joey>
<joey> Did you always know that you would move </joey>
<joey> out of your home country and live somewhere else? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like, at least for me, </garnt>
<joey> I moved out of the house that I was born in. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I never moved until I moved out of my home. </joey>
<joey> So I've been living in that, </joey>
<connor> what, like my parents' house for late 21 years straight. </connor>
<garnt> And I was just like, yeah, it's home </garnt>
<garnt> but it's also like, you know, you go home </garnt>
<garnt> and you just see the same view </garnt>
<connor> out of the window every day, right. </connor>
<joey> I need something else. </joey>
<joey> - I love my home, don't get me wrong. </joey>
<garnt> But I think, especially because I was so active online </garnt>
<connor> from such a young age, I became so like globally. </connor>
<connor> - Of other different places. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. - Right. </connor>
<joey> - And then it just made me curious I guess. </joey>
<joey> I remember, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Going back to my fucking mom, it was just, </joey>
<joey> I remember like when I was a kid, I was just like, </joey>
<connor> mom, I'm telling you this now love England's </connor>
<connor> but I'm going to move out. </connor>
<connor> - Three-year-old Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - No, seriously. </joey>
<joey> I was like, you know </joey>
<joey> between like when I was like going </joey>
<joey> from a kid to a teenager, </joey>
<joey> I fucking knew that I would like </joey>
<joey> move out of England eventually. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, mom, don't take this personally. </joey>
<joey> I'm just going to move out. </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to be in the country </joey>
<joey> and mum was like, sure, sure bet, bet. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> Okay, son whatever you say. </joey>
<joey> And then I remember when I told her, </joey>
<joey> Hey mom, I'm just going to like fucking move </joey>
<joey> to Thailand for a few years. </joey>
<joey> She was like, surprised Pikachu face. </joey>
<joey> Like, (gasps) </joey>
<joey> Like, Oh, you, you were actually serious all of these years. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, because like, </joey>
<joey> not that I don't love England, but one, </joey>
<joey> I wanted to experience like different cultures </joey>
<joey> and everything since I was a fucking kid. </joey>
<joey> And two like, I don't know, I was always, </joey>
<joey> in my head I was always thinking that </joey>
<joey> there was this perfect place to live. </joey>
<joey> That wasn't the place that you were from </joey>
<joey> because everywhere else seems so exotic right </joey>
<joey> and everything. </joey>
<joey> And like the more I move around, the less idea </joey>
<joey> I have about where I truly want to fucking settle down. </joey>
<joey> It's really weird, right? </joey>
<garnt> Because especially if you live like </garnt>
<garnt> stay in a place for like any substantial amount of time </garnt>
<garnt> you see all the great things </garnt>
<garnt> that are there and you also see the bad things. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no fucking perfect place. </garnt>
<garnt> And the more you move around </garnt>
<garnt> the more you realize there is no perfect place. </garnt>
<garnt> So where you got to make that decision of, Hey, </garnt>
<garnt> what is actually best for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Legit one, between the ages of like 12 and 16 </connor>
<garnt> I thought America was the perfect place. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought America was. </garnt>
<garnt> - I really wanted to live in America </garnt>
<garnt> like all my life until like age, </garnt>
<garnt> probably actually until like I moved to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I still like, before that, I was like </garnt>
<garnt> I kinda just don't want him to go to America, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Always since a young age, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd always been exposed to American culture. </garnt>
<garnt> I always spoke with Americans online </garnt>
<garnt> and I just really loved their style of doing things. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<connor> - I loved how fucking crazy they are. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I think it's because for me </connor>
<joey> it's like, I didn't really like interact with any Americans. </joey>
<connor> - I think that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Because like, literally from age 12 </connor>
<garnt> I've been chatting to people online, </garnt>
<garnt> always voice chatting like, </garnt>
<garnt> my parents, for some reason didn't stop me. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - All you did was random Americans. </connor>
<connor> - And most of the online friends you got </connor>
<connor> were just from America, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah a lot of them were. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - A lot of the people you were friends with </garnt>
<garnt> were from America so- </garnt>
<connor> - And I was the token British friend, most of the time. </connor>
<connor> They were like, it's fucking Connor. </connor>
<garnt> (screams) (speaking simultaneously) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, we were cool back then. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we were. </garnt>
<garnt> That was when we were respected online. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - God, I miss those days. </garnt>

<connor> back to the video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the more I think about it </connor>
<connor> the more is kind of fucking weird </connor>
<connor> that I did speak to like just anyone like online. </connor>
<joey> - I would never let my kid do that. </joey>
<connor> - I would never let my kid do that. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why I did it. </joey>
<joey> - Your parents were just cool with it. </joey>
<joey> Were your parents aware of it? </joey>
<connor> - No, I didn't tell them. </connor>
<connor> I would just tell my mother that I was talking to my friend. </connor>
<connor> They're like, who you who... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause okay. </connor>
<connor> So when I used to swear, right? </connor>
<connor> So I lived, I lived. </connor>
<joey> My room is upstairs, right. </joey>
<joey> So whenever I swore too loud and my parents heard it, </joey>
<joey> I would hear this at the stairs. </joey>
<joey> (taps desk) </joey>
<joey> And like, Connor! Stop swearing! </joey>
<joey> Because my dad swore a bunch, right. </joey>
<garnt> But he tried not to around me but I fucking I was, </garnt>
<connor> I could not stop swearing over an Xbox. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, cause you're that one angry kid on Xbox. </joey>
<connor> - Because right, if you wanted any credit </connor>
<connor> as a 13 year old, you had to curse, man. </connor>
<joey> Come on. </joey>
<joey> You gotta talk shit. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I can't relate. </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever given any 13 year old kid credit </joey>
<garnt> now that you're in the opposite end? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - If they shout. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Of course not. </joey>
<joey> But when you're that age, I hate to be a bit fat. </joey>
<joey> Okay, British Xbox is a different beast </joey>
<garnt> or whatever the you had, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> It was 'cause everyone in these lobbies was like 13, 14, 15. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now that sounds like these- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no that sounds like every Xbox lobbies. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so half the games, </garnt>
<garnt> I would enjoy the fucking game more </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was fucking screaming at someone. </garnt>
<garnt> Then for some reason I enjoyed- </garnt>
<garnt> - You were legit that one squeaker. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I wasn't... </garnt>
<connor> I mean, okay. </connor>
<connor> Was I squeaking then? </connor>
<connor> Maybe I was squeaking. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - Who knows? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<joey> - You were a cold squeaker. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, God! </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> My God! </connor>
<joey> - See, don't VA confirmed called squeaker. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, that was so funny. </joey>
<garnt> So many dumb, so much dumb shit I did on Xbox. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my gosh. </connor>
<garnt> - So here's the question now then, now that we've, </garnt>
<joey> now that you've like gone to Japan and gone to America </joey>
<joey> and these are like the two places </joey>
<joey> you really like, kind of like fantasize about </joey>
<garnt> when you were younger, </garnt>
<garnt> is there any place in the world that you still want to go to </garnt>
<garnt> or is it all just like- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, what's on everyone's like country bucket list? </joey>
<garnt> - Or is it all just downhill from here? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I've been everywhere I want to, </garnt>
<garnt> there's nowhere else I want to go. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, man. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> Not really. </garnt>
<joey> Here's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Because people like say, I want to go here, </joey>
<joey> I want to go here like, </joey>
<joey> there's some countries, people like, </joey>
<joey> I really want to go here. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, why? </joey>
<joey> Why the fuck would you want to go there? </joey>
<joey> They're like- </joey>
<joey> - Like where? (all laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not going to name any names. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just take a sample. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is going to sound fucking terrible, right. </garnt>
<garnt> There are some countries right, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like, not going to lie. </garnt>
<garnt> If I want to vacation somewhere, </garnt>
<garnt> I want to know that I can shit in a clean toilet. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I'm just going to say, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that a bad thing? </garnt>
<garnt> Am I allowed to say that? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a very privileged thing to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's hella privileged. </garnt>
<joey> I know it is. </joey>
<joey> But at the end of the day, I'm just going to be honest. </joey>
<connor> I don't want to fucking shit in the hole in the ground, man. </connor>
<garnt> It's too much. - Okay, no it's, </garnt>
<joey> you never get used to it. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> Have you ever had to use the hole in the ground toilet? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, in France I had to and </connor>
<garnt> I thought this was a fucking civilized country. </garnt>
<garnt> What is this? </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Okay, this is like- </connor>
<connor> - I used to go camping so much </connor>
<joey> so like shitting in a hole was just normal for me. </joey>
<connor> - Because, right, I spoke to Allen. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm sure when he comes on the podcast, </joey>
<joey> he can tell about it. </joey>
<joey> He can tell the stories about how his dad </joey>
<joey> forced him to go to Kenya on holiday. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And he made it sound like it was fucking hell. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, why the fuck would I want to go </garnt>
<garnt> on vacation there? </garnt>
<joey> When everything sounds horrible? </joey>
<joey> Like what? </joey>
<joey> Like, if I vacation, all I want to do is just relax </joey>
<joey> and just chill out. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to fucking do activities. </joey>
<garnt> I don't want to fucking ride camels. </garnt>
<connor> I don't want to fucking be uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone- </connor>
<joey> - You sound like my granddad. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, I'm already accepted that I am like </joey>
<joey> a 60 year old white dude when it comes to holidays. </joey>
<joey> - Like, you just don't want to like adventure- </joey>
<garnt> - I don't wanna. - In another country, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't either. </joey>
<garnt> I'm a hundred percent with Connor on this. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm fine with doing an activity on a day or two, </connor>
<garnt> maybe we can hike but </garnt>
<connor> I do not want to fucking do shit every day. </connor>
<connor> I also don't want to have to like just- </connor>
<garnt> - I don't want to have pressure </garnt>
<garnt> that I need to go see something. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I'm in a place and I'm just like you need to go here, </garnt>
<joey> you need to go there, you need to see this, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I hate it already. </joey>
<joey> Like, I will go to one cool place </joey>
<joey> and it's just like, I've seen enough, I'm satisfied. </joey>
<joey> Can I just go home </joey>
<joey> and just like fucking enjoy a pint or something. </joey>
<joey> But that's my perfect holiday. </joey>
<connor> - And it doesn't come from a place of, </connor>
<connor> maybe it does come from a place of privilege. </connor>
<garnt> I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> Probably it does. </garnt>
<garnt> But I honestly don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to chill on my holidays. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was just 'cause of like </garnt>
<garnt> what I went through as a kid. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause when you go on holiday as a kid, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You got to follow what everyone else says. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - I always like had this fucking </garnt>
<connor> especially if I go into like a big group, </connor>
<connor> like this start fucking itinerary. </connor>
<connor> Where all I wanted to do was just stay in my fucking hotel </connor>
<connor> room and play my Nintendo DS. </connor>
<connor> That's all I wanted to fucking do on holidays. </connor>
<joey> - Because we used to, I used to go camping in France </joey>
<joey> like I said, every year for three weeks, </joey>
<joey> right? - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And most years I fucking hated it. </joey>
<joey> And my parents thought that I was just like, they thought... </joey>
<joey> Okay, I get it now what they think, they're like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, he's just saying he hates it. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like that's what parents think. </joey>
<connor> No, I actually- </connor>
<connor> - He's just a (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - No, I actually hated it. </connor>
<connor> It was like, you were in a tent, </connor>
<connor> you were sleeping on the floor. </connor>
<joey> It was uncomfortable. </joey>
<joey> So it's like three weeks, you're eating the same shit. </joey>
<joey> Like everything is- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, to be fair- </joey>
<connor> - Everything is grilled on a barbecue. </connor>
<connor> - I love camping don't get me wrong. </connor>
<joey> I used to like, my dad used to take me camping </joey>
<garnt> like in the fucking Australian Outback all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> But it wasn't for three weeks, </garnt>
<joey> it was like tops, like five days. </joey>
<joey> - That's the thing, right, I think those- </joey>
<joey> - Three weeks is way too long. </joey>
<joey> - I think that was like has completely put me off </joey>
<joey> vacationing in any places that aren't just like, </joey>
<joey> honestly, just like relaxing in a nice bed </joey>
<joey> and just eating nice food. </joey>
<joey> Like that kind of like put me off for life </joey>
<joey> because I spent most of my childhood summers </joey>
<joey> just sleeping on the floor, </joey>
<joey> eating everything that had to be grilled </joey>
<joey> because that's all you had to cook, right. </joey>
<garnt> It was a grill, eating baguettes nonstop. </garnt>
<garnt> And then always there's horrible public showers </garnt>
<garnt> that are never clean. </garnt>
<garnt> And then sometimes you would see like </garnt>
<joey> piss in the corner and it would always smell </joey>
<joey> and it was just awful. </joey>
<joey> Like everything was awful. </joey>
<joey> And even as a 12 year old, I could be like, </joey>
<joey> is this some peasant joke? </joey>
<joey> I'm too rigid to understand. </joey>
<joey> I just, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Like, I would just be like- </joey>
<joey> - That would turn me off as well. </joey>
<joey> - I would always be like, at home we had a toilet </joey>
<joey> that was nice and it didn't stink of just everything. </joey>
<garnt> Why does it here? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I also wonder how different my perceptions </garnt>
<connor> of a lot of these activities would be </connor>
<connor> if I actually went nowadays. </connor>
<connor> - Now I would love with my mates. </connor>
<connor> - With my mates because- </connor>
<connor> - But not for three weeks. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Part of the reason I like looked back and dread about it </joey>
<connor> is because you spent it with, you were forced to be there </connor>
<connor> with like your family and something </connor>
<connor> and you wanted to do something else </connor>
<connor> that your family didn't want to do. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like that's just like </connor>
<garnt> that kind of memory has been ingrained into me </garnt>
<garnt> that I just like, I hate this activity </garnt>
<garnt> because I did that shit as a kid and I hated it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because my parents were obsessed with like </connor>
<garnt> maximizing the fuck out of the day. </garnt>
<joey> Like it was like, let's go... </joey>
<joey> If we got in France, it's like, </joey>
<garnt> yeah, let's just walk around this town all day. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, fuck no. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to go to the arcade all day. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> I don't want to walk all day. </garnt>
<connor> Like I'm still at the age where walking just hurts. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right, right. (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - All day, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like for some reason when you're a kid like </connor>
<connor> walking long distances, just doesn't work. </connor>
<joey> - Or like, were you an active kid? </joey>
<joey> - A hundred percent. </joey>
<joey> Like I was doing sports two, three times a week. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - But for some reason- </joey>
<joey> - Just walking is yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When I had to walk all day, </joey>
<joey> it was just pain. - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - It was just pain, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Pain. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] And then like- - Pain pickle. </joey>
<joey> - And then when you're a kid, right. </joey>
<connor> There's nothing more boring than fishing. </connor>
<connor> I would have to do it. </connor>
<connor> - That's true. - And I thought- </connor>
<joey> - I'm glad my dad never got me into fishing. </joey>
<connor> Like my dad fucking despised fishing. </connor>
<garnt> - It's something that I could see me enjoying now </garnt>
<garnt> with a mate and drinking a few pints. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I've actually been fishing for the first time recently </garnt>
<garnt> which was like two years ago with Sydney's dad </garnt>
<garnt> and Sydney's a brother took me fishing for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> I actually really fucking enjoyed it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, as an adult. </garnt>
<connor> - It's one of those things that like as a kid </connor>
<garnt> you're just not wired to do it. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> There... (laughs) </connor>
<connor> This is going to make me sound so bad. </connor>
<garnt> But there is one big difference </garnt>
<garnt> about why I can enjoy it now </garnt>
<garnt> versus why I couldn't enjoy as a kid. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's because alcohol is now involved. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I have never seen a man fish </connor>
<joey> with not a beer in that little pocket. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't happen. </joey>
<joey> - Because I mean, you had, it's not part of the charm. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like going in as a kid </joey>
<joey> it is just like, it's the ADHD simulator. </joey>
<joey> Because all you want to do is like </joey>
<joey> why is there not fish catching on this immediately? </joey>
<joey> Oh, I'm trying to get this fucking thing on the thing </joey>
<joey> and my, fucking. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - Where's my Nintendo DS, </joey>
<joey> I need to fucking play cooking mama for 20 minutes to relax. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You trying to do it and nothing happens, </garnt>
<garnt> you get shit fish. </garnt>
<joey> And as a kid, you're like, let's kill it and eat it. </joey>
<joey> - Let's just do something. </joey>
<joey> - Let's fucking decapitate this fish. </joey>
<garnt> And then is that your dad's like, we threw back in. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, what's the point? </garnt>
<garnt> I want to eat it. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> Because you're a kid and you think in every video game. </joey>
<joey> I've caught it and I've eat it. </joey>
<joey> Why are you stopping me dad? </joey>
<joey> - It's the worst activity for a kid. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't make sense and just the whole thing </joey>
<connor> just completely ruined, like </connor>
<connor> doing that kind of stuff for me as an adult now </connor>
<garnt> because I have just no interest. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I would actually go back fishing with my mates </connor>
<joey> because it was just like a nice male bonding sesh. </joey>
<joey> - We should go fishing. </joey>
<garnt> - I would be happy to go fishing with you boys. </garnt>
<joey> - I haven't been fishing in for like five years. </joey>
<garnt> - I will tell you what, because I've had this image </garnt>
<garnt> of what fishing would be like my entire life. </garnt>
<connor> And because like my only experience with fishing </connor>
<connor> my entire life has been through </connor>
<connor> the fucking fish and mini games you get in </connor>
<connor> every fucking Zelda game or every </connor>
<garnt> like it's in animal crossing, whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - You can play for the free controller. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought to myself </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way it's going to be like this. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was fucking surprised </garnt>
<garnt> at how accurate that simulation is. </garnt>
<joey> Like, it literally felt like a controller rumble </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, Oh, </joey>
<joey> like, this is just like the fucking video games. </joey>
<joey> - And you're just like, where's the a bus? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's literally just instead of tapping the a bus </joey>
<joey> and you just go (hisses) </joey>
<joey> And yeah. </joey>
<joey> But for some reason it was just like, </joey>
<joey> it was very therapeutic </joey>
<garnt> and if you like fishing mini games, </garnt>
<garnt> it's exactly like that </garnt>
<garnt> and I was surprised, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Every like fishing enthusiast </joey>
<connor> is just like frothing at the mapping </connor>
<joey> like how fucking dare he say that? </joey>
<joey> - Man, yeah, I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> I just it's completely like, </joey>
<joey> so to answer your question Joey, oh God, sorry. </joey>
<connor> No, I think there's not many any other countries </connor>
<connor> that I'm like desperate to go. </connor>
<connor> Obviously I've never been to any of Asia, </connor>
<connor> so I really want to explore a lot more. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Hmm. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Like there's so many activities that I like the idea of. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I like the idea of camping, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> The idea- </connor>
<connor> - Two days, two days, max. </connor>
<connor> - It's charming. </connor>
<connor> - The idea sounds cool </connor>
<connor> until you fucking wake up and it's like, </connor>
<connor> the fucking worst thing I hate is when you wake up </connor>
<connor> and everything it's just dump you feel things and it's dump </connor>
<garnt> and dump is like the worst fucking climate. </garnt>
<garnt> Everything's damp and moist and I'm depressed </garnt>
<garnt> and it's cloudy and I'm just like, why am I here? </garnt>
<garnt> I chose to be here, this is supposed to be relaxing. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh dude, then you should come camping in Australia, man. </joey>
<joey> It's like fucking dries in there all year. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but than everything wants to fucking kill you </garnt>
<garnt> and I have something else to worry about. </garnt>
<joey> - Only if you go out and fuck with the animals, </joey>
<connor> don't fuck with the animals and they'll leave you alone. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause camping in the UK is just </joey>
<joey> either fucking cold as shit or just damp as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, not gonna lie camping in the UK </joey>
<joey> sounds fucking horrible. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, because we have to do a thing </joey>
<joey> in the UK called like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, you don't have to do it, it's optional. </joey>
<joey> Duke of Edinburgh, did you do that? </joey>
<joey> - My sister did that. - No. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, where you basically like have to do a bunch </joey>
<joey> of things to get a fucking stupid award- </joey>
<joey> - Like go out camping and hiking and shit, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they always told you in school, </joey>
<joey> it's like, you should get it because </joey>
<joey> it's going to look amazing when you apply for jobs </joey>
<joey> and no one- - No one cares. </joey>
<garnt> - No one cares, no one cares. </garnt>
<garnt> And on it like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to do like a hiking slash camping thing where you </garnt>
<joey> do two days of like full hiking </joey>
<joey> with like the big bags and then camp. </joey>
<joey> This is going to sound like so fucking stupid </joey>
<joey> but I was the only one who was like, I'm bringing a pillow. </joey>
<joey> I want to be comfortable when I sleep. </joey>
<joey> - The privileged white boy. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> So I big brained it, right. </joey>
<joey> Because all these kids brought like dumb shit, right. </joey>
<joey> And we had to, we brought like a stove to cook on as well. </joey>
<joey> We were like 16 as well so, </joey>
<joey> I brought the pillow, right? </joey>
<joey> And as I was sleeping, </joey>
<joey> they'll start fucking trying to take it from me. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they were sleeping on the hard floor </joey>
<joey> with a t-shirt rolled up and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> I'm the one who was the stupid </joey>
<joey> dick who carried this pillow all the way </joey>
<joey> for like eight hours. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> This is my pillow. </joey>
<joey> - This is my reward. </joey>
<joey> - And I woke up and one of them had fucking took it. </joey>
<joey> And I woke up on the thing covered in fucking dampness. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, Oh my God did it rain bear in mind, </joey>
<joey> this is the three person tent, with four of us in it. </joey>
<joey> And I woke up, being like oh my God! </joey>
<joey> it must have rained so much. </joey>
<joey> I go outside, it's completely dry. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, Oh, it was sweat! </joey>
<joey> It was all sweat! </joey>
<joey> It was all condensation. </joey>
<joey> (screams) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause my sister did Duke of Edinburgh </joey>
<joey> but she did like the highest level. </joey>
<joey> So she like hiked- </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a week, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, she hiked across Vietnam twice. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I- </garnt>
<connor> - Why would you want to do that? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> She did it twice though. </joey>
<joey> - I did two days and I was like, </joey>
<joey> I think, no, this isn't for me. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to go back to sitting on the bed </joey>
<joey> and watching anime. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) I think that, I just.. </joey>
<joey> This isn't for me. </joey>
<joey> - Why did you even decide to do it? </joey>
<joey> - Well, because it's one of those things where it's like, </joey>
<joey> I can do it. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you ask me to go hiking for a week, I'll do it. </joey>
<joey> I'm very capable of doing it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<garnt> - I just hate every second of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, then why do you accept it? </garnt>
<joey> - All my parents were like, you should do it. </joey>
<joey> And I was like fine, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> And I was doing the other stuff anyway, because </joey>
<joey> I was teaching kids chess at my old school. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> I don't know man, like I knew from the get-go </joey>
<joey> when like the option was brought </joey>
<joey> up of dude, would you like to do Duke of Edinburgh? </joey>
<garnt> Would you like to go hiking </garnt>
<connor> and fucking experience dampness for a week straight? </connor>
<connor> I was like, no. - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - No, of course I don't. </joey>
<joey> - I think because it's wild, </joey>
<joey> they wanted like the kids who had </joey>
<joey> a lot of experience camping </joey>
<joey> to help the kids who hadn't done any. </joey>
<joey> And I was only like, there was only like three </joey>
<joey> or four boys and like the boy Scouts in like my year </joey>
<joey> and then there was like me who done a lot of camping. </joey>
<joey> So it was like, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - So you were the experience camper. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess, yeah to me it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Connor should help out and join. </garnt>
<joey> - You were the boy scout, right? </joey>
<joey> - I never did any like map direction or anything like that, </joey>
<joey> my parents fucking did all that. </joey>
<joey> And I barely helped with setting up the tents. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You just put the bag down. </joey>
<joey> - I used to be like, Oh, I'm gonna go play with the Frisbee. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> So when we did it, I do remember this as well. </joey>
<joey> Like when it came, I was like, I'll do the cooking, </joey>
<joey> you can set up the tent. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause setting up the tent is... </joey>
<joey> And it's 'cause it was one of the cheap ones as well. </joey>
<garnt> And the cheap ones are like, (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> connect the 576 poles together. </garnt>
<joey> And it's like, no, none of them can get it right </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, I'm going to cook the bacon that I brought. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That was yeah, I- </connor>
<connor> - I'd be down to go camping though in Japan. </connor>
<connor> I've never been camping in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Glamping, we should do glamping. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, glamping is cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never gone glamping. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like camping without all the frustration. </joey>
<joey> - It's like camping with privilege. </joey>
<joey> - It's like campling with civilization. </joey>
<connor> If we didn't want to like invent all this shit- </connor>
<connor> - It's camping with attitude. - We wouldn't have- </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Though I'ma be real, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to camp without 4G. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what's the point? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I'm just gonna say it, right. </garnt>
<joey> I know it's not the same, I don't give a fuck. </joey>
<garnt> I want 4G. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can camp without 4G. </garnt>
<connor> - I can camp without 4G. - That's your problem. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I need a toilet, you're right. </joey>
<joey> Toilets- - Yeah, toilets. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to shit in a fucking bag </joey>
<joey> or a hole in the ground. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] You haven't been- </joey>
<joey> - There's a reason fucking humans evolved </joey>
<garnt> and invented toilets and civilization. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you ever wiped your ass with a leaf? </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - It just doesn't work, but that's all you have. </connor>
<connor> What you gonna do? </connor>
<connor> Grab a handful of grass? </connor>
<connor> No you have to use leaves </connor>
<connor> and hope that you can just get most of it out. </connor>
<joey> It's awful. </joey>
<joey> - Well, that's why I like the one thing </joey>
<joey> we always took camping was like a bunch of toilet rolls. </joey>
<connor> - Damn dude, 2020 man, you fucking find some. </connor>
<joey> - Because yeah, you'd go out into the bush, </joey>
<connor> you'd wipe yourself, put it in a bag </connor>
<joey> and then you throw all that into a fire. </joey>
<connor> - I must've been as like 12 year old me, </connor>
<connor> it was like instant noodles or toilet roll? </connor>
<connor> Fuck dude, I mean. </connor>
<joey> - I can't eat the toilet roll. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - It's chicken flavor though, you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> Come on, man. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Chicken flavor or poopy butler. </joey>
<connor> - Oh God, it was, I do remember when we did it, </connor>
<joey> there was awful 'cause like it was a lot of kids that were </joey>
<joey> just not prepared at all </joey>
<joey> and had never even done any hiking at all. </joey>
<joey> And those things are heavy </joey>
<garnt> and a lot of them just couldn't do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And you had to stay as a team </garnt>
<garnt> so it was like every 15 minutes </garnt>
<joey> one kid would have a fucking mental breakdown </joey>
<joey> and it was like- - I can't do it. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't hold it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] And I think- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, go on go on, I have nothing to say. </connor>
<garnt> - So the only thing that like puts me off camping in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> from what I've seen, like, only like the pictures </garnt>
<garnt> and everything that I've seen is that it looks very, </garnt>
<connor> how can I say it's commercialized. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like you have this like camping spot </connor>
<connor> and like, I see a bunch of tents there. </connor>
<connor> - It's very privileged. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - And I'm just like- </garnt>
<connor> - You're put right next to someone. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's just, I remember the one thing, </garnt>
<joey> I remember about camping is just like </joey>
<joey> how little noise protection you have </joey>
<joey> from one tent to another, right? </joey>
<joey> You hear everything. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> And especially the, what I, </joey>
<joey> especially the camping experience I would like to have, </joey>
<joey> which is like a bonding mate sesh. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you have like a bunch of Japanese people </garnt>
<garnt> around you with tents and everyone values their privacy. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you imagine how quiet you'd have to be? </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or we could just be those like ignorant guys </joey>
<joey> and just be like, </joey>
<joey> no, one's making noise at this campsite </joey>
<connor> Well, I think we will like fuck it. </connor>
<connor> What are they going to say? </connor>
<connor> - You just hit like at 2:00 AM </connor>
<connor> just like aggressive Uno noises like from drunk people. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> I don't know, man. </connor>
<joey> - Fucking Jojo Uno's session </joey>
<joey> at two in the morning in a tent. </joey>
<connor> - We should do Trash Taste hiking special. </connor>
<joey> - Oh God! </joey>
<connor> - I'd be down, man. </connor>
<joey> I used to go hiking all the fucking time. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know what the worst part is, </connor>
<connor> it's actually not a bad idea. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'd be down dude, I'd be down. </joey>
<garnt> - It's all about, I'd be willing to do it now. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it for content? </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I'm willing to fucking suffer for content whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - I am, I am, I am. </joey>
<joey> - That's the tipping point, right? </joey>
<joey> It looks like I'll do it, but is it monetized? </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, all right, I'll do it. </garnt>
<connor> - How did we get on talking about camping? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> But like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> So yeah, what the fuck were we talking about? </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah, if you're going to stay in Japan or not? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, well, I mean- </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, no. </joey>
<garnt> It was that which country would you visit? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, is there a country that's </garnt>
<garnt> at the top of your bucket list right now for like visiting? </garnt>
<joey> - Korea. </joey>
<joey> Korea, Korea. - Korea? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I really want to go to South Korea. </joey>
<joey> - For me it's Iceland. </joey>
<joey> - Iceland? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I love everything about that country. </joey>
<joey> The language, just the culture around I'm like, </joey>
<joey> all the places I've seen </joey>
<joey> because it's such a tiny country, right? </joey>
<joey> So it's like, if you have a car you could fucking </joey>
<connor> and you have a week </connor>
<connor> you can probably visit most of that country </connor>
<connor> - I do wanna go Mexico. </connor>
<connor> But a lot of people I know who are Mexican, who are like, </connor>
<joey> yeah, its dangerous as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I've heard. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, Oh okay. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I really like how safe it is here. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, exactly. (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - But it's like, food's amazing. </joey>
<joey> Really good time. </joey>
<joey> Just really fucking dangerous. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> Is there one for you? </connor>
<joey> Do you have like a bucket list of like, </joey>
<joey> I wanna go to this country. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, probably Iceland is at the top. </garnt>
<joey> I do wanna really go back to Korea as well. </joey>
<joey> I've only been there for like a few days, </joey>
<garnt> but I feel like that just wasn't enough time for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'd love to go. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Thailand as well. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just throw away, right. </connor>
<connor> - I really wanna go to Thailand as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> - I definitely want to go to Southeast Asia more. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I want to go to Vietnam as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Have you ever been to Singapore either or Malaysia or any, </connor>
<connor> have you ever been anywhere in Asia except for Japan? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So I really want to be- </garnt>
<joey> - See like, I want to travel more around Asia. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like there's only a few </connor>
<joey> Asian countries that I haven't visited yet. </joey>
<joey> - 2020 psych. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Trash Taste, South Asian tour. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Like, I mean, I do want to visit just everywhere really </connor>
<joey> and just make my own... </joey>
<joey> I joke and say just that I don't want to go </joey>
<joey> to a lot of places but I wouldn't mind going </joey>
<joey> and passing through and checking it out. </joey>
<joey> Like Egypt, I really want to go to, </joey>
<garnt> Algeria I really wanna go to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Australia, I really want to go to Australia. </garnt>
<joey> - South Africa, I really wanna go to. </joey>
<joey> And I was joking about Kenya, but, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure I can have a nice time there </joey>
<joey> and I'm just being ignorant as fuck. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there's going to be comments saying that I am. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I've always thought like, </connor>
<joey> ah, I don't really want to like visit like this place, </joey>
<joey> like Africa, for instance. </joey>
<joey> Or like the middle East and stuff like that </joey>
<garnt> but like the more I kind of hear about those places </garnt>
<joey> from people who are either from there </joey>
<joey> or just from shit you see, it's just like, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - You know what? </joey>
<joey> That actually might be kind of dope. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> But it's just, it's such a toss up though, </joey>
<joey> because there's a lot of those countries </joey>
<joey> we just hear nothing about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you just like, </joey>
<joey> are we hearing nothing about it because it's bad </joey>
<joey> or because people just don't go. </joey>
<connor> - Austria is like a country you don't hear much about, </connor>
<garnt> but it's pretty nice. </garnt>
<garnt> I really like Austria. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Austria is super chill. </garnt>
<garnt> - You go skiing there, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've been skiing in Austria </garnt>
<joey> and snowboarding in Italy. </joey>
<joey> It's really nice. </joey>
<joey> Just skiing in Europe </joey>
<joey> or snowboarding in Europe in general it's like, </joey>
<joey> it's super expensive, but it's really nice. </joey>
<connor> - I really want to do it. - It's really nice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I just want to go to Europe more. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, everything's just super fucking expensive. </joey>
<joey> - This is just like a travel wishlist. </joey>
<connor> This is just us fantasizing in COVID times. </connor>
<connor> Remember before COVID existed and we could travel to places. </connor>
<joey> - Remember when I could see my family. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I do want to go back home and visit my family </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's weird. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause this will be like the second </joey>
<joey> Christmas in a row where I haven't seen them. </joey>
<joey> Which is normally would be the thing where it's like, </joey>
<joey> okay, I'll go back for Christmas. </joey>
<joey> All right, fuck it, you know? </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, that's one big thing, </garnt>
<garnt> but as far as living in Japan goes and I mentioned on </garnt>
<garnt> the quality of life being really good here. </garnt>
<garnt> I definitely feel like at least another two years </garnt>
<connor> I want to stay here. </connor>
<connor> And I think it'll be a case of in a year, </connor>
<connor> I'll know if it's gonna be another two years. </connor>
<connor> It's one of those things where I'll just, </connor>
<connor> as it goes, I'll keep changing that number. </connor>
<joey> - That's how it is. </joey>
<joey> Like from like with a lot of my friends </joey>
<joey> who are from overseas who live here or have been living here </joey>
<joey> it's always the case of, </joey>
<joey> all right, we'll give us one more year and see how it goes. </joey>
<joey> And then usually like 90% of the time </joey>
<joey> after that year ends up, it's like, </joey>
<joey> another year? </joey>
<joey> One more year? </joey>
<joey> And then it just keeps going, right. </joey>
<joey> - And it's such a pain to move shit back. </joey>
<joey> It's like, is it really worth the, like moving. </joey>
<connor> - I really can't be bothered with that again. </connor>
<connor> - But do you guys feel this as well? </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you guys feel the same, </connor>
<joey> but like for me this has been the first year where </joey>
<joey> what I do actually feels like a career </joey>
<joey> as opposed to just me just being self-employed </joey>
<garnt> doing my own fucking job that- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I've never been employed, up until this point so, </joey>
<joey> it just feels good. </joey>
<joey> - It just feels like </joey>
<joey> for the first time this isn't just a job, </joey>
<joey> it's like my career now. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know. </joey>
<joey> You don't think doing like doing like YouTube </joey>
<joey> in your job the environment really matters </joey>
<joey> because you can technically do it anywhere </joey>
<joey> but the more like I've done this </joey>
<joey> and the more of like growing up, the more I realized, </joey>
<joey> Hey, environment really fucking matters in your workspace. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I remember going, </joey>
<joey> like I remember in university where I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I can do YouTube wherever. </joey>
<joey> I can do it in my fucking room. </joey>
<joey> I can do it next to my bed. </joey>
<joey> And then I suddenly realized I need my own fucking office, </joey>
<joey> I need my own fucking space. </joey>
<joey> I need to separate, </joey>
<joey> work and my leisure time because </joey>
<joey> you can survive with it and you can do it, but </joey>
<joey> you're just, they'll end up be a point </joey>
<joey> where you get fucking depressed </joey>
<garnt> and you get tired and it's not healthy. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah and I mean, it definitely completely changed my </joey>
<joey> productivity but also just like my enthusiasm </joey>
<joey> towards my career and I guess like </joey>
<joey> it really cemented the severity of what I do. </joey>
<joey> Of like this isn't just like a little fun thing </joey>
<joey> that you get paid for. </joey>
<joey> This is your job. </joey>
<joey> Like this is your career like </joey>
<garnt> putting food on the table is this now </garnt>
<garnt> and everything you do revolves around this. </garnt>
<garnt> And definitely, like moving to a bigger place </garnt>
<garnt> and getting my own like actual work room </garnt>
<garnt> has like really cemented that like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> This is like, yeah, I can fuck around on camera </garnt>
<garnt> and be silly and goofy. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - But it's also my job. </joey>
<joey> Like I can't half-ass this shit, </joey>
<joey> like I need to be serious about it. </joey>
<joey> But like that's brought on an entirely different, </joey>
<joey> I guess, layer of enjoyment </joey>
<joey> that I otherwise would have never experienced. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know, like, I think it's because as well </joey>
<joey> like all of the topics that we cover of like, </joey>
<joey> the kind of otaku kind of stuff </joey>
<joey> and like anime kind of stuff where it's like, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Doing it here as opposed to anywhere else, </joey>
<joey> it's just, I think completely different. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it totally is. </garnt>
<garnt> And like one of the biggest things that I've like </garnt>
<garnt> realized this year is a lot of the mystery, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of like the mystery and the prestige, </garnt>
<garnt> not the prestige, like the mystery around </garnt>
<garnt> like the anime industry itself </garnt>
<joey> has kind of like, I see the anime industry totally different </joey>
<joey> because I remember before like I moved here </joey>
<joey> and you know, as a teenager, as a kid, you think, </joey>
<joey> maybe I could like, as a dream job, </joey>
<joey> I can work in anime one time. </joey>
<joey> But like you have no fucking clue </joey>
<joey> what steps you need to take. </joey>
<joey> Like I thought you had to be like incredibly fucking lucky </joey>
<joey> and like the more I meet people who work in this industry </joey>
<joey> the more realized, Oh, you just need to be here. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - You just need to be here </joey>
<joey> and know one person and that's enough. </joey>
<joey> - And sometimes you could fucking </joey>
<joey> look up a job on Craigslist. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you just you were like </joey>
<joey> teaching English or something </joey>
<joey> and you just happen to stumble- </joey>
<joey> - You just meet a person, right? </joey>
<joey> - You just happen to stumble </joey>
<garnt> upon someone who has an opportunity. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the biggest advice I can give now, </garnt>
<garnt> if you are interested in working </garnt>
<joey> in the Japanese anime industry, </joey>
<joey> it's just the fucking be here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's like, I've been surprised at how </joey>
<joey> like sometimes even how low the bar of entry is </joey>
<joey> because it's like the bar of entry seems to be, </joey>
<joey> okay, yeah university degree </joey>
<joey> but that's like the minimum you have to get a visa </joey>
<joey> but aside from that, it's just kind of being here </joey>
<joey> and just hanging around the right places. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Definitely noticed that. </joey>
<joey> - And I didn't think, </joey>
<joey> I just didn't think it worked that way. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was just like closed off </joey>
<garnt> to all kinds of foreigners and anyone else, like- </garnt>
<joey> - Or it took like years and years of building yourself. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And we would go to those anime studios </joey>
<connor> and you just meet a guy who's like, I'm American. </connor>
<garnt> - And then you ask, </garnt>
<garnt> how did you get this job? </garnt>
<garnt> Because it was like, you think they just had </garnt>
<garnt> like the craziest fucking journey to get here. </garnt>
<joey> - And then they're just like, Craigslist. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah then most of the time it's just, </garnt>
<joey> yeah, I was just teaching English </joey>
<garnt> and then I just saw a job posting for a random anime job </garnt>
<garnt> and I just went for the interview and I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> Oh wait, it was that easy this entire time. </garnt>
<joey> Did you even speak English- </joey>
<joey> - It's literally the McDonald's method. </joey>
<garnt> Of like, I see an ad, </garnt>
<joey> I'll apply for it, fucking why not. </joey>
<connor> - You get the job, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> Oh see, I got the job, cool. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I guess totally agree with that in terms of </connor>
<joey> all the mystique around it's kind of like </joey>
<joey> slowly peeling away, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> It's hard to summarize all my feelings </connor>
<joey> about living here and working here. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, definitely the structure has been added </joey>
<joey> and I don't know if that's because of Japan </joey>
<joey> or because of how </joey>
<joey> we've scheduled and built our work environment. </joey>
<joey> - Optimized. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, having an agency here that works with us </joey>
<joey> and works with anime has been super helpful </joey>
<joey> and has helped me feel like a lot more, </joey>
<joey> yeah, like you said structured. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause before this, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I was just kind of fucking around I think </joey>
<joey> and I was just hoping that the cheques kept coming in. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, I'll just keep making stuff </joey>
<connor> that I really enjoy- </connor>
<joey> - It didn't feel real, right? </joey>
<connor> - No and I assumed that every, </connor>
<connor> I assumed that every year it could be my last. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And now I'm starting to think, okay, well, </connor>
<connor> as long as I don't do fucking anything stupid </connor>
<garnt> - As long as none of us- </garnt>
<connor> - Making an apology- </connor>
<garnt> - As long as none of us get canceled. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're probably going to be around </connor>
<joey> for a little bit, right. </joey>
<joey> You can normally safely assume </joey>
<joey> I've got a year left in this industry, right. </joey>
<joey> Like you can probably know we plan a year or two. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<garnt> - And some people like, well, </garnt>
<garnt> like, damn, shouldn't you be working </garnt>
<garnt> in like getting a proper career and whatnot? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what is a proper career anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> Like people are still like 50 years old driving Uber's, </garnt>
<joey> is that a career? </joey>
<joey> Like why people gotta make everything about a career? </joey>
<joey> Who cares? </joey>
<connor> - It's just your prerogative, right of like- </connor>
<connor> - Whatever makes you happy, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> If you're getting the money </connor>
<joey> and it's making you happy, you're not hurting anybody, </joey>
<connor> I think that's a proper career. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah there's way I see it, as well as it, like, </connor>
<connor> if for some reason YouTube falls through, </connor>
<connor> in a year and I got nothing left, </connor>
<joey> like, Hey man, I've got experiences </joey>
<joey> people could like kill for. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> All three of us have been smart enough </connor>
<joey> to kind of establish ourselves in fields outside of YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> My plan B used to be go back to the BBC </garnt>
<joey> and go back into engineering lifestyle. </joey>
<joey> But now like if YouTube falls through, </joey>
<joey> like I have other plan Bs of like other businesses </joey>
<joey> I could possibly get involved in. </joey>
<joey> And that's like, it's gave me, it's given me like </joey>
<joey> in a career that really shouldn't have the feeling </joey>
<joey> of any kind of job security, </joey>
<joey> I do feel secure that yeah, </joey>
<joey> I do have a specific skill set that </joey>
<joey> working in doing this has given me </joey>
<joey> as opposed to five years ago when I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck can you learn doing YouTube? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, what the fuck can I actually learn doing YouTube? </joey>
<joey> - I know how to edit a video. </joey>
<joey> - Like you know, when you look back </joey>
<garnt> and you start doing YouTube and you just think, </garnt>
<connor> what can I possibly put on my CV? </connor>
<connor> - I'm getting the thing out of this. </connor>
<garnt> - What can I possibly put on my CV, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - And then now you're like, if in terms of social media </garnt>
<joey> and entertainment and marketing, it's like, </joey>
<joey> it's a big list. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - I think, you know, a lot of people think is, </joey>
<joey> of most YouTubers as </joey>
<joey> like they're fucking dumb people. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Some college dropouts. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you do you see a lot of them who are like, </joey>
<joey> fuck, I'm in the same category as him. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - But, I think what people don't understand is </joey>
<joey> that they're a lot of companies that wish </joey>
<joey> they had people who understood those kind of like, </joey>
<joey> because a lot of companies you'll see them </joey>
<joey> and they don't fucking understand social media at all. </joey>
<joey> If we did lose our job there was a good chance </joey>
<garnt> that we could probably work in a company </garnt>
<garnt> and be a head of that social media department </garnt>
<garnt> or help with strategizing like, consulting anything, right? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's like Dr. Disrespect, right. </joey>
<joey> He was an online creditor, </joey>
<joey> and then he went to work for, I think, Activision, right. </joey>
<joey> Or Infinti World </joey>
<joey> and he was the head of their community relations. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, for a while. </joey>
<joey> - Before coming back to streaming? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so before he came back, that's what he left. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause he was a big cold stream I believe. </garnt>
<joey> And then he left to go and be their </joey>
<joey> community management or something on- </joey>
<joey> - Social media management. </joey>
<garnt> - Right, something, </garnt>
<garnt> I believe it was something along those lines. </garnt>
<garnt> And then he came back, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And it speaks to even back then </garnt>
<joey> that someone who had just been doing videos online </joey>
<joey> who seems very amateurish, </joey>
<joey> that knowledge that you gain is so invaluable </joey>
<connor> and companies wish they understood that. </connor>
<connor> And they could hire as many teams as they want but- </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> Because it's so rare especially for someone like </joey>
<connor> Dr. Disrespect to like reach numbers like that. </connor>
<connor> It's not something that you can like, </connor>
<garnt> it's not something that it's like, </garnt>
<joey> well, I got a degree and then I studied it </joey>
<joey> therefore I'm going to get results like that. </joey>
<joey> It just doesn't happen, right? </joey>
<connor> - You learn a lot through YouTube. </connor>
<connor> And I think even if you are doing it as a hobby now </connor>
<connor> and you don't see any potential in it, </connor>
<connor> I think the skills that you're learning </connor>
<connor> are really, really useful skills, </connor>
<connor> I don't think you realize it useful. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, one thing, </garnt>
<garnt> one important skill that I had to learn how to do </garnt>
<garnt> is kind of realizing what skills I thought were useless </garnt>
<garnt> and were actually not useless </garnt>
<garnt> and it's actually thinking back to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh yeah, I do know how to do this thing, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe this is actually useful in some way. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's like, part of making yourself look sellable </garnt>
<joey> as a person, to any employees. </joey>
<joey> What skills have you gotten, </joey>
<joey> more like experience do you have, </joey>
<joey> and like we grew up in like a generation, </joey>
<joey> or at least like, especially with Asian parents </joey>
<joey> where we were taught, Hey, do well in task, </joey>
<joey> get like your degree, go to university </joey>
<joey> and if you don't go to university, you're a fucking dropout. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You're scam, you're not my child. </connor>
<connor> - And then like the older I grew up the more I realized, </connor>
<connor> yeah, if you have like certain career options </connor>
<connor> and certain like career paths that you want to go down, </connor>
<garnt> yes, a degree is definitely, you definitely need that. </garnt>
<garnt> But if you kind of don't know what you wanna do yet </garnt>
<garnt> that doesn't mean that every other skill set you gain </garnt>
<garnt> is invaluable. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Right, right. - You don't need a degree </joey>
<garnt> to make a plan B in your life, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, I never learned anything </garnt>
<garnt> about like business or marketing in school </garnt>
<joey> like, I didn't take any of those classes. </joey>
<joey> I never did any of that shit in uni. </joey>
<joey> And I learned so much about that kind of shit </joey>
<joey> just from doing YouTube. </joey>
<joey> And that's like a really valuable skill to have </joey>
<joey> but I didn't need to go to school for it. </joey>
<joey> I just had to fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Go through it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I just have to go through it and experience it. </joey>
<joey> - Because of the way I see it, right. </joey>
<joey> I have an engineering degree. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you put me in an engineering workplace, </joey>
<garnt> I wouldn't know fucking shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what's going on. </joey>
<joey> Maybe, I understand the rough concepts </joey>
<joey> that make up a lot of basic engineering </joey>
<joey> and you could probably teach me a lot easier </joey>
<joey> but you couldn't just plop me in an office </joey>
<joey> and be like, do it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - I would have no clue at all. </joey>
<joey> Because you have to learn how that company- </joey>
<joey> - You haven't utilized that skill. </joey>
<garnt> - Right, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And without using it practically, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, what am I doing? </garnt>
<joey> I've just got good at tests. </joey>
<joey> Like I was shit. </joey>
<joey> And I constantly got frustrated </joey>
<joey> because I never felt like I was learning engineering. </joey>
<connor> I was learning the concept, </connor>
<connor> I felt like a lot of it was so impractical, but I mean- </connor>
<joey> - You were learning it through your head, </joey>
<connor> but not through your body, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we weren't using it. </joey>
<connor> Like we learn, it's like, why this is important </connor>
<connor> they tell you, but it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't fucking like, (mumbles) </connor>
<garnt> - Have you guys ever had like a </garnt>
<garnt> proper real job interview or anything like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> And it was rough. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah, I've had that. </connor>
<garnt> - Was yours for like McDonald's? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no for like- </connor>
<joey> - Like a real job. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like, when I, before I decided to do YouTube full time </garnt>
<garnt> I was actually still applying for engineering jobs </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was going to do a year in placement. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. - Which is in, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if they do this in Australia. </joey>
<joey> You could basically, after your second year in the UK- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, you have an industry, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's an industry, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically working. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you get paid to work </garnt>
<garnt> and you normally, it's normally those kids </garnt>
<garnt> who do really well in third year as well, </garnt>
<garnt> because they come into it with a lot more like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like an internship. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like practical experience. </garnt>
<garnt> Kind of like an internship. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> An internship that actually pays well. </garnt>
<connor> And you normally get a job after it. </connor>
<garnt> Like they're normally- </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally they, you get the job offer </garnt>
<garnt> for that placement after your year ends. </garnt>
<garnt> - And some of them might even offer to pay for </garnt>
<connor> the third year and the masters. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like no downside of doing it, </connor>
<connor> especially in engineering. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right, right. - It's really good. </garnt>
<garnt> - The hardest part is getting an offer in the first place. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really hard to get a good place to take you. </garnt>
<joey> I remember I did tests for like rolls Royce and stuff, </joey>
<joey> and they were hard. </joey>
<joey> Like they would make every single one of them, </joey>
<joey> was so annoying. </joey>
<joey> You would apply for it </joey>
<joey> and they'd make you do this in an hour and a half long test. </joey>
<joey> That was hard as shit. </joey>
<joey> And eventually you just got to the point where you were like </joey>
<joey> I've done four of these in one day and it took all day </joey>
<joey> and I know I'm not going to get any of them. </joey>
<joey> Let's be honest, </joey>
<joey> I'm not smart enough to work in Rolls Royce's jet engine. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna be honest dude that aint me. </joey>
<joey> And I had an interview for one </joey>
<joey> and I just remembered them asking me questions </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, fuck, I can't even like stomach the lies. </joey>
<joey> I can't even, </joey>
<joey> I don't even have the- </joey>
<joey> - You get in the business now. </joey>
<garnt> - I care so little about actually getting this job </garnt>
<joey> that I couldn't even sit there and lie to the guy. </joey>
<joey> Like I would in a normal job interview. </joey>
<connor> I would be like, of course I know. </connor>
<connor> - I never really like worked any job </connor>
<garnt> like before YouTube became a job. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like I told the story </garnt>
<garnt> of how I tried for McDonald's and failed </garnt>
<garnt> and then, I did one internship, like during uni </garnt>
<garnt> but at that point, like YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> was kind of becoming more of a priority </garnt>
<joey> that I knew I probably wasn't going to go </joey>
<joey> into this field anyway. </joey>
<joey> But like I'm not gonna say the company name </joey>
<joey> but like last like two years or so </joey>
<joey> I've been approached by this like relatively big company </joey>
<joey> like international that like really wanted me. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that was the first time where I went </garnt>
<garnt> into like an actual, like proper job interview. </garnt>
<garnt> But I didn't do one interview, </garnt>
<garnt> I did 17 interviews. </garnt>
<garnt> - Holy shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Not to mention, </joey>
<joey> I did some here in Japan </joey>
<joey> and then I also did some in LA. </joey>
<joey> - 17? </joey>
<garnt> Fucking hell. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I did some in LA so like, when I was </garnt>
<garnt> like staying at Archie's place in Vegas, </garnt>
<garnt> they like flew me out to LA </garnt>
<garnt> just to do like six more interviews. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh my God! </garnt>
<garnt> - Then I had to fly back </garnt>
<joey> and at the end of the day, I didn't get the job. </joey>
<connor> - I'd like to think that after the 16th interview </connor>
<joey> they were like, I don't think so, but </joey>
<joey> let's try one more time. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - And it was like a different person every time as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like, but this is like a pretty big company. </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to say who, </joey>
<joey> but like it was a pretty big company. </joey>
<joey> And it was like, it was a company as well </joey>
<joey> because it's like, Oh, like if YouTube falls through </joey>
<joey> this is a perfect place to work. </joey>
<joey> Like, hell yeah! </joey>
<joey> Like this is my plan B. </joey>
<garnt> And so I was genuinely excited to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I might get this job. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think that just made it so much more stressful- </garnt>
<joey> - I remember, oh sorry go through. </joey>
<joey> - Because it was like, because I was genuinely interested </joey>
<garnt> but it's like, how do I like tell that to the person </garnt>
<garnt> without sounding like an absolute kiss ass. </garnt>
<connor> - You actually do want to work there. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, yes, I love everything you do, </connor>
<connor> of course I want to work for your company. </connor>
<connor> - So if you had got that would you have quit YouTube? </connor>
<joey> - Hard to say. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<garnt> - You can't say now that </garnt>
<garnt> with the place you're at in YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember every person in their YouTube careers thought </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I'll get a proper job because I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know when this will fall through. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> It was at that point where I was like, </joey>
<connor> I'll give myself maybe another year. </connor>
<connor> - There's a lot of anxiety and a lot of, </connor>
<joey> what's the word? </joey>
<garnt> Like you don't trust it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You think it's temporary. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though, you know, it's not </garnt>
<garnt> there's always that gut feeling. </garnt>
<joey> - And then I think I can understand sometimes why, </joey>
<joey> some people YouTubers want to move on </joey>
<joey> and wanna to do something else. </joey>
<joey> I understand that I don't have that interest right now </joey>
<joey> and I don't want to move on because I'm really enjoying it. </joey>
<joey> But, you know, I'm starting to understand </joey>
<joey> after doing this for like five years </joey>
<joey> I can understand the mindset of why someone wouldn't want to </joey>
<joey> be in that coin flip every day is like </joey>
<joey> well, let's see if I've got a job today. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - It is kinda like, it is really stressful </joey>
<joey> and I think that I've just become used to it. </joey>
<joey> But if you put someone in this situation overnight </joey>
<joey> I feel like it's one of those things where it's like- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, they wouldn't be able to handle it. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe not handle it, but it would definitely </joey>
<joey> it would definitely wear on you I think. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<garnt> - Going back to job interview so I do you have like a story </garnt>
<joey> of like my very first I'd say real job interview </joey>
<joey> 'cause you know, I've had job interviews </joey>
<joey> for like Co-op and like call centers. </joey>
<connor> - They don't count. - They don't really count. </connor>
<connor> We were talking like big- </connor>
<connor> - They just want to make sure you're not a fucking criminal. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> All you have to do is just be a competent person </connor>
<joey> and somehow Joey can be phrase of that </joey>
<joey> McDonald's interview, but that's a different story </joey>
<joey> but like we're talking actual like big boy companies. </joey>
<joey> Okay, you're here for a specific skill set. </joey>
<joey> So this is like before I got my job at the BBC </joey>
<joey> so as you do as a graduate </joey>
<joey> you apply to about 10 million different companies </joey>
<joey> and just hope one of them sticks. </joey>
<joey> So one, one company that actually call me back </joey>
<joey> for an interview was a missile company. </joey>
<joey> So I would basically be kind of like- </joey>
<joey> - Like, (imitating missiles) missiles? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, like (imitating missiles) </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - What other missiles are there Joey? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know it's just sounded really weird, </garnt>
<joey> it's like a company that makes missiles, like what? </joey>
<garnt> - Is that the sound missiles make? </garnt>
<garnt> (imitating missiles) </garnt>
<joey> So yeah, what would you do? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I design (imitating missiles). </joey>
<garnt> - Get down to the missiles are coming. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah it was a proper missile company </garnt>
<joey> and I was applying to be like a systems engineer </joey>
<joey> to like design and make missiles. </joey>
<joey> So like obviously, I go in the interview </joey>
<joey> and I'm fucking nailing this interview, okay. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember how it is, </joey>
<joey> like the interview was split up into </joey>
<joey> two different segments. </joey>
<joey> Like there was the one where like they interview </joey>
<joey> your like personality. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I can't remember what that's called </joey>
<joey> I know there's a technical term. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's one where there like </connor>
<connor> they grill you about </connor>
<joey> why do you think you'd be a fit in these company </joey>
<joey> and you say, you're a fucking team player, </joey>
<joey> you are a perfectionist. </joey>
<connor> - What do you want from me? </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna (speaking simultaneously) </connor>
<connor> - What are one of my weaknesses? </connor>
<joey> Oh, well, you know, I just I'm- </joey>
<joey> - I just love money. </joey>
<joey> - I am a perfectionist and you can't fucking say, </joey>
<joey> look, I just need money </joey>
<joey> and I need to pay off my fucking student loan. </joey>
<joey> Why are you asking me questions </joey>
<joey> that you know the fucking answer to, okay? </joey>
<joey> So well, like I, I breezed through that and </joey>
<joey> I know I'm doing a good fucking job. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And then I get to the technical interview, </joey>
<joey> and the technical interview, </joey>
<joey> I actually prepared for this, right? </joey>
<joey> Because you know, I'm working for a fucking, </joey>
<garnt> I'm applying to be a fucking missile designer </garnt>
<garnt> so I should probably know the basics </garnt>
<garnt> of how a missile works, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And sure enough, I get to the technical interview </garnt>
<garnt> and they ask me can you explain the broad basics </garnt>
<garnt> about how a missile works, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And so- </garnt>
<garnt> - Then you go (imitates missiles) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) - I go (imitates missiles) </garnt>
<garnt> No, so I'm sure I've mentioned this before </garnt>
<garnt> but my degree is in electronic and electrical engineering. </garnt>
<joey> So I was, so basically, </joey>
<joey> this was gonna be brief, I know how a missile works. </joey>
<joey> So, I've done my research- </joey>
<connor> - He's done the studying. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And so, I start, so there's two interviewers </connor>
<connor> there's one older, serious guy </connor>
<joey> and then there's one like younger, not exactly a graduate, </joey>
<joey> but he's been there for years, but </joey>
<joey> he's like at the time he was like </joey>
<joey> late twenties early thirties. </joey>
<joey> - The more understanding. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> So I start explaining how this missile works. </joey>
<joey> So there's like a whiteboard </joey>
<joey> and like, so I draw the missile, right. </joey>
<joey> And, I'm like explaining, explaining </joey>
<joey> explaining everything. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, yada yada, here, this system does this, </joey>
<joey> this system does this. </joey>
<joey> And so my final year degree project, my thesis, sorry. </joey>
<joey> Was on like object, real time, object tracking </joey>
<joey> and everything like that </joey>
<joey> So, perfect. </joey>
<joey> Perfect for what I need to explain here. </joey>
<joey> So I start explaining how this missile </joey>
<joey> like tracks different objects. </joey>
<joey> So I draw this rectangle and I label that target. </joey>
<joey> And then I draw a dotted line </joey>
<joey> from the target to like this missile that I've drawn, right. </joey>
<joey> And so I started explaining, okay, </joey>
<joey> this is how the tracking system works </joey>
<joey> and the tracking system is in the front of this missile. </joey>
<joey> And so I code an off the front of this missile, right. </joey>
<joey> And I'm fucking getting into this. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, okay, so this is, this is how, </joey>
<joey> this is how my experience of my tracking degree </joey>
<joey> can like help with how I can, like how a missile - </joey>
<joey> - Like your selling yourself, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm fucking selling myself. </joey>
<joey> I'm getting into it. </joey>
<joey> And then I look over </joey>
<joey> and then like the oldest serious guy was just like, </joey>
<garnt> Hmm, yeah, it's very in sweat. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the younger guy was like </garnt>
<garnt> trying to hold his laughter. </garnt>
<garnt> He was just like, </garnt>
<connor> - Oh no, what did you draw on the rocket gun? </connor>
<garnt> - And then I look over, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm thinking to myself, like, </garnt>
<garnt> why you laughing at what I'm doing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm killing this, why are you laughing? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm fucking killing this, </garnt>
<garnt> my career is on the line here, I just want to get a job. </garnt>
<garnt> What could you possibly be laughing at? </garnt>
<garnt> And then I look at what I drawn. </garnt>
<connor> I've drawn a penis. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - How? </connor>
<connor> How did you draw a penis? </connor>
<connor> - I've drawn a big girthy penis pissing on a rectangle. </connor>
<connor> (laughter continues) </connor>
<connor> - How did you do that? </connor>
<connor> - I've actually got a picture, right? </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> I've got to show you this picture. </joey>
<joey> - I was really hoping this story's climax </joey>
<joey> would be about a penis. </joey>
<connor> - I was figuring what he was saying </connor>
<joey> he was drawing on a board something else was coming. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God Garnt! </garnt>
<connor> Oh my God! (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But like, I didn't realize </connor>
<connor> how much it looked like a fucking penis until- </connor>
<connor> - That's a straight up Johnny scenes girth, bro. </connor>
<joey> - It is a fucking girthy penis. </joey>
<joey> - That's a veiny motherfucker. </joey>
<joey> - And then as soon as I saw that, </joey>
<joey> as soon as I saw that, right. </joey>
<joey> I knew I failed </joey>
<joey> not because I was doing a bad job, </joey>
<joey> but you know when you're in the zone </joey>
<joey> and like, there's nothing that could take me out of the zone </joey>
<joey> knowing that I've just drawn a fucking penis </joey>
<joey> in front of two examinees. </joey>
<joey> And then after that I just start stumbling </joey>
<joey> and I forget everything I prepared. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - You failed that test? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah I- </joey>
<joey> - So you didn't get it? </joey>
<joey> - I didn't get it. - Fuck dude. </joey>
<joey> - They specifically said, and that I did </joey>
<joey> super super well on my, like the personality side of things. </joey>
<joey> But the technical side was lacking. </joey>
<joey> - Until you draw a phallic object on the whiteboard. </joey>
<connor> - I had totally blocked out of my mind </connor>
<joey> that there was a, they ask you technical questions </joey>
<joey> because I think I was so fucking bad at it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. - [Garnt Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I remember I had a question and they were asking me </joey>
<joey> how turbines worked and I knew how they worked. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But you know, when you are in a room </joey>
<joey> with like two really old men </joey>
<connor> who've been doing this for years </connor>
<connor> and they ask it like, they're like, how do you shit? </connor>
<connor> Tell me how you shit. </connor>
<connor> Describe how you shit. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - It's like, I know how to shit, </connor>
<connor> but when they're looking at me like that </connor>
<connor> and they asking me that way, I'm like, ah, ah, ah, so </connor>
<garnt> yeah, the blades ah take the oxygen in </garnt>
<garnt> and they mix it with, am I right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is this is right? </garnt>
<garnt> This is right. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah fuck. </garnt>
<joey> I remember I just butchered it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But also did you video interviews, but you did, </garnt>
<garnt> but there was no one to talk to? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Video interviews. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or like on Skype and shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - So if you pass the test, right. </garnt>
<garnt> The math test and the personality, right? </garnt>
<connor> They would say that you wouldn't get an interview. </connor>
<connor> You got a video video interview where </connor>
<connor> all you could see is yourself </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, I never had that but that sounds horrible. </joey>
<joey> - I've never had that. </joey>
<garnt> - That must've have been as like three times, three times. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> so basically what it was is, there would be a... </garnt>
<garnt> It fucking felt like a Mario fucking party </garnt>
<garnt> quick type of thing. </garnt>
<joey> It would be, there would be a slide right? </joey>
<joey> Where you could see yourself </joey>
<joey> and it would cut to your question </joey>
<joey> and then it would be like five, four, </joey>
<garnt> and then you have to answer it and they were filming. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - I was terrifying. </joey>
<joey> Like one of them was like, so stupid. </joey>
<joey> It was like, you know, it's going </joey>
<joey> and it's like, you know, like, okay. </joey>
<joey> And then it's like, </joey>
<connor> who's your biggest engineering inspiration? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> but I don't fucking know. </connor>
<joey> - My engineering idol. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, I just did this for the degree. </joey>
<joey> I don't think about this shit. </joey>
<joey> I'm just trying to play code like what do you mean? </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, </joey>
<connor> fuck! Fuck! </connor>
<connor> I shout like Einstein or something. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<connor> (laughter continues) </connor>
<connor> And I'm not kidding, right? </connor>
<connor> I said Einstein, right. </connor>
<joey> I finished that question, </joey>
<joey> the next fucking thing is two of seven questions. </joey>
<joey> The next thing I just fucking all left four. </joey>
<joey> I'm like I haven't got this, I'm fucking all left four. </joey>
<connor> - Einstein. </connor>
<connor> The most famous engineer in the world. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - You might have heard of him. </joey>
<connor> - Because I was like, </connor>
<joey> there's no way I'm getting it with an answer like that. </joey>
<joey> That's like asking what your favorite meal? </joey>
<joey> White bread. </joey>
