<joey> to hold it </joey>
<joey> what's up guys welcome back to another </joey>
<joey> episode of the trash taste podcast i'm </joey>
<joey> joey and i'm with gun connor as always </joey>
<joey> and we haven't done an episode in a week </joey>
<joey> and i already forgot how to start one of </joey>
<garnt> these i don't know it feels like it </garnt>
<garnt> feels weird because even though well </garnt>
<garnt> you've done a lot this past week </garnt>
<garnt> but i took like a nice little like </garnt>
<garnt> three-day break yeah and then for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason like do you ever go </garnt>
<joey> do you ever do you guys ever feel like </joey>
<joey> if you get off the grind for just one or </joey>
<garnt> two days you just forget how to work </garnt>
<joey> yeah right </joey>
<joey> i come back home and i'm like all right </joey>
<connor> and then i just sit on my desk like oh i </connor>
<connor> i get more motivated to get back in the </connor>
<connor> grind i'm like i'm like doubly charged </connor>
<joey> oh no i get that sometimes as well but </joey>
<joey> like if it's especially after like a </joey>
<garnt> long because you know we've been on the </garnt>
<connor> grind for quite a while now because </connor>
<garnt> we're you know preparing for the tour </garnt>
<connor> yeah you know which i guess by the time </connor>
<garnt> this episode has gone up we should have </garnt>
<garnt> finished by now yeah i think but as of </garnt>
<garnt> us right now we're still preparing for </garnt>
<garnt> the tour so we have to make a crapload </garnt>
<garnt> of episodes for you guys um </garnt>
<garnt> and it's been you know really busy month </garnt>
<garnt> and then suddenly because of connor's </garnt>
<garnt> thing we're just like all right uh you </garnt>
<garnt> got a week off and i'm just i remember </garnt>
<garnt> like the first day i was like what do i </garnt>
<garnt> do </garnt>
<garnt> i i it's isn't it sad i've almost </garnt>
<garnt> forgotten </garnt>
<garnt> how to take a day off yeah because i i </garnt>
<joey> told myself okay i'm gonna take a day </joey>
<garnt> off yeah in reality i did not take a day </garnt>
<garnt> off yeah i just worked less because like </garnt>
<garnt> what happened is uh since since we've </garnt>
<garnt> been back from like you know just uh </garnt>
<connor> convention season and everything like </connor>
<connor> that we've had to like film basically </connor>
<connor> four episodes a week we get like one </connor>
<connor> episode one stream then another two </connor>
<connor> episodes another day um and then connor </connor>
<connor> connor yeah that's three i guess </connor>
<connor> basically </connor>
<connor> i think i </connor>
<connor> i mean technically technically a stream </connor>
<connor> is an episode because that goes into the </connor>
<connor> afternoon you know okay four episodes so </connor>
<connor> i counted those four episodes </connor>
<connor> but uh you know connor did something </connor>
<garnt> incredible you know congratulations to </garnt>
<connor> you gg's [ __ ] 300k gig a chatbot it's </connor>
<connor> gonna be out like ages from now yeah i </connor>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> just just to just to date this episode </garnt>
<connor> then i guess because they'll be like </connor>
<connor> when is going to talk about it i guess </connor>
<joey> seven episodes later it's like wow all </joey>
<connor> right connor's like not talking about </connor>
<connor> this this is weird like it's kind of </connor>
<connor> wrong </connor>
<garnt> yeah and then so we had like a week off </garnt>
<garnt> trash taste and as soon as as soon as as </garnt>
<connor> like that was like i guess announced </connor>
<connor> yeah sydney was like we're booking </connor>
<connor> something we're booking something now </connor>
<connor> fill up the schedule </connor>
<joey> this is this is our time now so uh fair </joey>
<connor> enough so yeah we went away your side </connor>
<joey> job kicked in </joey>
<garnt> my marriage kicked in </garnt>
<connor> my third my third time i have no excuse </connor>
<connor> now </connor>
<garnt> like what are you doing ah again [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> and uh so yeah we uh take a nice few </garnt>
<garnt> days off and then i don't know why </garnt>
<garnt> because i feel like with holidays </garnt>
<connor> there's like there's like a perfect time </connor>
<connor> where i'm able to like recharge reset </connor>
<connor> everything i feel like that's a week i </connor>
<connor> need to take like a week off yeah in </connor>
<connor> order to like get like the grind </connor>
<connor> back you know get like the motivation to </connor>
<connor> get to grinding again if it's like one </connor>
<connor> or two days i've noticed with like the </connor>
<connor> youtube grind it's just it </connor>
<connor> throws you off your </connor>
<connor> schedule or throws off like this </connor>
<connor> momentum that you have i don't know it's </connor>
<connor> really weird for me do you have like a </connor>
<connor> schedule every day </connor>
<connor> i um now that i have like a second </connor>
<connor> channel and streams and stuff i actually </connor>
<connor> do </connor>
<connor> first time </connor>
<joey> okay first time it's almost like it's a </joey>
<connor> real job </connor>
<garnt> it's weird having a schedule now just uh </garnt>
<garnt> just waking up and being like oh [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> i've got stuff i need to do and uh it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's weird this this has been a </garnt>
<garnt> very weird time for me guys and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> transitioning and i'm transitioning i </garnt>
<garnt> remember when i was just like one </garnt>
<garnt> channel is like more than too much one </garnt>
<connor> channel is too much and now it's just </connor>
<garnt> about placing your efforts in the right </garnt>
<connor> place you know you know make sure you're </connor>
<connor> working on the things that you need to </connor>
<garnt> be working on yeah yeah exactly yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know it's also just </garnt>
<joey> i i find it easier to work on things i'm </joey>
<connor> passionate on so </connor>
<joey> when i'm passionate when i'm passionate </joey>
<garnt> then i find it hard to concentrate on </garnt>
<connor> anything else so what happens your </connor>
<connor> second channel when you get like bored </connor>
<connor> of gentian you're just like did you </connor>
<joey> disappear all content vanishes all right </joey>
<connor> all right guys i just i just delete the </connor>
<connor> channel </connor>
<connor> taking a break i'll see you guys when </connor>
<connor> they update the game yeah </connor>
<garnt> you know i haven't thought that far </garnt>
<connor> ahead but maybe by the time this video </connor>
<connor> goes if i can't diversify it's it's it's </connor>
<garnt> weird because like i'm like in my in the </garnt>
<connor> back of my mind i'm like i know i need </connor>
<joey> to diversify i should make it here </joey>
<connor> but also i'm just addicted to playing </connor>
<garnt> gentian so i'm like either either i </garnt>
<garnt> don't play it uh either i don't stream </garnt>
<garnt> it i'm playing or i stream it and play </garnt>
<joey> it well you can't quit now because </joey>
<joey> you're literally the biggest gentian </joey>
<garnt> streamer on twitch </garnt>
<joey> who gets more views i don't know i mean </joey>
<joey> you're pulling some pretty crazy numbers </joey>
<garnt> he keeps growing right now the numbers </garnt>

<garnt> you're like congratulating me </garnt>
<garnt> congratulations </garnt>
<garnt> as selfless as it was selfish i didn't i </garnt>
<garnt> did a lot of the reason i did it because </garnt>
<connor> i wanted to do it yeah oh yeah </connor>
<connor> because i i'm not going to sit here and </connor>
<connor> be like dude i just wanted to do a </connor>
<joey> charity event this i just wanted to do </joey>
<joey> this and i was like oh wait this makes </joey>
<connor> perfect sense to be a champion </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean like i feel like </connor>
<connor> a lot of the times some events come </connor>
<connor> along you're like this just makes way </connor>
<connor> more sense it's gonna be more fun for </connor>
<connor> everyone it's gonna be way better if </connor>
<connor> it's not just for me yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because it's like all right you know i i </connor>
<connor> i thinking back i'm like how could it i </connor>
<connor> said i should probably explain what i </connor>
<joey> did yeah i was about to say it's </joey>
<connor> probably been a while i'm sure </connor>
<connor> i'm sure we should be watching this now </connor>
<connor> i cycled across hokkaido with chris </connor>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> seven hundred and fifty kilometers or </joey>
<joey> something whoa nice </joey>
<joey> over five hundred miles and how much uh </joey>
<joey> how much did you raise you raised over </joey>
<connor> three hundred and sixteen thousand </connor>
<connor> dollars nice </connor>
<garnt> and deficiency foundation oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] incredible i mean two things </garnt>
<connor> that shocked me when i saw that tweet </connor>
<garnt> about when you guys finished one was </garnt>
<connor> obviously the amount of money </connor>
<connor> which is crazy yeah two the fact that </connor>
<connor> chris survived yeah yeah yeah yeah well </connor>
<connor> so you know obviously spoiler alert </connor>
<joey> chris is going to come on the podcast </joey>
<connor> again so i'll i'll talk about it mainly </connor>
<joey> from like i suppose my perspective and </joey>
<joey> the stuff that i was dealing with </joey>
<garnt> because right i'll let chris talk about </garnt>
<garnt> the other stuff oh how he dealt with his </garnt>
<garnt> mother i mean you know chris's credit on </garnt>
<connor> the on </connor>
<garnt> later days chris is doing better than me </garnt>
<connor> i was really yeah i mean i was like </connor>
<connor> powering through the first few days i </connor>
<connor> was doing great chris was having a </connor>
<connor> miserable time yeah yeah and then you </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> a lot of the time with cycling and stuff </connor>
<connor> like you learned you learn a lot of </connor>
<connor> things when you do it days in a row like </connor>
<connor> i feel like the shin nami kaido we </connor>
<connor> didn't actually learn anything about </connor>
<connor> cycling no of course not because you </connor>
<connor> just do it and you're done and like you </connor>
<connor> could you can you could cycle for a day </connor>
<garnt> with a [ __ ] bike and not know like cause </garnt>
<garnt> all of our seats and everything was </garnt>
<garnt> completely well we learned how not to </garnt>
<garnt> cycle yeah </garnt>
<garnt> her number one comment on the on our </garnt>
<joey> cycling special was like you guys know </joey>
<joey> like your seat was too we didn't know no </joey>
<joey> we did we did we know nothing about </joey>
<joey> we're not cyclists yeah and you know </joey>
<connor> like so like to put it into perspective </connor>
<connor> like the shin nami kaido uh the thing </connor>
<connor> that we did was like 75k yeah but we </connor>
<joey> might as well have done it on a tricycle </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah it was literally a clown </connor>
<garnt> bike </garnt>
<connor> yeah and like </connor>
<connor> i think on average we were doing 100 </connor>
<connor> plus kilometer days </connor>
<connor> like every single day and there's like </connor>
<connor> one day we did like 65 but even then </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> the weather conditions changed the </connor>
<joey> cycling right right because you guys are </joey>
<joey> up in the mountains and you know i feel </joey>
<connor> oh yeah it changes all the time right </connor>
<connor> and then i got this [ __ ] backpack on </connor>
<connor> my back so i i i you know when i </connor>
<connor> quit because the reason why this </connor>
<connor> happened i'm sure we'll talk about this </connor>
<connor> even more again when chris comes on </connor>
<connor> chris was you know lamenting to me about </connor>
<connor> how he wants to get fit and stuff and i </connor>
<connor> was like bet let's actually do something </connor>
<connor> like let's let's do something like let's </connor>
<connor> do something crazy yeah uh and i was </connor>
<connor> like i really want to go to hokkaido </connor>
<garnt> again because why the [ __ ] that's </garnt>
<garnt> i just love hokkaido honestly i think </garnt>
<garnt> it's my favorite favorite yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's awesome </garnt>
<garnt> i i wanted to do something that would be </garnt>
<connor> pretty tough yeah so i thought that </connor>
<connor> cycle again like on a map i think about </connor>
<connor> this i'm like 500 miles like easy i can </connor>
<connor> do that because like </connor>
<connor> cycling is tough but ultimately </connor>
<connor> if you just wake up early it's not that </connor>
<connor> hard </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> wait wait wait wait wait wait no no i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know what i'm saying is </garnt>
<connor> if you want to do site like cycling </connor>
<connor> cycling like you want to get places and </connor>
<connor> like actually do it good yeah you you </connor>
<connor> don't have to wake up that early so what </connor>
<garnt> you're saying is secret to winning tour </garnt>
<joey> de france isn't about training </joey>
<connor> there is like you can cycle and you can </connor>
<connor> cycle at a pace that pretty much uses </connor>
<connor> like your </connor>
<connor> you don't go out of breath you don't </connor>
<connor> really use your muscles that much it's </connor>
<connor> kind of like your natural rhythm </connor>
<connor> resources </connor>
<garnt> yeah you just your natural pace that's </garnt>
<garnt> comfortable for you on like a flat road </garnt>
<connor> that will get you to your place if </connor>
<connor> you've set a reasonable distance like </connor>
<connor> yeah i was going to ask like were the </connor>
<joey> majority of the roads flat </joey>
<connor> well i mean i'm sure there were some </connor>
<connor> inclines yeah i mean sometimes you get </connor>
<joey> lucky and it'd be flat but then i mean </joey>
<joey> like i'm talking like because my only </joey>
<joey> other point of reference is the shimon </joey>
<connor> amikaida right yeah i mean there was </connor>
<connor> some brutal hills i mean like you've </connor>
<joey> you've driven on the roads in japan </joey>
<joey> right yeah sometimes the roads just </joey>
<joey> don't end yeah yeah and they go up like </joey>
<connor> there was the worst one we had a few </connor>
<connor> really bad ones but the worst one was it </connor>
<connor> was um seven kilometers just uphill </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> you can imagine yeah how long that took </connor>
<garnt> and then it was like seven kilometers </garnt>
<garnt> downhill which is like [ __ ] epic and </garnt>
<connor> then you're like this is the best thing </connor>
<connor> ever yeah because it just does it </connor>
<connor> literally just doesn't stop right but </connor>
<connor> it's crazy because like that kind of </connor>
<connor> like elevation it's like we've started </connor>
<connor> at the ocean and as you're you're </connor>
<connor> climbing up at some points you can see </connor>
<connor> the ocean and you are crazy high up </connor>
<connor> right right i think it was like uh </connor>
<connor> it was like 500 meter </connor>
<garnt> incline yeah yeah which is just like </garnt>
<connor> crazy yeah you can just like bike up </connor>
<connor> that i don't know i learned a lot i </connor>
<connor> learned that your bike seat height </connor>
<connor> matters a lot </connor>
<connor> i had mine um so because you have to oh </connor>
<joey> dude as well another thing that i i </joey>
<joey> guess that would be fun to talk about </joey>
<joey> dude trying to get your bike </joey>
<joey> like transport it yeah is a nightmare </joey>
<joey> really well because how do you how do </joey>
<joey> you oh yeah because i guess you get bike </joey>
<joey> on a plane </joey>
<connor> is it just over-sized luggage it's in </connor>
<connor> like the special luggage okay so you </connor>
<connor> just like go up to the counter and but </connor>
<connor> you have to pack your bag which is a </connor>
<connor> nightmare yeah you have to pack the </connor>
<garnt> bicycle um like so chris i was lazy and </garnt>
<garnt> i bought a bag that you just take the </garnt>
<garnt> front wheel off it's super [ __ ] easy </garnt>
<garnt> you just </garnt>
<garnt> comes off and then you strap everything </garnt>
<joey> in place right and i think to get on the </joey>
<joey> plane a a recommended deflating the tire </joey>
<joey> so it doesn't pop yeah yeah yeah i don't </joey>
<connor> think it'll actually like pop though but </connor>
<garnt> i i just did it anyway yeah yeah and </garnt>
<connor> then you will shove it in a bag i'm </connor>
<connor> vastly overestimating this it took like </connor>
<connor> an hour to do this and you get oil </connor>
<connor> everywhere it's so [ __ ] i hate this </connor>
<connor> and then you just check it in and then </connor>
<connor> the whole time on the plane you're </connor>
<garnt> panicking because you're like this is a </garnt>
<garnt> carbon fiber bike it's going to break </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like everything's going to </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] go wrong right it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> terrible and even then like going back </connor>
<connor> before that it's like all right i don't </connor>
<joey> i don't own anything to cycle um do you </joey>
<joey> want anything to cycle well not since </joey>
<joey> the schumann army kaido but we bought </joey>
<connor> like the shittest shittiest amazon </connor>
<garnt> basics yeah yeah yeah yeah that was just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> how cheap can we go to sleep </garnt>
<joey> because it's because it's still padding </joey>
<connor> on my ass </connor>
<connor> aren't the exercise bikes like really </connor>
<joey> well padded i mean </joey>
<garnt> they are but like you know if you're on </garnt>
<garnt> that thing for like an hour or two which </garnt>
<garnt> i usually am yeah then like after a </garnt>
<garnt> while you're just like [ __ ] man my look </garnt>
<garnt> i've got no meat on my ass all right so </garnt>
<garnt> after a while it just like goes directly </garnt>
<garnt> to my bones and i'm just like my pelvis </garnt>
<joey> is screaming because you have to get </joey>
<garnt> used to that yeah of course </garnt>
<garnt> you're also like dummy thick back there </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah i think it makes it worse </connor>
<garnt> though </garnt>
<garnt> music </garnt>
<connor> what okay so like this is because we </connor>
<connor> again i mentioned offhandedly to chris </connor>
<garnt> so like i guess i'll go through the </garnt>
<garnt> timeline oh yeah this is interesting i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if it isn't whatever i </garnt>
<garnt> mentioned to crystal like let's do this </garnt>
<garnt> i want to do this why the [ __ ] not yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i thought like chris would say no </garnt>
<garnt> because you know when you have a crazy </garnt>
<connor> idea and you're like it's crazy if i say </connor>
<connor> it to someone and they say no </connor>
<connor> immediately yeah because then you're </connor>
<connor> like okay i guess it is crazy but if you </connor>
<connor> say a crazy idea to someone they're like </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> you're like oh </connor>
<connor> maybe it's not that insane right maybe </connor>
<connor> we can like do this yeah and so i was </connor>
<garnt> like you get a video i'll live stream </garnt>
<garnt> the whole thing </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't know and then he was like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> sure let's do it and then i was like </garnt>
<garnt> wait [ __ ] what if is there signaling </garnt>
<garnt> like whack-a-night cause i remember when </garnt>
<connor> we drove yeah there was no signal in </connor>
<connor> some parts i was like wait [ __ ] can i </connor>
<connor> actually do this wait how do i keep </connor>
<connor> everything cool wait how do i run it for </connor>
<garnt> 10 hours in a backpack i need to buy a </garnt>
<garnt> bike how do i charge my phone like how </garnt>
<garnt> do i read chat </garnt>
<garnt> i also want to do this thing it was just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i agreed to do it and then there's a </garnt>
<connor> billion things i had to figure out yeah </connor>
<connor> and it was just oh my god it was awful </connor>
<connor> awful i didn't know how to buy anything </connor>
<connor> i didn't know what to buy </connor>
<connor> who just i don't know anyone who cycles </connor>
<connor> in japan yeah so i just started asking </connor>
<connor> around these great guys who've been </connor>
<connor> helping me with a lot of irl streaming </connor>
<connor> stuff i just kind of messaged hey how do </connor>
<connor> i um </connor>
<connor> how do i how do i check if i can stream </connor>
<connor> in this place and they were like oh just </connor>
<connor> go check out like cell towers so i i'm </connor>
<connor> like yeah sick i open up a map of cell </connor>
<connor> towers that's like none right it's like </connor>
<connor> for like three days there's like no cell </connor>
<connor> phone towers they're like all right but </connor>
<connor> maybe maybe if you like go along this </connor>
<joey> really specific road and stay on this </joey>
<joey> road you can do it but you need to go to </joey>
<joey> docomo and get like docomo sims yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so docomo is like the old </joey>
<connor> government cell phone company so a lot </connor>
<connor> of the rural areas in japan uh are </connor>
<connor> mainly like docomo yeah i was like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> okay right so now i gotta go and get two </connor>
<connor> more phone contracts and buy two new </connor>
<connor> modems and figure out how that's gonna </connor>
<connor> happen and then i was like wait my my </connor>
<connor> bag is like [ __ ] for cycling so i asked </connor>
<connor> like rob rob dc great streamer he helped </connor>
<connor> me out came to my house told me what to </connor>
<connor> buy </connor>
<connor> dude rob is a go so i actually got the </connor>
<joey> idea from rob yeah because he did a </joey>
<connor> cycling thing as well yeah again it's </connor>
<connor> going even more back rob did a stream </connor>
<connor> where he cycled across japan for like 30 </connor>
<joey> days i think it was from tokyo to kyushu </joey>
<connor> somewhere and like back and back yeah </connor>
<connor> he's he's he's actually a madman yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah he you know because he was a </garnt>
<connor> cyclothon subathons every time somebody </connor>
<garnt> saw the sub the thing went higher yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i was like i don't wanna do </garnt>
<garnt> that yeah i just wanna like i just wanna </garnt>
<garnt> like do this </garnt>
<garnt> give me a beginning and end point yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah so that's that's what we did </garnt>
<garnt> and you know </garnt>
<garnt> credit to him really nice guy helped me </garnt>
<garnt> out with it a bunch because you know a </garnt>
<joey> lot of people are like hey i kind of </joey>
<joey> want to did what you did can you give me </joey>
<joey> advice and help me out a lot of people </joey>
<joey> would be like no no that's my idea don't </joey>
<joey> steal that yeah </joey>
<connor> and so he was like he's you know </connor>
<connor> super helpful we did even help me do </connor>
<connor> like a test stream </connor>
<connor> we tested the bag out it did not work </connor>
<connor> properly it was like overheating right </connor>
<connor> the next day he was like dude don't </connor>
<connor> worry i got you i'll come over we'll </connor>
<connor> install a fan in your bag yeah so we we </connor>
<connor> installed a pc fan in my bag </connor>
<joey> to cool my bag so you're basically </joey>
<joey> carrying a towel i'm literally carrying </joey>
<connor> like you've got a pc tower yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah like i'm carrying like and again </joey>
<joey> another another problem it's like i have </joey>
<joey> this like it's just every time i would </joey>
<joey> do something that's how stressful it was </joey>
<joey> just another problem would come up yeah </joey>
<connor> of course okay so i have this bag with </connor>
<garnt> four modems uh live broadcasting tool </garnt>
<garnt> and now it's got a pc fan how the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> do i power all this i had a really big </garnt>
<garnt> battery it turns out that really big </garnt>
<garnt> battery can't go on the plane to go to </garnt>
<garnt> wakana so then i have to call up the </garnt>
<garnt> hotel and i'm like hey can i ship some </garnt>
<garnt> stuff to your hotel right and they were </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah all good so that was all okay </garnt>
<garnt> problem i'm avoided yeah how did you buy </garnt>
<garnt> a new battery like a 300 battery 50 000 </garnt>
<garnt> milliamp battery it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> literally the one thing it's the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> uh camping one right right right right </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's the thing </garnt>
<garnt> five kilograms yeah and it's like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> this is on my back </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like all right okay so so we </garnt>
<connor> have all these problems so i had to lay </connor>
<connor> everything out in the bag like with </connor>
<connor> velcro so it's all evenly distributed so </connor>
<connor> that it's not just weighing me down and </connor>
<connor> killing my back yeah yeah yeah perfect </connor>
<connor> done so then i'm like all right i need a </connor>
<connor> bike </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> i'm telling you man one of the hardest </connor>
<connor> things on earth is trying to figure out </connor>
<connor> a good bike yeah online it is like when </connor>
<connor> you look online it's like what is good </connor>
<connor> bike and it's literally like i bought </connor>
<connor> this tour de france bike for fifteen </connor>
<connor> thousand dollars it's pretty good but if </connor>
<connor> you're a more budget option we've got a </connor>
<connor> 9k bike here for amateurs and it's like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is any of this like </connor>
<joey> literally every time i try and buy a new </joey>
<joey> camera yeah it's like cyclists are so </joey>
<garnt> like insular with their like suggestions </garnt>
<joey> and stuff yeah yeah yeah you know these </joey>
<garnt> sunglasses they kind of deflected the </garnt>
<joey> micro wind uh you know in like a 0.3 you </joey>
<garnt> know and the uv with the 0.3 speaking </garnt>
<garnt> english it was just like i just didn't </garnt>
<garnt> understand anything yeah about cycling </garnt>
<connor> yeah and there's a guy called josh in </connor>
<connor> japan who was really great and he helped </connor>
<connor> me out and he basically he cycles a ton </connor>
<connor> in japan he just gave me all the </connor>
<connor> suggestions told me to what pence to </connor>
<connor> bought i bought new cycling pants that </connor>
<connor> had like uh straps straps that went over </connor>
<connor> they were they were awesome they were </connor>
<connor> great i like didn't chafe at all it was </connor>
<connor> great they stayed up all the king was a </connor>
<connor> pain in the ass because i have to tip my </connor>
<connor> shirt off every time i want to pee </connor>
<connor> again it was so expensive because i </connor>
<connor> bought like a pretty good bike right </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i bought a bike it was called </connor>
<connor> cannondale synapse 3l it's like a 4 000 </connor>
<connor> bike all right yeah i was like </connor>
<connor> government if you're listening i'm never </connor>
<connor> riding it ever outside of this one </connor>
<connor> charity event um so it's a tax write-off </connor>
<garnt> please please but yeah so it was just </garnt>
<garnt> like a month of crazy prep and getting </garnt>
<garnt> everything ready yeah yeah just hoping </garnt>
<garnt> like how do you test this like i can't </garnt>
<garnt> go to wakana in the middle of nowhere in </garnt>
<joey> hokkaido and test if this works yeah </joey>
<garnt> exactly so like i'm [ __ ] myself yeah </garnt>
<joey> and i'm in like in basically like sudo </joey>
<joey> russia in japan you're in the middle of </joey>
<joey> nowhere and like just day one you're </joey>
<joey> like you turn everything on and you just </joey>
<joey> hope it works and yeah some things broke </joey>
<joey> right away and you're like [ __ ] like our </joey>
<joey> tires we didn't like inflate them </joey>
<garnt> properly and then </garnt>
<garnt> um stuff wasn't working and i had to um </garnt>
<garnt> so another thing is that it was for </garnt>
<garnt> charity yeah and i wanted there to be </garnt>
<garnt> text to speech on my speaker for all the </garnt>
<garnt> donations coming through so i thought </garnt>
<garnt> that would be fun yeah incentivize </garnt>
<garnt> people and also i'm gonna be cycling </garnt>
<garnt> like all day like nine hours but i have </garnt>
<connor> something to keep your mind occupied </connor>
<garnt> yeah my mind like numb yeah and um so </garnt>
<connor> like turns out that </connor>
<joey> uh the charity service i was using </joey>
<joey> tiltify </joey>
<joey> just doesn't let you do text-to-speech </joey>
<joey> in any way really there's no way you can </joey>
<garnt> do text-to-speech with it uh through </garnt>
<connor> like stream labs yeah yeah yeah um </connor>
<garnt> stream elements anything it doesn't work </garnt>
<connor> and uh so shout out to stream elements </connor>
<connor> and my uh one of my mods i just asked </connor>
<connor> someone's like hey could you make </connor>
<connor> something you should program something </connor>
<connor> that will read text-to-speech so both of </connor>
<connor> them made things so stream elements just </connor>
<connor> made a </connor>
<connor> plug-in just for this charity event wow </connor>
<connor> so that i could have charity donations </connor>
<connor> come out on the speaker right in like </connor>
<garnt> three days shout out to them </garnt>
<garnt> so many people helped like yeah like my </garnt>
<garnt> mod who's just uh rode who's awesome who </garnt>
<joey> manages our subreddit as well he made </joey>
<joey> like a live tracking thing </joey>
<joey> yeah i saw that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but i i i can't really use this in day </joey>
<garnt> like normal streams i don't want </garnt>
<garnt> everyone to know </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> yourself it's literally like doxing </garnt>
<connor> where i am like yeah yeah yeah in real </connor>
<joey> time yeah right um make sure you don't </joey>
<joey> accidentally show that next year </joey>
<connor> but it's sick though right because it's </connor>
<connor> like i thought like okay </connor>
<connor> again like another issue is like how </connor>
<connor> how do you make nine hours of cycling </connor>
<garnt> engaging yeah because like that shit's </garnt>
<connor> boring like i i wouldn't watch it yeah </connor>
<garnt> but it's like okay so you have you have </garnt>
<connor> the narrative of the the charity and the </connor>
<connor> challenge right and and the journey </connor>
<connor> that's one but that's that's not really </connor>
<connor> like like you if you if you missed day </connor>
<garnt> one you maybe you don't care about that </garnt>
<garnt> as much yeah it's like so i was like </garnt>
<connor> okay i really want to have some kind of </connor>
<connor> like progress bar or tracker on the </connor>
<connor> screen yeah uh and i just you know three </connor>
<connor> weeks before the event i asked my mods i </connor>
<connor> was like hey can you can we try and make </connor>
<connor> something and yeah they made it it took </connor>
<connor> it was like pulling hair testing this </connor>
<connor> app it was like every night they were </connor>
<connor> like we tested again and i just sat </connor>
<connor> there for an hour and they were like </connor>
<connor> type this on android editor and i was </connor>
<connor> like dude </connor>
<garnt> it's broken it doesn't work </garnt>
<garnt> like hours and hours hours yeah took so </garnt>
<garnt> long but then you get this cool result </garnt>
<garnt> where you get this progress bar that </garnt>
<connor> tells you how far i am from the </connor>
<connor> destination a little monkey on the map a </connor>
<garnt> little animation that was a custom app </garnt>
<connor> that was made yeah yeah it was a custom </connor>
<connor> app called find my monkey that they made </connor>
<connor> wow um it was like literally like every </connor>
<connor> morning before the cycle i would zoom in </connor>
<connor> on where i was put start zoom out go to </connor>
<connor> where we're going to finish put end yeah </connor>
<connor> and it would just do like a geographical </connor>
<connor> straight line yeah which wasn't like </connor>
<connor> perfect because sunday's people would be </connor>
<garnt> like wow what an easy day we have 60 but </garnt>
<garnt> then the root was like this yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah so it was actually like 120 </garnt>
<garnt> and we're like wow he's moving so slowly </garnt>
<garnt> but luckily we had like a speedometer as </garnt>
<garnt> well right which was using gps to show </garnt>
<garnt> how fast i was going which is also fun </garnt>
<connor> because then chat was like oh my god </connor>
<connor> he's moving at like 50 kilometers an </connor>
<connor> hour on this downhill everyone's getting </connor>
<connor> hyped yeah it was just like </connor>
<connor> trying to like gamify it and trying to </connor>
<connor> make it like engaging i think that it </connor>
<connor> worked yeah people already liked it like </connor>
<garnt> views were crazy for me yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> exactly i saw you peek to like 30 000 at </connor>
<garnt> the end yeah </garnt>
<connor> 41 or something like that i've never had </connor>
<garnt> that many viewers ever on a live stream </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and that's nice that's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> insane yeah it was it was crazy it was </garnt>
<joey> uh it's hard though because cycling with </joey>
<joey> the backpack on it was like it was a lot </joey>
<joey> and then also trying to like be fun for </joey>
<joey> nine hours cycling is hard yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah for sure um that was hot that was </connor>
<connor> hardest part i felt like some days i </connor>
<garnt> wasn't engaging enough </garnt>
<garnt> at that point i think there's enough </garnt>
<joey> elements within the stream that you </joey>
<garnt> didn't need to be engaged no one's gonna </garnt>
<joey> blame you for that yeah yeah dude i </joey>
<connor> think for the first like four or five </connor>
<connor> days i was killing it with the </connor>
<garnt> engagement i thought i was like just </garnt>
<garnt> talking non-stop even though cycling </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um except for like uphills i was </garnt>
<garnt> like all right chat just </garnt>
<garnt> but even that was fun because like i i </garnt>
<connor> think i think it all worked really </connor>
<connor> nicely where we had enough elements in </connor>
<connor> it um where everyone kind of came </connor>
<connor> together </connor>
<connor> and when like uphill sections happened </connor>
<garnt> that were really long everyone was just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like in cheering mode and that </garnt>
<garnt> was really fun </garnt>
<garnt> it was just everything worked like i was </garnt>
<connor> very lucky that </connor>
<connor> we never had a signal outage more than </connor>
<connor> like 20 30 minutes right and even then </connor>
<connor> most of them were like one minute right </connor>
<connor> right yeah yeah yeah so yeah it worked i </connor>
<connor> i don't know it's i think it's a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> miracle that all worked out yeah i don't </connor>
<connor> know the battery lasted every single day </connor>
<connor> i i </connor>
<connor> my i had a 50 000 milliamp battery and </connor>
<garnt> it only </garnt>
<garnt> died on the very very last day after 10 </garnt>
<connor> hours of streaming damn with four things </connor>
<garnt> plugged into it god damn okay and then </garnt>
<connor> it would last like another hour on like </connor>
<garnt> residual charges right right so that's </garnt>
<connor> like crazy yeah i'm i i'm yeah it was </connor>
<connor> nuts i didn't even talk about how like </connor>
<connor> how the cycling actually was just the </connor>
<connor> prep and doing it was hard yeah that was </connor>
<garnt> hard yeah because like like i saw how </garnt>
<garnt> many things you had going on in like irl </garnt>
<garnt> stream setup and everything like that </garnt>
<connor> and i was just like is this custom made </connor>
<connor> or is this like all that was like custom </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah god damn gg so like how much </connor>
<garnt> time did this play like take like </garnt>
<connor> planning to like execution </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<joey> like a month or so we had about a month </joey>
<joey> between when i pitched the idea and when </joey>
<joey> we did it and even then like we were </joey>
<joey> changing </joey>
<joey> the route kind of like whilst we were </joey>
<connor> cycling as well </connor>
<connor> like because google maps </connor>
<connor> just like there was if you cycle in </connor>
<joey> tokyo there's pre-existing cycle routes </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah that can tell you where to </connor>
<garnt> cycle but in wakanda and stuff like that </garnt>
<joey> no one cycles there </joey>
<garnt> we didn't see people no one's there well </garnt>
<garnt> no one's there period </garnt>
<connor> like after we left wakana we just didn't </connor>
<connor> see people for like four days yeah </connor>
<connor> there was nothing yeah and um </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> it was just </connor>
<connor> so much prep so much and like i was </connor>
<connor> trying to do work and do other streams </connor>
<garnt> whilst also trying to manage everything </garnt>
<garnt> and also i didn't really promote it that </garnt>
<garnt> much right i was kind of like yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> happening and in hindsight i should have </garnt>
<garnt> promoted it way more because i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> this is like eight days i should have </garnt>
<garnt> promoted this yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly </garnt>
<connor> but i was also terrified that if i </connor>
<connor> promoted it too much and then the first </connor>
<connor> day and the first day just had no signal </connor>
<connor> right because i i genuinely thought like </connor>
<connor> the first day of cycling i would just </connor>
<garnt> have no signal for half the day right i </garnt>
<garnt> kept telling the viewers as we were </garnt>
<garnt> leaving work and i'm like listen </garnt>
<connor> if there's no signal for like two hours </connor>
<connor> i'm so sorry it's probably going to </connor>
<connor> happen just just deal with it yeah and </connor>
<connor> it was like terrifying because you're </connor>
<connor> like man </connor>
<garnt> it really [ __ ] sucks to have your </garnt>
<garnt> first day of in a big event yeah just </garnt>
<garnt> not work and the technical issues how do </garnt>
<garnt> you convince people to then just you </garnt>
<joey> know stick around yeah if they don't if </joey>
<garnt> they don't invest themselves in the </garnt>
<joey> first day a lot of people are going to </joey>
<joey> fall off yeah yeah yeah yeah because </joey>
<joey> what happened is it was kind of like a </joey>
<joey> like that in viewership right right the </joey>
<joey> first day was crazy we had like 27 000 </joey>
<joey> viewers right i don't even know why </joey>
<connor> like the people were going crazy like i </connor>
<connor> think all our energies were really high </connor>
<connor> as well because the first day yeah chris </connor>
<connor> was chris was really really funny the </connor>
<connor> first day and was energetic slowly went </connor>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<connor> down same with me to be honest i mean </connor>
<connor> for the first five days i was killing it </connor>
<connor> and then i started really slowing down </connor>
<connor> right um and yeah and so </connor>
<connor> i've got the questions </connor>
<garnt> how was your how was the experience well </garnt>
<connor> that was it this was tough preparation </connor>
<connor> for the hardest part like getting all </connor>
<connor> the the widgets and stuff to work </connor>
<connor> but like that's why i did like two days </connor>
<connor> before i did a </connor>
<connor> test stream in tokyo yeah where i did a </connor>
<connor> 60k cycle across tokyo but obviously </connor>
<connor> it's not really like the same because </connor>
<joey> tokyo is like perfect internet yeah like </joey>
<garnt> there's never worry that it would cut </garnt>
<connor> out because like tokyo has like it's </connor>
<joey> like mcdonald's everything irl streams </joey>
<connor> just work it because it works so well in </connor>
<connor> tokyo you really have to be like </connor>
<joey> in like a weird basement or some kind of </joey>
<connor> room that's made of aluminium foil yeah </connor>
<garnt> exactly i said aluminium ew </garnt>
<garnt> no no no you said it right you said it </garnt>
<garnt> right you said it right connor </garnt>
<connor> wasn't a mistake in that i don't know i </connor>
<connor> was gonna say aluminum </connor>
<joey> aluminium it's aluminum </joey>
<connor> he's been indoctrinated </connor>
<connor> uh yeah i'm sure there'll be like a </connor>
<connor> really big video out i don't know if i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna do one or two parts or whatever </connor>
<connor> yeah but like it was it was a lot of </connor>
<connor> prep it was so i wish i could show the </connor>
<connor> prep because the prep was crazy and like </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<garnt> shout out to my uh my uh uh mods and </garnt>
<garnt> slash programmers </garnt>
<garnt> who uh worked </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] hard on making the farmer </garnt>
<garnt> monkey app i think that was the coolest </garnt>
<garnt> part for me yeah yeah i think watching i </garnt>
<garnt> mean you just had a custom map </garnt>
<garnt> it was i thought it was [ __ ] sick </garnt>
<joey> that you could just </joey>
<joey> see like the map it was zooming in and </joey>
<joey> out gradually showing you where i was </joey>
<joey> and yeah like kind of go i just thought </joey>
<connor> they were sick and a progress bar like a </connor>
<joey> progress but that's so [ __ ] cool when </joey>
<joey> i watch the tour de france i'm like </joey>
<garnt> where are they i don't [ __ ] where's </garnt>
<garnt> the progress ball </garnt>
<garnt> dude tell me the tell me that give me </garnt>
<garnt> the progress bar man that's what i need </garnt>
<connor> what's that like actual current speed on </connor>
<connor> a gps yeah give me like i want like look </connor>
<connor> like make it like a game yeah make it </connor>
<joey> like i'm just i won't watch tour de </joey>
<garnt> france unless there's a hud </garnt>
<joey> i i had like a heads-up display right </joey>
<garnt> like if two of the friends had chat </garnt>
<joey> i'm i'm watching that yeah you know what </joey>
<joey> i mean two of the friends needs this </joey>
<joey> dude i like you know what i want like </joey>
<joey> the hearts </joey>
<joey> it's so [ __ ] weird because um because </joey>
<joey> i i've also been streaming more often </joey>
<joey> than past months i'm trying to try to </joey>
<joey> dabble in more often i'm kind of getting </joey>
<connor> used to it right </connor>
<connor> but then like a few days ago i had to </connor>
<connor> like stream like a let's play yeah and i </connor>
<connor> was like great this this can be easy all </connor>
<connor> right i've been doing let's plays for </connor>
<connor> this past month yeah and everything like </connor>
<joey> that yeah and just like but it was like </joey>
<connor> an offline let's play so no chat just an </connor>
<joey> og offline let's yeah and i i tried i </joey>
<connor> tried like i thought it was going to be </connor>
<connor> easy because i was like i've been </connor>
<connor> streaming like i've been streaming games </connor>
<connor> streaming different things like almost </connor>
<joey> like every day for like the past month </joey>
<joey> whatever this is going to be easy i turn </joey>
<joey> on the game </joey>
<connor> and i like subconsciously look towards </connor>
<connor> where the chat is i see no interaction </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> is everything better and i just i </connor>
<connor> actually had to like scrap the video </connor>
<connor> because i was like i i don't know how </connor>
<connor> yeah i actually don't know how to like </connor>
<garnt> commentate or like be entertaining </garnt>
<joey> you know what's so weird though i </joey>
<garnt> actually find it easier when there's no </garnt>
<garnt> chat no no no no because i because early </garnt>
<garnt> in my channel i did let's plays yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that weren't on stream right so like i </garnt>
<connor> because i'm used to that from early on </connor>
<connor> in my channel because i was a one point </connor>
<connor> a let's player yeah i just find it so </connor>
<connor> much easier when there's no chat for me </connor>
<garnt> for me chat i i'd be i might be thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about like uh you know something you </garnt>
<garnt> know like okay i'm gonna say like this </garnt>
<garnt> joke here yeah like you know explain </garnt>
<garnt> this or whatever yeah but while i'm </garnt>
<garnt> doing that on stream because i'm so </garnt>
<joey> engrossed in looking at chat i all the </joey>
<joey> jokes just fly out of my head so i </joey>
<joey> become such a boring let's play on </joey>
<connor> stream i just read out the funniest </connor>
<connor> thing chat says and i just say say as if </connor>
<joey> it's my joke </joey>
<connor> so that normally works really yeah </connor>
<joey> to me like i i think my big issue is </joey>
<joey> that when i don't have when i'm not live </joey>
<joey> streaming and when am i just trying to </joey>
<joey> record like an offline video second </joey>
<joey> channel video whatever um i like think </joey>
<joey> about what i say too much yeah so i try </joey>
<connor> i try to like script it in my head you </connor>
<connor> know what i mean whereas if i have you </connor>
<connor> generally yeah yeah yeah i turn into </connor>
<connor> like giggup right whereas if chat's </connor>
<connor> there i'm forced to say what's the first </connor>
<garnt> thing that comes to my mind right i </garnt>
<garnt> don't i can't like second-guess myself </garnt>
<connor> so i just haven't forced like constantly </connor>
<connor> talk i'm like a firm believer that </connor>
<connor> as a streamer your chat should be on </connor>
<connor> screen i just think it always should be </connor>
<connor> on screen oh yeah of course i just think </connor>
<connor> that like that's the whole live element </connor>
<connor> right show them like it doesn't have to </connor>
<connor> be like crazy not like nico nico where </connor>
<connor> it's like flying across the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> screen yeah just put in the little </connor>
<connor> corner like all right imagine if you </connor>
<connor> could like i think it's stupid that the </connor>
<connor> olympics don't let people like stream it </connor>
<connor> yeah imagine if you had like twitch chat </connor>
<connor> with the olympics i think that would be </connor>
<connor> awesome i think we've said this before </connor>
<connor> on trash taste but like that's why like </connor>
<connor> i really really wanted all this stuff on </connor>
<connor> on the screen yeah the cycling things </connor>
<connor> i'm like cycling is like inherently </connor>
<connor> you know it's not that you know it's not </connor>
<connor> that exciting yeah like it's just not </connor>
<connor> like if i was just cycling pov across </connor>
<connor> japan it's like right </connor>
<connor> cool yeah nice like walking the same </connor>
<connor> it's like give me something like give me </connor>
<connor> yeah give me some stuff to get invested </connor>
<garnt> true gamer you're just </garnt>
<garnt> you're turning irl into a game well </garnt>
<connor> that's kind of what i wanted it to be </connor>
<connor> like i kind of wanted it to be where </connor>
<connor> anyone could hop in and kind of get a </connor>
<connor> feel for what where we're at yeah you </connor>
<connor> have to ask oh how far in are we it's </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> we're 80 of the way there yeah oh uh </garnt>
<garnt> we're we're eating lunch and we're 47 of </garnt>
<garnt> the way there oh the days you started </garnt>
<garnt> with five you know what i mean like yeah </garnt>
<connor> a lot of the questions people are going </connor>
<connor> to ask uh in the chat and stuff like </connor>
<connor> that just get that out of the way </connor>
<connor> there's never any questions about how </connor>
<connor> we're doing how's it you know it's like </connor>
<connor> you can everything is visually explained </connor>
<connor> and and it doesn't impose i think it </connor>
<connor> adds to it because it's not like there's </connor>
<connor> much i need to show yeah literally just </connor>
<connor> uh yeah me gay and like i i had like a </connor>
<connor> a fail proof for like everything um </connor>
<garnt> except a spare bike which i nearly broke </garnt>
<joey> of course you do of course like my brand </joey>
<garnt> every new bike </garnt>
<garnt> i was smart though i got insurance on my </garnt>
<garnt> bike okay that's good that's good that's </garnt>
<garnt> good that's good we learned from </garnt>
<garnt> ourselves the insurance was like </garnt>
<garnt> it was like </garnt>
<garnt> percent of the bikes [ __ ] cost but it </garnt>
<garnt> covered everything it was like if the </garnt>
<garnt> bike literally come bust or get stolen </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah they'll replace it it's monkey </garnt>
<garnt> proof yeah literally like no matter what </garnt>
<connor> i do to it it is </connor>
<garnt> they'll they'll no questions asked yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah and it's great for me because </connor>
<garnt> if i was live streaming i broke it i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> it's proof </connor>
<connor> right here bro </connor>
<connor> oh yeah i nearly broke it on the second </connor>
<garnt> day it's not good </garnt>
<garnt> was that when you fell over or yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> i was pointing to something in the </connor>
<connor> distance holding on with my left hand </connor>
<garnt> and i went over a big rock right thing </garnt>
<connor> like wobbled yeah and i just went right </connor>
<connor> into the yeah the pavement and it was a </connor>
<connor> really big like it's not maybe like this </connor>
<connor> big of sidewalk from the road </connor>
<connor> pavement for british people um and i </connor>
<connor> just like jumped into the bush i didn't </connor>
<connor> want to land on the sidewalk oh yeah i </connor>
<connor> was like that's just gonna hurt yeah but </connor>
<connor> i didn't also want my bike to get </connor>
<connor> wrecked so i i just didn't in the second </connor>
<connor> i was like i just can't decide i'll just </connor>
<connor> jump </connor>
<connor> but i i was also excited </connor>
<connor> my first time ever using them i had the </connor>
<connor> clip in yeah yeah yeah which are awesome </connor>
<connor> by the way it makes cycling like way </connor>
<connor> easier and also you have to think less </connor>
<connor> you have to worry where your legs are </connor>
<connor> you just </connor>
<connor> yeah like a like a steam engine just </connor>
<connor> keep you just keep pushing you don't </connor>
<connor> like the machine yeah i mean like i'm </connor>
<connor> sure to work with chris is on but he's </connor>
<garnt> just like slipping and [ __ ] yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like it's just it's good but also it's </garnt>
<connor> bad for situations like that yeah but </connor>
<garnt> luckily uh if you jump hard enough </garnt>
<garnt> you'll get out of the clips </garnt>
<connor> and i think i did and they've made a </connor>
<connor> good clip it was completely by accident </connor>
<connor> and luckily there's no cars on the road </connor>
<connor> right at that point uh i mean we're in </connor>
<connor> the middle of nowhere yeah yeah but yeah </connor>
<joey> it was it was you have to be pretty </joey>
<joey> unlucky to get hit by a car </joey>
<joey> on a road that's practically empty that </joey>
<connor> would be tough that would be tough i </connor>
<joey> mean there was that that was an aspect </joey>
<joey> that was really </joey>
<joey> uh you get used to pretty fast but it </joey>
<joey> was very anxious the first time where </joey>
<joey> you cycle on the road oh yeah </joey>
<connor> and tunnels especially yeah tunnels of </connor>
<joey> the sky used to it tunnels is terrifying </joey>
<connor> cause the echo in a tunnel when you're </connor>
<connor> cycling in it is terrifying right right </connor>
<connor> because the car comes in or here in the </connor>
<connor> background </connor>
<connor> like fifteen thousand echoes coming </connor>
<garnt> right that's terrifying you and you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's coming from behind you and you're </garnt>
<garnt> like oh no oh no please please don't </garnt>
<garnt> don't hear me don't you please please </garnt>
<garnt> i don't have your lights on yeah he's </garnt>
<garnt> like please see me please see me please </garnt>
<connor> and you're literally just hoping you </connor>
<garnt> just don't die yeah that's it </garnt>
<garnt> hoping it's not like because i saw like </garnt>
<garnt> the one one of the clips where that </garnt>
<connor> massive truck yeah almost clipped you or </connor>
<connor> that was that was unnecessarily scary </connor>
<garnt> because it was literally a </garnt>
<garnt> a country road with so much room and no </garnt>
<garnt> one no one was on these roads yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> he went so close to me and i thought why </garnt>
<connor> why just being addicted like </connor>
<connor> it was enough room </connor>
<connor> probably in europe it's probably the </connor>
<connor> normal amount of room yeah but i was </connor>
<connor> just like come on man it wasn't like it </connor>
<connor> was like a busy road like i don't know </connor>
<connor> that that was probably not as close as </connor>
<connor> some other ones but other times we were </connor>
<garnt> on a road and i chose to be on the road </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> when you're cycling for ages going on </garnt>
<garnt> the the pavement the sidewalk it's bumpy </garnt>
<garnt> and up and down and [ __ ] paved and it's </garnt>
<garnt> just not good and after a while you're </garnt>
<garnt> just like i just want a cycle i do not </garnt>
<connor> want to have to think or get my ass hurt </connor>
<connor> or stop or slow down you just want to </connor>
<garnt> keep you just want to have the exercise </garnt>
<garnt> bike experience yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right and you go so much faster on the </garnt>
<garnt> road yeah and it's like whatever i don't </garnt>
<garnt> give a [ __ ] about the cars even when i'm </garnt>
<garnt> driving i don't give a [ __ ] if i have to </garnt>
<garnt> just like wait a second to get around </garnt>
<garnt> the cyclist it's a road bike let me go </garnt>
<garnt> on the road yeah also my favorite part </garnt>
<garnt> is when i saw other japanese cyclists </garnt>
<garnt> and we just nodded each other that was </garnt>
<garnt> fun </garnt>
<garnt> the mutual you </garnt>
<connor> now every other cyclist that was like </connor>
<connor> also wearing serious gear would not </connor>
<connor> always </connor>
<connor> it was like a mutual respect you'd wave </connor>
<connor> especially when like i don't know like </connor>
<connor> you uh you were coming down like </connor>
<joey> you were going up a big hill and after </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah they knew and you're like oh </connor>
<joey> no he's like oh he ain't normally </joey>
<garnt> one of us </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just like one night we had to drive </garnt>
<connor> back um </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> we did drive down the biggest incline we </connor>
<connor> did right and in the car we were like </connor>
<garnt> this is stupid i can't believe we cycled </garnt>
<garnt> up this yeah it's like ten we're like on </garnt>
<garnt> this road for like 10 minutes driving </garnt>
<connor> down we're like this we cycled up this </connor>
<connor> this is insane yeah because like day one </connor>
<connor> the first incline we're like oh dying </connor>
<garnt> we're like we can't do this this is too </garnt>
<garnt> much and by like day seven you're just </garnt>
<garnt> like all right let's get used to all </garnt>
<connor> right 5k incline let's do it let's just </connor>
<connor> go you just get used to it it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like it's just a different </connor>
<connor> sensation you don't like it doesn't hurt </connor>
<connor> nearly as much yeah just kind of like </connor>
<connor> it just uses a different part of you </connor>
<connor> it's really interesting i i </connor>
<connor> i really want to keep cycling more i </connor>
<connor> feel really fit </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> i mean </connor>
<joey> if you don't feel fit after this i don't </joey>
<connor> know what's going on </connor>
<connor> because like your heart rate is like </connor>
<connor> literally </connor>
<connor> it's just elevated all day long like </connor>
<connor> you're just purely exercising like </connor>
<connor> seven eight hours a day yeah that's it </connor>
<connor> for eight days no breaks it's probably </connor>
<connor> terrible if you actually want to build </connor>
<connor> muscle and actually do it healthfully uh </connor>
<joey> but yeah it's great to lose body fat if </joey>
<connor> you want to lose weight it's great but i </connor>
<connor> wouldn't recommend it it's just like </connor>
<joey> it's i mean it's pretty like yeah it's </joey>
<connor> it's like not eating for three days yeah </connor>
<connor> it's awful because like you know you're </connor>
<connor> burning like i don't know i think most </connor>
<connor> days you were burning like five four </connor>
<connor> thousand calories a day </connor>
<connor> so it's like oh it's on top of your </connor>
<connor> daily like 2 000 yeah yeah yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> you're just like there's no possible way </connor>
<joey> you can eat 8 000 calories a day </joey>
<joey> like unless you're like actually trying </joey>
<joey> your hardest yeah yeah yeah i just </joey>
<garnt> didn't want to eat i don't stop cycling </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to [ __ ] eat yeah it's i </garnt>
<garnt> mean like it's i mean i think it's a </garnt>
<garnt> great way to lose weight if you want to </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> do that i mean i don't think i lost that </garnt>
<connor> much weight because i was also i was </connor>
<connor> drinking a lot of beer </connor>
<garnt> well that made the beer worth it though </garnt>
<connor> right that was that's the sweet that's </connor>
<joey> how you're putting back the 8 000 </joey>
<connor> calories just like like 10 pints of beer </connor>
<garnt> yeah well i i mean i ate i ate as much </garnt>
<connor> as i could </connor>
<connor> at every point but yeah there's even </connor>
<garnt> then it's like you just </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know if if only we had our </garnt>
<garnt> health check up right now right corner i </garnt>
<joey> know yeah </joey>
<joey> that was the real ingredient i was just </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] my health jacob's coming up </joey>
<connor> i'm going to drop some weight </connor>
<connor> like it's like you you finish it like </connor>
<connor> five </connor>
<connor> six pm every day and then you've got a </connor>
<connor> shower yeah yeah yeah and then i have to </connor>
<connor> charge everything so i have to charge </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> like uh the giant portable bat portable </connor>
<garnt> battery have to charge all the router uh </garnt>
<garnt> router which is a british one </garnt>
<joey> i call it router i don't know which one </joey>
<joey> it is it's it's pretty rude i say router </joey>
<joey> i i've heard i don't say i don't think </joey>
<connor> people say router so maybe it's </connor>
<connor> the american one i have to charge all of </connor>
<connor> you i feel like i feel like ruto is like </connor>
<connor> the southern maybe yeah maybe </connor>

<connor> the two portable batteries in my bike </connor>
<connor> the uh the giant battery uh the </connor>
<connor> three routers um </connor>
<connor> everything else and then i have to put </connor>
<garnt> it all back in the bike and it's just </garnt>
<connor> it's a lot every day yeah yeah you </connor>
<garnt> pretty much didn't get to do anything </garnt>
<garnt> for like eight days well i mean like was </garnt>
<garnt> there anywhere you'd want to go back to </garnt>
<joey> and oh yeah like nobody bet 2 was cool </joey>
<garnt> oh no </garnt>
<joey> it's a really famous onsen town yeah ah </joey>
<joey> and that was really cool </joey>
<connor> because a lot of the towns you went to </connor>
<connor> just had nothing </connor>
<connor> just nothing in there yeah i think it </connor>
<joey> was three days we didn't see anything </joey>
<connor> yeah i feel like anything north of like </connor>
<connor> sub-par is pretty much just like i know </connor>
<joey> i was really sick oh other than our </joey>
<connor> psychologist </connor>
<connor> i was very small like there were some </connor>
<garnt> places that only had </garnt>
<garnt> like one hotel within like a uh you know </garnt>
<garnt> like a 80 kilometer radius yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like um </garnt>
<garnt> uh i'm sure </garnt>
<garnt> chris can tell the story about this </garnt>
<connor> racist hotel staff but there's already </connor>
<connor> clips of it and stuff not racist i don't </connor>
<connor> know [ __ ] or maybe just a horrible </connor>
<connor> person </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> that's the difficulty being in traffic </connor>
<garnt> especially in like the country in japan </garnt>
<connor> are you being racist or are you just </connor>
<connor> like oh </connor>
<joey> but like there was like you know uh the </joey>
<connor> first night there was like no hotels in </connor>
<connor> this area just none right it was just </connor>
<connor> only like one hostel </connor>
<garnt> and it just like didn't make sense for </garnt>
<garnt> us to go in hostel when we had to charge </garnt>
<garnt> charge everything yeah yeah it'd be up </garnt>
<garnt> so early and we were going to get there </garnt>
<connor> so late and stuff so it was just it was </connor>
<connor> just tough </connor>
<connor> really tough i don't know </connor>
<connor> how you would would you would you do it </connor>
<garnt> again </garnt>
<connor> like some something like that cycle not </connor>
<connor> hokkaido again right hokkaido is way </connor>
<connor> harder than anywhere else in japan </connor>
<joey> somewhere a little more like with a </joey>
<connor> little more civilization i'd love to do </connor>
<connor> it uh i mean crystal's also chris </connor>
<connor> already already was like maybe we should </connor>
<connor> do another one sometime soon </connor>
<joey> i mean i don't mind </joey>
<joey> yeah i i the idea was like maybe kyushu </joey>
<joey> or something right that makes more sense </joey>
<joey> right because it's the whole island yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's a lot hillier though yeah but </joey>
<garnt> then apparently chris was telling me </garnt>
<garnt> there's a there's another way this is </garnt>
<garnt> like the west or east side that's not as </garnt>
<garnt> hilly or whatever i don't mind same </garnt>
<garnt> famous last words yeah it's like i'm </garnt>
<connor> fine i know a way i know i'm with hills </connor>
<connor> it was like way more successful than i </connor>
<connor> thought yeah i thought it wasn't gonna </connor>
<garnt> be i thought the viewership on my twitch </garnt>
<garnt> was not gonna be as good as it was yeah </garnt>
<connor> um i thought cause it was like i thought </connor>
<connor> i wouldn't like watch it if i </connor>
<garnt> just watched someone cycle i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i feel like irl content on twitch </garnt>
<garnt> she's just doing really really well </garnt>
<joey> right now definitely </joey>
<garnt> uh because no one else can come to japan </garnt>
<connor> that's why so that's the only that's </connor>
<joey> literally the only way that people would </joey>
<joey> just create their knees it's great you </joey>
<garnt> can just show off a [ __ ] combination </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> chat think irl stuff should always be </garnt>
<garnt> like an event not i don't know how you </garnt>
<garnt> could be uh like i don't know how rob </garnt>
<garnt> does it uh robert i don't know how rob </garnt>
<garnt> does he streams like five days a week </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> i don't know how those like how have you </joey>
<joey> not run out of places to go </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know how he does it i i </joey>
<joey> would be </joey>
<joey> sick of going outside yeah i would just </joey>
<joey> touching too much </joey>
<joey> i'm like can i can i not touch grass </joey>
<connor> i think it's great to have irl stream </connor>
<connor> events i think as one-offs they're </connor>
<connor> really good and i think twitch right now </connor>
<connor> or streaming in general like irl is a </connor>
<connor> really big uh like trend right yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> there's always been a thing but i think </garnt>
<connor> right now it's particularly popular than </connor>
<garnt> anything yeah definitely um when it's </garnt>
<garnt> done well yeah so if you want to try it </garnt>
<connor> try it it just sucks because the barrier </connor>
<connor> of entry to irl streaming is </connor>
<connor> very very high well yeah um also cycling </connor>
<connor> as well </connor>
<connor> on top of it if you want to get into </connor>
<garnt> like the amount of cycling that you did </garnt>
<connor> to </connor>
<connor> like you don't need to buy all the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that i bought like you could get a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bike and do the same thing it would just </connor>
<garnt> be harder oh yeah like this bike wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> would you have a good time though doing </garnt>
<connor> your bra </connor>
<connor> this bike was my bike was nutty i've </connor>
<connor> never had gears that changed like that </connor>
<connor> like i've never had a bike where you </connor>
<connor> just tap it </connor>
<connor> boom change gear </connor>
<connor> immediately no questions asked the bike </connor>
<connor> is like bra i got you doesn't matter </connor>
<connor> what hell you're on anything boom tap it </connor>
<connor> you want to go two hold it down twice as </connor>
<connor> long it's insane i've never had </connor>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<connor> so now that you've had the cycling </connor>
<garnt> experience what do you think makes a </garnt>
<joey> good bike </joey>
<connor> what would you recommend now that you're </connor>
<joey> a cycling expert </joey>
<connor> now that you're uh you know that you're </connor>
<garnt> the traveler </garnt>
<garnt> like this bike and this bike was nuts </garnt>
<garnt> like i i don't understand how people can </garnt>
<garnt> like review bikes for a living i'm just </garnt>
<joey> like what are you what are you looking </joey>
<joey> for like i feel like every bike is </joey>
<joey> slightly i feel like you can say that </joey>
<joey> with any niche though yeah </joey>
<connor> i wanted a bike that was good for the </connor>
<joey> lazy man because mine had a thing so you </joey>
<joey> got you you got the apple of bikes </joey>
<connor> kinda i kind of got like the like yeah </connor>
<connor> like the full so i bought my bike purely </connor>
<joey> on the reason that </joey>
<joey> it had um the headlights and the rear </joey>
<joey> light like built into the bike right and </joey>
<joey> then you just charge this battery pack </joey>
<connor> on the the frame and then it's just </connor>
<connor> controlled by an app no you just turn </connor>
<connor> the lights on or if it gets dark they </connor>
<connor> automatically turn on </connor>
<connor> easy and i was like cool that sounds </connor>
<connor> good because i hate turning on these </connor>
<connor> lights i always forget to send them off </connor>
<connor> and i just i'm i understand that this is </connor>
<connor> such a lazy reason to get it but i just </connor>
<connor> wanted to do it turns out it became a </connor>
<connor> pain at one point because when i had no </connor>
<connor> internet i couldn't turn my lights on </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> there's no there's no way to turn them </connor>
<connor> and on really felt like that moment </connor>
<connor> where boomers are like </connor>
<connor> why do you why are you gonna put </connor>
<connor> technology and everything we did we we </connor>
<connor> had lights that work just fine without </connor>
<joey> these [ __ ] apps </joey>
<joey> why do you need smart </joey>
<connor> truly felt at balls point where it was </connor>
<garnt> like ah </garnt>
<garnt> this sucks this is so dumb why does that </garnt>
<garnt> why is there not a way for this this is </garnt>
<garnt> an oversight </garnt>
<connor> there's no way for me to turn it on </connor>
<garnt> without the app yeah this is [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> dumb yeah when when the when the </connor>
<connor> inevitable rogue ai you know </connor>
<connor> starts taking over humanity yeah we're </connor>
<connor> gonna look back at this point and be </connor>
<garnt> like why can't we turn on the lights </garnt>
<connor> without our [ __ ] smart tap so you're </connor>
<connor> gonna pay like 10 10 bezos bucks today </connor>
<garnt> play a subscription service yeah </garnt>
<connor> i did i i i oh my god so i bought this </connor>
<connor> bike so i said four thousand dollars but </connor>
<connor> i think it's normally four thousand </connor>
<joey> dollars i don't know what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> happened but yeah um i went to the store </joey>
<joey> and i because i already knew what bike i </joey>
<garnt> wanted </garnt>
<joey> and they had it in the store because i i </joey>
<garnt> i didn't understand how how you buy </garnt>
<garnt> bikes really i just thought although </garnt>
<garnt> i'll just have the bike in the store </garnt>
<garnt> yeah turns out like </garnt>
<garnt> like if the store's small they don't </garnt>
<garnt> have your bike they have to order it for </garnt>
<garnt> you which can take months yeah so i was </garnt>
<connor> like chris i was like you by the way you </connor>
<connor> can't just like wait you should go now </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so he waited like two weeks </connor>
<connor> before and couldn't get the same bike as </connor>
<joey> me but he wanted the same bike as me </joey>
<joey> right um so he couldn't get that one </joey>
<joey> because he </joey>
<joey> he the store he had didn't have it but </joey>
<joey> luckily i went to the store and they had </joey>
<connor> it i had it in like shining purple and i </connor>
<garnt> was like oh [ __ ] sick yeah trash </garnt>
<connor> tastes represent </connor>
<garnt> yeah got it </garnt>
<garnt> and um yeah it was really weird it was </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> um three thousand dollars and for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason the day that i went to the store </garnt>
<garnt> they had a campaign on was like yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> get </garnt>
<connor> uh ten percent off uh the bike just pick </connor>
<connor> any bike just because </connor>
<connor> and then i got extra money off because i </connor>
<connor> paid in cash and it ended up costing </connor>
<connor> like 2 500 bucks and i was like oh okay </connor>
<connor> okay cool not too bad then um i was like </connor>
<garnt> sweet i've got these apps and stuff is </garnt>
<garnt> that is that not too bad that's 500 off </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i paid for the insurance </garnt>
<garnt> it is an amazing bike it is it's a </garnt>
<connor> beautiful non-cyclist be like </connor>
<connor> carbon fiber a beautiful specimen i'm </connor>
<joey> like damn like and the first bike i </joey>
<joey> bought was like 150 dollars like that's </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] expensive </connor>
<connor> this bike it was god tier dude it was </connor>
<connor> like perfect yeah you do not need a good </connor>
<connor> badge of this i definitely like just </connor>
<connor> just because i had the money i just </connor>
<connor> splurged yeah that's purely like a you </connor>
<connor> do not need this kind of bike right um </connor>
<connor> so yeah and then i bought the bike and i </connor>
<connor> started sweating when i when i went to </connor>
<connor> the app store to download the app and i </connor>
<connor> saw the reviews and i had 2.1 stars and </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> it's not going to work </connor>
<connor> yeah and i've been trying to update my </connor>
<connor> sensor in the bike for like a month now </connor>
<connor> can't update it just doesn't work just </connor>
<connor> doesn't let me update it </connor>
<connor> can't update my bike the lights </connor>
<garnt> they turn on but they're so finicky </garnt>
<garnt> right it's so annoying i'm just like i </garnt>
<garnt> for [ __ ] sake why would they not just </garnt>
<garnt> put a button to turn it on </garnt>
<joey> like this isn't expensive </joey>
<joey> we're going real minimalistic with our </joey>
<connor> design an expensive bike and this the </connor>
<connor> lights are a pain in the [ __ ] ass to </connor>
<joey> turn on yeah they put all these like </joey>
<joey> bits and bobs on a bike but they were </joey>
<garnt> like switch for the light switch no no </garnt>
<connor> we don't need a switch i also like you </connor>
<connor> know i might the seat on the bike you </connor>
<connor> know i assume if i'm the super most </connor>
<connor> serious cyclist on earth it's great </connor>
<connor> it's just not comfortable it is tiny </connor>
<joey> it's tiny is there air is there does is </joey>
<joey> there any bike that actually has a </joey>
<connor> comfortable seat for road bikes </connor>
<joey> generally they're not yeah they're not </joey>
<joey> they're like really small and they're </joey>
<joey> meant to you know because </joey>
<joey> cyclists are like all right get used to </joey>
<connor> it that's kind of what it is you just </connor>
<connor> have to you literally just have to </connor>
<connor> destroy your ass yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and i was like can i change the seats we </connor>
<connor> you know i take the seat off and i'm </connor>
<connor> like oh </connor>
<joey> yeah the the rear headlight that is </joey>
<joey> hardwired to the bike cannot be removed </joey>
<joey> from this </joey>
<joey> seat so i have no choice but to use the </joey>
<joey> seat right that's how they rope you into </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> so i have to buy like this padded suit </joey>
<joey> but i really wanted this bike right </joey>
<joey> because it was perfect for what i wanted </joey>
<joey> it was like an endurance bike and the </joey>
<connor> wheels were a bit thicker than normal </connor>
<joey> road bikes and it was it was good god he </joey>
<garnt> did buy the apple of bikes he did </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] no accessories no customization </garnt>
<garnt> yeah everything is included yeah yeah i </garnt>
<connor> imagine like trying to fix this bike is </connor>
<connor> a pain </connor>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> like that particular comfortable you </joey>
<garnt> break the warranty you have to have like </garnt>
<connor> specialist equipment i </connor>
<joey> two year warranty cost me 600 [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dollars to for insurance and [ __ ] on </joey>
<joey> this bike </joey>
<joey> i had to </joey>
<connor> register with the police as you do in </connor>
<joey> japan oh yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because it's like it's like it's </joey>
<connor> considered a vehicle registration in </connor>
<connor> japan yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> yeah that's why getting rid of a bike as </connor>
<connor> well is [ __ ] pain in the air </connor>
<connor> i want to get rid of this you can't just </connor>
<connor> like yeah but if you if you were to for </connor>
<connor> whatever reason it's the biggest pain in </connor>
<connor> the ass i remember when i got rid of my </connor>
<garnt> bike it was like a whole like </garnt>
<garnt> like three week process just like call </garnt>
<garnt> them up and be like i want to get rid of </garnt>
<joey> this bike and then you have to do all </joey>
<joey> this paperwork to like unregister the </joey>
<joey> bike and then you have to get rid of the </joey>
<joey> bike which costs you know well luckily i </joey>
<joey> think this bike's nice enough where i </joey>
<joey> could probably just sell it oh yeah i </joey>
<joey> don't think i will i mean i love this </joey>
<joey> bike this bike's awesome yeah i really </joey>
<joey> want to </joey>
<connor> you know eventually cycle around like </connor>
<garnt> europe or something </garnt>
<garnt> well now that you've invested this much </garnt>
<garnt> money into it it would be a shame if you </garnt>
<connor> didn't use it again i mean i you know </connor>
<connor> i've been cycling to the before this i </connor>
<connor> was cycling to the studio a lot and i </connor>
<connor> loved it i think it's dude </connor>
<connor> after cycling on this bike it's like oh </connor>
<connor> this is like </connor>
<connor> how cycling is supposed to feel </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> cycling in the shin amikaido and cycling </joey>
<joey> right you're doing these uphills it </joey>
<joey> feels like the bike is just like not </joey>
<joey> doing anything yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> square wheels it's just like you pedal </connor>
<garnt> and it feels like nothing's happening </garnt>
<garnt> well that's that's why </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the times we just ended up </garnt>
<garnt> walking up the hills yeah because it </garnt>
<joey> felt like less effort you know i think i </joey>
<joey> was actually moving </joey>
<connor> faster because like the energy the </connor>
<connor> energy you're putting into each pedal </connor>
<connor> like wasn't translating is like yeah </connor>
<garnt> what you kind of wanted yeah whereas </garnt>
<connor> like with this bike like it was just </connor>
<connor> like every like rotation you put into it </connor>
<garnt> felt like it went </garnt>
<garnt> directly into pushing you because it's </garnt>
<garnt> such a nice bike and it's so good and it </garnt>
<connor> was crazy like up hills man i've never </connor>
<connor> had anything like that it felt like </connor>
<garnt> you're slowly walking up a hill right </garnt>
<garnt> because the on the lowest lowest gear it </garnt>
<connor> was basically like walking up a hill </connor>
<garnt> it's crazy it's such a good bike we're </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is now the connor cyclist </garnt>
<connor> arc we have now entered everyone </connor>
<connor> i just can't believe that i thought the </connor>
<garnt> shin namicato was hard like that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's like maybe maybe we just nerfed </garnt>
<garnt> ourselves we should do it again and then </garnt>
<connor> i'll just be like all right guys boys i </connor>
<connor> finished three hours </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> this bike is nutty i just it's i didn't </connor>
<connor> realize how </connor>
<garnt> good these road bikes obviously if </garnt>
<garnt> you're a better cyclist you'll you'll </garnt>
<connor> still like you know you'll be able to </connor>
<garnt> use it more of course like i never did </garnt>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> just because i couldn't be bothered um </connor>
<connor> because it was just pain in the ass you </connor>
<connor> know where you can go right on the </connor>
<connor> bottom handlebars and be more wind yes </connor>
<connor> resistant i never wanted to go that fast </connor>
<connor> and i know so it was horrible for the </connor>
<connor> camera angle yeah so i'll just be </connor>
<connor> pointing at the ground so i never ever </connor>
<connor> did that </connor>
<connor> um so i wasn't really using the bike for </connor>
<connor> it's like full potential if you will i'm </connor>
<connor> sure cyclists are like cringy potential </connor>
<garnt> you know what i mean because like it's </garnt>
<garnt> super saiyan body </garnt>
<joey> like the weather conditions bro i i </joey>
<garnt> thought rain was the worst turns out no </garnt>
<connor> wind is the worst all right wind wind is </connor>
<connor> number one can [ __ ] off when you're </connor>
<garnt> playing well that's literally why like </garnt>
<connor> professional cyclists in the olympics </connor>
<connor> they have like </connor>
<connor> they literally have a [ __ ] team you </connor>
<connor> know it's it's it's </connor>
<connor> uh the </connor>
<connor> wind is like </connor>
<connor> it can make downhills feel like flats if </connor>
<connor> it's strong enough </connor>
<connor> and it's crazy you'll be going on the </connor>
<connor> flat and you'll be you you'll have to </connor>
<connor> put the same amount of energy as going </connor>
<connor> up a hill just to keep going yeah </connor>
<connor> because the wind will be so crazy i it's </connor>
<joey> i just was like [ __ ] this like if if </joey>
<connor> this was this every day i would i </connor>
<connor> couldn't do it yeah </connor>
<connor> we got so lucky that one or two days </connor>
<connor> were perfect we had rain some days which </connor>
<connor> is miserable because your feet get like </connor>
<connor> trench foot yeah and you're just soaked </connor>
<garnt> it's just should have had someone just </garnt>
<garnt> like tank the wind for you like a like </garnt>
<connor> an olympics i was following chris a lot </connor>
<joey> of the time because </joey>
<connor> he he did a good job with that yeah he </connor>
<connor> did it because chris i don't know why </connor>
<connor> it was good i mean when there was like </connor>
<connor> certain days where i </connor>
<connor> felt like i could just keep cycling till </connor>
<connor> the end of time right we did like 120k </connor>
<connor> one day which is the longest day and at </connor>
<connor> the end of it i just felt like yeah i </connor>
<connor> could do another 50 another 60. i felt </connor>
<connor> totally like good to go nice i don't </connor>
<connor> know why some days you just feel it and </connor>
<connor> other days you're like holy [ __ ] 10k is </connor>
<garnt> so hard yeah um i don't know it's i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like that's true with exercise in </garnt>
<connor> general though you know yeah it sucks </connor>
<connor> because when you do something like this </connor>
<connor> those days where you would normally wake </connor>
<connor> up and be like no how how i would do </connor>
<connor> exercise today yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's not gonna happen because you you </connor>
<connor> know those days where you when you turn </connor>
<connor> to the gym and you just you just you're </connor>
<joey> just [ __ ] yes everything the walk to the </joey>
<garnt> gym you're just like oh you're you're </garnt>
<garnt> leaving you know you know this day is </garnt>
<connor> gonna suck yeah start running on the </connor>
<connor> treadmill after two minutes you're like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i can't yeah you you can't even do </connor>
<garnt> your like normal reps like everything's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it's just like that but like in </garnt>
<garnt> cycling form and you're like </garnt>
<connor> like i wouldn't even be tired but my </connor>
<connor> muscles like my leg muscles would be </connor>
<connor> just so [ __ ] that i just couldn't get </connor>
<connor> them to pedal the speed i wanted them to </connor>
<connor> go to right whereas other days it would </connor>
<connor> be just easy like i could just maintain </connor>
<connor> like a crazy pace all day don't know why </connor>
<connor> and yeah it was it was awesome like it </connor>
<connor> just kind of depended on a lot of </connor>
<connor> factors i don't know why like i i'm like </connor>
<connor> some days i would like like the day </connor>
<connor> after sapporo i had drank in sapporo so </connor>
<connor> much beer like i had like six or seven </connor>
<connor> pints of beer </connor>
<connor> because i was like i'm in sapporo baby i </connor>
<connor> gotta </connor>
<connor> and then that was like my best cycling </connor>
<garnt> day the day after i just i'd killed it </garnt>
<garnt> like i just i was on fire fueled by </garnt>
<garnt> sapporo class really clearly like either </garnt>
<garnt> like the the sapporo beer has got </garnt>
<joey> something in it right like i </joey>
<joey> i was a machine i drank every day </joey>
<joey> that's probably why you didn't </joey>
<joey> yeah probably i mean it's because every </joey>
<connor> day i had like two beers after it's all </connor>
<connor> right i don't have a beer </connor>
<joey> you want it </joey>
<connor> that was rough yeah that empowered me </connor>
<connor> yeah and yeah i was good but uh yeah i </connor>
<garnt> definitely recommend uh doing something </garnt>
<garnt> crazy congratulations you want to do it </garnt>
<garnt> you want to do it </garnt>
<connor> i don't know i mean i want to do </connor>
<connor> something crazy yeah i mean i think </connor>
<connor> we've </connor>
<joey> it's it's weird because this year has </joey>
<joey> just been a crazy crazy year just in </joey>
<joey> general we've already done some pretty </joey>
<connor> good crazy things it's not even [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> over yet i'm gonna do it next time you </joey>
<garnt> wanna i'll be down oh no like did you </garnt>
<joey> actually i would actually be down like </joey>
<garnt> six seven days yeah i guess because you </garnt>
<garnt> you've got you've got me to tell you all </garnt>
<connor> the everything they're doing yeah right </connor>
<garnt> i've done i've found out how to exactly </garnt>
<joey> everything exactly </joey>
<connor> yeah no but like i i mean you know if i </connor>
<connor> want to [ __ ] get because you know i </connor>
<connor> do want to get into shape um and so you </connor>
<connor> know why </connor>
<joey> would i you know what what better excuse </joey>
<joey> than to do for you know a charity or an </joey>
<connor> event i don't think it's a good way to </connor>
<connor> get like </connor>
<connor> super fit there's like way better ways </connor>
<connor> to do it yeah but you just want to get a </connor>
<connor> kick start yeah i think it's well like </connor>
<connor> you know it's just to say that you did </connor>
<connor> it as well oh yeah it's a cool [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> story to tell it's cool yeah but i feel </garnt>
<joey> like it's especially if you want to get </joey>
<connor> fit you know it's i'm sure like there's </connor>
<connor> so many better there are better ways of </connor>
<joey> course there are better ways to min max </joey>
<joey> it but at the end of the day if you're </joey>
<connor> not having fun or if you're not doing </connor>
<connor> this you don't have to know </connor>
<connor> the motivation there's going to be more </connor>
<connor> efficient ways to do it yes but if you </connor>
<connor> don't want to do it you're not going to </connor>
<connor> do it you know it's kind of it's kind of </connor>
<connor> like it's it's very similar to i guess </connor>
<connor> learning a language and everything like </connor>
<connor> that is like what i've realized is that </connor>
<joey> there is always a more efficient way to </joey>
<joey> learn japanese or learn another language </joey>
<joey> but at the end of the day the most </joey>
<joey> important thing is </joey>
<joey> having fun </joey>
<joey> no joke no jokes it [ __ ] is okay look </joey>
<joey> if like we've like clowned on duolingo </joey>
<joey> so much but if you if duolingo gets you </joey>
<joey> up and gets you doing a language </joey>
<joey> exercise every day that's way [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> better than other methods that are way </garnt>
<connor> more efficient absolutely um yeah i mean </connor>
<connor> sometimes the stars align right and yeah </connor>
<connor> everything just kind of works out yeah </connor>
<connor> and uh you </connor>
<joey> set a challenge </joey>
<joey> and it kind of just hits every box you </joey>
<joey> want yeah you know like for me it was </joey>
<connor> started out as me just wanted to do </connor>
<connor> something stupid yeah and then i was </connor>
<connor> like oh i get personal fitness i get to </connor>
<connor> make some content i get to cycle with my </connor>
<connor> friends and then i get to also raise </connor>
<connor> money for a great cause and yeah </connor>
<connor> hopefully i get to entertain a bunch of </connor>
<connor> people throughout it so i think you know </connor>
<connor> you sometimes you just </connor>
<connor> you know you're like this is gonna be </connor>
<connor> tough this is not gonna be easy and it's </connor>
<connor> gonna it's gonna be a nuisance to my </connor>
<connor> life because you know like i couldn't </connor>
<connor> really do much after the day was over </connor>
<connor> yeah people would text me but i would </connor>
<connor> just i couldn't [ __ ] reply i was just </connor>
<connor> so i was too tired i wouldn't look at my </connor>
<connor> phone yeah i literally ate </connor>
<connor> changed clothes showered put stuff on </connor>
<garnt> charge went to bed then woke up at six </garnt>
<connor> five a.m every day yeah it was tough and </connor>
<garnt> then today i had to wake up at 5am to </garnt>
<garnt> get the shinkansen from hakodate to get </garnt>
<connor> here to film the base </connor>
<connor> i literally finished it yesterday yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's crazy to think i was in </connor>
<garnt> hokkaido yesterday yeah and you just got </garnt>
<garnt> the shoe you wanted you're in the code </garnt>
<garnt> this morning yeah yeah yeah this morning </garnt>
<garnt> this morning oh man yeah it's it's uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like the number one tip to </garnt>
<joey> cycling long distances is just wake up </joey>
<joey> early but </joey>
<joey> i'm sure when chris comes on he'll tell </joey>
<joey> you all about it we had so many </joey>
<joey> arguments about what time to wake up </joey>
<connor> right we actually we like had on like </connor>
<joey> four years because yeah because chris is </joey>
<joey> like the number one like i hate waking </joey>
<connor> up in the morning post we had like a </connor>
<connor> shouting match at one point about this </connor>
<garnt> in like a restaurant we were we were </garnt>
<garnt> this is like five we are so stressed out </garnt>
<garnt> right because you're cycling all day </garnt>
<garnt> you're pissed off yeah and and i was </garnt>
<garnt> getting i was getting really pissed off </garnt>
<garnt> for chris was </garnt>
<garnt> under the bridge afterwards like but we </garnt>
<garnt> were like so pissed off what time did he </garnt>
<garnt> want to wake up </garnt>
<joey> he you know because he was arguing that </joey>
<joey> like uh if i wake up too early i'm i'm </joey>
<joey> you know i won't get enough sleep and i </joey>
<joey> won't be in condition to do anything and </joey>
<joey> i'm like </joey>
<joey> just get over it just like </joey>
<garnt> because just get good </garnt>
<garnt> just don't be tired don't be tired i'm </garnt>
<joey> sure you can talk about it </joey>
<connor> because we've done video shoots together </connor>
<connor> right yeah and sometimes you do shoots </connor>
<connor> with a lot of people yeah sometimes </connor>
<connor> for the for the the greater good of the </connor>
<garnt> shoot you just have to sacrifice things </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i think chris cause chris </garnt>
<garnt> normally controls everything on his </garnt>
<connor> videos yes he controls it so that he </connor>
<connor> doesn't have to wake up early right yeah </connor>
<connor> but for this it was like we're just not </connor>
<connor> gonna hit </connor>
<connor> the places because i i i was like </connor>
<joey> insistent on the fact that </joey>
<connor> i did not want to cycle in the dark yeah </connor>
<joey> i just thought that oh it looks like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] first it looks like [ __ ] and also </connor>
<connor> it's just unnecessarily adding like a </connor>
<connor> dangerous elements to it for no reason </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> yeah you have lights on your bike but </connor>
<connor> you can't see stuff as well you can't </connor>
<garnt> see the the rocks and the roads these </garnt>
<garnt> roads are [ __ ] yeah you can't see the </garnt>
<connor> potholes you can't see the cut the cars </connor>
<connor> can't see you as well like i just i just </connor>
<connor> thought that it's you're just adding </connor>
<connor> unnecessary danger for no reason yeah </connor>
<connor> and we could just wake up an hour early </connor>
<connor> yeah you know because originally we're </connor>
<connor> waking up at like we were starting at </connor>
<joey> like 9 30. and i just thought that's way </joey>
<joey> too late yeah that's surprisingly late </joey>
<connor> and so we eventually got it down to like </connor>
<connor> 8 8 30 after arguing a bunch and like ah </connor>
<connor> because i was on the other crazy </connor>
<connor> spectrum where i was like listen if i </connor>
<connor> have to get six hours of sleep five </connor>
<connor> hours of sleep for a week of my life so </connor>
<connor> be it like it's it's it's a week of my </connor>
<connor> life i'll get over it i'll recover i'll </connor>
<connor> just sleep extra yeah like obviously </connor>
<joey> it's not ideal but you just make </joey>
<joey> sacrifices to make stuff happen yes </joey>
<joey> uh but christian's like this </joey>
<joey> content yeah but you know it was i i </joey>
<connor> understand where he's coming from i know </connor>
<joey> you know i'm younger and i can it's way </joey>
<joey> easier for me to i mean you're not that </joey>
<connor> much young </connor>
<connor> i don't know like </connor>
<connor> six years younger i don't know like for </connor>
<connor> me i waking up and losing a bit of like </connor>
<connor> for me five hours of sleep that's not a </connor>
<garnt> big issue if it's like it's a big issue </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm i'm saying if if okay if we were </garnt>
<connor> doing this and i was like gone you have </connor>
<connor> to get five hours of sleep and we're </connor>
<connor> doing it you wouldn't be happy about it </connor>
<garnt> but you'd probably be like all right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah okay so like i think the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between being 30 is that you just know </garnt>
<connor> what your body is capable of right you </connor>
<joey> know you know some days where you think </joey>
<garnt> okay okay okay so yeah i'd say like i </garnt>
<connor> understood where he's coming from i </connor>
<joey> wasn't trying to be a dick about it i'm </joey>
<joey> not even 30 and i can already feel that </joey>
<joey> no that's that's because you're almost </joey>
<connor> 30 joey that's almost </connor>
<joey> that's i think that's the big tester </joey>
<joey> where you've limit tested your body </joey>
<joey> enough to know what the limits are right </joey>
<joey> so i can do like five hours of sleep </joey>
<garnt> yeah and six thousand sleep but i know i </garnt>
<garnt> know if i do five to six hours of sleep </garnt>
<garnt> i'm gonna have a write-off day it's </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's yes </garnt>
<garnt> it's law of equal exchange i'm going </garnt>
<garnt> like the price is going to catch up to </garnt>
<joey> your body yeah and if i have a five hour </joey>
<garnt> night the next night is a 12 hour yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah exactly exactly i understand that i </connor>
<connor> that sleep was definitely a necessity </connor>
<connor> yeah um </connor>
<connor> my solution was just go to bed earlier </connor>
<garnt> because chris was going to bed like </garnt>
<connor> midnight i was going to bed like 10. </connor>
<garnt> yeah because i think chris got really </garnt>
<connor> unlucky a bunch of stuff i mean he'll </connor>
<connor> talk about it a bunch of stuff piled on </connor>
<connor> yeah emails and important things he had </connor>
<connor> to do so he wasn't sleeping properly </connor>
<connor> which is also like </connor>
<connor> you know it was i i just told everyone </connor>
<connor> i'm like don't don't bother don't you </connor>
<connor> don't talk to me i'm not going to reply </connor>
<connor> to anyone yes because i'm just like i </connor>
<garnt> just i just don't want to worry about </garnt>
<connor> anything i just want to turn off i told </connor>
<connor> the agency i was like hey </connor>
<connor> just you can you can ask me do it do </connor>
<joey> what you want but i'm not gonna i'm not </joey>
<joey> gonna reply unless it's like gigger </joey>
<joey> urgent yeah um so yeah i went to bed </joey>
<connor> every night like ten so waking up at six </connor>
<joey> is like oh that's nothing yeah that's </joey>
<connor> plenty yeah my mindset was we just go to </connor>
<garnt> bed </garnt>
<garnt> eight hours of sleep yeah because a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of the times we all said bye and we're </garnt>
<connor> like we would all have dinner and talk a </connor>
<connor> bit then we'd all go to bed like we'd </connor>
<joey> all head off at nine yeah so i was like </joey>
<garnt> just go to bed you know yeah easy worst </garnt>
<joey> case you don't get seven hours of sleep </joey>
<joey> which is fine seven hours of sleep is </joey>
<joey> also in the recommended amount that's </joey>
<joey> still pretty good you know yeah um so </joey>
<connor> that's what i always think but then </connor>
<connor> obviously you know </connor>
<garnt> everyone sleeps different as well yeah </garnt>
<garnt> is it um is that an old man thing now to </garnt>
<connor> really value your sleep i value my sleep </connor>
<connor> don't get me wrong i i normally i i am </connor>
<connor> hard on the seven eight hours necessary </connor>
<connor> yeah but i i when it comes to like a an </connor>
<connor> outdoor shoot where we've all traveled </connor>
<connor> and a lot of people and money and time </connor>
<connor> has invested i'm completely of the </connor>
<connor> mindset of like </connor>
<connor> if i get two hours i get two hours </connor>
<garnt> that's what it is no because like i've i </garnt>
<garnt> remember actually for for the drifting </garnt>
<garnt> special yeah yeah actually was no sleep </garnt>
<connor> for that like the road trip we got like </connor>
<garnt> no sleep yeah </garnt>
<joey> the road trip was like five years </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> i stayed in the hotel that we stayed in </connor>
<connor> in hakodate right i remember i was like </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah the last time i was here </garnt>
<garnt> we literally were there for four hours </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah we booked a hotel room just to </garnt>
<connor> sleep for four hours we got to that </connor>
<garnt> hotel at i think it was like 12 00 a.m </garnt>
<garnt> no it was like one or two a.m </garnt>
<joey> and then we had to wake up at i think </joey>
<joey> six inches yeah yeah yeah yeah we </joey>
<connor> literally booked a hotel yeah for just </connor>
<joey> like four hours yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah we just did that because there was </connor>
<connor> a video shoot and we understood that </connor>
<connor> like to make these things happen we had </connor>
<connor> to sacrifice sleep exactly obviously </connor>
<joey> it's a different i understand it's </joey>
<joey> completely different when you when it </joey>
<joey> comes to the fact that i'm like okay </joey>
<connor> sacrifice sleep now exercise for eight </connor>
<joey> hours yes yes that's so i i </joey>
<connor> i i was content we were all content yeah </connor>
<connor> it was we were both tired it's been five </connor>
<connor> days cycling we were pissed off but it </connor>
<connor> was you know we we understood that like </connor>
<joey> immediately after you're like that's 400 </joey>
<garnt> bridges yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> me and chris piss each other off all the </joey>
<joey> time </joey>
<joey> chris is just like eighty percent of </joey>
<joey> chris is just angry at all times anyway </joey>
<connor> well you know uh well not angry </connor>
<garnt> of shoots yes i was like this is both of </garnt>
<connor> our shoots so </connor>
<connor> you can't just be like this is what </connor>
<connor> we're doing yeah i'm like no i'm pushing </connor>
<connor> back hard on it </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna be the i'm gonna be the one </connor>
<connor> who pushes back </connor>
<connor> uh you know because i </connor>
<connor> we we were slowly getting later and </connor>
<joey> later and i was like if we start at 10 </joey>
<joey> we're [ __ ] yeah we're not gonna make </joey>
<garnt> it because also okay so to to preface </garnt>
<garnt> how all this works it was eight days and </garnt>
<garnt> it was like 95 kilometers 90 85 85. and </garnt>
<garnt> we were just about finishing before </garnt>
<joey> sunset when we were doing 95 and 80. um </joey>
<joey> because we were we were slow we were </joey>
<joey> taking our time we were stopping for </joey>
<joey> lunch and we're doing stuff like that </joey>
<joey> and um originally the last day was gonna </joey>
<connor> be 160. </connor>
<joey> damn and as we were getting closer to </joey>
<connor> that day this is when i was like dude </connor>
<connor> we're gonna have to wake up at like 4 </connor>
<connor> a.m yeah and like i'm i just it's one </connor>
<connor> day i'm chill to do it and we were like </connor>
<connor> having arguments and stuff about it </connor>
<connor> because i'm not waking up before i am </connor>
<connor> because yeah i'm not gonna be able to do </connor>
<connor> it i was like alright fine so we </connor>
<connor> eventually came to the conclusion that </connor>
<connor> we had to like </connor>
<connor> somehow spread out the distance in the </connor>
<connor> remaining days so instead of doing like </connor>
<garnt> 80 100 160 we did 120 110 110 right um </garnt>
<garnt> and that was tough because then that </garnt>
<garnt> turned what was going to be two normal </garnt>
<garnt> days and a really hard day into like </garnt>
<joey> just three hard days right right um </joey>
<garnt> which was tough that was tough </garnt>
<joey> it's hard that was tough </joey>
<connor> that was hard but you know you get used </connor>
<connor> to it i don't know it's hard but it was </connor>
<connor> really fun you sound like you know you </connor>
<connor> know when like marines go through their </connor>
<connor> like their training where they like run </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like 100 kilometers or something </connor>
<connor> a day i think you're just like you know </connor>
<garnt> you just got to learn to push past </garnt>
<joey> yourself </joey>
<joey> it's weird it's like yeah when they're </joey>
<garnt> like it was tough i'm like </garnt>
<joey> it's not the word you would describe you </joey>
<garnt> subscribe </garnt>
<joey> it's weird how quickly your body can </joey>
<connor> adapt to things oh of course i mean you </connor>
<connor> if you have like you you know like </connor>
<garnt> we had like hard deadlines right like </garnt>
<connor> you had to do this distance in the day </connor>
<garnt> yeah so it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta do it i mean your body and </garnt>
<garnt> your mind is just incredibly flexible to </garnt>
<garnt> a point yeah yeah you know you're </garnt>
<garnt> capable of way more than you think you </garnt>
<joey> are oh yeah well i mean i mean like </joey>
<joey> remember like the the crazy schedule </joey>
<connor> that we had for like la miami and then </connor>
<connor> australia in the span of like a week and </connor>
<connor> a half like when we were looking at that </connor>
<connor> before it was happening we were like </connor>
<connor> there's no [ __ ] where we're gonna be </connor>
<connor> but by the end of it we were like okay </connor>
<joey> yeah that was tough but </joey>
<connor> i mean we still did it </connor>
<connor> anything can be handled i never met prep </connor>
<connor> literally it's just all prep if you just </connor>
<connor> prep properly for this this kind of </connor>
<connor> stuff it's so easy yeah yeah definitely </connor>
<connor> you know and it's really amazing how um </connor>
<connor> fast and how many days your body will </connor>
<garnt> kind of like even like by day four like </garnt>
<connor> i said like hills became way easier like </connor>
<garnt> i had not had any really really tough </garnt>
<garnt> hills before i've been doing a lot of it </garnt>
<connor> on on tokyo which is really flat tokyo </connor>
<connor> doesn't have that many hills um and also </connor>
<connor> like the exercise bike you can put the </connor>
<connor> resistance up but it's not the same yes </connor>
<connor> the resistance the resistance cannot </connor>
<connor> mimic going up a hill no it's just </connor>
<connor> totally different because you don't feel </connor>
<connor> like you're going to fall off </connor>
<connor> you never feel like you're going to fall </connor>
<connor> off the resistance right it's just going </connor>
<garnt> to push back whereas the hill it's like </garnt>
<connor> if you don't like cycle properly you </connor>
<connor> just fall off your bike yeah um and you </connor>
<connor> you know changing gear it's a whole </connor>
<connor> thing and uh you know it's it's </connor>
<connor> impressive how even after like three </connor>
<garnt> days it becomes so much easier if you </garnt>
<connor> just keep going yeah um and you get like </connor>
<connor> rapid improvement if you do it every day </connor>
<connor> yeah kind of i guess like learning </connor>
<connor> like language right like anything like </connor>
<joey> anything like if you wanted to get your </joey>
<joey> muscles to be like to actually get like </joey>
<connor> healthy and grow the muscles properly </connor>
<connor> then you take rest days yeah and i was </connor>
<connor> definitely not eating enough protein i </connor>
<connor> just don't know how i could eat that </connor>
<connor> much protein </connor>
<garnt> liquid protein i truly who needs protein </garnt>
<connor> when you've got carbs i've tried to eat </connor>
<connor> protein but it's hard enough to eat like </connor>
<connor> calories let alone like yeah the protein </connor>
<joey> i should have taken protein powder with </joey>
<garnt> me or something yeah but i just i just </garnt>
<joey> couldn't just snort probably so much </joey>
<connor> there's always so much stuff yeah yeah i </connor>
<garnt> should have liked </garnt>
<garnt> all </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's just like you you put on all </connor>
<joey> of that and then you've got to worry </joey>
<joey> about the stream yeah and it's just like </joey>
<joey> another added layer of like [ __ ] yeah so </joey>
<joey> you're like mentally tied you're </joey>
<connor> physically tired yeah </connor>
<garnt> man yeah well congratulations for </garnt>

<connor> benches </connor>
<connor> one more one more one more you got this </connor>

<connor> of doing like some kayaking stream i </connor>
<connor> really want to do a kayaking show for </connor>
<joey> kayaking yeah i just but </joey>
<connor> do you know what's the one thing though </connor>
<connor> that you really have to be careful of </connor>
<joey> the kayaking stream if you fall off the </joey>
<joey> kayak oh yeah yeah it's ripperone's yeah </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah your stream is [ __ ] yeah at </joey>
<joey> least with alice at least you're on land </joey>
<connor> on a bicycle there </connor>
<connor> there like i i was thinking about how </connor>
<joey> you could maybe have so like i had to </joey>
<joey> because obviously when it was raining </joey>
<joey> yeah i had to kind of have something </joey>
<joey> waterproof yeah uh it was like it worked </joey>
<joey> but obviously it won't work if you </joey>
<joey> submerge it yeah it's splash proof but i </joey>
<connor> i know that some people make these </connor>
<connor> plastic housings for the stuff i </connor>
<connor> wondered if you could make it kind of </connor>
<joey> well i mean there's those like plastic </joey>
<joey> housings for like uh big cameras you </joey>
<connor> know underwater </connor>
<joey> come out of it kind of somehow exactly </joey>
<joey> yeah so that would have to be the whole </joey>
<connor> thing basically </connor>
<connor> as well yeah but the wire length would </connor>
<garnt> have that that seems like a technique a </garnt>
<connor> lot of challenges but uh yeah you </connor>
<garnt> probably need to be 3d printed or some </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] like that probably probably but it </connor>
<connor> could be i would want to do a kayaking </connor>
<connor> stream kind of like maybe the same deal </connor>
<connor> you do that distance i think you're </connor>
<connor> pretty hype sure just kayaking all day </connor>
<connor> yeah same the honest thing is that it </connor>
<connor> would be super [ __ ] boring kayaking </connor>
<connor> if you unless you had like a really sick </connor>
<connor> lake </connor>
<joey> you would need to have like a really </joey>
<connor> interesting route yeah i feel like yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah but dude kayaking i think he's </joey>
<joey> fun as [ __ ] though it's awesome but i </joey>
<joey> know that like your feet get [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> after a while because you're just being </garnt>
<garnt> like in the wet kayaking after a while </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah also just yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah maybe like a day thing i could do </connor>
<connor> it uh it could be pretty high i i kind </connor>
<connor> of want to figure out how to do it um um </connor>
<connor> maybe someday i'll figure out yeah i try </connor>
<connor> to do more interesting irl stuff like i </connor>
<connor> had a </connor>
<connor> i had a a theory that you could set it </connor>
<connor> up this way and i never ended up doing </connor>
<connor> it just because i was so tired every day </connor>
<connor> i had so the way that the backpack works </connor>
<connor> you can put like a mic into the back of </connor>
<connor> the camera </connor>
<connor> and you put a lap mic so i had this big </connor>
<connor> brain idea i was like wait </connor>
<connor> my cable's long enough where if you put </connor>
<connor> the bag in the back of the car and then </connor>
<connor> put a suction cup on the back of the car </connor>
<connor> with a camera mount you could feed the </connor>
<garnt> camera that's in the bags in the car you </garnt>
<connor> could feed the camera with the wire onto </connor>
<garnt> the suction cup behind you you're you're </garnt>
<connor> wearing a lav mic and then you could be </connor>
<connor> have the car trail you </connor>
<joey> really oh </joey>
<joey> like a third person camera and then you </joey>
<connor> could have literally like a like a third </connor>
<joey> person view of you with the mic on you </joey>
<joey> and it would be streaming how sick would </joey>
<joey> that look </joey>
<connor> i thought man that would be so cool to </connor>
<joey> do that'd be like that'd be like if you </joey>
<joey> had your regular streaming setup but it </joey>
<joey> was moving yeah kind of yeah it's </joey>
<connor> literally like marching like the problem </connor>
<connor> is that like you'd have to do it in a </connor>
<connor> place like if we would have done it we </connor>
<connor> would have done it on the first few days </connor>
<connor> you'd need like a road that was empty </connor>
<connor> yeah to try it well so i actually want </connor>
<connor> to [ __ ] around and set it all up it was </connor>
<connor> such a big hassle yeah maybe if i </connor>
<joey> prepared more i could have done it but </joey>
<connor> it was a lot of crap but i thought it'd </connor>
<connor> be a sick idea </connor>
<connor> or you've got something for next time </connor>
<connor> yeah i could try it next time if i have </connor>
<joey> more time if we have like a day where we </joey>
<connor> don't have as much going on yeah but </connor>
<joey> like a lot of the time google maps </joey>
<joey> wouldn't send you down the right route </joey>
<joey> yeah probably not google that's so </joey>
<connor> annoying that just didn't well like </connor>
<garnt> okay so here's the thing google maps </garnt>
<garnt> works perfectly i find in the city but </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a country that might not be as </garnt>
<garnt> well developed or go to an area that is </garnt>
<garnt> you know not as you know a bit more </garnt>
<garnt> rural you know out and out of the city </garnt>
<garnt> and google maps does not work as </garnt>
<connor> efficiently as you think it does at all </connor>
<connor> it would just like especially when you </connor>
<connor> fix the cycling option yeah it would </connor>
<connor> just like tell you to get off the </connor>
<connor> highway not however like just a main </connor>
<connor> road yeah for like one minute to go via </connor>
<connor> like a round in a field and then join </connor>
<connor> back and it's like why for one minute </connor>
<connor> it's like why would you why would you </connor>
<connor> think i'd want to do that i'll just stay </connor>
<joey> because google's like we know you want </joey>
<joey> the scenic route because it generally </joey>
<joey> wants you not to be on a main road which </joey>
<joey> is good because sometimes it took us </joey>
<joey> down some really cool </joey>
<joey> routes yeah because we trusted it but </joey>
<connor> other times it would take us down a road </connor>
<connor> maybe just gravel and we couldn't cycle </connor>
<garnt> on it right because the bikes the roads </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i remember i encountered this </garnt>
<connor> problem a lot in uh thailand yeah oh god </connor>
<connor> yes because </connor>
<connor> because what what what i would do is you </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<garnt> google maps you know works in thailand </garnt>
<garnt> but what counts as a road on google maps </garnt>
<garnt> google maps can't tell you the quality </garnt>
<connor> of the roads </connor>
<connor> google maps use like open maps and open </connor>
<connor> maps is from like i don't know like </connor>
<garnt> government i don't know yeah i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know because like what happens is uh we </garnt>
<connor> we'd like when i was living in thailand </connor>
<connor> me and city would like have a </connor>
<connor> destination sometimes it would be like </connor>
<connor> an hour away or something like a </connor>
<connor> different town and goo and we'd be on </connor>
<connor> like the highway with signs telling us </connor>
<connor> to lead to this town or the city that we </connor>
<connor> wanted to go to and google was like no </connor>
<connor> take take the exit off here and one time </connor>
<connor> we're like okay why is it telling us to </connor>
<connor> take the exit off maybe there's maybe </connor>
<connor> there's a shortcut we don't know about </connor>
<connor> and then so we went from this very </connor>
<connor> well-lit road we take one exit off and </connor>
<connor> google leads us to it's it's </connor>
<connor> the definition of a road was pushed to </connor>
<connor> the limits okay what it led to was </connor>
<connor> not even like concrete it was just dirt </connor>
<connor> leading into a dark forest </connor>
<connor> and there wasn't we couldn't even go </connor>
<connor> back right because time in the country </connor>
<connor> yeah first time yeah because it was like </connor>
<connor> it was like it was on a mountain right </connor>
<connor> it was on a mountain so we couldn't even </connor>
<connor> you turn back so we we were forced to </connor>
<connor> like go into like this pitch black </connor>
<joey> forest and i was like i'm gonna get </joey>
<joey> murdered this is this is literally the </joey>
<joey> start of every horror movie i've seen in </joey>
<joey> my life you know you you follow google </joey>
<joey> maps you're like oh okay what's this uh </joey>
<joey> going a bit to the country this is where </joey>
<garnt> the serial killers live man this is like </garnt>
<joey> texas chainsaw massacre all over again </joey>
<joey> we had that though uh yesterday when me </joey>
<joey> and nabi went we were in shizuoka </joey>
<connor> yesterday for a shoot and like we were </connor>
<connor> trying to go to this like you know </connor>
<connor> because like for the most part it's like </connor>
<connor> country sign shizuoka yeah and we're </connor>
<connor> like i want like a really like nice spot </connor>
<connor> to like shoot this part of the video </connor>
<connor> and so we were like alright we'll put it </connor>
<connor> in google maps and then i was like okay </connor>
<connor> go down this road and i was like okay </connor>
<connor> that's fine we get to it </connor>
<joey> first of all it's a one-way road in </joey>
<joey> between two houses </joey>
<joey> barely can fit the car that we have </joey>
<joey> and it's not even the right way </joey>
<joey> and the google maps is like do it </joey>
<joey> go there is no other way to go down to </joey>
<connor> your destination go down this road right </connor>
<connor> now and we had no choice because there </connor>
<garnt> was like cars backed up yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> literally no other road to get through </connor>
<garnt> this part i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> why are we going down so what you want </garnt>
<connor> us to like break traffic laws to get to </connor>
<connor> our destination thanks google </connor>
<connor> it's so annoying it's so annoying and </connor>
<connor> it's like and when you try and be like </connor>
<joey> okay we can't go down this road can you </joey>
<joey> try something else they're like okay how </joey>
<joey> about you go around the block once </joey>
<joey> and try it again </joey>
<garnt> i was like no girl </garnt>
<connor> i don't want to go down this road i </connor>
<garnt> think for all the information they take </garnt>
<connor> from us to yeah maps accurate they at </connor>
<connor> least do a [ __ ] good job </connor>
<garnt> like it's like well it's because not </garnt>
<garnt> enough people are living there further </garnt>
<connor> yeah there's no information to take </connor>
<garnt> you know for the the comfort of having a </garnt>
<garnt> map that could tell me where to go i'd </garnt>
<garnt> like to think that you know you taking </garnt>
<connor> everything about me and using that </connor>
<connor> information to serve ads to me least you </connor>
<joey> know at least i got a good map out of it </joey>
<joey> like google's that one mate that's like </joey>
<connor> sitting in the passenger seat being like </connor>
<garnt> yeah don't worry about it </garnt>
<connor> don't worry about it it's the quickest </connor>
<garnt> way to go it's like are you sure yeah </garnt>

<joey> just the cycling so much i guess i just </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] all i did was that for eight </connor>
<joey> days yeah that's all i could think about </joey>
<connor> i'm just i'm just trying to think like </connor>
<joey> what i did during those eight days it </joey>
<connor> just seems like oh we went to the </connor>
<connor> cigarettes concert </connor>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] we did that was last week what </garnt>
<connor> the [ __ ] oh what concert </connor>
<joey> we went to so garten and i went to uh a </joey>
<joey> concert of a band that we both really </joey>
<joey> like siguros </joey>
<garnt> you might know one of them okay what was </garnt>
<joey> that one song that was like really big </joey>
<garnt> in like british tv that you told me </garnt>
<garnt> about this hobby potluck oh that was </garnt>
<garnt> awesome yeah yeah i think apparently i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know this because god told me </garnt>
<connor> there's like one secret song that got </connor>
<garnt> really [ __ ] massive because japanese </garnt>
<joey> friend no no no no icelandic bands oh </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's a nice landing how does </garnt>
<garnt> that song go again uh hoppy paul yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's this is the problem with </garnt>
<garnt> cigarette songs all the song titles are </garnt>
<connor> in icelandic so if you don't know </connor>
<joey> the name of the song you're just like </joey>
<garnt> what was that one song the one that's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like are you singing the </garnt>
<garnt> halo theme oh oh no it's like a beta </garnt>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] amazing like probably one </connor>
<joey> of the best concerts i've been to in my </joey>
<garnt> life yeah yeah i think it was the best </garnt>
<garnt> concert i i went to in my life i mean it </garnt>
<garnt> was there are some i think bands that </garnt>
<connor> work better in a live setting and i </connor>
<connor> think sega ross is one of those bands </connor>
<connor> that i've experienced them now live and </connor>
<connor> i can't imagine experiencing them </connor>
<connor> anything but live yeah you know </connor>
<garnt> absolutely because it's kind of like </garnt>
<joey> they have such a very </joey>
<garnt> of unique style right because it's not </garnt>
<joey> like it's not like your typical kind of </joey>
<joey> songs kind of like rocky songs it's very </joey>
<garnt> i don't how would you describe it joe </garnt>
<garnt> you're the music guy i'm having trouble </garnt>
<joey> finding words like i've i've always said </joey>
<joey> said to say uh like to people that like </joey>
<joey> cigarettes music is kind of like </joey>
<joey> it's like advanced </joey>
<connor> church hymns </connor>
<connor> do you know what i mean </connor>
<joey> it's like because it's like it's the </joey>
<joey> feeling of like when you listen to a </joey>
<joey> church him right yeah you don't have to </joey>
<garnt> be religious in any way but the sound </garnt>
<garnt> and the style of a church him is like oh </garnt>
<garnt> this is like i can understand why they </garnt>
<garnt> play this kind of music in churches </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like it's very </garnt>
<garnt> transcendental it's very like yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> religious you know but like it's very </connor>
<garnt> like pure and like transcendental and </garnt>
<connor> very like it gives you that feeling of </connor>
<connor> like oh you know this is very spiritual </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> and cigarettes is like that but like </joey>
<joey> the alpha version of it yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> basically </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> i don't i don't really know how to </garnt>
<garnt> describe their songs i can just describe </garnt>
<joey> what it means to me and it's every time </joey>
<joey> i hear a sega ross song it just like it </joey>
<joey> makes me emotional it makes me feel </joey>
<joey> things that i can't explain going to </joey>
<joey> going to the going to this concert and </joey>
<joey> hearing their songs i was processing the </joey>
<garnt> experience for like a full like for the </garnt>
<garnt> entire night after that you know you </garnt>
<garnt> know what i mean yeah i get that i get </garnt>
<connor> that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> the live show's so good yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> what did i just watch yeah i remember </joey>
<joey> turning to joey and being like i'm still </joey>
<garnt> like processing what we what we just did </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> like i didn't even know how to do it it </joey>
<joey> was definitely like it wasn't the kind </joey>
<joey> of like shows where you're like in a </joey>
<joey> mosh pit and you're like freaking out </joey>
<joey> and then afterwards you're like damn </joey>
<connor> that was [ __ ] awesome that was so </connor>
<connor> hype hell yeah it was more like the ones </connor>
<connor> where you just like you're sitting down </connor>
<connor> quietly after every song finishes you're </connor>
<connor> clapping and then the next one kicks in </connor>
<connor> and you're just like engrossed it's like </connor>
<connor> a full body experience and like with </connor>
<connor> some of their songs like oh my god like </connor>
<connor> those like speakers that they had at in </connor>
<connor> this hall they were working overtime bro </connor>
<connor> like you could feel this yeah just </connor>
<connor> pulsating through your body and you're </connor>
<connor> just sitting there like a 4d movie just </connor>
<garnt> like yeah like just taking it all in </garnt>
<joey> because you don't know what else to do </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's crazy oh my god it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> so amazing i mean like could have been </garnt>
<garnt> like indoctrinated or something because </garnt>
<garnt> that was just like how absorbed i was </garnt>
<connor> into this experience you know it was </connor>
<connor> just one of the most it was the most </connor>
<connor> incredible concert i've ever been to i i </connor>
<connor> still i'm processing it to this day yeah </connor>
<connor> i do not know how to describe beeps and </connor>
<garnt> boops it was very nice </garnt>
<connor> you know it's lightning in the bottle </connor>
<joey> man you can't explain that no it was </joey>
<connor> just i get it i get it </connor>
<joey> you it's it's impossible to explain how </joey>
<joey> a gig makes you feel yeah yeah i i made </joey>
<joey> like a second channel video like trying </joey>
<joey> to process it but like even then it was </joey>
<joey> just kind of like </joey>
<joey> yeah the entire time i'm just like it's </joey>
<joey> so hard to describe without you being </joey>
<joey> there to experience it because there was </joey>
<connor> one part i think one of the most </connor>
<connor> powerful parts in this like oh i think </connor>
<connor> it was like what two and a half hour gig </connor>
<joey> or something it was it was quite a long </joey>
<connor> like three hours almost three hour game </connor>
<connor> what made you want to make a video about </connor>
<joey> it if you couldn't really explain it </joey>
<joey> because i i don't know so like one of i </joey>
<joey> think the most amazing parts about </joey>
<connor> cigarettes music is that like it they </connor>
<connor> utilize silence silence to their </connor>
<connor> advantage </connor>
<connor> to like create this like tension in </connor>
<connor> their music so there was one part in the </connor>
<connor> in the concert where </connor>
<connor> in the middle of the song </connor>
<joey> they just stopped playing </joey>
<joey> and they were just standing there in </joey>
<joey> silence for about 30 to 40 seconds </joey>
<connor> but the thing is like a little fart in </connor>
<joey> the background no no dude i've never </joey>
<garnt> heard that was probably what like it was </garnt>
<garnt> full capacity right and this place can </garnt>
<garnt> hold about eight thousand eight thousand </garnt>
<garnt> people big hole right in order and i've </garnt>
<connor> never heard 8 000 people being that </connor>
<connor> silent in my life there was not a single </connor>
<connor> person talking or making noise during </connor>
<joey> this like 30 40 seconds of silence and </joey>
<garnt> it was the most intense moment i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like it was longer than 30 40 40 seconds </garnt>
<connor> right because you you had i think i feel </connor>
<connor> like everyone had the same kind of </connor>
<connor> experience where they stopped the song </connor>
<connor> and you're just like okay must be moving </connor>
<connor> on to the next one yeah and then you </connor>
<connor> know when someone holds a silence for a </connor>
<connor> bit too long it starts to become </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable so they held it past the </connor>
<connor> point of uncomfort that you you </connor>
<connor> discovered that it became it went from </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable silence to comfortable </connor>
<connor> silence it was such a [ __ ] surreal </connor>
<connor> experience it was if i had to put into </connor>
<connor> words it was the loudest silence i'd </connor>
<garnt> ever heard in my life yeah right i'm </garnt>
<connor> just like that's that's the best way i </connor>
<joey> can describe this because it was one of </joey>
<connor> those moments where you just like kind </connor>
<connor> of forget to breathe and then once the </connor>
<connor> music kicks in you're like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> that's right now i know where i was sick </connor>
<connor> and and and it's so cool as well because </connor>
<connor> they utilize these like lights in such </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> cool ways so like during this silence </garnt>
<garnt> there's just this like kind of yellow </garnt>
<connor> light that's just like pulsating </connor>
<garnt> just silently </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just going on and on and on </garnt>
<connor> they're not moving at all not a single </connor>
<connor> note and everyone's just sitting there </connor>
<connor> just like waiting </connor>
<connor> and it was the it was the weirdest </connor>
<connor> feeling it was so cool i've never seen </connor>
<garnt> any band do that in a live setting and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like the the balls to be able </garnt>
<garnt> to do that and everyone just immediately </garnt>
<garnt> know exactly what's happening being like </garnt>
<joey> this wasn't like a mistake or anything </joey>
<connor> this was just part of the show yeah so </connor>
<connor> definitely ten out of ten would go again </connor>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] you uh hell yeah ten ten hour </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] ten out of ten yeah easily and </joey>
<joey> i've been to like a lot of really </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] cool concerts but like just this </connor>
<connor> one was like </connor>
<connor> it was more like watching a stage show </connor>
<connor> if anything it wasn't like going to go </connor>
<connor> see a band it was like if you it was </connor>
<joey> like kind of what you feel after you've </joey>
<connor> seen like a life-changing movie mm-hmm </connor>
<connor> what what's a life-changing movie for </connor>
<joey> you well i don't know like batman yeah </joey>
<connor> being like god they're boring </connor>
<connor> can never look at batman the same ever </connor>
<connor> again </connor>
<connor> but like you know you know there's those </connor>
<connor> movies that just kind of like on a </connor>
<connor> personal note that just like viscerally </connor>
<connor> hit you to the point where </connor>
<connor> after that </connor>
<connor> your your standard of movies just change </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you know so if like for me for </connor>
<connor> example like the first i remember like </connor>
<connor> the first time i watched like pulp </connor>
<connor> fiction you know like before that i was </connor>
<connor> like oh you know movies are cool and </connor>
<connor> everything and then afterwards there's </connor>
<connor> just like there's one of those movies </connor>
<connor> where you just watch it and you're like </connor>
<connor> how do you go up from there </connor>
<connor> you know and i and everyone has you know </connor>
<connor> a movie or you know maybe some people </connor>
<garnt> haven't discovered that movie but like i </garnt>
<garnt> feel for me </garnt>
<connor> that cigarettes concert was that </connor>
<connor> but for concerts yeah okay so like i'm </connor>
<connor> afraid to go to my next concert because </connor>
<garnt> i'm like because like it might be just </garnt>
<garnt> go to a really [ __ ] one yeah it might be </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] great it might be a band i've </garnt>
<garnt> always wanted to see but i know in the </garnt>
<joey> back of my mind there's going to be that </joey>
<joey> one little voice that's like you know </joey>
<joey> it's not as good as the serious concert </joey>
<joey> is it </joey>
<garnt> you're going to be chasing that high for </garnt>
<connor> the rest of your life absolutely yeah </connor>
<connor> because i i know even because i was </connor>
<connor> obviously out there at the concert as </connor>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> i i was i was there too i was there too </connor>
<connor> guys guys don't forget about me i was </connor>
<connor> there life-changing concert guys what </connor>
<joey> can i say my life was also changed guys </joey>
<joey> okay do you think okay do you think </joey>
<joey> there are films that you experience and </joey>
<connor> you might you might watch right and </connor>
<connor> there's a d there's a big difference </connor>
<connor> between </connor>
<connor> films that are basically made for the </connor>
<joey> theater and films that can just be </joey>
<connor> watched anywhere because i i feel like i </connor>
<joey> didn't </joey>
<connor> because i i didn't really understand the </connor>
<connor> whole like cinematic experience and this </connor>
<connor> is gonna be sounding really cheesy but </connor>
<connor> the the first [ __ ] movie that made me </connor>
<garnt> feel that was [ __ ] your name man just </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] i i know guys i know your </garnt>
<garnt> name your name never you'd never watched </garnt>
<garnt> a movie for your name no no no no this </garnt>
<garnt> could be improved in the cinema </garnt>
<garnt> yes </garnt>
<connor> what yes </connor>
<connor> i i had never seen a movie in theaters </connor>
<connor> that just made me go wow that was that </connor>
<connor> was going to [ __ ] up that table </connor>
<joey> for me </joey>
<connor> because </connor>
<garnt> for me that was a cure </garnt>
<connor> when i saw when i saw akira in cinemas </connor>
<connor> when they redid it for like i think it </connor>
<connor> was like the 20th anniversary of the </connor>
<connor> 25th what was this </connor>
<connor> this was like four or five years ago </connor>
<connor> none of you had ever watched a movie </connor>
<connor> before that and thought damn this would </connor>
<connor> be so good in the movie no no what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> okay because i i kind of but the thing </joey>
<joey> is i kind of my excuse for that was </joey>
<connor> because my dad is a massive film buff he </connor>
<connor> put so much money into like the home </connor>
<connor> surround system still not going to be </connor>
<connor> it's not going to be the same </connor>
<garnt> for me i'm like this is good enough yeah </garnt>
<connor> but but like for me i i've the cinema </connor>
<garnt> has always been haha bigger screen </garnt>
<garnt> louder sounds cool </garnt>
<connor> the way you view music is the way i view </connor>
<connor> films no because it's like your tv is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] all the colors and all the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> is wrong it's not what they they wanted </connor>
<connor> it to look like it it looks exactly the </connor>
<connor> way supposed have you have you tried </connor>
<connor> watching some movies on your tv at home </connor>
<garnt> it looks like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> uh most films i watch i feel </garnt>
<connor> you know when when one when i saw </connor>
<connor> anybody when i said </connor>
<connor> silent green they didn't know those </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> know it's people when i talk when i talk </connor>
<connor> about like when i talk about cinematic </connor>
<connor> experience i don't mean cool you know </connor>
<garnt> this would this experience would be </garnt>
<garnt> improved by watching in theaters because </garnt>
<garnt> ninety percent of the time okay yeah </garnt>
<connor> okay it wouldn't be you're implying okay </connor>
<connor> no are you saying like your name was the </connor>
<connor> first one of me you think i i have to </connor>
<garnt> watch this in the cinema where i'm like </garnt>
<connor> this can only be enjoyed in the cinema </connor>
<connor> like to to me no no </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> to me to me it's something like </connor>
<garnt> something like your name and i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> what's the newest mummer her soda feel </garnt>
<connor> whether it's like it's like having a </connor>
<connor> meal at a an ubereats or a restaurant </connor>
<connor> it's like it's it's like always meant to </connor>
<garnt> be at the restaurant and yeah you can </garnt>
<garnt> have it there no not every film not </garnt>
<connor> everything i think i feel like 90 80 </connor>
<connor> percent of films are just way better in </connor>
<joey> the cinema do i watch weathering with </joey>
<joey> you in cinema when it came out and then </joey>
<joey> i watched it again at home kind of the </joey>
<joey> same experience </joey>
<connor> i can't say but like you know like a </connor>
<connor> quentin tarantino film like every one of </connor>
<connor> those should be watched in the cinema </connor>
<joey> well i never watched paul fiction in the </joey>
<joey> cinema yeah i never noticed one of my </joey>
<joey> favorites but like anyone that comes out </joey>
<joey> now i'll try my best to watch them in </joey>
<joey> the cinema right like i i feel like most </joey>
<joey> films are just so much better in the </joey>
<joey> cinema because it's like it's like the </joey>
<garnt> way that they they every single aspect </garnt>
<garnt> of the the creation process was with </garnt>
<garnt> that screen and that that you know that </garnt>
<garnt> size and the the colors and everything </garnt>
<garnt> was all that right that exact </garnt>
<garnt> specification is it's weird because like </garnt>
<garnt> you wouldn't change a you know like when </garnt>
<garnt> they reprint the manga it's not like </garnt>
<connor> different right it's on the it's printed </connor>
<connor> the way they want it to be printed </connor>
<connor> exactly when you read it right but with </connor>
<connor> the tvs because they all have their own </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] settings and all their own color </connor>
<connor> settings i'm sure you've gone to your </connor>
<connor> friend's house one time and thought who </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] did your tv settings it's like </connor>
<connor> the contrast is [ __ ] ridiculous okay </connor>
<garnt> so whatever iteration is blowing maybe </garnt>
<garnt> i'm that guy because i've never thought </garnt>
<connor> that they probably just </connor>
<connor> they probably just put it on [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> movie mode and thought that's it that's </connor>
<garnt> for me wait wait wait wait wait wait </garnt>
<garnt> wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait </garnt>
<garnt> wait hold on can people put it on </garnt>
<garnt> anything but the default settings unless </garnt>
<garnt> they have like a home cinema set because </garnt>
<connor> i've never yes yes i've always just put </connor>
<garnt> it on default oh my gosh i've never </garnt>
<connor> changed my default settings from my </connor>
<connor> twitter oh the default is bad it's so </connor>
<connor> some tvs right they like add frames okay </connor>
<joey> no no okay like that pisses me off okay </joey>
<joey> that's a different story </joey>
<joey> he's doing this [ __ ] like all your tv </joey>
<joey> that wasn't an issue before smart tvs </joey>
<connor> that was i noticed that i was i was like </connor>
<connor> why the [ __ ] does this look off because </connor>
<joey> we bought like everything was in 24 fps </joey>
<joey> i'm like this looks too real </joey>
<connor> it's like i just don't i don't subscribe </connor>
<garnt> to them i'm like this this gay gamers </garnt>
<garnt> have made a </garnt>
<connor> time i've ever seen the colors are </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] too i don't know </connor>
<garnt> i guarantee you your colors are [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> on your tv and when you change them </garnt>
<garnt> you'll be like i'm an idiot but you </garnt>
<connor> don't know because you just like </connor>
<connor> watching it yeah but i also don't watch </connor>
<connor> movies that often yeah right if you're </connor>
<connor> not watching movies </connor>
<garnt> i i i'm not even talking i'm not even </garnt>
<garnt> talking about movies i'm talking about </garnt>
<garnt> any form of media really because like i </garnt>
<connor> remember your games your game call is </connor>
<joey> probably wrong </joey>
<joey> like your pc monitor i don't really yeah </joey>
<joey> you don't you don't care until you know </joey>
<joey> and then you're like god damn it like </joey>
<connor> this game was more beautiful because </connor>
<connor> like you can get these devices that uh </connor>
<garnt> point at the screen yeah </garnt>
<garnt> ghost of tsushima looked beautiful on my </garnt>
<connor> default setting tv </connor>
<connor> it could have looked even more beautiful </connor>
<garnt> you can get these devices on your pc </garnt>
<connor> right because </connor>
<connor> when you're editing thumbnails yeah </connor>
<connor> don't you want to know that the </connor>
<connor> thumbnail that you're editing is like </connor>
<connor> the right color because you might be </connor>
<connor> editing it on your monitor which is </connor>
<connor> wrong colors and you're sending this </connor>
<connor> thumbnail out and it has different </connor>
<joey> colors yeah but i'm okay because i </joey>
<joey> guarantee the majority of other people </joey>
<joey> who look at that are probably also </joey>
<connor> looking at it so they're defaulting so </connor>
<connor> the idea is that if you have your </connor>
<connor> monitor on like uh the like most default </connor>
<connor> kind of the the flattest color profile </connor>
<connor> um that you know when it gets to an </connor>
<connor> iphone when they change the brightness </connor>
<connor> it goes to samsung they change the </connor>
<connor> brightness that like you don't you're </connor>
<connor> not like doubly skewing the </connor>
<connor> the messed upness to it if that makes </connor>
<connor> sense right you don't want it to be </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] on both ends you want to be the </connor>
<connor> correct thing on your end so when it </connor>
<connor> goes to someone else's device that's </connor>
<connor> that's wrong that it doesn't look </connor>
<connor> completely messed up right </connor>
<connor> because i noticed that uh i used to used </connor>
<connor> to have like one or two of my thumbnails </connor>
<connor> really weird on some of my friends tv </connor>
<connor> and i was like huh and it was because my </connor>
<connor> colors on my monitor were like it was </connor>
<connor> the manufacturer's default which is </connor>
<connor> awful awful like i had an msi monitor i </connor>
<connor> don't know how they messed up the colors </connor>
<connor> on this monitor so much it was so bad </connor>
<connor> right so so bad and it was just like i </connor>
<connor> don't know how to i was what's the right </connor>
<connor> color i don't [ __ ] know so you just </connor>
<connor> buy this device point it at the screen </connor>
<garnt> tells you what to do </garnt>
<garnt> i'm gonna be real dog i've never done </garnt>
<garnt> that in my life </garnt>
<connor> i've never once noticed but it's like </connor>
<connor> having it's like having a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pair of pants or something right </connor>
<garnt> you just don't know it's [ __ ] until you </garnt>
<garnt> get a good pair right a lot of the time </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know just like you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> it's bad </garnt>
<garnt> to me to me my life you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> you're cycling on a ship bike until </garnt>
<garnt> someone points it out in the comments </garnt>
<garnt> that's just how it is it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> like yeah it'll do the job </connor>
<garnt> you know maybe you want to kind of get </garnt>
<garnt> it better i mean i i hope i can see </garnt>
<connor> color just fine i think i can i've never </connor>
<garnt> i don't know that's red right that's </garnt>
<connor> purple right yeah </connor>
<connor> that's why we have like this set to like </connor>
<connor> you know a certain color profile so that </connor>
<garnt> it looks the same on every this device </garnt>
<connor> this is why i'm not a cinematographer or </connor>
<connor> like i hate working </connor>
<garnt> with like cameras because i just like my </garnt>
<garnt> brain just like doesn't process it it's </garnt>
<connor> the same with filming right we filming </connor>
<connor> this thing so that when it goes to </connor>
<joey> everyone's [ __ ] up tvs that hopefully </joey>
<joey> because we filmed it correctly it </joey>
<joey> doesn't look as [ __ ] up on that tv </joey>
<joey> right right no because what okay because </joey>
<joey> you'll notice on some screenshots </joey>
<joey> from people say picture their tvs </joey>
<connor> sometimes trash tastes way lighter </connor>
<connor> sometimes look way darker </connor>
<connor> i've never noticed </connor>
<garnt> i'm not gonna lie dog </garnt>
<garnt> dead ass it's little things never </garnt>
<connor> noticed </connor>
<joey> i just you know we just wanted to look </joey>
<joey> good i don't look at the details in my </joey>
<joey> brain i'm like are we recording yes or </joey>
<joey> no </joey>
<joey> if it's yes good if it's no bad this is </joey>
<connor> like the opposite of beeps and boops you </connor>
<joey> know yeah it really is </joey>
<connor> bits and bobs if you make a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> movie it belongs on the big screen and i </connor>
<connor> can't believe that it took your name and </connor>
<connor> acura for you to watch them even going </connor>
<connor> ah yes big screen good i don't know </connor>
<garnt> because like there's there are still </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> you're telling me this you're telling me </connor>
<connor> james [ __ ] cameron's avatar like was </connor>
<connor> dog [ __ ] on a tv that movie was only </connor>
<garnt> watchable on a cinema like experience </garnt>
<garnt> also it was pretty it was amazing it was </garnt>
<connor> a movie </connor>
<connor> even a movie like that that was like mid </connor>
<connor> there's so so much better </connor>
<garnt> because here's here's the thing right </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not i'm trying to find a way to </garnt>
<garnt> describe this because you know watching </garnt>
<garnt> let's say og interviews of like steven </garnt>
<connor> spielberg and you know hearing some </connor>
<connor> directors talk about </connor>
<connor> the art of filmmaking and you know </connor>
<connor> cinema and everything they'd always talk </connor>
<connor> about the magic of cinema this feeling </connor>
<connor> i'm just like i'm like i'm like growing </connor>
<garnt> up i'm like what the [ __ ] are you </garnt>
<connor> talking about magic of cinema bro it's </connor>
<connor> gonna be like a generation of people who </connor>
<joey> don't go to the cinema this is just a </joey>
<joey> marketing point </joey>
<garnt> i'm like i'm like you're just trying to </garnt>
<connor> sell tickets just tell me you're trying </connor>
<connor> to sell it </connor>
<garnt> because you're trying to tell me </garnt>
<garnt> yourself it's got too expensive like </garnt>
<garnt> going to the cinema is expensive like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's like you know who the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> wants to pay to go to all this [ __ ] all </garnt>
<connor> the time yeah i could just watch it at </connor>
<garnt> home for free </garnt>
<garnt> what i'm saying is watching your name </garnt>
<connor> i'm just like oh i get it that's the </connor>
<connor> magic of cinema yeah i get it now </connor>
<connor> because like i remember when your name </connor>
<connor> came out everyone was just like oh </connor>
<joey> silent voice is better southern voice is </joey>
<joey> better and i'm just like well and you </joey>
<joey> know technically i think sun voice has </joey>
<joey> is has a better plot you know and you </joey>
<joey> know better written characters but if </joey>
<joey> you're gonna tell me which film i'd </joey>
<joey> rather watch </joey>
<joey> in cinemas well silent voice is </joey>
<joey> basically an extended tv program versus </joey>
<joey> your name which is i think </joey>
<joey> a story that was made to be displayed in </joey>
<joey> theaters yes whereas silent voice i </joey>
<joey> think you you know the enjoyment </joey>
<connor> obviously will be increasing theaters </connor>
<connor> but i don't think you're losing too much </connor>
<joey> by watching it on your tv or something </joey>
<connor> like that you know that's that's kind of </connor>
<joey> what i mean that's kind of what i'm </joey>
<joey> saying where there are some films that </joey>
<garnt> make you feel this magic of cinema and i </garnt>
<garnt> thought it was just marketing [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> there's a lot of films you feel like </connor>
<connor> yes this had to be experienced this way </connor>
<garnt> yeah and like us ever since then there's </garnt>
<joey> been like a few more films like </joey>
<joey> especially like seeing the avengers in </joey>
<joey> cinemas as well that was that was </joey>
<joey> something that i think </joey>
<joey> lost loses his edge not being </joey>
<garnt> experienced with everyone else at the </garnt>
<garnt> same time in cinemas sorry joe you know </garnt>
<garnt> you've missed the bojo you've missed the </garnt>
<connor> boat yeah </connor>
<joey> not that i was going to catch that boat </joey>
<connor> anyway </connor>
<connor> i don't know i think maybe it's just </connor>
<joey> because i i you know i go to the cinema </joey>
<joey> a lot and i enjoy it and i i really i i </joey>
<connor> treasure that i experience a lot it </connor>
<joey> means a lot to me see but like that's </joey>
<joey> the thing it's like yeah for you that's </joey>
<joey> cinemas for me that's live shows yeah </joey>
<joey> right it's like same same same idea just </joey>
<connor> different executions because to me what </connor>
<connor> it sounds it's like you're to me it's </connor>
<joey> like the same way i've been as being </joey>
<joey> like just listen to the album why do you </joey>
<joey> gotta go and see them live yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> like it's like it's like i would never </joey>
<connor> like it's it's like of course 99 percent </connor>
<connor> of music </connor>
<joey> sounds way better in a live setting yeah </joey>
<connor> exactly yeah i must say like auto-tune </connor>
<joey> to [ __ ] and then yeah yeah but i don't </joey>
<joey> listen to that </joey>
<joey> yeah the majority of music or media is </joey>
<connor> there's a there's a yes of course the </connor>
<garnt> best way that you can enjoy why why is </garnt>
<garnt> why is things enhanced by it being live </garnt>
<garnt> you know whether it'd be like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> twitch or with like live shows as well </garnt>
<connor> it's because it's the communal communal </connor>
<connor> aspect feels like you're in on it </connor>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> you know you you hear about people talk </garnt>
<garnt> about live shows and you know you know </garnt>
<garnt> something you say is like oh you have to </garnt>
<garnt> be there you have to be there yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and it sounds cheesy but like you've </garnt>
<connor> like when i go to live shows i find it </connor>
<connor> so hard to verbalize the feeling and the </connor>
<connor> experience i felt </connor>
<connor> within that live show versus </connor>
<connor> experiencing that same piece of media </connor>
<joey> that same music that same show on a cd </joey>
<connor> or like or or something else </connor>
<joey> what sets it apart i mean i def i mean </joey>
<connor> when it comes to like music stuff like i </connor>
<connor> feel definitely some genres just work </connor>
<connor> better in a cd setting obviously </connor>
<connor> compared to a live show or like they're </connor>
<connor> not noise that much </connor>
<connor> well yeah i mean like i guarantee like a </connor>
<connor> lot of ambient music is probably gonna </connor>
<connor> sound and feel the exact [ __ ] same </connor>
<connor> right live or not but like but i think i </connor>
<connor> think when like musicianship is involved </connor>
<connor> with like multiple people or even like </connor>
<connor> one person and just like the energy you </connor>
<connor> feel in that room that you're like oh </connor>
<connor> i'm experiencing this with everyone else </connor>
<connor> yeah i can see the magic being created </connor>
<connor> on stage like in person you know it's </connor>
<connor> the difference between like </connor>
<garnt> i don't know uh [ __ ] seeing a </garnt>
<garnt> painting on a wall versus actually </garnt>
<garnt> watching the artist paint that same </garnt>
<garnt> painting right like you'd much rather </garnt>
<joey> see the process being done rather than </joey>
<joey> just experiencing the result right </joey>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> every live show i've been to i'm sure </garnt>
<garnt> you can agree with this as well it's </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah it's it's been way better live </garnt>
<garnt> seeing it live oh yeah especially like </garnt>
<connor> musicians and stuff like that especially </connor>
<joey> if they're good musicians like yeah a </joey>
<connor> hundred percent maybe if maybe they're </connor>
<garnt> like part of the brain that's like mob </garnt>
<garnt> mentality right where it's like you just </garnt>
<garnt> you feed off the crowd and being a part </garnt>
<garnt> of it yeah definitely being in that </garnt>
<joey> energy you feel like you're </joey>
<joey> oh my god i can feed off everyone else </joey>
<joey> getting hyped and i feel like it all </joey>
<joey> just builds yeah we're weird creatures </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't think lions get hyped about </connor>
<garnt> other lions </garnt>
<connor> oh no man they seem to hype each other </connor>
<garnt> up </garnt>
<connor> like yo without hunting the [ __ ] dude </connor>
<connor> i mean they hunted but i don't know if </connor>
<connor> they're getting like they're feeding off </connor>
<joey> each other bro when they when they spot </joey>
<joey> that elk in the distance they're like </joey>
<connor> i think it's like a quirk of our </connor>
<connor> evolution </connor>
<joey> into the idea of being a part of </joey>
<joey> something big well yeah it's the </joey>
<joey> difference between you know a caveman </joey>
<joey> dancing around a fire on his own versus </joey>
<joey> a caveman dancing around the fire with </joey>
<connor> other cavemen well yeah it's like i if i </connor>
<garnt> miss a game a league of legends whatever </garnt>
<garnt> game or a football game which i don't </garnt>
<connor> watch yeah you know i i'm never going to </connor>
<garnt> go back and watch the vod i don't know i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know i'm like i want to i want to </garnt>
<garnt> feel you want to be there be there live </garnt>
<joey> yeah know that everyone's losing their </joey>
<connor> collective [ __ ] when something crazy </connor>
<joey> happens right that's part of the fun </joey>
<joey> that's why like yeah like as much as i </joey>
<joey> love the live show experience and </joey>
<joey> watching musicians do stuff live that's </joey>
<joey> why i very rarely unless it's like my </joey>
<joey> favorite band i very rarely watch like </joey>
<connor> live dvds or like live footage i hate </connor>
<connor> listening to live concerts and cds i i </connor>
<joey> just yeah well it depends how they're </joey>
<joey> recorded obviously if it's on a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> iphone then it's going to sound like dog </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah yeah but like some some </connor>
<connor> professionally recorded like live albums </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that they can sound </connor>
<connor> really good but it's like </connor>
<garnt> i'm only listening to that because </garnt>
<garnt> that's the best that i have because i </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't there when it was actually yeah i </garnt>
<joey> don't know but if i was there when it </joey>
<joey> was recorded i'm not going to </joey>
<garnt> listen to it i actually think live </garnt>
<garnt> recordings okay okay here's </garnt>
<garnt> you've just unlocked like a memory i </garnt>
<joey> guess where if i have the choice to </joey>
<joey> download a studio recorded song or a </joey>
<joey> live recorded song where i can hear the </joey>
<joey> audience reaction i always go for the </joey>
<joey> live recording really yeah because i'm </joey>
<garnt> just like damn it just </garnt>
<garnt> makes the music sound better and i don't </garnt>
<connor> know why i agree it's like a different </connor>
<garnt> energy yeah yeah yeah i just like the </garnt>
<garnt> idea that it's kind of like an art piece </garnt>
<connor> where it's like you have designed the </connor>
<joey> perfect thing that you think this is not </joey>
<connor> yeah can you perform it every perfect </connor>
<connor> every time or whatever yeah but maybe </connor>
<connor> the roughness of performing it live adds </connor>
<garnt> more character too oh yeah i think it </garnt>
<garnt> does hearing you know not sometimes you </garnt>
<connor> you hear like an offbeat note or like </connor>
<connor> cause something's slightly off tune or </connor>
<connor> something like that you know like maybe </connor>
<connor> a voice </connor>
<joey> i feel like that adds to the music to me </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<connor> hearing the perfect studio version isn't </connor>
<connor> always like the best experience for me </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i've never thought about that </connor>
<connor> yeah when when i tried it like on my </connor>
<garnt> spotify playlist i try to put as many </garnt>
<connor> live performances as i can </connor>
<garnt> i hate them yeah i do i think as long as </garnt>
<connor> like maybe with some exceptions like </connor>
<connor> some live albums that are like </connor>
<connor> exceptionally well recorded other than </connor>
<connor> that i don't normally listen to live </connor>
<connor> versions because it's like i would </connor>
<connor> rather listen to this </connor>
<connor> actually in person like i don't want to </connor>
<joey> live vicariously through a crowd i'm </joey>
<garnt> listening through spotify no no </garnt>
<garnt> it's not like it's not that i don't want </garnt>
<connor> to be there of course i want to be there </connor>
<joey> but like if i if i if i have a choice if </joey>
<connor> i could cope i'd be like </connor>
<connor> if i close my eyes i could pretend i'm </connor>
<connor> there okay i can pretend i'm there i say </connor>
<connor> this knowing that like deaf punk had </connor>
<connor> that live album which was sick yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> but that's because that was so well </connor>
<connor> recorded that was right and it was also </connor>
<connor> completely different to anything else </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> that was crazy but if it's the same song </connor>
<connor> as the studio version i'd rather listen </connor>
<connor> to the studio if i can have around the </connor>
<joey> world without people chewing in the </joey>
<joey> background i'll just take that one yeah </joey>
<joey> but the map </joey>
<joey> makes the song so much more the mashup </joey>
<connor> version is sick though yeah yeah because </connor>
<garnt> it's different yeah yeah the defunct </garnt>
<joey> live album was okay that's an exception </joey>
<connor> that's just mashups yeah it wasn't the </connor>
<joey> same song yeah because if the contents </joey>
<joey> the only time i would re uh i would </joey>
<connor> listen to a live album is if the </connor>
<connor> contents is something that i can't get </connor>
<connor> off any studio mm-hmm then it's like </connor>
<connor> then that's just like new music yeah </connor>
<connor> right and so it's like hell yeah </connor>
<connor> kind of builds in and then the hype kind </connor>
<joey> of builds into it right because it was </joey>
<joey> built off of that but if it's the exact </joey>
<joey> same song i'd rather just go to their </joey>
<garnt> concert see tim to me the crowd </garnt>
<garnt> just by having a crowd there you're </garnt>
<garnt> adding like an extra light we should </garnt>
<connor> have a crowd trash taste episode that </connor>
<garnt> would be interesting </garnt>
<joey> we need a live studio audience trash </joey>
<connor> takes is filmed in front of a live </connor>
<garnt> studio audience </garnt>
<garnt> shout out to our live tour by the way </garnt>
<joey> let's see what the tour is going to be </joey>
<garnt> come come see we need to we need to </garnt>
<connor> start the tour we need to start every </connor>
<connor> tour with this is done </connor>
<joey> yeah but like if we do another tour just </joey>
<joey> every time we just got to start it off </joey>
<connor> with this this show is performing in </connor>
<connor> front of a live audience </connor>
<connor> i'll do that i'll be the guy i'll just </connor>
<connor> do it he should just slap bass </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't know it's it's weird how </garnt>
<joey> just adding an audience to something </joey>
<joey> just makes it incredibly more hype for </joey>
<joey> me it's it's like everything except for </joey>
<garnt> sitcoms i [ __ ] [ __ ] hate like </garnt>
<garnt> worse the water </garnt>
<garnt> i absolutely hate when sit come remember </garnt>
<garnt> this when sitcom went through it like </garnt>
<garnt> it's canned laughter phase and sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't even canned laughter sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> there was an actual live studio audience </garnt>
<connor> i like to argue that's still happening </connor>
<connor> is it in a lot of ways the best one </connor>
<garnt> yeah that's not still gone going is it </garnt>
<garnt> is that i thought </garnt>
<garnt> big bang theory is still not gone i'm </garnt>
<joey> sure though they're still i'm sure </joey>
<garnt> they're this is this are they still </garnt>
<garnt> making episodes </garnt>
<joey> that's what i thought </joey>
<joey> i'm sure there's still a bunch of </joey>
<joey> sitcoms we just don't know about that </joey>
<garnt> have canned laughter including so </garnt>
<joey> because now that's just like a staple of </joey>
<garnt> sitcoms now did frasier </garnt>
<garnt> yeah frasier had it friends malcolm in </garnt>
<garnt> the middle no </garnt>
<garnt> didn't have it oh really yeah yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> didn't have it also wait what's the one </garnt>
<joey> i'm thinking of </joey>
<joey> uh two and a half minutes </joey>
<connor> in the middle was amazing what's what's </connor>
<connor> the most popular sitcoms nowadays </connor>
<connor> because you know i i look at sitcoms now </connor>
<connor> i'm like i never always </connor>
<joey> barely ever watch </joey>
<connor> brooklyn nine-nine that doesn't have </connor>
<garnt> canned laughter yeah yeah cause it's </garnt>
<connor> like because i i've i feel like </connor>
<garnt> it's very very popular yeah am i crazy </garnt>
<garnt> is that the most popular one i don't </garnt>
<joey> know i'm not sure </joey>
<garnt> all right most successful sitcoms what's </garnt>
<connor> the most popular one most popular right </connor>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah because like i remember you </joey>
<joey> know back back in the day we'd have </joey>
<connor> things like friends </connor>
<joey> you know friends and um </joey>
<joey> like frasier and other like super mega </joey>
<joey> popular super mega popular sitcoms like </joey>
<garnt> that and you know not to say that it </garnt>
<garnt> weren't funny but </garnt>
<garnt> i it seems like sitcoms now are going </garnt>
<garnt> through a phase where they've just </garnt>
<garnt> removed the can laughter and i'm like </garnt>
<joey> thank [ __ ] thank god for that because i </joey>
<joey> feel it was like such a rare occasion </joey>
<joey> where adding canned laughter to a sitcom </joey>
<joey> actually enhanced the comedy like in my </joey>
<joey> head i think the only two shows that i </joey>
<joey> thought were like genuinely watchable </joey>
<garnt> and funny at times that had canned </garnt>
<garnt> laughter was probably friends and i t </garnt>
<garnt> crowd </garnt>
<garnt> like other than those two shows i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> it's just it's just like it's i don't </garnt>
<joey> know it's mocking </joey>
<garnt> where it's like please laugh now you </garnt>
<garnt> know it's like i actually that's the </garnt>
<garnt> reason i didn't like it crowd really it </garnt>
<garnt> was that one show everyone's like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> this this is amazing it's so funny it's </garnt>
<joey> really good i think it's really history </joey>
<joey> i think it's one of the rare exceptions </joey>
<joey> where it was like the comedy itself was </joey>
<joey> actually so funny in a lot of episodes </joey>
<joey> where i could ignore the candle after </joey>
<joey> right you know but like there's a lot of </joey>
<joey> shows like say like big bang theory </joey>
<joey> where it's like the jokes are like </joey>
<joey> subpar at best and then the it's like </joey>
<joey> the canned laughter is like laugh now </joey>
<joey> where it's like it's instructing you </joey>
<joey> when to feel emotion and i'm like no </joey>
<joey> that's not how comedy works well that's </joey>
<garnt> just like the thing that i could not </garnt>
<garnt> stand on my camera and why i couldn't </garnt>
<garnt> get into the i.t crowd is because what </garnt>
<connor> can laughter does is that it [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> messes up with the pacing of the comedy </connor>
<connor> or the show because people have to pause </connor>
<connor> it's literally say a joke pause for </connor>
<connor> laughter right and and you basically </connor>
<connor> subconsciously telling people okay this </connor>
<garnt> is one to laugh right whereas when i see </garnt>
<garnt> something funny and happening in real </garnt>
<garnt> life you don't [ __ ] pause for </garnt>
<garnt> laughter well i'm not pausing every time </garnt>
<joey> okay well then what about like every </joey>
<joey> like stand-up comedy show every star </joey>
<connor> that's also a big reason why i've never </connor>
<joey> been like </joey>
<joey> you don't like stand-up content i'm not </joey>
<joey> a fan of stanford oh really yeah i love </joey>
<joey> stand-up comedy yeah i'd much rather </joey>
<joey> watch stand-up special over any sitcom </joey>
<connor> to be honest um because like for one </connor>
<garnt> it's not candle after it's yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> real it is real laughter but there's </garnt>
<garnt> also they still do that thing where like </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of their jokes are designed where </garnt>
<connor> they would say a punch line and then </connor>
<connor> they would pause to leave enough space </connor>
<connor> for the crowd to hopefully laugh at the </connor>
<connor> joke right and i feel in a lot of like </connor>
<connor> really good stand-up shows i mean i'm </connor>
<connor> not a [ __ ] stand-up spo uh you know </connor>
<connor> expert or whatever but like i've seen </connor>
<connor> enough where like i've noticed a pattern </connor>
<garnt> where a lot of the best comics they </garnt>
<garnt> purposely make the joke flow to the </garnt>
<garnt> point where that pause that they add </garnt>
<garnt> between a punch line and the next thing </garnt>
<connor> they're going to say it enhances the </connor>
<connor> comments yeah yeah and it's like and i </connor>
<connor> feel like that's no different to how </connor>
<connor> like shows like it crowd or friends did </connor>
<connor> it where like the the joke is usually </connor>
<connor> structured around the pause </connor>
<connor> but like there's a lot of shows like say </connor>
<joey> big bang theory it's just like it </joey>
<joey> doesn't really work because of the flow </joey>
<joey> of the conversation it just really seems </joey>
<garnt> unnatural i have this weird relationship </garnt>
<garnt> with stand-up comedy actually because </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's been like this way my entire </garnt>
<garnt> life where you know with cam laughter </garnt>
<garnt> and with you know being filmed in front </garnt>
<joey> of a live cd audience if i feel like </joey>
<joey> they are telling a joke my subconscious </joey>
<joey> brain just goes you are playing a you </joey>
<joey> laugh you lose challenge right now you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> so you like the dry humor i oh well yeah </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] love dry hair </joey>
<joey> i am british i also like dry humor but </joey>
<joey> the iot crowds are my favorites yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah because yeah okay but then </joey>
<joey> here's the question have you ever gone </joey>
<garnt> to see stan will call me live i haven't </garnt>
<garnt> no i haven't yet it's good i i feel the </garnt>
<joey> one where it's like the live aspect </joey>
<joey> makes it a million times i can i can i </joey>
<garnt> can i can i can see that yeah because </garnt>
<joey> when you're in an audience then you kind </joey>
<connor> of want to laugh yeah i've never asked </connor>
<connor> this are you guys musical guys do you </connor>
<connor> guys like musicals i like musicals </connor>
<garnt> yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> enjoy i wouldn't say i'm a musical guy </garnt>
<joey> i'm not like an iceberg but i like i've </joey>
<garnt> seen a lot of music yeah i've never been </garnt>
<garnt> that guy who's like gone out of his way </garnt>
<garnt> to go see musicals but every time i have </garnt>
<garnt> i've just had like a brilliant time i </garnt>
<connor> don't really like musicals </connor>
<connor> oh i thought you were gonna lean on </connor>
<joey> being like i love musicals let me talk </joey>
<connor> about it musicals you know what any </connor>
<connor> musicals </connor>
<joey> there's always that one because my my </joey>
<connor> hands down that's enough my hands down </connor>
<joey> favor will always be rocky horror </joey>
<connor> pictures so you're gonna ask what are </connor>
<connor> you gonna say like les miserables </connor>
<connor> that the only one you've watched no i've </connor>
<joey> watched um </joey>
<connor> okay i haven't liked everything </connor>
<garnt> i've watched that i've watched book of </garnt>
<connor> mormon yeah that's a great great musical </connor>
<garnt> watch them on movies well that's </garnt>
<garnt> probably what </garnt>
<connor> i hate musicals and movies as well i </connor>
<connor> sing i hate when they sing i don't want </connor>
<connor> to see i want to see a story i want to </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] hear them sing i think i think </joey>
<connor> again the only musical movie that i </connor>
<connor> really enjoy was rocky i love plays i </connor>
<connor> love watching plays live i hate watching </connor>
<connor> people sing live like like i'm not in </connor>
<garnt> like a concert setting </garnt>
<garnt> i actually like i i hate musical in film </garnt>
<connor> forms you know i heard musicals i'm so </connor>
<garnt> when it's in stage form that's actually </garnt>
<garnt> the only times i've ever liked it </garnt>
<connor> i can appreciate how like how talented </connor>
<connor> and how you know how much work goes into </connor>
<connor> it yeah it's very demanding but i just </connor>
<connor> don't really like it yeah i love plays </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i think i think i know i i </joey>
<garnt> think i understand your hate for like </garnt>
<joey> musical or like musical numbers in too </joey>
<garnt> many beats and boobs it just feels like </garnt>
<connor> it like rips you out of the </connor>
<joey> like the flow right now i get that i </joey>
<joey> think i think that you feel that way </joey>
<garnt> because for the most part the storyline </garnt>
<garnt> itself is like very serious and it's </garnt>
<garnt> told in like a cinematic yeah yeah and </garnt>
<connor> then all of a sudden it like cuts to a </connor>
<connor> musical right yeah which is just like a </connor>
<connor> polar opposite but that's why i think </connor>
<connor> rocky horror was such a great movie </connor>
<connor> because that storyline does not take </connor>
<connor> itself seriously okay the entire time so </connor>
<connor> it feels </connor>
<connor> less jarring when it goes into a musical </connor>
<connor> number because the non-musical parts are </connor>
<connor> just as [ __ ] ridiculous </connor>
<connor> so like but like that's another big </connor>
<connor> reason why i like i mean among many </connor>
<connor> reasons why i like the cats movie </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] sucked right yeah because like </connor>
<connor> for one it looks horrible but two it's </connor>
<connor> like a serious story right that just </connor>
<connor> looks goofy yeah and so that goofiness </connor>
<connor> is just enhanced when it goes into a </connor>
<connor> musical number yeah which sucks because </connor>
<connor> if you see cats like on a live stage </connor>
<connor> it's [ __ ] amazing it's it's such a </connor>
<connor> great musical life </connor>
<garnt> like which is why i was so i mean which </garnt>
<garnt> is one of the many reasons why i saw the </garnt>
<connor> trailer to the cat's movie and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like oh god why did you do this it's so </connor>
<connor> bad it's like it's like it's like seeing </connor>
<joey> the trailer to like the worst </joey>
<joey> live-action anime film you've ever seen </joey>
<garnt> yeah it was really really it was it </garnt>
<garnt> feels horrible what about like films </garnt>
<garnt> that have been turned into musicals have </garnt>
<garnt> you ever like experienced that i heard </garnt>
<connor> that back to the future one was okay </connor>
<garnt> it was a back to the future music </garnt>
<garnt> there was a back to the future one </garnt>
<connor> apparently it's pretty good i saw the </connor>
<connor> death note musical </connor>
<connor> damn that sounds fun </connor>
<joey> i felt like i was on drugs while i was </joey>
<connor> watching that show i'm like this is not </connor>
<garnt> a real thing i'm watching because it's </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> again going back to that whole like </connor>
<garnt> adding musical numbers in a very serious </garnt>
<garnt> storyline like you can't get more </garnt>
<garnt> serious than a death note storyline </garnt>
<garnt> right and then all of a sudden light </garnt>
<garnt> just like busts into this musical number </garnt>
<garnt> of how he's gonna kill every criminal in </garnt>
<joey> the world i'm just like </joey>
<joey> i knew you were a psychopath character </joey>
<joey> but now you sound even more like </joey>
<garnt> actually </garnt>
<joey> you know i can actually kind of see it </joey>
<joey> yo yo you you you hear else theme you </joey>
<joey> know what the [ __ ] doo doo doo doo </joey>
<garnt> doo and you think that's that's a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] fat beat you know you yeah but </joey>
<joey> like that okay i understand if you're in </joey>
<garnt> a musical setting you hear the else </garnt>
<garnt> theme and then it like busts into a trap </garnt>
<garnt> beep and then they just start dancing </garnt>
<garnt> live on stage but that's not what </garnt>
<connor> happens </connor>
<connor> theme goes so hard are you kidding me </connor>
<connor> that that [ __ ] moment where the </connor>
<connor> guitar kicks in </connor>
<garnt> bro that that was made for a musical man </garnt>
<garnt> you know what i'm saying you know what </garnt>
<joey> i'm saying yeah it's it's uh it's a </joey>
<garnt> really fascinating i actually really </garnt>
<garnt> want to go see more like anime like </garnt>
<garnt> musicals just because it's </garnt>
<joey> one of the most unique </joey>
<connor> entertainment </connor>
<connor> cells at work one as well i remember </connor>
<joey> that yeah there was a prince of tennis </joey>
<connor> one as well there was a free one </connor>
<joey> uh they did a lot they have my hero </joey>
<garnt> oh my name is </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate factory that was good it was </garnt>
<garnt> really good musical numbers in it </garnt>
<joey> the gene wilder one yeah that's what the </joey>
<joey> musical number in it has numbers in it </joey>
<joey> like um oh oh yeah i guess i guess some </joey>
<joey> other has some other moments where it's </joey>
<joey> kind of musically yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah i wouldn't say it's traditional but </connor>
<connor> yeah i think the reason why that worked </connor>
<connor> is because the story is just so </connor>
<connor> ridiculous yeah that it just matches </connor>
<joey> that world yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like you know </connor>
<connor> death note you guys watched any like </connor>
<garnt> traditional plays live i was actually </garnt>
<garnt> going to say like i tell you what </garnt>
<garnt> this weird rabbit hole i've fallen down </garnt>
<garnt> in recently </garnt>
<garnt> uh i've been watching like clips of </garnt>
<joey> rakugo </joey>
<joey> oh dakugo is fantastic yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> rakugo is like a traditional style of </garnt>
<joey> japanese storytelling it's it's stand-up </joey>
<joey> it's original stand-up comedy yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it's it's like they're not standing up </joey>
<garnt> yeah they're literally like sitting down </garnt>
<garnt> you take stand up right and you just </garnt>
<garnt> restrict basically everything so </garnt>
<joey> you're not allowed to like walk around </joey>
<garnt> you have to sit down in one tiny spot </garnt>
<garnt> and all you have as a prop is a fan and </garnt>
<joey> that's it </joey>
<joey> and using just that they have to convey </joey>
<joey> the story which isn't always funny </joey>
<joey> sometimes it's like serious story </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> that's that's all you have to use to </joey>
<joey> like convey the story and so there is </joey>
<joey> down comedy yes it's stand up comedy </joey>
<joey> this is a sit down comment yeah but the </joey>
<joey> reason i got into it was because i've </joey>
<connor> been i had to read like i kind of uh is </connor>
<connor> it akane banshee banashi </connor>
<connor> which is like a new shonen jump a manga </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> so that that got me really interested to </connor>
<connor> be like okay yeah i know how they </connor>
<connor> portray in manga and everything but how </connor>
<connor> does actually look in real life and i've </connor>
<connor> never just like appreciated just this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's really is like an art form of </connor>
<connor> storytelling because we've just like </connor>
<connor> such </connor>
<connor> you see with like such </connor>
<connor> subtle changes in expressions and </connor>
<connor> mannerisms they like these rocket </connor>
<connor> performers are able to just </connor>
<joey> absorb you into this story into this </joey>
<joey> world with just like very subtle changes </joey>
<joey> in their face and just their mannerisms </joey>
<joey> and i'm like this is [ __ ] incredible </joey>
<joey> like i should not be this invested in a </joey>
<joey> story where this guy's just sitting down </joey>
<garnt> with playing around with the fan yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah i don't know </joey>
<joey> it's almost like it's weird it's almost </joey>
<connor> like cause i've been to a rocco show </connor>
<connor> before because my grandma's really into </connor>
<connor> it um and it was really weird because </connor>
<connor> like even if you don't fully comprehend </connor>
<connor> like say the bot of the joke or the </connor>
<connor> point of the story is that the intention </connor>
<connor> of the book yeah the bot of the joke </connor>
<connor> like you know like the the the joke </connor>
<connor> even if you don't comprehend like the </connor>
<connor> joke or the the meaning behind the story </connor>
<connor> or whatever like it's still just </connor>
<garnt> enthralling to watch it especially if </garnt>
<garnt> it's a really good performer yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> to just sit him sit there and it's like </connor>
<connor> he's just like writing a book in front </connor>
<connor> of him yeah and you you can fully </connor>
<connor> envision everything he's saying and just </connor>
<connor> get like engrossed being like so so what </connor>
<connor> happened after that yeah it's it's like </connor>
<connor> when you go to like a [ __ ] family </connor>
<connor> reunion and you just have like that one </connor>
<connor> uncle who's just really good at </connor>
<joey> storytelling and it's like i might not </joey>
<joey> even care half the time about what the </joey>
<joey> actual story is but i just want to keep </joey>
<garnt> listening of like that it kind of brings </garnt>
<garnt> you back into that zone where you're a </garnt>
<connor> kid and your parents would like read you </connor>
<connor> like story time books or whatever and </connor>
<connor> you're like oh well what happens next </connor>
<joey> what happens next you know </joey>
<joey> i kind of like that same feeling but </joey>
<garnt> just as an adult and uh yeah i never </garnt>
<garnt> would have like got into it if not for </garnt>
<garnt> like anime and manga and it was just </garnt>
<joey> like i'm surprised it was that one and </joey>
<joey> not raku shinjuku that got you into it </joey>
<garnt> okay cause like i i think uh i i watched </garnt>
<connor> raku shinju and that's </connor>
<connor> i felt more focused on the drama aspect </connor>
<connor> yeah where this is more like okay let's </connor>
<connor> take rakio and just shown shonen shonen </connor>
<joey> it's shown in fire shonen fire i was </joey>
<connor> trying to make a word out of it but it's </connor>
<connor> like this this this actress who this </connor>
<garnt> performer who wants to be the best </garnt>
<garnt> racket performer of all time and you </garnt>
<garnt> know that should they have like </garnt>
<garnt> power-ups </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> no they have like training arcs </garnt>
<connor> in our basket </connor>
<connor> you can rotate this thing 360 degrees in </connor>
<garnt> 0.1 seconds </garnt>
<joey> basically that's how the guests like i </joey>
<joey> can throw </joey>
<connor> hemorrhoids now he has to become a </connor>
<joey> stand-up comedian like no he has to like </joey>
<joey> slightly lift his butt on me </joey>
<joey> oh my god it enhanced the story </joey>
<joey> oh my god yeah so that was like i would </joey>
<joey> love to see a raccoon performance live </joey>
<joey> because if i got that engrossed watching </joey>
<joey> a youtube video which is normally i hate </joey>
<joey> watching what live performances on </joey>
<joey> youtube then i </joey>
<joey> i would wonder what it would be like </joey>
<garnt> being in that room and just hearing </garnt>
<joey> hearing the performer actually do it </joey>
<joey> that's that's the kind of the same with </joey>
<connor> like kabuki or like normal you don't </connor>
<connor> always need to understand everything </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah honestly i i i speak english </joey>
<joey> and i watch shakespeare and i didn't </joey>
<joey> know what was happening but i had an </joey>
<joey> amazing time yeah i i think that </joey>
<connor> if you go to london you should watch try </connor>
<connor> and look to see if there's a shakespeare </connor>
<joey> performance oh i want to watch a show </joey>
<joey> live i've never seen like a shakespeare </joey>
<connor> story live dude in the globe it's </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] awesome yeah uh unless you're </joey>
<joey> standing or a polls blocking your way </joey>
<joey> all right there's some seats that are </joey>
<joey> sold as like a pole that's blocking your </joey>
<joey> view </joey>
<joey> because it's traditional </joey>
<joey> because it's it's literally a replica </joey>
<joey> because you just have to like kind of </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] literally yeah you literally </connor>
<connor> have to just </connor>
<connor> the whole time wow sometimes some </connor>
<garnt> traditions shouldn't be kept </garnt>
<connor> tradition so the building burned down </connor>
<garnt> right yeah they remade it one to one and </garnt>
<connor> yeah if you want to stand in like the </connor>
<connor> pit you stand there like four hours </connor>
<connor> standing below the stage looking at the </connor>
<garnt> stage because that's how you get you get </garnt>
<garnt> the peasant experience you literally get </garnt>
<connor> the fastest except you're paying for it </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's very cheap though down on the </garnt>
<connor> bottom yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's really really affordable these </connor>
<joey> things unless you want them like really </joey>
<joey> i thought to myself i've been in enough </joey>
<joey> mosh pits while i'm standing up for </joey>
<connor> hours at a time where i could probably </connor>
<connor> do that but like it's kind of like being </connor>
<joey> in a motorsport but not moving yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> you should go it's just like this </connor>
<connor> is that like they only have them like </connor>
<connor> three four times a month and they're or </connor>
<connor> is it like they're always booked yeah </connor>
<connor> and it's it's never the </connor>
<joey> shakespeare story you want right i got </joey>
<joey> super lucky one time i got hamlet yeah </joey>
<joey> it's my favorite one um but every other </joey>
<connor> time i've been it's been like one of the </connor>
