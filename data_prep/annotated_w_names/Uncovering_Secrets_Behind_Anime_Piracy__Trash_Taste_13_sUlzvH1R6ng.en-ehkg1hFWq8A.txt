<garnt> - Is it starting? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's face reveal, this
is the intro. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Face reveal, let's go! </garnt>
<garnt> (ambient music) </garnt>
<garnt> Hello and welcome to another episode </garnt>
<garnt> of "Trash Taste Podcast". </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today, Gigguk, </garnt>
<garnt> and today, joining me are
my usual cohosts, the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello, we're the boys.
- Hello </garnt>
<garnt> - Boy one and boy two, </garnt>
<garnt> and today we have another special guest. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you want to introduce yourself? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, bye. (laughing)
(Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - We'll introduce you for you then. </garnt>
<garnt> This is our producer, Meilyne. </garnt>
<connor> You probably heard her voice </connor>
<garnt> or seen her passing
the camera a few times. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or seen us shouting at her. </garnt>
<garnt> - Seen us shouting at her, or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> but today's her face revealed. </garnt>
<joey> This is what our producer looks like. </joey>
<connor> - She's a familiar face
in my videos, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, you're in-
- Really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the Yaoi cafe, </joey>
<joey> you were like the heavy
breathing in the background. </joey>
<garnt> (Gigguk and Meilyne laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think you've been on
like all our channels, right? </garnt>
<garnt> At one point.
- I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, the rental mom. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the rental mom one and yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> but like on "Trash Taste" at least, </garnt>
<joey> this is the first time, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So, do you wanna
explain what your job is </garnt>
<garnt> and what you do and kinda why
you're on the podcast today? </garnt>
<garnt> - What's up with that,
why are you on here? </garnt>
<connor> What are you doing? </connor>
<garnt> - Free real estate, (laughing) but anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, I am Meilyne, I work at Book Walker. </garnt>
<garnt> You've probably seen that
on all of their videos, </garnt>
<garnt> they're free to use
all their coupon codes. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have one, but yeah (laughing). </garnt>
<garnt> Anyways, yeah, so GeeXPlus </garnt>
<garnt> is a company under
Kadokawa and Book Walker. </garnt>
<garnt> And I started that within
Book Walker last year, </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah, now I work at... </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't even explain
that right. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Meilyne is a nervous mess. </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughing) The long
and the short of it is, </garnt>
<garnt> she's the reason we're all here now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty much. </garnt>
<joey> And she's the reason why
this show even exists. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> And the reason we invited her today </joey>
<garnt> is because I thought
today we could talk about </garnt>
<garnt> some spicy industry news guys. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, so if you didn't know this, </connor>
<connor> a small indianime site called KissAnime </connor>
<connor> recently went out of business, "business"- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, "business". </connor>
<connor> - That's at the time of
recording this though. </connor>
<connor> - As at the time of recording this </connor>
<garnt> and yeah, I guess we just
wanted to talk about that. </garnt>
<joey> - Talk about piracy </joey>
<connor> 'cause you know, that always
goes well on the internet. </connor>
<connor> - Twitter has been a mess.
- Oh my God! </connor>
<joey> - When is Twitter not a mess? </joey>
<joey> - Oh God, I've seen so many
garbage takes about it. </joey>
<garnt> Where do we even begin?
- Where do we even begin? </garnt>
<garnt> - We wanna explain what
a KissAnime even is. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is KissAnime?
- What is a KissAnime? </garnt>
<joey> - I'll explain what KissAnime is. </joey>
<connor> Monkey brain here, to
explain things for you. </connor>
<joey> - Explain it like I'm five. </joey>
<connor> - KissAnime was probably
the most notorious </connor>
<connor> and well-known anime piracy
website for streaming </connor>
<joey> for a while.
- For a while, not anymore. </joey>
<joey> - Not anymore, but I'd say
at least three years ago, </joey>
<joey> it was definitely like the site. </joey>
<joey> And then you know, as somebody
who at one point you used it, </joey>
<connor> it definitely became a thing
of, "Oh we're using .ru now </connor>
<garnt> instead of.com. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, that's a little confusing." </connor>
<joey> - And then, suddenly it
acts like disposable bomb </joey>
<joey> or something. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you went to
like this, the pictures. </connor>
<connor> - The capture got so fucking complicated, </connor>
<connor> that I was like, I didn't
know how to navigate it. </connor>
<garnt> And then it got to a point where </garnt>
<garnt> anywhere you click on the
website, you got an ad. </garnt>
<joey> It was like trying to navigate minefield, </joey>
<garnt> it's like, where can I
click without getting an ad? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was waiting for the capture
to turn into like Sulfurex. </garnt>
<joey> It was trigonometry question. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It would ask for like
cat, cat and blue scape. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah (laughing)
(Gigguk laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It had essentially become a
second page of Google website, </garnt>
<garnt> It was like a minefield, </garnt>
<joey> and it was definitely the most notorious </joey>
<joey> I'd say overall website
among the anime fandom, </joey>
<joey> and it recently closed its stores. </joey>
<connor> And people seemed very upset
about that for some reason, </connor>
<connor> as if there isn't like 500 other websites </connor>
<garnt> that immediately pop up. </garnt>
<garnt> - One thing that really
confused me is that </garnt>
<garnt> why are people sad, I guess? </garnt>
<garnt> Who's still using KissAnime in 2020? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, c'mon guys. </garnt>
<garnt> I hate the fact that I just joke tweeted </garnt>
<garnt> about being like "rip
kissanime, rip brokeweebs", </garnt>
<garnt> and it became my most popular tweet. </garnt>
<garnt> It's got like 90,000 likes, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, why? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Who is like "#canrelate"? </garnt>
<connor> It's my most popular tweet, and I hate it. </connor>
<garnt> I fucking hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I jokingly said
that in the sense of like, </garnt>
<joey> who the fuck uses KissAnime in 2020? </joey>
<joey> And so many people were
like, "Relate queen, </joey>
<joey> I relate, rip brokeweebs." </joey>
<garnt> - I don't understand Twitter. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. It's horrible. </joey>
<joey> - People were like, I don't
know if you guys got this, </joey>
<joey> were like atting me being like, </joey>
<garnt> "You need to discuss this,
it's such big community news." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like why, what do you mean? </garnt>
<joey> Pirate sites get shut down all the time, </joey>
<joey> and then another one pops up. </joey>
<joey> Like it's the reason we had like </joey>
<joey> every single country
extension ever of KissAnime, </joey>
<connor> is 'cause they move to
every fucking country </connor>
<connor> until they probably have
none left, I assumed. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I saw KissAnime
having a dot whatever, </joey>
<connor> in things that I've never even seen. </connor>
<connor> I was like "ru", I'm like, </connor>
<connor> that's Russia.
- That's Russia. </connor>
<joey> - You know, I don't wanna offend </joey>
<joey> the Russian fans of "Trash
Taste" and we have a Russian dem. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, we have like a
large Russian demographic. </joey>
<joey> - Which is great, but I'm sorry, </joey>
<garnt> I feel very uneasy when I
see that .ru in my browser. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, whoa. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know there's
something shady going on </garnt>
<garnt> if it's on .ru. </garnt>
<garnt> - Love Russia though, yeah, totally. </garnt>
<connor> - They have other things though, right? </connor>
<connor> Not only KissAnime, it's
like KissManga, KissMovies- </connor>
<connor> - KissCartoon. </connor>
<garnt> - There's a KissHentai as well, I think? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think so. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's actually a KissHentai. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember, somehow
I got on to KissCartoon </connor>
<connor> and like "Family Guy"
was like the most popular </connor>
<connor> and I just sat there for a second. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like people are pirating "Family Guy". </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know YouTube exists, right? </garnt>
<connor> All the episodes- </connor>
<garnt> - Like, this shit is available
everywhere. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you remember that phase </garnt>
<garnt> where they were just like,
there was this streaming phase </garnt>
<connor> where "Family Guy" episodes
would just be like streamed </connor>
<connor> on YouTube and it would just be like </connor>
<garnt> 24-hour "Family Guy" stream,
24-hour "Simpsons" stream. </garnt>
<connor> - It was always the front page
of fucking YouTube as well. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not official, is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - (Joey and Gigguk) No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not official </garnt>
<garnt> and yet like, every time I'd open YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> there'd just be like 24 hours, </garnt>
<joey> a 24/7 stream of "The Cleveland Show". </joey>
<garnt> I'm like... </garnt>
<garnt> And there was like 700,000
people watching the stream. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, it's the same
thing that happened </garnt>
<garnt> with like Hentai Haven, right. </garnt>
<garnt> When Hentai Haven got shut down, </garnt>
<garnt> people were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Where are we going to
watch our Hentai now?" </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I don't know, Google that shit. </garnt>
<joey> There's literally 700 websites for it. </joey>
<joey> - I fell short out of the loop, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I never used Hentai Haven, </joey>
<joey> and when everyone was losing their shit, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "But why don't
you just use the website </joey>
<joey> I'm using?" </joey>
<joey> - Why don't you just
use every other website- </joey>
<joey> - And everyone was like- </joey>
<garnt> - A question to you Meilyne, </garnt>
<garnt> because you actually work in the industry. </garnt>
<garnt> So what is your opinion on KissAnime </garnt>
<joey> and it's shutting down as a whole, </joey>
<garnt> from like someone on the
other side of the wall. </garnt>
<garnt> - Someone who like, works
with the copyright holders. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't really work
in like the anime side, </garnt>
<joey> I work more on like the manga </joey>
<joey> and occasionally, we'll do
something with the anime. </joey>
<garnt> So I can't really speak
for the anime industry. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've liked most of the discussion, </garnt>
<garnt> Twitter and like most of
the discussion on our side, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of it is just speculation. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't actually know how much
piracy affects the industry, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> I think it can be argued that no one- </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think there's any like, </garnt>
<joey> concrete stats right? </joey>
<garnt> There isn't like... </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I don't think any
of these piracy sites </garnt>
<garnt> are making that shit public, </garnt>
<joey> of like how much money
they're actually making. </joey>
<joey> - Of course not, </joey>
<connor> 'cause they're making a disgusting
amount on all those ads. </connor>
<garnt> - You can definitely guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, at one point, </garnt>
<garnt> KissAnime was like one of
the top 100 visited websites </garnt>
<joey> on the internet, which is fucking insane. </joey>
<joey> Like imagine how much
money they were making </joey>
<garnt> just from ad revenue
of being like the top. </garnt>
<connor> - Probably worth it to
keep evading all the- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - you know what I mean?
- Exactly. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, they made a
disgusting amount of money </garnt>
<garnt> that they really shouldn't
have been making. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause don't a lot of the... </connor>
<connor> Because obviously when you
watch something pirated, </connor>
<connor> it's not using a standard YouTube player </connor>
<connor> or like a normal... </connor>
<connor> It's using one of those really
sketchy third-party websites </connor>
<joey> that hosts anything. </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure those websites as well, </joey>
<joey> a lot of the ones they were using </joey>
<joey> would pay you to host files. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right.
- Like video files, </joey>
<garnt> because they wanted their
player to become more universal. </garnt>
<garnt> So a lot of these were also... </garnt>
<garnt> KissAnime at the time,
again, I'm not sure, </garnt>
<connor> but from what I understood,
they were getting ad revenue, </connor>
<connor> like a lot of it, I imagine, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you've gone on that website </connor>
<connor> and you've got like, what, 10 fucking ads? </connor>
<garnt> - Hot asian dating- </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughing) Hot singles in your area. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like always fucking
Lois from "Family Guy" </connor>
<connor> being rammed, and it's like,
I'm just trying to watch anime, </connor>
<garnt> what is this? </garnt>
<garnt> - And that'd be always like
these shitty hentai games </garnt>
<connor> that would be advertised. </connor>
<connor> I think one time I was watching something </connor>
<garnt> and just this advert of like Cunt Wars </garnt>
<garnt> or a game called that, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, is this for real? </garnt>
<joey> Is this for real right now? </joey>
<joey> I think that's a real game, </joey>
<joey> because that just stook out of my mind. </joey>
<connor> - To be fair, I want to play Cunt Wars </connor>
<joey> just from the fucking name of it. </joey>
<connor> - I love Rentokil, I'm joking. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Don't you accidentally
click on those ads sometimes, </garnt>
<connor> and then once you click
it's like, boom, boom, </connor>
<connor> all these pop-up windows. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like "Boom, boom, boom, </connor>
<garnt> sex free now in your area," like that. </garnt>
<joey> So they were getting like
double-dipping ad revenue. </joey>
<joey> They were getting paid to host the files, </joey>
<joey> and they were... </joey>
<joey> Sorry, I leaned back, I
always fucking do that. </joey>
<garnt> Okay, so, they were
getting like double ad rev </garnt>
<garnt> basically, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So, and then, you know, people on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> which I disagree with, I think you can... </garnt>
<garnt> Say, okay, there is a need for piracy </garnt>
<garnt> in some extents, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But then there's people who're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Boohoo KissAnime man", </garnt>
<joey> it's just like, they're
doing the real hard work. </joey>
<joey> It's like, are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> It's probably like four
dudes racking in millions, </joey>
<joey> but I wouldn't like feel
sorry for them, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - So, I didn't see the full story </joey>
<joey> of like how they got shut down. </joey>
<garnt> - I assume they just got
shut down by some DMCA claim. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, but at the same... </joey>
<garnt> Because they've had their
thing shut down several times, </garnt>
<garnt> right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like they went from like kissanime.com </garnt>
<garnt> to like .net to like
.ru eventually, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And then when that happened, </garnt>
<garnt> there was also like, obviously not as big </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't think there
were articles about it, </garnt>
<garnt> but people were definitely making a fuss </garnt>
<garnt> of like, "Oh no, KissAnime is down." </garnt>
<garnt> And then two weeks later,
they're back with a new url. </garnt>
<garnt> So, that's what I just assumed
when I saw that article. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, oh, they'll
be back in like two weeks. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's the first
time they've put in </connor>
<joey> like a message saying
like, yeah, it's over. </joey>
<garnt> - On their discord, right?
- I think so, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't even know
why they had a discord. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who the fuck is in
the KissAnime discord? </garnt>
<garnt> - Why would you need a discord? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like, I love KissAnime so much, </garnt>
<joey> I'm going to join the discord. </joey>
<connor> - There's always that
argument that people present </connor>
<connor> where it's like, what
is it, Gabe Newell said, </connor>
<connor> like piracy is a service
problem or something? </connor>
<connor> - I think it's gone way past that now, </connor>
<connor> because the piracy is a
service problem argument </connor>
<connor> always gets brought up and it's just like, </connor>
<garnt> it's a different situation
with the anime industry I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Games is a really different thing. </garnt>
<connor> Have you ever tried to pirate a game? </connor>
<connor> Like that shit is annoying,
like straight up, just annoying. </connor>
<garnt> - But one thing I find
unique to anime piracy, </garnt>
<garnt> and even hentai to the
same extent as well, </garnt>
<garnt> is that in no other industry do I see </garnt>
<garnt> a pirate service get the branding power </garnt>
<connor> that it does in anime.
- It's true. </connor>
<connor> - If you want to pirate a movie, </connor>
<connor> or if you wanna pirate a game, </connor>
<connor> where'd you go for that? </connor>
<connor> You probably go to Google, right? </connor>
<garnt> But there's no like, "Oh
yes, there's kiss gaming, </garnt>
<garnt> I go to kiss gaming every day,
I would die if kiss gaming... </garnt>
<garnt> Are you part of the kiss gaming discord?" </garnt>
<connor> - I downloaded Cunt Wars
on kiss gaming. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - But you don't see that
in any other industry. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, I don't know why </connor>
<connor> it is specifically to
like the anime and manga </connor>
<connor> and then like hentai circles </connor>
<garnt> where piracy just has this branding power. </garnt>
<garnt> Where people will gather
behind this service </garnt>
<garnt> which is just like any
other pirate service, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean?
- Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> Because I remember, </joey>
<joey> I think it was right before
Hentai Haven got shut down </joey>
<garnt> as well, </garnt>
<joey> I remember they messaged me being like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey do you wanna promote our merch line?" </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "I'm not
promoting a merch line </connor>
<connor> for a fucking pirating website." </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> That's like, if Pirate Bay was like, </connor>
<connor> "Bro, we've got like these-"
- They actually? </connor>
<garnt> - I can say that because they gone, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, they fully did that. </garnt>
<garnt> And, I remember I messaged a few people </garnt>
<garnt> just being like, does this seem right? </garnt>
<garnt> I think I'm missing something here. </garnt>
<joey> I don't think this is right.
(Gigguk laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - You're not the only person,
but it wasn't Hentai Haven, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh really?
- It was KissAnime. </garnt>
<garnt> - They messaged you?
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So KissAnime were going
to open like a store, </garnt>
<joey> they were going to open a store. </joey>
<garnt> And they messaged me being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, do you wanna promote our store?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I was there sitting, are
these guys for real? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> What makes you think you're
gonna get away with this? </garnt>
<garnt> And they had like an entire store page </garnt>
<garnt> that they linked me to, </garnt>
<garnt> and obviously it was
like official products </garnt>
<garnt> that were being sold
unofficially, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Were they typing to you or
writing to you in clear English </garnt>
<garnt> or is it broken English? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it was actually in clear English. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it in Russian? (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - No, it was like a proper
store and everything, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like, man,
the balls on these guys. </garnt>
<joey> - The Hentai Haven store as well was like, </joey>
<joey> he had already even made
like a landing page for it. </joey>
<garnt> And he was like, this is
the lineup for the stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like, t-shirts, </garnt>
<joey> obviously it wasn't anything
too amazingly well-designed, </joey>
<joey> but you know it was just simple stuff, </joey>
<joey> like the Hentai Haven logo
on a t-shirt or something. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, ah, no! </joey>
<joey> And then two weeks later, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I think it was maybe
like two or three weeks later, </joey>
<joey> they got like, that whole thing happened </joey>
<joey> where they got shut down, right? </joey>
<connor> - I wonder if it comes from disdain </connor>
<connor> from the major companies
more so than them, </connor>
<joey> 'cause they don't actively brand anything. </joey>
<joey> They don't do anything. </joey>
<joey> They don't have like a hehe
funny Twitter account right? </joey>
<garnt> Like KissAnime never did anything. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's just because-
- It's all community driven. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think a lot of the community </garnt>
<garnt> just does not like the
big guys, which, whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - They're easy to share too.
- Yeah, they are. </connor>
<connor> - If your friend doesn't have an account </connor>
<joey> and they're new to anime </joey>
<joey> and you're trying to get them to anime, </joey>
<joey> you'll link them to like a pirate site. </joey>
<joey> - And also it works in
every country, right? </joey>
<joey> A lot of the unofficial stuff.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> I do think there is a space for piracy. </garnt>
<garnt> I made an entire video on Fansubs </garnt>
<garnt> and how that was really really
important for the community </garnt>
<joey> and how it helped it grow. </joey>
<joey> And I wanna make that argument, </joey>
<joey> that I do think there is a space </joey>
<garnt> where piracy did very much did play a part </garnt>
<garnt> in helping anime grow, especially abroad. </garnt>
<joey> But I think it has gotten to the point now </joey>
<garnt> that anime, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't have that same effect anymore </garnt>
<garnt> because anime is now big enough </garnt>
<garnt> where everyone knows anime. </garnt>
<garnt> So I think there's still
like a lot of countries </garnt>
<garnt> where that kinda need
piracy to help boost anime </garnt>
<garnt> to make this a truly global medium. </garnt>
<garnt> But places like the U.S and the UK </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know places where you
have a lot more accessibility </garnt>
<garnt> and the fandom is a bit bigger, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like that argument
doesn't hold as much water </garnt>
<garnt> as it did fucking 10 years
ago or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean 10 years ago, I mean,
no, even further beyond that, </connor>
<connor> the whole Western community
came from piracy, right? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause you had to get
like a bootleg, like VH... </garnt>
<garnt> Why, I say H like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - VHS.
- VHS tape, right? </garnt>
<joey> You had to get a bootleg one,
it was all shared around. </joey>
<garnt> It wasn't all piracy, but
obviously like you said, </garnt>
<garnt> it's growing out of that. </garnt>
<connor> And I guess some people
wanna hold onto that </connor>
<connor> and argue that's how it should be. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's the biggest
problem though, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that a lot of the discussion </joey>
<joey> that revolves especially
around anime piracy </joey>
<connor> is like, both sides of the
argument is very very much </connor>
<connor> situated on both sides
of the spectrum, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like you either hard agree
that piracy in anime is bad, </connor>
<garnt> or you hard disagree. </garnt>
<garnt> Like there's very rarely any people </garnt>
<joey> who are kinda like, there's benefits, </joey>
<joey> but there's also demerits to it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm definitely someone who's
in the middle. (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> It's hard for me to get involved </joey>
<joey> in any discussion on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> Because if you say anything, </joey>
<joey> they either put you on
one side or the other. </joey>
<joey> You're either like hard into piracy </joey>
<garnt> or you're like a fucking Crunchyroll </garnt>
<garnt> and Funimation or Book Walker
shit, right? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Filthy Book Walker shell. </garnt>
<garnt> - I work at Book Walker. </garnt>
<connor> I know I probably shouldn't say this, </connor>
<garnt> but I'm in between. </garnt>
<garnt> The only reason, I'm
technically in this industry </garnt>
<connor> or I got interested was because
there were pirate sites. </connor>
<connor> - They got you into it, right?
- Yeah, and I got into it. </connor>
<garnt> And now there's just so
many subtitles available, </garnt>
<garnt> so many platforms,
there's really no excuse, </garnt>
<garnt> but if you wanna see something
fast and in low quality </garnt>
<garnt> and maybe the translations are out </garnt>
<garnt> because it's stuck in Netflix, sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - One question I always had about, </garnt>
<garnt> on the Japanese side of things is that, </garnt>
<garnt> how aware are the Japanese companies </garnt>
<garnt> of all these pirate sites? </garnt>
<garnt> - Very aware.
- Are they very aware? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've talked to...
- It feels very Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> where like, "We don't care, I sleep. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, you're pirating our anime? I'm woke." </connor>
<garnt> - They care, they're
very strict, especially, </garnt>
<garnt> not talking about like websites,
but for example, YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we know. </garnt>
<joey> - Feyus is not a thing
in Japan, unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> - When we've worked with sponsors, </joey>
<garnt> if we want a show just to
get screenshot in anime, </garnt>
<joey> if they're sponsoring it,
they'll bring that up. </joey>
<garnt> Like, "Could you have brides
to show the screenshot?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, it doesn't matter. </garnt>
<garnt> If they have a problem... </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I guess the YouTube mentality is, </garnt>
<garnt> if it's a problem, they'll
let us know, right? </garnt>
<garnt> We're all copywriters,
whatever, we'll fight it. </garnt>
<garnt> Or if it's really unfair </garnt>
<garnt> and I've just uploaded
the 10-minute "Family Guy" </garnt>
<joey> or 24-hour "Family Guy" stream, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I probably shouldn't
be doing that, right? </joey>
<joey> But most of the time it's like, </joey>
<garnt> if they have a problem they
can come and tell us, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like they're very
much a risk-averse mindset </garnt>
<connor> where it's like, just don't
ever allow that situation </connor>
<connor> to happen. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like on the Book
Walker side of things, </garnt>
<garnt> how much of an effect do
you guys see on piracy </garnt>
<garnt> on your side of things </garnt>
<garnt> and how do you go about
justifying that as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a hard question.
- - That's a toughie. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a loaded question,
that's a hella loaded question. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, if you don't have
an answer, that's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't really
have like a huge answer. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, Book Walker's technically very new, </garnt>
<garnt> and despite it being around
for almost five years, </garnt>
<garnt> when a pirate site goes down, </garnt>
<garnt> we don't see that much of effect </garnt>
<garnt> because our users, </garnt>
<garnt> the people who have been
coming to our store every month </garnt>
<garnt> are the type of people who
want to support the industry. </garnt>
<garnt> So if people have been stealing for years </garnt>
<connor> and they don't have money,
even if the site goes down, </connor>
<garnt> they're not gonna come to our store. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like in the West, </garnt>
<garnt> but in Japan, there's this site called, </garnt>
<joey> or used to be a site, you
probably know it Joey, </joey>
<joey> Manga Muda?
- Yeah, Manga Muda. </joey>
<joey> - When it went down, there
was a huge increase in sales. </joey>
<joey> - Manga Muda was basically
like the KissManga of Japan. </joey>
<joey> It was one of the biggest
manga pirating site, </joey>
<joey> and that got like properly shut down. </joey>
<garnt> The founders were like straight up charged </garnt>
<joey> and went to jail and everything. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I assume the thing happened </joey>
<garnt> to a big Western app recently
which was manga rock, </garnt>
<garnt> that got shot down. </garnt>
<garnt> - They didn't really shut down. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did they not? </garnt>
<connor> - They like pivoted and shut it. </connor>
<garnt> They shut down the app in many ways, </garnt>
<connor> and then were like, "Hey,
we have other stuff, </connor>
<connor> check it out." </connor>
<joey> - They pulled a .ru basically. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - But after they shut down,
did you see any change at all </garnt>
<garnt> or increase in traffic or
sales or anything on your side? </garnt>
<garnt> - Not so much I would say. </garnt>
<garnt> Because they also, I don't
know if I should share this, </garnt>
<garnt> Book Walkers more popular
for light novel readers, </garnt>
<garnt> and usually pirate sites have manga. </garnt>
<connor> So when they wanna read something </connor>
<connor> like, I don't know, longer or whatever </connor>
<garnt> and they wanna pirate it, </garnt>
<garnt> they're going to stick
to other pirate sites. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there any noticeable difference </connor>
<connor> between the spending habits of Westerners </connor>
<garnt> and Japanese on manga? </garnt>
<garnt> Anything that you're allowed to tell us? </garnt>
<joey> - Because I think the general stereotype </joey>
<joey> is that the Western audience
is very fucking stingy. </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, extremely stingy. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember it, 'cause I
think I had this mindset </connor>
<garnt> of I'm not paying for any media. </garnt>
<garnt> Like when I was like 13, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I grew up with just
like pirating everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I think once you take that step </garnt>
<garnt> of paying for media, I
think you don't go back. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you're like, whoa,
that was really easy. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the thing I always feel piracy- </garnt>
<garnt> (Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I've always said, </garnt>
<garnt> piracy isn't exactly a bad thing, </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel it's just a stepping stone </garnt>
<garnt> towards getting into the actual fandom. </garnt>
<garnt> And then once you're mature enough </garnt>
<joey> and you've made your own
money and what not... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I do think most of the time, </connor>
<connor> I'm not saying it all the time, </connor>
<garnt> it's normally the younger
ones who are diehard piracy </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like, yeah, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> that normally comes from
having no income at all- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe your parents give
you like 10 bucks a month </garnt>
<connor> or something, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> You can't spend that on- </connor>
<joey> - You're not spending that online, right? </joey>
<connor> Like, no one's gonna do that. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It makes sense then that you
hopefully transition into it, </connor>
<joey> and when you get older and
you get more monkey brained </joey>
<garnt> like myself, it becomes
really fucking annoying </garnt>
<garnt> when you are looking for 10 plus minutes </garnt>
<joey> to just find the link to
watch what you wanna watch. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, I will throw 10 bucks </joey>
<joey> to make this problem go away. </joey>
<joey> I wanna watch it comfortably and just- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, reliably. </joey>
<joey> - But then there's people who argue like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, well there isn't
good services to watch anime </joey>
<joey> or read manga," there is, </joey>
<joey> it's just, most of the time
people don't wanna admit that. </joey>
<garnt> Even using Crunchyroll here
in Japan, it's a bit of a pain </garnt>
<garnt> because I have to use a VPN. </garnt>
<garnt> It's still less annoying
than going to KissAnime, </garnt>
<garnt> opening up five fuckin' tabs,
pressing pause six times </garnt>
<garnt> before all the ads... </garnt>
<garnt> You all know this, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you used to the
websites when you know </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> how many times do you have to press play </garnt>
<garnt> before it actually plays? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's three times, three
is the magic number, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's always three. </garnt>
<garnt> - You better fucking hope to God </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have to pause that bitch, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause if you pause that bitch </connor>
<connor> and you wanna press play again, </connor>
<garnt> you know you got more problems. </garnt>
<garnt> - I always wanna skip the anime opening </garnt>
<connor> and I know to skip the anime opening, </connor>
<garnt> the cost you pay is three extra clicks, </garnt>
<garnt> just because you wanna
skip the anime opening. </garnt>
<connor> - And sometimes, you
completely fuck the buffering, </connor>
<joey> and you've got to reload the whole thing- </joey>
<joey> - And then it all starts again, right? </joey>
<joey> - and then before it plays, </joey>
<joey> you cannot allow this thing to play. </joey>
<garnt> You need to skip to 1 minute 30 </garnt>
<garnt> before it even allows to buffer, </garnt>
<garnt> because it might fuck up
and you cannot rebuffer. </garnt>
<connor> So, I just wanna avoid that dance- </connor>
<joey> - And that's exactly why
I stopped using KissAnime </joey>
<garnt> like four years ago. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I'm just like,
I'm better than this. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna go through this torture. </connor>
<garnt> - And Chromecast exists now, right? </garnt>
<connor> I wanna cast that shit to my TV. </connor>
<connor> - I just wanna press one
button and it goes on my TV. </connor>
<garnt> You can't do that with pirate sites, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - For android you can, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Some of them you can,
but it doesn't always work. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, sometimes you'll be watching it </garnt>
<garnt> and you'll be like, okay, cool, </garnt>
<connor> episode one allows me to Chromecast. </connor>
<connor> Episode two, none of these
web players on the mirrors </connor>
<connor> allow you to Chromecast, then
you're like, fuck's sake! </connor>
<joey> - It's the YouTube anime
like part seventies missing </joey>
<joey> problems all over again, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, do I just cave in </joey>
<connor> and just watch this on my phone </connor>
<joey> and just be really annoyed for 20 minutes, </joey>
<joey> or do I, you know... </joey>
<connor> And that happens to me
and I have to do that </connor>
<connor> because obviously sometimes
Crunchyroll doesn't have it, </connor>
<connor> and there's no way for
me to get it, and it's... </connor>
<connor> Or Netflix, fuck Netflix Japan
not having English subtitles. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I fucking hate that. </garnt>
<garnt> I've not been able to watch so many shows </garnt>
<garnt> that should be available to me because- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you put the Netflix to UK, </connor>
<connor> boom, it has English subtitles. </connor>
<connor> Why can't you just put the subtitles </connor>
<connor> on the Japanese Netflix? </connor>
<connor> You have the subtitles, why
would you not offer them? </connor>
<connor> - I don't have that problem. </connor>
<garnt> - Motherfucker! </garnt>
<garnt> - If you wait a few months
though, it'll show up. </garnt>
<garnt> If you wait a few months, </garnt>
<garnt> the subtitles do get on there. </garnt>
<connor> - Great, I'll just wait a few months, </connor>
<connor> I'll just wait a few months.
- For "Baki"- </connor>
<connor> - No, "Baki" they were
there straight away. </connor>
<joey> - Were they?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - "Baki" were there straight away. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fucking rolling a dice </garnt>
<garnt> whether Netflix will put
English subtitles on it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, Oh, maybe it will. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I'll go watch this anime, </garnt>
<garnt> put it on, no subtitles, fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> - Like one thing I never got </garnt>
<garnt> about some of the
reactions I see on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> is, if you're gonna
pirate anime, that's fine, </garnt>
<joey> I know plenty of people pirate anime. </joey>
<joey> But there's been this movement recently </joey>
<joey> that I've seen where people are just like </joey>
<joey> fucking proud of this shit. </joey>
<joey> Like, you should pirate
anime, that helps everything. </joey>
<joey> That helps the industry. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, bro, I get it. </joey>
<garnt> You wanna pirate anime? Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I do it, everyone fucking
does it, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> But there's a difference between, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, yeah, I watched
some of my shows pirated," </garnt>
<garnt> to, "Yeah, I stand up for this shit, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna defend this shit." (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I don't get that. </connor>
<connor> - I think what it's maybe come from, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, I'm speculating here </garnt>
<joey> is that you get so many influences </joey>
<garnt> and people in the industry </garnt>
<garnt> who actively shame people who
admit that they pirate, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And even us, probably talking about </garnt>
<garnt> saying that we admit that we
pirate is a pretty risky move. </garnt>
<garnt> Crunchyroll could easily turn around </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, "We never worked
with you again," right? </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you for the free
account, by the way, I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> I do actually use my Crunchyroll account, </garnt>
<garnt> thank you Miles, I love you. </garnt>
<connor> But, just us mentioning that we pirate, </connor>
<connor> maybe there's some other
YouTubers out there </connor>
<connor> that would be like, "How dare
you admit that you pirate? </connor>
<connor> You should be a role model to those." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's like
saying like, you know, </joey>
<joey> Oh no I didn't drink until I turned 18. </joey>
<joey> I was like bullshit, </joey>
<joey> everyone drinks before they turn 18. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but, you're not
there as a 16 year old </garnt>
<garnt> being like, "Guys, I'm
getting fucking hammered </garnt>
<garnt> in the middle of the fucking
city," you know. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I am proud to defy the law. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I had alcohol before I was 18, </garnt>
<garnt> which is the legal drinking age in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> but I wasn't there shouting it out </garnt>
<garnt> for every fucking parent to see. </garnt>
<garnt> I wasn't there in the fucking
off license being like, </garnt>
<connor> "Hey, by the way, I'm 16,
sell me your fucking alcohol." </connor>
<garnt> - I'm doing something illegal. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's so much more
approachable for viewers </connor>
<connor> and people who watch us </connor>
<connor> and especially people in
industry to admit like, </connor>
<joey> "Hey, at one point I did pirate, </joey>
<joey> but even now I still
pirate when I have to." </joey>
<joey> - What's important is the word "did", </joey>
<connor> right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's that you did pirate </connor>
<joey> but you don't actively only
rely on pirating now, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, if I have a choice to
pay and get it done easily, </connor>
<joey> I will 'cause I'm lazy
and that's what I'll do. </joey>
<joey> But I think having this mindset </joey>
<joey> of you can never admit that you pirate, </joey>
<joey> you can never speak
doesn't have any merits. </joey>
<joey> I feel like it just
actively pushes people away </joey>
<connor> from having any form of
constructive argument. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I think
actually most people </garnt>
<garnt> would fit somewhere in the middle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so.
- But the only takes </garnt>
<garnt> we see on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> is either people actively
like slut-shaming piracy </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that- </garnt>
<joey> - Or simping on piracy.
- or just simping on piracy. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, not neither
of these are correct, </joey>
<garnt> and I don't know why
these are the only takes </garnt>
<garnt> I see on Twitter. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I think it's wild, </connor>
<connor> one thing that drives
a lot of people away, </connor>
<connor> especially from the bigger figures, </connor>
<connor> like a lot of the voice actors </connor>
<connor> and a lot of people in
the industry is that </connor>
<connor> just actively saying, "You are
wrong, I am in this industry, </connor>
<joey> I know better than you." </joey>
<joey> Okay, there is a sense of that, right? </joey>
<joey> You are in the industry, </joey>
<joey> so maybe you have a bit more of a point, </joey>
<joey> but as far as a voice actor goes, </joey>
<joey> it's like, you have no
fucking say in what happens, </joey>
<joey> you're doing a job,
you're doing a service. </joey>
<joey> Like as far as you're concerned, </joey>
<joey> you're just in the show </joey>
<garnt> and that's where your commitments end. </garnt>
<garnt> You've no bearing on the show. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're not in the industry.
- Oh no, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that a lot
of these voice actors </garnt>
<garnt> are also forced then to like, you can't, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the way the industry works, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't be to your
friend, no, you're wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Because if you're seen as problematic, </garnt>
<garnt> like, it's serious. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're seen as problematic, </garnt>
<garnt> well maybe a director won't hire you, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause you're known for being
a bit of a dick on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right.
- You don't support, </joey>
<joey> you said anime piracy was good. </joey>
<connor> We wanted to hire you,
but I guess, piracy- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I think a lot
of people don't realize </garnt>
<garnt> that just actively shaming people, </garnt>
<garnt> will just push them
away to the other side. </garnt>
<garnt> And it doesn't work by saying,
"Hey, you shouldn't pirate, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a bad thing," even
though technically, it is. </garnt>
<garnt> But that doesn't mean that
people don't pirate for a reason. </garnt>
<joey> - As weird as it is to say, </joey>
<joey> it's like a really weird
form of gate-keeping, almost. </joey>
<joey> It's almost like a reverse gatekeeping </joey>
<garnt> where it's like, if you pirate, </garnt>
<garnt> then you'll not a real anime fan, </garnt>
<garnt> you really don't support the industry. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, no, you can. </garnt>
<garnt> You can eventually get to that point, </garnt>
<connor> but you have to start somewhere, right? </connor>
<connor> And if piracy is your only option, </connor>
<joey> then piracy is your only option. </joey>
<connor> - I saw, like, it was like
a tweet, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> That was one of the takes that was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's not available in your country? </connor>
<connor> Tough, it wasn't made for you." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, Whoa. </connor>
<connor> It's like, yeah, okay, no one
has right to anything, right? </connor>
<connor> But also if you can't get it legally </connor>
<joey> and you're a fan of the stuff, </joey>
<connor> like, yeah, fuck it, who cares? </connor>
<connor> Pirate that shit, there's no
way for you to pay for it. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand why this
is such a, "No, you can't." </connor>
<joey> - There was another
fucking' horrible take, </joey>
<connor> which was like, "Anime is a
luxury," you remember that one? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - We saw like this list
of horrible arguments </connor>
<connor> towards piracy, and it was
like, "Anime is a luxury, </connor>
<connor> And you should really be proven lucky </connor>
<joey> that you even get the chance
to watch any of this stuff." </joey>
<joey> I was like, it's just a fuckin'
cartoon bro, like chill. </joey>
<connor> - I know some people
who work like two jobs, </connor>
<garnt> have no fucking money </garnt>
<garnt> and they can't afford the like
three subscriptions they need </garnt>
<garnt> to watch all the shows they want. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, dude, kick back and
relax, you deserve that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> You've been working hard,
man, I don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<connor> If someone is broke as fuck, </connor>
<connor> I would not shame them for
pirating, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> - I think that we can all agree </connor>
<connor> that probably the worst take </connor>
<joey> is the whole anime merch take, right? </joey>
<joey> Like the, "I buy anime merch, </joey>
<joey> and therefore I have the right to pirate." </joey>
<connor> - I think we all buy a
lot of anime merch, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Used to, right?
- I used to buy a lot. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, tell us the reason why- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, why is it past tense? </joey>
<garnt> - The real reason is just, just kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't share that. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's too much tea in this episode, </joey>
<garnt> the tea's being spilled. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, but what are you, </garnt>
<joey> as someone who actually
works in the industry, </joey>
<joey> what do you feel about that argument, </joey>
<joey> of like the, "I buy anime merch, </joey>
<joey> so therefore I have the right
to pirate," kinda thing? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, you can't use it as a reason </garnt>
<garnt> because I think, I don't
know how to explain this. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, for example, royalties for goods, </garnt>
<garnt> so I've heard from friends in the industry </garnt>
<garnt> that they go to different departments. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not always directly
to that specific creator. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, what are you saying? </garnt>
<garnt> If they buy merch, </garnt>
<garnt> the money still doesn't go
back to the original creator? </garnt>
<garnt> - It does, it depends, I think,
on the contract they had, </garnt>
<garnt> so I've heard
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not in that department. </garnt>
<connor> - I imagine the bigger
of a brand the anime is, </connor>
<connor> the easier it is to get a better deal </connor>
<connor> in terms of royalties
and costs, I imagine. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause one thing
that always confuses me </garnt>
<garnt> is that people think that, </garnt>
<garnt> I know there's lots of
arguments that have been made </garnt>
<connor> that doing X worth is better </connor>
<connor> for supporting the industry than doing Y, </connor>
<connor> and I dunno how much, like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know where they're
getting this information from, </connor>
<connor> 'cause none of these people
are working in the industry. </connor>
<connor> So every argument I see
on both sides of things </connor>
<joey> a lot of the times just anecdotal- </joey>
<joey> - It's just speculation.
- and speculation. </joey>
<garnt> - There's no theory behind it. </garnt>
<garnt> They're just like, Oh, I
feel good buying merch. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels like if I buy official merch, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's tied to that particular IP, </garnt>
<garnt> you just feel like, Oh, I'm supporting it, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm helping to spread the love, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm putting money into
something that's official. </garnt>
<garnt> So therefore in the back of their head, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just like, yeah, that's
gonna go back to the creator </garnt>
<garnt> in some way, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like they own it.
- I mean, it's better </garnt>
<garnt> than not doing anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, </garnt>
<joey> but is it the best way to
support that particular creator </joey>
<joey> of the IP? </joey>
<garnt> No.
- Not the best, </garnt>
<garnt> but better than nothing. </garnt>
<connor> - So the best wages, legally streaming? </connor>
<connor> Paying for the services? </connor>
<connor> Is that the best way in your opinion? </connor>
<garnt> - I've heard that the DVDs,
Blu-ray DVDs for example, </garnt>
<connor> in Japan, I'm not sure about the U.S, </connor>
<joey> but in Japan, buying the
Blu-ray DVDs is the best. </joey>
<joey> That's when they know like- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause they measure success </connor>
<garnt> from Blu-ray sales, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that and like the
original sources sale- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like the manga
and stuff like that, </garnt>
<joey> I've heard that.
- That's what I've heard. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I always try to
make sure I buy my manga </garnt>
<garnt> firsthand now. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, even if it's an older series </garnt>
<garnt> where I can easily go to
a bulk offer or something </garnt>
<garnt> and buy it for 100 Yen, </garnt>
<garnt> I always just try and go to the bookstore, </garnt>
<joey> the first-hand book store. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've heard that
is truly the best way </joey>
<joey> to support the creator, right? </joey>
<connor> - I guess 'cause when it's pre-owned- </connor>
<garnt> - The royalties don't go. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I mean like 2/3 of my JoJo merch </garnt>
<garnt> is pre-owned stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's because it's like-
- You can't get that stuff </garnt>
<joey> anymore, 'cause for some reason- </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't made for you, it
wasn't available at the time. </joey>
<garnt> You don't deserve it. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I deserve all the JoJo merch. </garnt>
<garnt> I spent thousands of dollars
on like Yahoo auction, </garnt>
<garnt> but none of that goes to... </garnt>
<garnt> Because a lot of the time as well, </garnt>
<connor> like this merch is like
what, like 100 bucks? </connor>
<connor> And then two years later on Yahoo auction </connor>
<connor> it's 300 bucks and someone
made a nice profit. </connor>
<connor> I mean good for them. </connor>
<joey> - Araki's definitely not seen that profit. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, anything that
I've bought that's brand new </connor>
<connor> is probably the Jump store
stuff that we both bought, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause the JoJo exhibition
museum was canceled </garnt>
<garnt> and normally you have to
go to the JoJo exhibition </garnt>
<garnt> to get the stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> but they were like, "Hey, you
can just order it online." </garnt>
<garnt> So I ordered like-
- You got the suits. </garnt>
<garnt> - The suits as well I got, </garnt>
<garnt> but the thing is, with the suits, </garnt>
<garnt> that's Bandai collaboration
with Perfect Suit Factory. </garnt>
<joey> So there's like two companies
that are making this thing </joey>
<joey> before it gets to the-
- They're taking most of it. </joey>
<joey> - So, like these $500 suits, </joey>
<joey> how many of that goes to Shonen Jump </joey>
<connor> and then, are like.. </connor>
<connor> Like the animators aren't
seeing that shit, right? </connor>
<connor> The animators are still underpaid as fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't think
there's anything we can do for- </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, they're underpaid
because it's just Japan's salary, </garnt>
<garnt> the average salary in Japan- </garnt>
<joey> - Mike! </joey>
<garnt> - Man, Mike is taking a beating. </garnt>
<garnt> - The average salary in general is low. </garnt>
<garnt> - (Joey and Gigguk) Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like with animators, </garnt>
<joey> it's a systematic problem
with how the industry works </joey>
<joey> as a whole. </joey>
<joey> - That's a whole other can of worms. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a whole other can of worms. </garnt>
<connor> - That's also just like Japanese culture. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's a whole
different argument to be had. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think one thing I see </garnt>
<garnt> with a lot of like Western
Twitter and Western people </garnt>
<garnt> is that I feel like they don't
want to support the industry, </garnt>
<garnt> mostly because they're not happy with </garnt>
<garnt> some of these bigger companies </garnt>
<garnt> or the image of like say
Crunchyroll or Funimation </garnt>
<garnt> and it's less of, "I don't
wanna support the industry," </garnt>
<garnt> and more of, "I don't wanna
support these companies </garnt>
<joey> in particular. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you don't wanna
support the companies </joey>
<joey> that are representing the
industry in our country, right? </joey>
<connor> - I can understand it at times </connor>
<connor> 'cause there's a lot of
arguments that people make </connor>
<connor> like underpaying translators
that comes up a lot, </connor>
<joey> and you know, like last year, </joey>
<joey> it was voice actor of Funimation. </joey>
<joey> Like, there's a lot of reasons </joey>
<garnt> why people might not want to, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's tough, 'cause it's- </connor>
<garnt> - Because I don't think there's
a right or wrong argument </garnt>
<garnt> but what I feel sometimes is that </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of people won't
support the industry, </garnt>
<connor> unless there's like a perfect system </connor>
<connor> where all the money they go
to goes to this one creator. </connor>
<connor> They wanna-
- Utopian system? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like a utopian system </connor>
<connor> where every creator has a
fucking Patreon or something </connor>
<garnt> and they can support any creator they want </garnt>
<garnt> and how much they want, </garnt>
<garnt> and that's just not a business
model, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like a lot of
people use that justification </garnt>
<garnt> to say, "Hey we're not
supporting the creator </garnt>
<garnt> how I want to support the creator. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just not gonna support anything." </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like there must be
a better way to go about it </garnt>
<joey> than that because there's never
gonna be a perfect system. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, Trigger kinda
did the right thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> They have a Patreon, </garnt>
<connor> they have a Twitch stream
where they do like- </connor>
<connor> - How much does their
Patreon get at the moment? </connor>
<joey> - I'm not too sure, but-
- I think I checked, </joey>
<connor> and I was like, that is
nowhere near enough to- </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, definitely not. </connor>
<garnt> It's basically just like
a side revenue for them. </garnt>
<garnt> But at least it's a way </garnt>
<garnt> that will actually go
directly to the studio, </garnt>
<garnt> and is a payment method or donation method </garnt>
<joey> that Westerners are very
familiar with, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's good to have just an option </connor>
<garnt> to do something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, Hey, do you wanna
directly support the studio? </garnt>
<connor> And like, you know-
- I think Pixie has that. </connor>
<garnt> It's not a studio, but like
there are some illustrators. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, Pixie kinda has
that as well, definitely. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, that's really the only thing </joey>
<joey> and barely anybody's utilizing it. </joey>
<joey> I've never heard of a
manga artist using Patreon. </joey>
<connor> - Is it like a pride thing in Japan? </connor>
<connor> Like not wanting to ask people for money? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like begging is
really like not a thing here. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, culturally
begging is not a thing, </joey>
<joey> not even for homeless people. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, homeless people just
do their own thing like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's true, I've never seen
a homeless person begging. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's really disrespectful, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's not a thing here. </garnt>
<garnt> Even the homeless here are respectful </garnt>
<joey> where they're just like, "No,
no, no, keep your money." </joey>
<connor> - Like, "I'm homeless,
I still have my pride." </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's just a
different culture altogether. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a lot of it that
comes down to that there </connor>
<connor> I think in the industry and
how people want it to change. </connor>
<connor> It's just not going to. </connor>
<joey> - I also think a really
big root of the problem, </joey>
<joey> when it comes to at
least the anime industry </joey>
<joey> is that they truly, even
though in my experience, </joey>
<joey> having done stuff with a
lot of different studios </joey>
<joey> and productions and whatnot in anime, </joey>
<joey> they're aware of the Western industry, </joey>
<joey> they just don't really
give a shit about them. </joey>
<garnt> - I would say they care a lot, </garnt>
<joey> they just don't know what to do. </joey>
<garnt> - It's not their first priority though. </garnt>
<joey> The first priority is always
the Japanese market, right? </joey>
<garnt> And that's how they measure their success. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, of course I'm sure
all of these studios now, </connor>
<connor> it's 2020, right? </connor>
<connor> Like I think most of them are aware now </connor>
<connor> that there are way more Western fans </connor>
<connor> who are into their anime </connor>
<connor> than there will ever be
Japanese fans, right? </connor>
<connor> But-
- I mean, in China alone- </connor>
<connor> - Or just Southeast Asia. </connor>
<connor> - All the mobile games
coming out of China. </connor>
<connor> - Even if you just look at Southeast Asia, </connor>
<connor> that's more people just in general </connor>
<connor> who will watch the anime
and enjoy the anime </connor>
<connor> and be willing to spend the money on it. </connor>
<connor> But because the Japanese
anime industry is, </connor>
<connor> a lot of it is so old fashioned, </connor>
<garnt> and thinking just locally,
that they just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, we understand that
there are all these people </garnt>
<garnt> out here who are probably
willing to pay for our stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> we just don't know how to do it. </garnt>
<connor> We can't be bothered to
figure out how to do it." </connor>
<connor> - Japanese culture in
general though, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just like, for example, </connor>
<connor> the DVD and Blu-ray business model </connor>
<connor> is just not going to work abroad, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> I mean, it can prop up the
anime industry here in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and it has for the longest time, </garnt>
<garnt> but it took them like how
many years to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> that people just don't
wanna buy DVDs and Blu-ray? </garnt>
<joey> - That's like if Crunchyroll was like, </joey>
<garnt> "We're gonna open up a
blockbuster tomorrow, </garnt>
<garnt> come on in and rent your DVDs." </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, no, it's not...(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's shocking how many people in Japan </garnt>
<joey> do not know streaming services. </joey>
<joey> Like even young people are just not aware. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Oh, you can
watch anime on Netflix?" </joey>
<garnt> - They usually record it on
their TV when it's playing live. </garnt>
<garnt> - but it's like, I'm not
staying up until 3:00 AM </garnt>
<joey> to watch a fucking run. </joey>
<connor> - I've never seen a place
where they sell CRT TV so much. </connor>
<garnt> Smash players were like, "Yes, yes," </garnt>
<garnt> but everyone else is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Why the fuck would I need a CRT TV? </garnt>
<joey> There's so many. </joey>
<joey> - I don't even know what a CRT TV is. </joey>
<connor> - Those big fucking chunky ones, </connor>
<joey> the static-
- The big TVs. </joey>
<connor> - I see so many of them for sale- </connor>
<joey> - The TV that you grew
up with, like the giant, </joey>
<joey> like the brick of a TV. </joey>
<joey> - Ow, thick.
- The thick boys, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I was in Akihabara, </connor>
<connor> and there was like a
brand new electronic store </connor>
<garnt> there was like LCD, like thin TVs, </garnt>
<joey> and there's a whole section for CRT TVs. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm like, who the fuck is buying this? </garnt>
<garnt> Genuinely, who the fuck
is buying CRT TV set, </garnt>
<garnt> except for Smash players? </garnt>
<garnt> - But like the secondhand
store here in Japan </garnt>
<connor> is fuckin' on another level, </connor>
<joey> because you go into a secondhand store </joey>
<joey> and they have like fucking laser discs </joey>
<joey> in pristine condition.
- Perfect condition. </joey>
<joey> - I bought a fuckin'
like full LaserDisc set </joey>
<joey> of all the episodes of
"Evangelion" for like 500 Yen. </joey>
<joey> I don't even have a LaserDisc player, </joey>
<joey> I was just like, holy shit. </joey>
<joey> Why is this here, and why
is it such good quality? </joey>
<connor> - If you love retro games, my God, </connor>
<connor> they have every single
retro game system perf... </connor>
<connor> You can buy like an N64,
like used for like 20 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, I bought my N64 brand
new, in box for like 90 bucks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you could get the SNES, in-box, </connor>
<garnt> like 50 bucks in the store. </garnt>
<garnt> It's crazy, like Genesis games, </garnt>
<joey> which are normally really
expensive in the West, </joey>
<joey> super cheap everywhere here. </joey>
<joey> Sorry, I'm going off tangent, </joey>
<joey> it's crazy how-
- It's great. </joey>
<garnt> If you like retro games, come to Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Meilyne is like, what the fuck is this? </connor>
<garnt> - I space out like half
the time... (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - We just talk mad shit,
Meilyne's like, "Yeah". </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, what? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So in your guys' opinion then, </garnt>
<garnt> what can be improved in the industry </garnt>
<garnt> and how they approach marketing
themselves to the West </garnt>
<garnt> and obviously never getting rid of piracy, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I don't think piracy's
ever gonna disappear, </garnt>
<garnt> but how could you- </garnt>
<connor> - Chill the fuck out,
that's what I'd like. </connor>
<garnt> That's like the one, that piece of advice </garnt>
<garnt> I wish they would take,
just calm the fuck down. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it would take
a little bit more time, </connor>
<garnt> like the next five or 10 years, </garnt>
<garnt> it'll probably be much better. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's sad, right? </connor>
<connor> Because I think what would
take one or two years </connor>
<connor> in American companies, if you're that, </connor>
<connor> it's like 10 years in Japanese companies. </connor>
<garnt> They just- </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to remember,
it's like an Island and- </garnt>
<connor> - I know it is, I know, but it's so- </connor>
<joey> - It's really telling though, </joey>
<joey> when Japan is like still stuck in the '80s </joey>
<connor> with like how they run
their businesses sometimes. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, it just doesn't work. </joey>
<joey> - Every single thing that's
like, why are they doing this, </joey>
<joey> it's just a cultural thing, right? </joey>
<connor> It comes back to like, you know... </connor>
<joey> - I definitely think one thing
that will really, really help </joey>
<connor> is just having an interest to listening </connor>
<connor> to what the foreign
market is doing, right? </connor>
<connor> And a great start, for example, </connor>
<garnt> is like working with foreign YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> like us, for example. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I've convinced
some companies to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, actually, that's
a really dumb thing to do </garnt>
<garnt> in our company," </garnt>
<garnt> and they stopped doing it
and it's worked out for them </garnt>
<garnt> just because we understand. </garnt>
<connor> It's really telling, when we
understand the foreign market </connor>
<connor> more than the actual industry here, </connor>
<connor> and we're not even that
highly knowledgeable </connor>
<connor> or like, that in-depth about
how the industry works, right? </connor>
<garnt> We've just been around it
and kind of surrounded by it. </garnt>
<connor> - You see it time and time again </connor>
<connor> where a Japanese company is like dead fast </connor>
<garnt> and sticking to what they
wanna do and not changing. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, if you even look at
like Konami, with Kojima. </garnt>
<garnt> They kicked Kojima out </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they wanted to focus
on mobile games and Pachinko, </garnt>
<joey> and that's all they fucking
do now, is Pachinko. </joey>
<joey> And sure, it's working great in Japan, </joey>
<joey> but as far as the Western
community is concerned, </joey>
<joey> Konami is a dead fucking company. </joey>
<joey> - Konami died like five years ago, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I think Capcom's kinda
doing the same road, right? </connor>
<connor> They made like- </connor>
<joey> - The moment Capcom axed
Mega Man, they was just dead. </joey>
<joey> - And then what was the other game </joey>
<joey> they brought out recently? </joey>
<garnt> The top-down shooter
that was fucking awful? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't remember it.
- I don't even know that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you keep up with them?
- Yeah, I do. </garnt>
<garnt> I keep up with all the game
news and it's just embarrassing, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it's like all Konami
does now is Pachinko. </connor>
<joey> - These companies that
were like Goliath companies </joey>
<joey> and that everybody knew who
Capcom and Konami was, right? </joey>
<connor> - Capcom, Konami were giants in the NES. </connor>
<garnt> - They just couldn't adapt
to the generation, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - But even with Konami
when they had Kojima, </connor>
<garnt> Kojima, was steering
them on a good journey. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know inside
politics, it looked like, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean he was raking, like "PT" came out, </garnt>
<garnt> that was huge, </garnt>
<garnt> - Silent Hills
- Silent hills, </garnt>
<garnt> and they completely scrubbed
him from "Metal Gear Five". </garnt>
<joey> I mean, it's time, </joey>
<joey> and that's just one really
public occasion, right? </joey>
<garnt> I mean, just interacting with them, </garnt>
<garnt> we see this kind of stuff
time and time again, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like you have the perfect idea, </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like, "No",
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what we're
allowed to talk about </garnt>
<connor> and what we're not. </connor>
<garnt> - It's also hard for them
to kind of try something new </garnt>
<garnt> because they have no data to back it up. </garnt>
<connor> - But that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> If no one's willing to try
anything new, nothing happens. </connor>
<joey> - There's no data for
something that's new, right? </joey>
<connor> - Are we allowed to talk
about the audio book, </connor>
<connor> for example? </connor>
<connor> - Audio book? Sure. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so when we did the audio book- </joey>
<joey> - The Yaoi one.
- the Yaoi one, </joey>
<joey> go and buy it, </joey>
<joey> we were trynna pitch to
some of the companies </joey>
<joey> saying, "Hey, would you
mind, like, helping out </joey>
<joey> with the funding of the audio book?" </joey>
<joey> Basically, how the audio book got made </joey>
<joey> was I put all my money into it </joey>
<joey> and I hope that it sells
well I make my money back </joey>
<joey> and it's worth </joey>
<garnt> one month of my life.
- Luckily did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Luckily you guys are
amazing, you guys bought it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was, I mean, not to be- </garnt>
<garnt> - You're so stressed out that
month, I remember. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I was fucking losing it dude, </garnt>
<garnt> I was stressing out my... </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's like, when you
were in charge of it solely, </garnt>
<joey> it just takes one person </joey>
<garnt> to not do what they're supposed
to do to ruin everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, shout out to Seigi man, </garnt>
<connor> amazing audio editor, he's came in clutch, </connor>
<connor> he did an amazing job, and
it turned out really well. </connor>
<garnt> - You did two, one was a test. </garnt>
<connor> - One was a test, it worked out, </connor>
<connor> we proved that it was successful, right? </connor>
<connor> So we had the data that
this would sell well. </connor>
<connor> And so we went around pitching to- </connor>
<connor> - Several different- </connor>
<connor> - basically saying, Hey you're
gonna get guaranteed sales </connor>
<connor> with this, would you like- </connor>
<connor> - And we have the data. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like, hard evidence </connor>
<connor> that this would get you at
least X amount of sales. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I'm sorry. </garnt>
<connor> - It would get you X amount of sales, </connor>
<connor> you would definitely get a
return on the investment. </connor>
<connor> And none of them wanted to
like even remotely go close. </connor>
<joey> - And what was the
reasoning behind the other? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, what was the reason? </connor>
<connor> I can't remember, it was something like, </connor>
<connor> they just didn't think
it would work, right? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I think it was not that, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just they didn't wanna
put their money into it. </garnt>
<joey> - They didn't wanna put that money </joey>
<joey> into something that they
had the hard evidence </joey>
<connor> that it would work? </connor>
<connor> - And then we, I just decided that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause originally, we
were going to publishers </connor>
<connor> and being like, "Hey, do you know what, </connor>
<connor> we'll choose one of your books." </connor>
<garnt> - Book Walker supported that one too, </garnt>
<garnt> so it was like Book Walker and
you supporting that project. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, both of us, right? </connor>
<connor> Like we have a track
record that I've done it, </connor>
<connor> but none of these companies were willing </connor>
<connor> to even give it a shot. </connor>
<garnt> Like I didn't even need that much, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I produced the audio book for like $2,000, </garnt>
<garnt> which is a lot less than like, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean that also helps- </garnt>
<garnt> - For one month of time.
- For one month at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, doing it nonstop,
we made a video about it, </garnt>
<garnt> they were getting an insane deal. </garnt>
<garnt> And none of them wanted to do it, </garnt>
<garnt> and then we just chose one. </garnt>
<garnt> I just chose a book that I like, did it </garnt>
<connor> and it's been like, what, like number one? </connor>
<garnt> - Every month? Top 10 I would say. </garnt>
<connor> - Its, yeah, top five, top three. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a flex right there. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - For like every month since it came out, </connor>
<connor> and it's just like, it's so frustrating </connor>
<joey> wanting to do these bigger projects </joey>
<joey> and none of these Japanese companies </joey>
<joey> just wanting to even
give a chance when we- </joey>
<joey> - Well that's just called bad
fucking businesses. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - We know that it works, </garnt>
<garnt> we know that we can make this work. </garnt>
<connor> And it's so frustrating having
to work with these companies. </connor>
<garnt> - I've always been curious. </garnt>
<garnt> How did you convince Book
Walker, a Japanese company </garnt>
<joey> to start to start working
with Western YouTubers? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember like,
- I wanna know how that works. </joey>
<joey> - Joey was the first one.
- Joey was the first one, </joey>
<joey> but I think Book Walker was
the first Japanese company </joey>
<joey> that ever contacted me. </joey>
<garnt> I think like, still now,
one of the only ones </garnt>
<garnt> that have like ever gone
out and contacted us. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, without Book Walker- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and that was your idea, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, how did you
convince them to do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean before, I guess
using YouTubers, I was- </garnt>
<connor> - Using YouTubers, (laughing),
before we milk them dry! </connor>
<connor> - (laughing) That's a bad way to say it. </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry, before
collaborating with YouTubers- </connor>
<connor> - Get those buzzwords in Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I was doing marketing for them </connor>
<garnt> and I guess I still was,
I'm not in Book Walker now, </garnt>
<connor> but I've tried so many things. </connor>
<connor> I've done like SNS ads, </connor>
<garnt> or collaborations with the
cosplayers or fan art artists. </garnt>
<garnt> And I worked with anime clubs </garnt>
<garnt> and like, yeah, I worked with anime clubs </garnt>
<garnt> because they had movie nights </garnt>
<joey> or they wanna have, I
don't know, manga readings. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, so you sponsor the movie nights? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- You paid them? </joey>
<connor> - We gave them, like free books, </connor>
<connor> to say, "Oh, maybe you
guys should read it," </connor>
<joey> because the idea was, </joey>
<garnt> they're going to be the
ambassador of their community. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you give them like free
manga, they'll check it out, </garnt>
<garnt> and then they'll give it to their friends. </garnt>
<connor> - If only there was some way
to just reach a ton of people, </connor>
<garnt> really easily, like the
internet or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually did it-
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> So I was like giving them around thinking </connor>
<connor> like, what's bigger than an anime club, </connor>
<garnt> what's bigger than a cosplay? </garnt>
<garnt> - We gotta think bigger.
- Yes! </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like, four
years ago, five years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's like,
four, five years ago now. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I didn't even know that
anime YouTube was a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I knew like anime music videos, </garnt>
<connor> - Very "illegal" stuff, in their eyes. </connor>
<connor> - I've made anime music
videos, but anyways, </connor>
<connor> (Gigguk and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Fired from Book Walker. </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, so I just knew about that type </garnt>
<garnt> of like "anime YouTube". </garnt>
<garnt> But then I was a big follower </garnt>
<garnt> of a lot of Japanese vloggers, </garnt>
<garnt> not Japanese vloggers, Japan bloggers, </garnt>
<garnt> like, J-vloggers. </garnt>
<garnt> And then Joey appeared
in one of the videos </garnt>
<garnt> of the person that I was watching, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "This
person's called Anime Man?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, this is, oh this, this could, hmm. </garnt>
<joey> - That's some giga-brain
marketing right there. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - So, you didn't even know
he was an anime YouTuber? </connor>
<connor> If he wasn't called the anime man, </connor>
<connor> you wouldn't have looked
into it. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Giga-brain marketing right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think you weren't
even talking about anime. </garnt>
<joey> - If I wasn't a J-vlogger- </joey>
<garnt> - I think it was like Sharla's
video, Sharla in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - Ah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, if I'm collabing with J-vloggers, </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna talk about... </joey>
<joey> Like I can talk about
other things. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I don't think I
was talking about anime </joey>
<joey> at that point. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> I think you were like mixing drinks. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, something stupid.
- Maybe, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I Googled you, not Googled you, </joey>
<garnt> I just clicked your videos, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I just started watching. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, what, there's
people that review anime? </garnt>
<garnt> Why would anyone wanna watch that? </garnt>
<garnt> I hate reading people's comments. </garnt>
<connor> Like for example, Crunchyroll videos, </connor>
<connor> on the bottom of the episodes-
- There's comments, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I hate reading those-
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'cause, they might not
like the same character </garnt>
<connor> or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - I don't want people to say
they don't like what I like. </connor>
<garnt> - That's some garbage opinion.
- And I think I watched </garnt>
<garnt> like dubs are better
than subs or something, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, I don't agree </garnt>
<garnt> but let's see if he likes manga. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I emailed and I was like, "Oh..." </garnt>
<joey> - Not gonna lie, the first
time I got your email, </joey>
<garnt> and it said like, from like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Kadokawa.
- Yeah, Kadokawa, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, I think
this might be phish, </garnt>
<garnt> I think this might be a phishing email. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually thought the same, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I remember the
first time you emailed me, </garnt>
<joey> immediate delete, 'cause I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> there's no way this is legit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I did email you,
and then I asked Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> he's like, you know I think
this other anime YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> is not replying at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughing) 'Cause I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way Kadokawa's emailing me. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I was like, that Kadokawa? </joey>
<joey> I only know one Kadokawa, </joey>
<joey> and it's like the anime
company Kadokawa, nooo! </joey>
<joey> - I used Kadokawa </joey>
<garnt> because Book Walker is actually
kinda like a subsidiary. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not like Kadokawa. </garnt>
<garnt> It is 100% Kadokawa, but
no one knows at that time- </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I'd never heard of Book Walker. </garnt>
<garnt> I always knew Kadokawa, but I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> what is this shady company that's using- </garnt>
<garnt> - So I was just like, Kadokawa! </garnt>
<garnt> - What is this shady company
that's using Kadokawa's name? </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, there's no way this is legit. </joey>
<garnt> - I got the email </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was living in
Australia still at the time, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm pretty sure. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no, I was in Japan.
- You'd moved here, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like four or six months. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was
already in Japan, that's right. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember I sent that email, </connor>
<connor> I forwarded to my mom and dad </connor>
<connor> just to be like, does this look legit? </connor>
<garnt> Like, I'm really scared to reply to it. </garnt>
<connor> - Why is it in English?
- Why is it in English, </connor>
<connor> and why is like, the name Meilyne? </connor>
<joey> Like, she doesn't sound Japanese, at all. </joey>
<joey> - Southeast Asian girl. </joey>
<garnt> - And I was like, well, you
know, I'll give it a go. </garnt>
<garnt> If it ends up being a phish, whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> and that was the best email I ever sent. </garnt>
<garnt> - I asked you to come to the office too. </garnt>
<joey> - That's right, that's right. </joey>
<joey> And then when you gave me the address </joey>
<joey> and I looked it up on Google maps, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, okay, this is legit. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it's actually </garnt>
<joey> in one of the Kadokawa's
office buildings or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - I think I heard, was it true </joey>
<joey> that Kadokawa just didn't... </joey>
<garnt> like, they wanted to meet
the YouTuber before they did- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not Kadokawa, it's
just Japanese businesses </garnt>
<connor> in general. </connor>
<garnt> Like to know if they're a
real person or just, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> to judge if they're good people. </garnt>
<garnt> - So if Joey wasn't in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> would there possibly have
been no collaboration? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause if Joey didn't come
to meet you guys in person- </garnt>
<garnt> - Our first conversation
was actually on Skype. </garnt>
<connor> - Would that have been good
enough to secure a deal, </connor>
<connor> do you reckon?
- Probably not, </connor>
<garnt> unless there's like a
foreigner in the group. </garnt>
<joey> Like at that time, I was the
only foreigner, probably. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, I was the first foreigner. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember like when I went
to the Book Walker office </garnt>
<garnt> as well, that was like
probably the first time </garnt>
<connor> I ever went to like a
physical meeting in Japan. </connor>
<connor> And since then, God, </connor>
<connor> every time a Japanese company is like, </connor>
<joey> we'd like to meet up with
you to discuss this thing, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, do you know
what email is? (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna leave. </joey>
<connor> - I think without like, I
mean, you guys starting it, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like they wouldn't have
even considered YouTubers. </garnt>
<connor> I almost feel like the Japanese
companies talking to us- </connor>
<garnt> - I think it took me like
four months to get approved. </garnt>
<garnt> No, not four months, maybe
two months to get approval. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is actually incredibly fast, </garnt>
<garnt> compared to some of the other projects. </garnt>
<garnt> - After five years,
and my number changing, </garnt>
<connor> my email changing. </connor>
<garnt> - I had to like B-S a lot of like data, </garnt>
<connor> oh my God, I'm gonna
get caught. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Did you cook the
books, Meilyne (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe, like inflow from YouTube- </garnt>
<garnt> - I crunched the numbers. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I made graphs that was
like, the inflow from YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> is the best for reaching
the hearts of teenagers. </garnt>
<garnt> So I still probably have that slide, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, YouTubers are this many. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's quantify how well YouTubers </joey>
<joey> can reach their viewer's hearts. </joey>
<connor> - You're probably wondering
for the past hour, </connor>
<connor> what are these figures, we
don't know what this is. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it's because this episode </garnt>
<garnt> is sponsored by EJ ANiME STORE. </garnt>
<connor> - EJ standing for
Entertainment Japan by the way. </connor>
<connor> Carry on. </connor>
<garnt> - EJ ANiME STORE is Kadokawa's
official anime store </garnt>
<garnt> that sells anime, gaming, manga- </garnt>
<connor> - Directly from Japan. </connor>
<connor> If you didn't know, Kadokawa's
published huge titles, </connor>
<connor> such as "Evangelion"! </connor>
<connor> It's capitalized in the script. </connor>
<connor> The "Haruhi Suzumiya" series, "Re:Zero", </connor>
<garnt> "Konosuba" and more. </garnt>
<garnt> - And because Kadokawa is
producing these directly, </garnt>
<garnt> what better way to support
the industry itself? </garnt>
<joey> - There is no better way. </joey>
<joey> Look at all these beautiful things </joey>
<joey> that we have on the table
that are from EJ ANiME STORE, </joey>
<joey> and that you can get
your hands on right now. </joey>
<joey> Look at all this Asuna, </joey>
<joey> there's three Asunas in front, </joey>
<joey> oh actually four Asunas
in front of me right now. </joey>
<garnt> - What does EJ stand for again? </garnt>
<garnt> - Entertainment Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - To give you an idea of
the stuff that you can get </joey>
<joey> at EJ ANiME STORE, they've
brought in a few of the items- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Jesus Christ Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - Speak of the devil,
this is one of the things </joey>
<joey> that you can get at EJ ANiME STORE. </joey>
<joey> What is it Gigguk? </joey>
<garnt> - Did you have to aim for
my face Meilyne? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - This is from "Fates", do
you know "Fates", Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> It's from one of the spin-offs. </garnt>
<joey> - From Fate/kaleid liner Prisma. </joey>
<connor> - So we don't have it here,
but it should be on screen, </connor>
<connor> which is the Fate/kaleid liner Prisma, </connor>
<connor> My God, the Illya Illyasviel von Einzbern </connor>
<garnt> wedding bikini version
one slash scale figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm fucking dying here. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - What did I just pronounce? </garnt>
<connor> But it does come with the
t-shirt that Gigguk is modeling </connor>
<connor> if you do buy that figure. </connor>
<joey> - Look at that, beautiful. </joey>
<joey> - This is the only Fate
franchise you should care about, </joey>
<connor> because there's lesbian wallys in it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I'm allowed to say that, </connor>
<joey> but it's in the shot. </joey>
<connor> - I'm also told the clothing
veil and other clear parts </connor>
<connor> are painted with pearl coloring. </connor>
<connor> The veil perio and bouquet are detachable. </connor>
<garnt> - There's also this figure, </garnt>
<garnt> which is the Date A Bullet Light Novel: </garnt>
<garnt> White queen 1/7 scale figure </garnt>
<garnt> Kadokawa special sets. </garnt>
<joey> - And this figure already looks </joey>
<garnt> just absolutely incredible,
so much detail in that. </garnt>
<garnt> And the best part about it </garnt>
<garnt> is if you get this beautiful figure, </garnt>
<garnt> then you can also get this
lovely B2 tapestry set </garnt>
<garnt> with it as well- </garnt>
<garnt> - For free.
- for free, gentlemen. </garnt>
<garnt> There's also my favorite anime
series, "Sword Art Online". </garnt>
<garnt> This is a "Sword Art Online" figure- rise </garnt>
<garnt> standard Asuna Dengeki Pearl
Color limited version set, </garnt>
<garnt> with a beautiful Asuna tapestry as well, </garnt>
<garnt> that comes with it as a special bonus. </garnt>
<garnt> There's also these two
other Asunas as well </garnt>
<garnt> which has the Asuna vacation set. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, she looks like
she's having a good time </garnt>
<garnt> on the beach there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, that's a-
- She's about to get laved up. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's the regular version, </garnt>
<joey> and then there's the ALO version. </joey>
<garnt> - If you want your own
beach episode, there you go. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, comes with the beach. </connor>

<connor> - Back to the video. </connor>
<connor> - So did YouTubers work Meilyne? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, did they? </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you guys here? (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I guess so. </connor>
<garnt> - I think one thing that a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> might be interested in,
is that you're a foreigner </garnt>
<garnt> working in like the anime
and manga industry in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're basically living the weeb dream. </garnt>
<garnt> - So how did that happen? </garnt>
<garnt> How did you find a job
in Book Walker Kadokawa </garnt>
<garnt> as a foreigner? </garnt>
<garnt> - I know the story.
- I think I know the answer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Craigslist Tokyo. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you wanna tell the story
about how that happened? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, well I was working at a
marketing consulting company </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan, and- </garnt>
<connor> - Because you've been living here </connor>
<connor> 'cause you had marriage
your Japanese person. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, yeah, like my
first, second year in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, I was working at
a digital marketing agency, </garnt>
<garnt> being a consultant for several
different Japanese companies </garnt>
<connor> who wanted to like get, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> global traffic to their site or something, </connor>
<connor> I've said that weird. </connor>
<garnt> - That would still count as foreign, </garnt>
<garnt> calm down Meilyne, it's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Am I sweating? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't wipe it on the table. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Just fine pine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where was I? </garnt>
<connor> - You were talking about the global- </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You threw me off and now I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> what is that even talking about? </garnt>
<connor> - You were talking about
how you got the job </connor>
<connor> at Book Walker.
- Oh yeah, </connor>
<garnt> and then I needed a bicycle one day </garnt>
<garnt> and I finished my work and
it was during lunchtime </garnt>
<connor> and I was like, I can
just check Craigslist </connor>
<connor> for cheap bicycle, like
30 bucks, 20 bucks. </connor>
<connor> I'm checking on Craigslist
and then I found a bicycle. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't buy it though,
and then I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I wonder if there's
like actually legit jobs </garnt>
<connor> on Craigslist besides like foot
massage, or whatever it is. </connor>
<connor> - 34 M looking for F. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause you know, </connor>
<connor> that's the image that
Craigslist has in America. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, or a fridge full of cockroaches. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you're the one. </joey>
<garnt> You made me get that fucking
fridge full of cockroaches. </garnt>
<garnt> - When you buy something on Craigslist, </garnt>
<garnt> you first look at it in
person and then you decide. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not going to some
fucking person's house </connor>
<connor> to check out a $10 fridge Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> - Why didn't you Amazon it then? </connor>
<garnt> - Because-
- Now he knows better. </garnt>
<garnt> - you were highly insistent </garnt>
<garnt> that Craigslist, may
as well be a cockroach, </garnt>
<garnt> - Craigslist changed my life, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - You were so insistent that Craigslist, </garnt>
<garnt> "Dude, you should really
go to Craigslist, man, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna get a mad deal." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, fine Meilyne, fine, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll get a fridge from Craigslist. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it got fucking
cockroaches in it Meilyne, </garnt>
<garnt> that's on you.
- But now you have a story. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do have a story. </garnt>
<connor> I love the story, but I hate you. </connor>
<garnt> - So, this job, what did it say? </garnt>
<garnt> What jobs did you find on there? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I think it was like-
- Looking for F. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It said like digital
manga marketing specialist, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, what? </garnt>
<connor> They're looking for something like that? </connor>
<garnt> I click it and it doesn't
say the name of the company. </garnt>
<garnt> It says like, Oh, Chiyoda-ku, Iidabashi. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, wait, </connor>
<joey> there's only two publishers
that I know of in this area. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, it's
either this really big one, </joey>
<joey> or like this kind of the big-ish one. </joey>
<joey> And I Google all the, well,
I knew it was Kadokawa, </joey>
<joey> so I was like, oh, I'm gonna Google </joey>
<joey> every single Kadokawa department </joey>
<joey> and see what they're looking for. </joey>
<joey> And then I found Book Walker </joey>
<joey> and it matched exactly kind of
what the Craigslist thing was </joey>
<garnt> which was, well, looking
for someone to go overseas </garnt>
<garnt> to different anime conventions
to market our service. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, oh, I love anime conventions. </connor>
<garnt> No Japanese required, and
this was like five years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> and my Japanese is nowhere fluent. </garnt>
<garnt> And at that time it
was even more horrible. </garnt>
<joey> So getting into the anime
industry or manga industry, </joey>
<garnt> you need to speak English, not English, </garnt>
<garnt> and Japanese like fluently,
like beyond business. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh I'm never gonna work
in the manga industry, </garnt>
<garnt> unless it's like in America,
then I could like apply. </garnt>
<garnt> - Glad you got it.
- Oh, yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like insane, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause if I saw that ad on Craigslist, </garnt>
<garnt> again I would think he was
a scammer or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like imagine Kadokawa
going on like advertising </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking job on Craigslist. </garnt>
<garnt> - They didn't say the company name though, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just location. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's still on Craigslist. </garnt>
<garnt> That makes it even more sketchy, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I fully expected to
just be like Kodokawa, </joey>
<garnt> just like one letter off, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's like, oh, it almost sounds
like Kadokawa. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's like a certain rent-a-girlfriend, </joey>
<joey> that was like TamelyMart? </joey>
<garnt> I was fucking losing it. </garnt>
<garnt> With all the letters, TamelyMart? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why it was so funny. </garnt>
<connor> - The golden oldie, walkdonalds? </connor>
<garnt> Never gets old, never gets old. </garnt>
<connor> - I gonna do a video on
Craigslist, I remember. </connor>
<garnt> Why are you laughing? </garnt>
<joey> I suck dick for video. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I wanted to see what was on there, </joey>
<joey> and so I found this ad that was like </joey>
<joey> looking for YouTubers below 10,000. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, what? </joey>
<garnt> What is it all about? </garnt>
<joey> This was in London, so I called them up </joey>
<garnt> and it was, no, no, not Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I was gonna feel weird
about that in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I called them up, </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like, "Yeah
we wanna pay YouTubers </garnt>
<garnt> below 10,000 subscribers, </garnt>
<garnt> $5,000 to move to our
platform exclusively." </garnt>
<garnt> It was a woman on the phone, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't tell her I had
like a million subs. </garnt>
<garnt> And she was just like, she was going on, </garnt>
<garnt> and she was like, yeah,
so we just need you </garnt>
<garnt> to be in an exclusive deal
with our partners and all this. </garnt>
<connor> I was so confused, I was like, what the? </connor>
<connor> I never heard of this
platform since, right? </connor>
<connor> And then they were like, Oh yeah, but... </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was a guy, obviously, </connor>
<connor> they were like, yeah, but
we're only interested in women </connor>
<connor> as well. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like red flags coming up, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder if I like stumbled </garnt>
<garnt> onto the greatest prostitution
network or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what it was, </garnt>
<garnt> 'till this day, I still don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I have the phone call recorded on my PC. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I told them I had a million subs </garnt>
<joey> and then they, they were like,
oh no, we're not interested. </joey>
<joey> And I was also like- </joey>
<joey> - Why 10,000? </joey>
<connor> - I was really confused about that. </connor>
<joey> - Is it because if they
wanna like drop out, </joey>
<connor> for example, it's just like trauma. </connor>
<joey> They're like, Oh, this
guy's only got 10,000 subs, </joey>
<joey> they won't go anywhere. </joey>
<connor> - They kept saying stuff that
was like too good to be true. </connor>
<connor> They were like, one, we'll
give you $5,000 to move, </connor>
<connor> we were in the UK as well by the way, </connor>
<connor> that was already like, that's weird. </connor>
<garnt> And then also they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> we can give you premium ad
rev rates of like $10 CPM. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, get out of here. </garnt>
<garnt> $10 CPM? Fuck off, no
way, I was losing it. </garnt>
<connor> To this day, I still
don't know what that was. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't know why I told that story. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you even check
their website thoroughly? </garnt>
<connor> - They wouldn't me what it was. </connor>
<connor> They were like, it's down-low,
it's on the down-low. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, that's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds sketchy as fuck, man. </garnt>
<joey> That sounds like a hiring
ring for like a prostitution, </joey>
<garnt> like a black market prostitution. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I never wanna use Craigslist, </joey>
<garnt> because every single story
I've heard from Craigslist, is, </garnt>
<garnt> a part from yours-
- Apart from Meilyne's. </garnt>
<connor> - Outside of Japan, I think
Craigslist is a sketch. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you gone to like the
section where you can, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> pay for favors? </garnt>
<garnt> - You can?
- Oh yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, that's like the community
or something right there. </garnt>
<connor> - There's one where it's
like for old people, </connor>
<connor> it's all just like 40, 50 year old women </connor>
<garnt> looking for like dudes
to just give them a good- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this in Japan? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and UK, in the
U.S, I checked all of them. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I wanted to see
if there's anything crazy </joey>
<joey> about Craigslist. </joey>
<connor> - Don't tell me you're
gonna make a video on it. </connor>
<joey> - No, I will not.
- Okay, thank God. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't tell me that's where </garnt>
<garnt> all the hot sexy singles
(laughing) in my area, </garnt>
<garnt> they're all on Craigslist,
not KissAnime, God-damn it. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why you're not
home sick. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - What if you just clicked
on the KissAnime ads </garnt>
<connor> and it just takes you to the Craigslist? </connor>
<connor> It makes sense. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's wild, 'cause there
was like 40 year old women </connor>
<joey> who were married showing their face </joey>
<joey> and giving them mobile phone number. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, whoa, you are
playing with fire, surely. </joey>
<joey> - That doesn't sound safe. </joey>
<joey> - But also you're married, right? </joey>
<joey> I saw your face, Karen. </joey>
<joey> - Every Karen is like- </joey>
<garnt> - You don't know if it's their real photo. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, true, </connor>
<connor> - It could be very much a scam. </connor>
<connor> - It definitely has to be
their number though, right? </connor>
<garnt> I mean... </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess we have to find out by calling. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess there's only one
way to find out. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I would totally call her just
for a video, I'd do that. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I have like, no
qualms about doing that. </connor>
<connor> - But steering back to the conversation, </connor>
<connor> so I think we can all agree </connor>
<garnt> that Meilyne's story is very
much a rare case, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I-
- Is it a rare case? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never heard of anyone
getting into the anime industry </garnt>
<joey> through Craigslist. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's 'cause
people who you probably, </garnt>
<garnt> most people know or you
guys know are in the U.S, </garnt>
<garnt> working for U.S. </garnt>
<connor> - Was there ever a time you wanted to work </connor>
<connor> in the U.S industry? (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> What is that smile? </garnt>
<garnt> - That smile paints just 1,000 words. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the most nervous
smile I've ever seen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there was two companies
that I applied to that were- </garnt>
<connor> - Did you get rejected Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> Did you get rejected? </connor>
<connor> Is that why you- </connor>
<garnt> - But they called back </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like, "You
are the second candidate </garnt>
<connor> we were thinking about." </connor>
<connor> - That hurts even more, I don't hear that. </connor>
<garnt> - That was like when I
was a fresh graduate. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you wanna know if
you haven't got the job? </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna know, I just wanna apply </garnt>
<garnt> and move on.
- I wanna know. </garnt>
<connor> I also wanna know the reason. </connor>
<garnt> - They're never gonna give it to you. </garnt>
<connor> - I guarantee to every
person they dropped, </connor>
<joey> they said, "You were the second one." </joey>
<connor> Guarantee it.
- Honestly, we wanted to. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I would do. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> But what would be, cause
I'm fucking certain, </joey>
<joey> that not just people
watching this episode, </joey>
<joey> but I reckon like every
weeb living overseas </joey>
<connor> probably has that dream somewhere
in the back of their head </connor>
<connor> where they're like, man
I wanna move to Japan, </connor>
<connor> I wanna work in the anime industry. </connor>
<connor> - Did you get those emails as well? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I get them.
- Everyone gets them, </connor>
<connor> we all get them. </connor>
<connor> So as someone who actually made it, </connor>
<joey> what is the advice you would give </joey>
<joey> to people who want to chase that dream? </joey>
<garnt> - It took a year and a half, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - That's pretty fast though for Japan. </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, you didn't get
the green card to move here. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was like what? No. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, that's the
easiest way there, right? </connor>
<garnt> I mean, there's probably
guys that say like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can marry someone to get in? </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually, no, not really, I mean... </garnt>
<garnt> - But what advice would you give </garnt>
<garnt> for someone who's looking
to work in the industry- </garnt>
<joey> - In Japan?
- Yeah, in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - The most realistic way. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would say learn some Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like the easiest way to get in. </garnt>
<garnt> Not flown, like, there's that JLPT </garnt>
<joey> where it's N1, N2 or whatever. </joey>
<garnt> And I've heard like, Oh, N2 is sufficient. </garnt>
<joey> - If you can get to N2, you
can pretty much snag any job </joey>
<garnt> that's not too language-focused. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or be extremely knowledgeable
about the industry. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like the biggest thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause people ask us all the time, </garnt>
<garnt> they're like, "What's the best way?" </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, bro, I'm like
in the weirdest situation. </connor>
<joey> - Don't take my career path, </joey>
<joey> that's a really weird career path. </joey>
<joey> - We just wanna stress, we're
not part of the industry. </joey>
<garnt> We work with the industry. </garnt>
<garnt> - We are not part of the industry. </garnt>
<connor> - Why are you asking a
YouTuber on immigration law? </connor>
<joey> I don't know anything, you
think I know immigration law? </joey>
<garnt> Fuck, dude.
- You should, </garnt>
<joey> because you immigrated here, right? </joey>
<connor> - I barely know how to file
my taxes correctly, come on. </connor>
<garnt> - But are a lot of Japanese
companies hiring foreigners? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, yes they do actually. </garnt>
<garnt> Quite a lot are, especially
in the past year or two, </garnt>
<garnt> they've expanded to the global market. </garnt>
<connor> - Why are you-
- 'Cause people watching this </connor>
<connor> are like, "Write that down,
write that down!" (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Open tab, Craigslist. </connor>
<garnt> - Japan knows how popular
anime is overseas, </garnt>
<garnt> that's why, of course, there's
like the cool Japan thing. </garnt>
<connor> - If Book Walker did a
job application today, </connor>
<garnt> what would my CV, my
resume need to look like? </garnt>
<garnt> What are we looking for? </garnt>
<connor> - And you can tell us this </connor>
<connor> because you're probably gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> if a job opening ever opens up </connor>
<garnt> you'd probably be the one
doing the interview, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So what would-
- What do you expect </garnt>
<joey> from someone who wants to work in there? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, I'm not
in like that team anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - Give us your thoughts Meilyne, c'mon. </connor>
<garnt> - Like hypothetically, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause you almost have
to hire for GeeXPlus, </connor>
<garnt> which is also very similar. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't be like an incel or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like don't be a nervous wreck- </garnt>
<garnt> - So a bit of charisma. </garnt>
<garnt> - And have like a social life, kind of. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause you got those really weird- </connor>
<garnt> - That's a real tall order for weebs. </garnt>
<connor> - When they come in, can
you sense it straight away? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, we did some like
interviews recently actually </garnt>
<garnt> where we were like, we did it through zoom </garnt>
<garnt> or like video call, and
the thing I was looking for </garnt>
<connor> is like, they smile and like... </connor>
<garnt> And then I also, like, we ask them, </garnt>
<garnt> what's your favorite
anime series or something </garnt>
<garnt> and it's not the anime series they choose, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the reason why they
like it or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - If they say Nomi, get
outta here. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, "Oh my God,
he said that series," no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every application you're
gonna have from now on </garnt>
<garnt> like every CV, it's
just like, not an incel. </garnt>
<joey> - Not and incel, smiles in a zoom call. </joey>
<garnt> - And they have to have experience. </garnt>
<joey> I would say experience
is like the biggest thing </joey>
<joey> because-
- Experience in what? </joey>
<joey> - Working, like in a company actually. </joey>
<garnt> - Anything?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like
that's a lot of experience </garnt>
<joey> that a lot of people
are missing, you know. </joey>
<joey> Just working in a company environment </joey>
<joey> is actually really valuable in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> - Corporate experience, definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - Or if they're like fresh graduate, </garnt>
<garnt> at least have a few
internships under your belt. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's some people
in my previous companies </garnt>
<connor> I've worked with in the past, </connor>
<garnt> like they're new graduates,
they go into the job </garnt>
<garnt> and they don't even know how to use Excel. </garnt>
<garnt> So if they're familiar with
all the Microsoft stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it's something you
never like actively learn </garnt>
<garnt> how to use, like Excel and Word, </garnt>
<joey> but it's such a necessary skill to have </joey>
<joey> working in a corporate job, </joey>
<joey> which is knowing how to use Excel. </joey>
<joey> It's not in any job
application, but it's... </joey>
<garnt> When I was working in the BBC, </garnt>
<garnt> I had to use Excel for fucking everything. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm convinced my engineering degree </connor>
<joey> was an Excel degree in disguise. </joey>
<joey> I'm convinced, 'cause we
used Excel for everything. </joey>
<joey> - We had classes in high school </joey>
<connor> that were specifically towards Excel. </connor>
<connor> - So what's like the
main points on a resume. </connor>
<connor> Like if there's three most
things that you can have </connor>
<connor> as a candidate for applying. </connor>
<garnt> - What stands out the most for you? </garnt>
<joey> - We're not talking about
like, don't be an incel. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not like the final
judge with this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, but just like your opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just the way they write
their intro paragraph </garnt>
<garnt> about themselves.
- Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh shit, that's actually important. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me, I read it and I'm
just like, what do they say? </garnt>
<garnt> Did they sound passionate
or they're just copying </garnt>
<garnt> and pasting top 10 best
ways to write a cover letter </garnt>
<garnt> or something. </garnt>
<connor> - In Japan, don't you
have to write every letter </connor>
<garnt> and resume by hand? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- That's disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, that's too much. </garnt>
<garnt> - So what's that little job fair they do </garnt>
<garnt> when they leave school,
what's that called? </garnt>
<joey> Where they spend a year trynna- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, shukatsu? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and they can write
up to 100 applications </joey>
<connor> by hand, the same shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I would lose my damn mind. </connor>
<joey> - I had to do that when I
was applying for internships </joey>
<garnt> in Japan, I think I wrote 30. </garnt>
<joey> And that wasn't nearly as much
as some of my friends did. </joey>
<connor> - Apparently they look out
for like, if you care enough, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, to me, that seems like, </joey>
<connor> why is this the thing
that we're caring about? </connor>
<joey> - I don't care, I just want money. </joey>
<joey> Give me the experience- </joey>
<garnt> - I'm here to make you money, shut up! </garnt>
<connor> - Can we just be honest here </connor>
<connor> and just say, why do you need this job? </connor>
<garnt> Because I'm broke and I just graduated </garnt>
<joey> and I need the fucking money, okay? </joey>
<joey> I need a job! </joey>
<joey> - Just give me the job, fucking hell. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you like it when they're
extremely passionate too. </garnt>
<joey> Like not saying like, "Oh my God, </joey>
<joey> I'm like a huge Love Liver, </joey>
<garnt> and I've "Love Live" for everything." </garnt>
<garnt> It's more like, you know,
I was in a different time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shout out to the Love Livers. </garnt>
<connor> - I would never hire
someone who's obsessed </connor>
<connor> with "Love Live", you know why? </connor>
<connor> Because that loyalty would
never lie with you, ever, </connor>
<garnt> no matter what. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you can bribe them. </garnt>
<connor> - That's true, but for
how long can you bribe? </connor>
<joey> How long can you bribe them, Meilyne? </joey>
<joey> - If you don't finish
this, I'm ripping it. </joey>
<joey> - Your phone just slammed
on the floor, very dramatic. </joey>
<joey> But okay, let's say, they're
addicted to "Gancha". </joey>
<garnt> Who knows how long it is </garnt>
<connor> before they do one too
many "Gancha" rules. </connor>
<connor> They coming at you with a raise,
they want a raise, Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> - They wouldn't ask me, </connor>
<joey> they would ask the CEO for the raise. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, but hypothetically,
if you were the CEO, </joey>
<joey> then how would you respond to that? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, first I would ask, </garnt>
<connor> oh, what have you been doing
this past year differently? </connor>
<connor> And how much have you affected this? </connor>
<connor> Like how much has the sales
been affected by your work? </connor>
<connor> And what do you wanna
try doing differently? </connor>
<connor> If I gave you this much money,
what are you going to do? </connor>
<garnt> Is it really going to better your life? </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's basically another job interview, </garnt>
<garnt> is what I'm hearing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't have any underlings. </garnt>
<garnt> - Underlings, my God! Overlord over here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because one thing I find fascinating </garnt>
<garnt> is how the story of like,
we all have you to thank </garnt>
<connor> for this podcast and being here in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - It takes an awful lot. </garnt>
<joey> - An awful lot of what we've
done is thanks to Meilyne. </joey>
<garnt> She's like the brain child to a lot of it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I find this-
- I just got lucky, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - But how did the story of
GeeXPlus forming come to be? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you made GeeXPlus. </garnt>
<connor> - GeeXPlus is the agency
that we're all under, </connor>
<connor> and the reason why we're here. </connor>
<connor> - And the reason why we're here. </connor>
<garnt> So how did that come about? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Kadokawa has a new business contest </garnt>
<garnt> or competition every year, </garnt>
<garnt> and then within their departments </garnt>
<garnt> they also do business competitions. </garnt>
<garnt> And the first year I
decided to submit something </garnt>
<garnt> and it was the GeeXPlus thing. </garnt>
<garnt> And usually, well, I didn't
wanna submit it before </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there was like, the
prize money was like this much. </garnt>
<garnt> And then this particular year
the prize money was like this, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, maybe I want that money. </garnt>
<garnt> - So wait, wait, I gotta ask, </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember the exact
meeting where you asked me, </garnt>
<garnt> she asked me in the meeting, </garnt>
<garnt> "Have you ever considered
moving to Japan?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we were just casually talking. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, just casually talking. </garnt>
<garnt> But did you have that prize money </garnt>
<garnt> and that competition in
mind when you asked me? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughing)
(Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, man, I respect it.
- I respect the hustle. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, "I don't give a shit about
these YouTubers coming out, </garnt>
<garnt> I want that cold-hard cash." </garnt>
<connor> - Are you allowed to
tell us how much you got? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, people will say,
"Oh, it's not that much." </connor>
<garnt> But it was like, I think
they told me was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh the price is going to be like (beep). </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like a decent bonus.
- Yeah, it's not bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - But what I wanna know </garnt>
<garnt> is how you managed to convince them </garnt>
<garnt> because as we've all talked about, </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese companies are fucking difficult- </garnt>
<garnt> - They never wanna try anything new. </garnt>
<garnt> - to try anything new. </garnt>
<garnt> And convincing a Japanese company </garnt>
<garnt> to send over like three or four AniTubers </garnt>
<garnt> and just sponsor their
visas and help get up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I had an advantage. </garnt>
<garnt> You guys have been working
with Book Walker for, </garnt>
<garnt> at that point, like two,
three years already? </garnt>
<garnt> So I had data, and they love data. </garnt>
<connor> - We know from the Yaoi audio book, </connor>
<joey> that that's not always the case, right? </joey>
<joey> Like that's not guaranteed. </joey>
<garnt> - That wasn't enough though. </garnt>
<garnt> This is like three years worth. </garnt>
<connor> - Never enough. </connor>
<connor> - It's all about that data. </connor>
<garnt> - The Excel sheets, the Excel sheets. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly, Excel sheets and PowerPoints. </connor>
<connor> And so I think in the back of their mind, </connor>
<connor> they were already thinking like, </connor>
<garnt> Oh if we had this business,
it would be interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> And my superior, Ross, at
that time was giving me a tip </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, maybe you should submit that idea </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause maybe they're thinking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, okay, I
guess I have enough data, </garnt>
<garnt> so let's do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I won the thingy, and then- </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you have like, was it
like an apprentice type pitch </garnt>
<connor> where you had to go into
like a boardroom meeting and- </connor>
<connor> - I attended one. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I was the, like, first week I moved here, </garnt>
<garnt> they were like, do you
wanna come to this thing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and then you
met Mr. Kadokawa, like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was weird. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I just sat down
in the most sterile room </garnt>
<garnt> you can imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine just like 100,
200 Japanese businessmen </garnt>
<garnt> and the quietest room in
your life and I came in, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I came in midway, </garnt>
<garnt> so I was making so much fucking noise </garnt>
<garnt> just trynna to sit down, </garnt>
<garnt> of course my seat was in the middle- </garnt>
<garnt> - And you're the only non-Asian in there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like the only, </garnt>
<garnt> like I was the only one not
on the suit of some sort </garnt>
<garnt> as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So I come in with like
my t-shirt and jeans, </garnt>
<joey> making some noise. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, excuse me, excuse me. </joey>
<joey> Sat down, and then one
of the Japanese people </joey>
<joey> kept translating in my ear </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, just stop translating, </joey>
<joey> you're making too much noise,
and people are looking at us. </joey>
<garnt> I'll just pretend like
I know what's happening. </garnt>
<garnt> But they were all really
good sports about it, </garnt>
<garnt> they were nice to me afterwards. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just like that, we had
like a new business plan </garnt>
<connor> format document, you fill it out. </connor>
<connor> And then within that, </connor>
<garnt> I think it was like over 200,
maybe around 200 applicants. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it narrowed down to like 50, </garnt>
<garnt> and then when you're the
top 50, they narrow it. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't do anything, you just
like make like a three year- </garnt>
<connor> - Business plan?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Where did I go? </garnt>
<connor> - What?
- Why did I go again? </connor>
<connor> There was free food and drink, </connor>
<connor> that was it. </connor>
<connor> That was really good sushi and free beer, </connor>
<joey> so it was really good, sorry, go ahead. </joey>
<joey> - If there's free food and
drink, I'll go to anything. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, not gonna lie, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - And you were bored,
probably, you had no friends- </garnt>
<garnt> - I had no internet.
- They didn't arrive yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - They weren't there. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I felt bad
'cause I'd been crashing </garnt>
<joey> on Joey's couch for like a week. </joey>
<joey> I felt really bad that
was bothering him so much. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's fine.
- I know, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, okay, this is the thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Company parties, at least in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> they don't spare any
expense with food and drink, </garnt>
<garnt> they like do such good food and drink. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, Meilyne's a food snob,
I don't count her opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought it was good,
it was good, it was okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - But they have like bomb food and drink. </garnt>
<joey> It's always so good. </joey>
<garnt> They'll have restaurant quality
food just there for you, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, yeah, okay,
yeah, I wanna try that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is a restaurant though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, no, it's like a hotel </garnt>
<garnt> and then just bring in a platter </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, dig in. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, sweet. </connor>
<garnt> - And all you can drink alcohol. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that was good. </joey>
<connor> - People, awkward people, </connor>
<connor> and the Japanese women taking
photos 'cause you told them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they were like- </garnt>
<connor> - They were like, "This is
the guy who made the Yaoi, </connor>
<connor> the one that we're going to
check for the sex noises." </connor>
<garnt> - The Book Walker support team, </garnt>
<connor> I think they're mostly women, and then... </connor>
<connor> - That was so weird. </connor>
<connor> - This is the man. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - They're like all fan girls
of you I think. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - The 93%, back at it again.
- Let's go, let's go. </joey>
<garnt> - I was so confused </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like none of them
could speak English. </garnt>
<connor> So I was like, why are
you listening to my stuff? </connor>
<garnt> - Some of them are. </garnt>
<garnt> The reason why they knew about you </garnt>
<garnt> was because I think it was last year </garnt>
<garnt> when we did the first audio book, </garnt>
<garnt> they were playing it on speaker </garnt>
<garnt> because they would get
like emails from customers </garnt>
<garnt> saying, "Oh I don't know
how to play this MP3," </garnt>
<garnt> and so they're like, "Oh, let's
check if there's a problem" </garnt>
<garnt> and they play it and they just
end up playing it on speaker. </garnt>
<connor> - Did they play the new one on speaker? </connor>
<connor> The new one has like a
hardcore sex scene at the end. </connor>
<garnt> - No, because, what is it, Corona virus? </garnt>
<garnt> They were working from home. </garnt>
<joey> - So they played it on
the speakers at home. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, probably. </joey>
<garnt> - That was weird, 'cause
then I was just eating, </garnt>
<connor> and then they were like,
"Can we take a picture?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Who are you?" </connor>
<connor> Why are you-
- We're your fan girls. </connor>
<connor> - It was so weird. </connor>
<connor> - So did you expect to win
the competition at all, </connor>
<garnt> or was it like a fucking surprise for you? </garnt>
<garnt> - Kind of a surprise, I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - I knew I was the best. </connor>
<garnt> - No, like my boss at the time was saying </garnt>
<garnt> like, Oh you have like,
maybe a high probability </garnt>
<garnt> because he was the one reviewing
the other business things. </garnt>
<garnt> So maybe he helped me a lot, thank you. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's a pretty
radical idea, right? </joey>
<joey> Especially in such a traditional
company like Kadokawa. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you know what other ideas
you were competing against? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there were kinda
like manga service, </garnt>
<connor> like manga subscription
or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - That would be good as well. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that would be good for japan. </joey>
<joey> - JP, ever heard of that? (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - So, I kinda want to talk
about the opening party </garnt>
<garnt> of GeeXPlus, </garnt>
<connor> because that was probably
the most extra business party </connor>
<connor> I've ever been to.
- Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - So sad I wasn't there. </connor>
<garnt> - So Connor wasn't there </garnt>
<garnt> because he was at the
Crunchyroll anime awards. </garnt>
<garnt> So he was, there was about like 10 iPads </garnt>
<garnt> scattered around this entire like- </garnt>
<joey> - Three.
- Three iPads, </joey>
<joey> okay, three iPads, whatever, </joey>
<joey> scattered around this like
two-star Michelin restaurant. </joey>
<joey> What was the restaurant
that it was held at? </joey>
<joey> - Iniwa. </joey>
<joey> - It's owned by Kadokawa, right? </joey>
<joey> - So I didn't know that
Kadokawa owned so many things </joey>
<connor> outside of just like anime </connor>
<connor> and manga.
- Multimedia. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and so we were at this
two-star Michelin restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> and Connor had to join
us via Skype or zoom </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever you were using. </garnt>
<joey> - That was like a stupid
time for you, right? </joey>
<joey> - I was like-
- Your face was like this. </joey>
<joey> - It was like, yeah, like
10, 11:00 PM or something. </joey>
<garnt> And then I had to do a speech </garnt>
<connor> and it was like the most
fucking awful speech. </connor>
<joey> - I remember you were in
the fucking hotel room, </joey>
<garnt> like a downward angle. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was just like,
(speaking in Japanese). </garnt>
<garnt> - He said it all in Japanese,
and I was like, wow! </garnt>
<joey> (Connor speaking Japanese) </joey>
<joey> - To explain, so this is like, </joey>
<joey> there are a lot of important
people at this party. </joey>
<joey> - How many people were there?
Maybe like 50 plus, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 50 plus. </joey>
<joey> Basically they was like,
Mr Kadokawa was there, </joey>
<garnt> there was like pretty
much any anime company- </garnt>
<garnt> - MyAnimeList CEO </garnt>
<garnt> - The CEO of MyAnimeList was there, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't even that he
was Japanese, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - Danny Choo was there.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically any
company that is in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> any big company, there
was a representative </connor>
<connor> for that company there. </connor>
<connor> This was like the biggest dick energy </connor>
<garnt> I've ever been-
- And Connor on an iPad. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember we had to do a speech </garnt>
<garnt> in front of all these important people. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember the CEO of GeeXPlus, </garnt>
<garnt> he introduced us to make our speech. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like fucking shitting myself </garnt>
<garnt> because man- </garnt>
<joey> - I could see you were shitting yourself. </joey>
<joey> - I was shitting myself </joey>
<joey> because I had to talk in front
of all these fucking people </joey>
<joey> and I couldn't speak a lick of Japanese. </joey>
<garnt> So I had to speak in English </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember that he introduced us </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember hearing something like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, the heroes of anime." </garnt>
<garnt> And I turned to Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, my Japanese
isn't the greatest, </garnt>
<garnt> but did he just call
us the heroes of anime </garnt>
<garnt> for Western anime fans? </garnt>
<garnt> And Joey was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah."
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was just thinking to myself, </garnt>
<garnt> why would he lie like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - The heroes of anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like doing the blinking meme, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> - To be fair though, I
would say it's kinda true. </garnt>
<garnt> Like there's a lot of people that- </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a lot of people
who would disagree with that. </garnt>
<joey> - A lot of people call
us the villains of anime </joey>
<joey> if anything, right. </joey>
<garnt> - Some people would probably, </garnt>
<garnt> who are in the middle of nowhere
that have no anime friends </garnt>
<garnt> and they're getting bullied for it, </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like, "Oh
these people like anime </garnt>
<connor> and they're actually cool?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, punch 'em back.
- Anime is not a lame thing? </connor>
<garnt> Yes, you're cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - All I remember was, I was suited up, </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney was suited up </garnt>
<garnt> and then Joey walks up in fuckin'... </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember what you were wearing. </joey>
<joey> - I was in a JoJo shirt, and like shorts. </joey>
<garnt> And I looked at Gigguk,
like so properly dressed </garnt>
<garnt> with like collar, shirt and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney was in like this really nice dress, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just there with like
my jeans and fucking sneakers, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Ss'up,
hero of anime right here." </garnt>
<connor> - I took that to another party as well. </connor>
<garnt> - This is like, "Oh my God,
that's how YouTubers dress?" </garnt>
<joey> That's like, you know... </joey>
<joey> Celebrity wear.
- Celebrity wear? </joey>
<garnt> - Celebrities wear like jumpsuits. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm so celebrity, I
wear Uniqlo everywhere. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't think
that anyone understood </garnt>
<joey> what I actually said in my speech. </joey>
<joey> You're the only one who
anyone could understand. </joey>
<joey> - I was told no one could hear me. </joey>
<garnt> - A lot of them did speak English though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you started speaking </garnt>
<garnt> and the speakers just weren't on. </garnt>
<garnt> All we could see was-
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's an amazing speech,
it such a good speech. </connor>
<joey> - What was more hilarious </joey>
<joey> was just not only just
Connor's speakers not being on, </joey>
<joey> but just 50 Japanese business men, </joey>
<joey> just like really seriously
just looking down at the iPad, </joey>
<joey> just being like... </joey>
<garnt> - They were paying attention. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to bear in mind as
well, I can't see anything. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm just talking to a
webcam, I don't see shit. </garnt>
<joey> So as far as I know, </joey>
<joey> like I'm just talking in
the fucking void over here, </joey>
<garnt> with my shitty Japanese,
(speaking in Japanese). </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God.
- That was really funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - But no, that was like a
really interesting experience </garnt>
<garnt> for me 'cause that was
like a holy shit moment. </garnt>
<joey> Have I made it? Is this the point? </joey>
<joey> - We met some really
fuckin' cool people there. </joey>
<joey> - Who was like, the person you
met that stood out the most? </joey>
<joey> Or which company did
you like freak out over? </joey>
<joey> - Obviously like the Shonen
Jump guys were there, </joey>
<garnt> but I think the coolest one, </garnt>
<garnt> just because it just kinda
came out of nowhere was, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I was talking to
the Shonen Jump people, </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like,
what manga do you like? </garnt>
<garnt> What are you interested in? </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously I laid out a
bunch of Shonen Jump stuff </garnt>
<joey> and then one of the guys was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, what about stuff
that's not Shonen Jump, </joey>
<joey> like I'm just genuinely curious." </joey>
<joey> And I think I said "Berserk" </joey>
<joey> because I fucking love "Berserk". </joey>
<joey> And then literally the moment
after I said "Berserk", </joey>
<joey> some guy tapped me on the shoulder </joey>
<joey> almost like, "Hi, I'm
the publisher 'Berserk'." </joey>
<garnt> I was like, (gasping)
- The editor. </garnt>
<connor> - Was things like dusty? </connor>
<connor> He's like, "I've never done that." </connor>
<connor> I've been hired for five years
and I haven't done anything. </connor>
<joey> - I've never even met Miura
in my life. (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> So, he said that and I read the card. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, Oh shit, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> that is like the publication of "Berserk". </garnt>
<garnt> And I just said, like, "Not to be rude, </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck is Miura doing? </garnt>
<garnt> What is he doing?" </garnt>
<garnt> - What's going on?
- What's going on with that? </garnt>
<connor> - Let's jump right into it. </connor>
<joey> - Like, "You're his publisher right? </joey>
<joey> Just give me the details,
what's he doing?" </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Oh no, he's
working hard, don't worry." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Yeah, that's what
they all say." (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Idol master in the
background, "I'm working hard." </garnt>
<connor> - Are you winning, son? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but that was really cool, </joey>
<garnt> Danny Choo was really cool-
- Danny Choo was really cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - because I think it's safe to say </garnt>
<garnt> that Danny Choo she is one of those people </garnt>
<garnt> who really put anime weeb
culture in the West on the map. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I think it's not
too much of a stretch </garnt>
<garnt> to say that without
Danny Choo's influence, </garnt>
<joey> I don't think any of us would
really even be interested </joey>
<joey> in Japanese culture,
especially people on the West. </joey>
<garnt> - He did so much for,
not only like our culture </garnt>
<joey> but our industry as well. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he was one of the first
foreigners who moved to Japan </joey>
<joey> and really put a highlight
on a lot of things </joey>
<joey> going on in the Japanese industry. </joey>
<joey> - He had to blog about it.
- Yeah, exactly, </joey>
<joey> 'cause before, I remember it was just like </joey>
<joey> Japan was just kind of a black hole. </joey>
<garnt> Nobody knew shit that
was happening in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> we just got anime somehow. </garnt>
<garnt> But he actually spotlighted
a lot of the things going on, </garnt>
<garnt> and if not for him, </garnt>
<garnt> I probably wouldn't even
have even considered moving </garnt>
<garnt> to Japan or have any interest
in the industry itself. </garnt>
<garnt> - He did some great motivational speeches </garnt>
<garnt> at a lot of events like anime expo. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he's a really down
to earth guy as well. </garnt>
<joey> - He's so humble, incredibly
incredibly humble. </joey>
<garnt> - Everything he's done,
he's like so humble </garnt>
<garnt> and so down to earth. </garnt>
<garnt> - He just showed up with his doll. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he showed up with this smart doll, </joey>
<garnt> yeah, that was so cool,
shout out to Danny Choo. </garnt>
<garnt> But you should have been
there bro. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I'm pissed off I missed out. </connor>
<garnt> - How was the Crunchyroll
anime awards compared to that? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Gigguk laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, one day I
came back into my room, </garnt>
<garnt> and there was a trash bag full
of stuff that wasn't mine. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you believe that? </garnt>
<garnt> - In your hotel?
- In my hotel room. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who went in there? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I called them up and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> Hey, there's a, just a giant
bag of trash in my room. </garnt>
<garnt> What's up with that? </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, "Really?" </garnt>
<garnt> They didn't believe me. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, come, come. </connor>
<garnt> - The maids probably cleaned up. </garnt>
<connor> - Well I think what they did
is the maids were cleaning </connor>
<garnt> and they just forgot the
bag, so I didn't care much. </garnt>
<garnt> They gave me a letter that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Dear CDawg, sorry that we
left trash in your room." </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, why is it CDawg? </connor>
<garnt> - Probably the name that
they put on the reservation? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it was Connor, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I checked in with
my real name and I know, </connor>
<connor> the guy must have known or
something, it was weird as fuck. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause then he gave me
another bottle of wine, </joey>
<joey> but it was like a terrible
hotel screw-cap wine, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I wouldn't
even cook with this shit. </joey>
<joey> No offense, it's like, it
was fuckin' garbage wine. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I'm not picky,
but even I knew that. </connor>
<joey> - How was the actual awards? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, how was it for you? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we both went on different years. </garnt>
<connor> - I imagine it was the same for you, </connor>
<connor> the best aspect was just
chatting to the other creators. </connor>
<garnt> - It felt like a holiday, </garnt>
<garnt> where you just got to meet other creators. </garnt>
<connor> - I got to eat Chipotle, I've
been missing Chipotle a lot. </connor>
<connor> I was like, 'cause we would
all eat lunch together, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Chipotle,
I want Chipotle," </connor>
<connor> and then one of the, I
forgot her name, from IGN. </connor>
<connor> I think she was Hispanic, </connor>
<connor> and she was like, "No,
Chipotle's garbage." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Listen, I come
from a place recently </connor>
<connor> where they don't have any Chipotle. </connor>
<connor> Do you know how hard
it is to find a burrito </connor>
<connor> bigger than like your index
finger in this country? </connor>
<garnt> Impossible."
- I think out of every cuisine </garnt>
<garnt> Mexican is one of the
hardest to find in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - I want a burrito that
like fucking kills me. </connor>
<connor> So anyway, it was nice
having lunch with them. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, I'm going on a rant there. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, it was pretty
cool, the offices were cool, </garnt>
<garnt> they've made it into like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you got to see
the offices, didn't they? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was cool. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I felt like a little
extra, like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> there was a lot of free LaCroix, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't really care for LaCroix. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's LaCroix?
- You know LaCroix, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's like the meme drink. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the most
disgusting thing I ever had. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that like White Claw? </garnt>
<joey> - No, LaCroix is like, it's like salted? </joey>
<garnt> - Flavored, sparkling water. </garnt>
<connor> - It was weird, 'cause I think
you went two years in a row. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I didn't go to the one </garnt>
<connor> where they were streaming
out, the Twitch headquarters. </connor>
<connor> Where they streaming
at the Twitch quarters? </connor>
<garnt> - No, they were streaming in their office. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay.
- So that was like a back room </garnt>
<connor> with a small crowd of about
100 people, and it was fine. </connor>
<connor> I really got bored of how many
times you had to practice. </connor>
<garnt> - How many times did you have to rehearse? </garnt>
<connor> ' Cause we only-
- Four times. </connor>
<connor> - we only had to rehearse once. </connor>
<garnt> - Four fucking times.
- Jesus, four? </garnt>
<garnt> - What were they rehearsing? </garnt>
<connor> - I think it was for the host, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause obviously, he had a lot of lines. </garnt>
<joey> For me it was easy, I just, </joey>
<garnt> oh, during the rehearsals,
by the way, I mean gone... </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, so I gotta tell the story. </garnt>
<garnt> So they wanted us to have
a mixture of scripted </garnt>
<garnt> and do your own stuff as I
think it should be, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I want to be on track,
but I also wanna be myself. </garnt>
<connor> So they would ask me a
question that was kind of, </connor>
<connor> "Who do you think is best skilled?" </connor>
<garnt> And during rehearsals, </garnt>
<connor> I never said like anything
even remotely Mimi. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh yeah, like Rem." </connor>
<connor> And then I texted Gigguk like
an hour before the show start, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Yeah, give me the worst girl. </connor>
<garnt> Give me the worst, best girl, </garnt>
<garnt> And I will dead-ass say
this like straight face </garnt>
<garnt> in front of all these
people, like I'll do it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll do it on the Twitch
stream, I don't mind." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I thought, I wanna make this funny. </garnt>
<garnt> In a good way, that wasn't
fucking with Crunchyroll, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's a way that we could
get a bit of laughter out. </garnt>
<garnt> - I said Nina from "Code Geass", </garnt>
<garnt> that was the first name that came to mind. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember I said that joke </connor>
<joey> and the fucking crowd's like, </joey>
<joey> no one got it.
- I watched the stream. </joey>
<garnt> - I was fucking pissing myself. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought to myself, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I knew no one was
gonna laugh at this joke, </joey>
<joey> and I just thought to myself, </joey>
<joey> I was like, the Twitch
chat, they're gonna love it, </joey>
<joey> Twitch chat's gonna love this. </joey>
<connor> I don't mind, I'll just put
up with the awkward silence </connor>
<connor> for like one second. </connor>
<joey> - I was watching the Twitch stream, </joey>
<joey> and the moment you said that, I died, </joey>
<joey> Twitch chat was fucking loving it, </joey>
<garnt> - But the crowd in the audience
and everyone's there, dead. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember the moment I said it, </connor>
<connor> for some reason, Jacob
from Fakku was in the crowd </connor>
<connor> and I just made eye contact with Jacob </connor>
<connor> and he looked like this. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, and I think I
made like a joke or something, </garnt>
<garnt> I made something to
like try and segway it, </garnt>
<connor> and it didn't work very well obviously, </connor>
<garnt> but I didn't give a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - It made for a great clip </garnt>
<garnt> because it was like so
perfectly timed of my stream, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was like, yeah,
I told Connor to say Nina, </garnt>
<garnt> and as soon as I said that, you said it, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just like the
most perfectly timed moment </garnt>
<garnt> I could ever hope for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Asked me, what he should say for this, </garnt>
<joey> in the chat, he was like,
"They're gonna ask me </joey>
<garnt> who the all time best girl is." </garnt>
<garnt> - What'd you tell him? </garnt>
<garnt> - I told him, say Nina from
"Code Geass". (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - [Panelist] Connor? </connor>
<connor> - Umh, Nina from "Code Geass". </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god! </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was, it was good. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, it was fun, we
hung out in the green room </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever, it was
chill, just chatting with, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember, I chat with
ProZD, really cool guy. </garnt>
<garnt> That man knows his anime,
he knows a lot of anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - He knows so much anime. </garnt>
<connor> because I had a similar
conversation with him </connor>
<garnt> and I'm like, man you know,
more anime the most AniTubers. </garnt>
<connor> - We were just in this
room and it was silent, </connor>
<connor> then you would just hear someone playing </connor>
<connor> the fucking "Love Live". </connor>
<connor> Just ProZD sitting there like this. </connor>
<connor> - He's a Love Liver? </connor>
<connor> - He's a hardcore Love Liver. </connor>
<garnt> - I love it when like, when he would talk, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it would be like
whenever ProZD talked, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone in the room was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yes, ProZD, I'll listen to you." </garnt>
<garnt> He got such a commanding
voice, it's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who has the deeper voice in real life? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like just two mumbles
talking when they're talking, </connor>
<garnt> because he's like, "Get McDonald's," </garnt>
<connor> I be, "Yeah, I'll get McDonald's." </connor>
<connor> - The subwoofer on this
conversation is ridiculous. </connor>
<garnt> - Overall it was good. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that the parts I remember the most </garnt>
<connor> are like not the actual, like awards. </connor>
<connor> - Same, I don't remember anything, </connor>
<connor> all that happened was
that when I was on stage. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember when I
was on the Crunchyroll, </garnt>
<garnt> it was a big fucking crowd. </garnt>
<garnt> How big was your crowd? </garnt>
<connor> - Like no more than 100. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, 'cause we were like, </garnt>
<garnt> they rented our whole
stage in LA or something. </garnt>
<garnt> They had like a red carpet, </garnt>
<garnt> which like, an orange calm. </garnt>
<garnt> It was charming about like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was still like
a small scale event, </garnt>
<garnt> but they really tried to dress this up </garnt>
<garnt> to look like something official. </garnt>
<joey> And you know, there was a
lot of technical difficulties </joey>
<joey> and mess up, but that's
probably like, you know, </joey>
<joey> if you watch the streams- </joey>
<joey> - The technical difficulties
in that year were glorious. </joey>
<joey> - They made for like great meme material. </joey>
<joey> And it was like charming in its own way </joey>
<joey> because it wasn't like The Game Awards, </joey>
<garnt> it wasn't the fucking Oscars, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, they tried their best. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think for what they had, </garnt>
<garnt> they did like a pretty decent job. </garnt>
<joey> - B plus for effort, I'd say. </joey>
<connor> - I think they said that
they wanted to dial it back </connor>
<garnt> this year to make it a little more like </garnt>
<garnt> have personality shine through a bit more. </garnt>
<joey> But it's still hard
because I think sometimes </joey>
<connor> some people aren't as
good on stage as others. </connor>
<garnt> - Is that your first
time kind of "hosting"? </garnt>
<connor> - I wasn't doing anything? </connor>
<joey> - He was literally just sitting
on a couch, cracking jokes. </joey>
<garnt> - The only thing I was nervous
about was cracking that joke, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I knew that was gonna,
I knew no one would laugh, </garnt>
<garnt> but I didn't mind. </garnt>
<connor> But other than that, </connor>
<connor> I really don't mind doing
stuff like that, that's fun. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember the only
weird thing that happened </garnt>
<garnt> when I was on stage was, I
was standing next to Lily </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was hosting with Lily Puchi </garnt>
<garnt> when I was presenting my award, </garnt>
<garnt> and so I was staying at the bright lights </garnt>
<garnt> and all I heard was, (muffling) </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought someone
said, "I love you guys." </garnt>
<garnt> And I shout out in the Crunchyroll awards, </garnt>
<garnt> "I love you too, man." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I've watched the vods, </garnt>
<garnt> and the guy shouts out, "I
love you, Lily." (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That would be even better. </garnt>
<connor> I would be like, no, I love you. </connor>
<joey> - You may not love me, but
I love you unconditionally. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't think
anyone noticed there, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah, I thought
you were just screaming </garnt>
<garnt> for us both there. </garnt>
<connor> - When they did the final award, </connor>
<connor> at Crunchyroll anime awards, </connor>
<garnt> they had like a giant,
like what is it called? </garnt>
<garnt> The fucking thing they open, what's it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sake? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I think it is, they all had Sake, </garnt>
<garnt> that's part of the story, </garnt>
<garnt> but they have like the
big boxes that we had, </garnt>
<garnt> like the names of the winners in, </garnt>
<garnt> the anime of the year
had like a giant one. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what they're called, </joey>
<joey> I know what you're talking about though. </joey>
<joey> - So when they did the giant one, </joey>
<joey> they were like, "Yeah, okay,
everyone's gonna go on stage </joey>
<joey> and we have a fake Sake
for you, it's water." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh cool, cool, cool. </joey>
<connor> So I have it right, and I'm
smelling it like next to Lily. </connor>
<connor> I think you can see me
and Lily in the VODs, </connor>
<connor> like visual confusion, </connor>
<connor> because we do it, I'm like,
"That's fucking Sake." </connor>
<connor> They told us it was fucking water! </connor>
<connor> Me and Lily are like,
"God that's fucking vile." </connor>
<connor> She's like, "Yeah, that's gross." </connor>
<connor> They lied to us. </connor>
<connor> Crunchyroll, what if I
was allergic to alcohol? </connor>
<garnt> - They gave you free alcohol
and you didn't even know. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause there was alcohol
right after in the after-party. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so we know that you're
now working for Book Walker </joey>
<connor> and GeeXPlus and all that,
that's really great Meilyne. </connor>
<joey> - Why say it so condescending? </joey>
<joey> - Because that's not what
I care about Meilyne, </joey>
<joey> I wanna know what you were doing </joey>
<connor> when you were younger in Japan. </connor>
<connor> What jobs were you doing? </connor>
<connor> - We wanna know about your week. </connor>
<garnt> - What is your path to
getting to where you are now? </garnt>
<connor> - We want the viewers to recognize </connor>
<garnt> with your shonen protagonist art, </garnt>
<connor> we need to build up Meilyne's character. </connor>
<garnt> - We've told all of our back stories, </garnt>
<garnt> it's time for us to tell your back story. </garnt>
<garnt> - Backstory? Okay. </garnt>
<joey> So I used to go to a lot
of anime conventions- </joey>
<joey> - As you do.
- Yes, </joey>
<connor> and, where am I going with this? </connor>
<connor> - That's how you met your husband right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, that's the thing. </garnt>
<connor> I forgot to tell the story
or not tell the story. </connor>
<garnt> I wanted to say like the biggest tip </garnt>
<garnt> is to envision what position
you want in the anime industry </garnt>
<joey> and make like steps to get there. </joey>
<joey> And the steps I made for myself </joey>
<garnt> is one, keep going to a
lot of anime conventions </garnt>
<garnt> and make friends that work in some, like- </garnt>
<joey> - In the industry.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And one of the people
that I met at a convention </joey>
<garnt> happened to bring Japanese rock bands, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, Japanese rock bands to
the U.S anime conventions. </garnt>
<garnt> And then that person introduced
me to a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> that were in Japan and the
hardest thing for a foreigner, </garnt>
<garnt> for someone to get there... </garnt>
<garnt> No, sorry, the hardest thing </garnt>
<garnt> is to get into Japan with the visa. </garnt>
<garnt> Finding a job that'll give you a visa </garnt>
<garnt> when you don't speak good
Japanese is extremely difficult. </garnt>
<garnt> So the first thing I did was get a job </garnt>
<garnt> that has no relation to
anime, to get the experience </garnt>
<garnt> and then try to do a consulting job </garnt>
<joey> that consults for anime figure,
like, type of companies. </joey>
<garnt> And then, after that, meet
people from that industry, </garnt>
<garnt> get the know-how from them </garnt>
<garnt> and then apply to the job that I have now. </garnt>
<connor> But, gosh, I'm like-
- Damn, that's calculated. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I calculated everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - At the end of the day,
you know, it's that age old, </garnt>
<joey> like, it's not what you
know, it's who you know. </joey>
<garnt> - I think I've heard similar
stories with other friends, </garnt>
<garnt> like Nabi, who I had no idea
how he knew so many people </garnt>
<garnt> in the industry. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember asking
him and he was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, just go to enough events, </garnt>
<garnt> just talk to enough people." </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a lot of events here. </garnt>
<garnt> For me I'm like a nervous wreck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we could tell. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Do not be fooled by
Meilyne's nervousness, </connor>
<garnt> she is a killer.
(dramatic music) </garnt>
<connor> - It's only you guys in the room, </connor>
<connor> so that's why I'm comfortable, </connor>
<garnt> but it's like, if there's more than that, </garnt>
<garnt> holy, oh my god, this
would be soaked. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So like you have to meet people, network. </garnt>
<garnt> - And a lot of people will
find that difficult in the U.S </garnt>
<garnt> and abroad, 'cause the only
place I could possibly think of </garnt>
<garnt> is like conventions and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> But in Japan, there are
so many official events </garnt>
<garnt> that you can go to to meet people. </garnt>
<garnt> What would you recommend then? </garnt>
<garnt> Like what should people look out for </garnt>
<garnt> if they wanted to just
be in the right place </garnt>
<garnt> at the right time? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a lot of
Facebook groups actually, </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of these Facebook groups </garnt>
<garnt> are for like the otaku community, </garnt>
<garnt> and sometimes they have industry people </garnt>
<garnt> as surprise guests or like just show up. </garnt>
<garnt> So go to those and you can meet people, </garnt>
<garnt> or when there's like,
they're kinda like panels, </garnt>
<garnt> industry panels, </garnt>
<garnt> you can meet people at the
after party of these things. </garnt>
<joey> - From experience, I've had people, </joey>
<connor> one thing I know that doesn't work </connor>
<connor> is to just go up to someone </connor>
<garnt> and being like, "Hey, I'm this person, </garnt>
<garnt> here's my business card, call me." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, I don't
know what you do bro. </garnt>
<joey> What do you want to do with me? </joey>
<connor> - I've had that so much. </connor>
<garnt> They come to you really like
suave, like, "Here's my card, </garnt>
<connor> I expect to hear from you." </connor>
<connor> - You small talk first though. </connor>
<joey> - At least explain what is the purpose </joey>
<garnt> of you going up to people, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what is the kind of
connection that you want? </garnt>
<garnt> It's not just about like,
"I wanna make a connection </garnt>
<garnt> because I want a connection." </garnt>
<connor> It's about, why do you
want the connection, </connor>
<connor> what do you wanna do with the connection </connor>
<connor> and explain why it'll be
mutually beneficial, right? </connor>
<connor> They'll just be like, "Here's
my business card, call me." </connor>
<joey> - If you know that they would
be in a beneficial position </joey>
<joey> sometimes I might just play dumb </joey>
<joey> and be like, "Oh yes, what do you do?" </joey>
<joey> - They'll tell me and I'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, no way, I'm in the same industry." </joey>
<garnt> But then they're like,
yeah, that's organic, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But the whole time, I'll be like- </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Because a lot of weebs don't realize </connor>
<garnt> that one of the most important
skills you need to learn </garnt>
<garnt> when getting a job in any
industry, it's just social skills. </garnt>
<garnt> - God-dam it, no! </garnt>
<garnt> - Not a lot, you just
gotta learn social skills. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't wanna talk to people! </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually tutored random
people in English, in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> to develop social skills. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like, it should be
inspiration for all of you. </garnt>
<garnt> If this nervous wreck can
develop enough social skills </garnt>
<joey> to be working in the industry </joey>
<joey> and convince fucking Japanese companies </joey>
<garnt> to form GeeXPlus, there's
hope for you as well, okay? </garnt>
<connor> - No amount of social anxiety
is gonna stop you, alright? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the first time I called you, </connor>
<garnt> I was like, "Wow, why is
she so fucking nervous?" </garnt>
<connor> - On the phone, I think you were like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's okay, don't be nervous." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Oh it's just,
it's winter, it's really cold." </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause my voice gets shaking. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the worst thing
to say though, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and it got me more nervous. </connor>
<connor> - Saying "Don't be nervous," </connor>
<connor> it's just gonna get them more nervous. </connor>
<connor> - I think I was like,
"Why are you so nervous?" </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you said that, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "No,
it's cold, it's cold." </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't know that was like-
- That's a no-no. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanted to see what kind of
reaction Meilyne would give, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanted to see,
'cause I just got a vibe </garnt>
<garnt> that you would react really funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - We met in real life first, </garnt>
<connor> at the anime expo.
- We did, </connor>
<connor> that's why I didn't mind.
- And then you said </connor>
<connor> the same thing, you were like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, you don't have to be so awkward." </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause we were talking </connor>
<garnt> and you're like, "Well, I
don't know if we can, um," </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, what the fuck's
wrong with you? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I remember my
first business meeting </garnt>
<garnt> with you as well and whenever
Meilyne's negotiating, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the most hilarious
thing I've ever seen. </garnt>
<garnt> - When we had the piece of paper out, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "How about this?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's so obvious </garnt>
<connor> if you don't like the deal that's offered. </connor>
<connor> You're like, (humming). </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, "How do I say no </garnt>
<garnt> without sounding like an asshole?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I know how she says it, she says, "Oh." </garnt>
<joey> When you hear Meilyne saying that, </joey>
<joey> you're immediately like,
"Oh, it's not good, is it?" </joey>
<joey> - I was about to say, you can
write a fuckin' dictionary </joey>
<garnt> on your fuckin' ohs, and
like, which tone you say it in </garnt>
<garnt> just communicates something
completely different. </garnt>
<garnt> - You even type it to us as well. </garnt>
<garnt> When I'm texting you about a business deal </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, "Oh they
came back with this, </garnt>
<garnt> what do you think?" </garnt>
<garnt> And you legitimately come back with, "Oh," </garnt>
<garnt> and immediately I'm
just like, "Say no more, </garnt>
<garnt> I know exactly what you mean." </garnt>
<garnt> - I remembered a story, I
don't know if I've told this. </garnt>
<garnt> I told you guys about the time
at "Promare" there was a guy? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<garnt> - So, when I was at the
premier of "Promare", </garnt>
<garnt> I was sitting in the Studio Trigger seats </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause a friend got me into
the Studio Trigger seats </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, well, it's fuckin' cool. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm sitting on the end
of the Studio Trigger seats, </garnt>
<joey> "Promare" is about to start, </joey>
<joey> and it's obviously Studio Trigger seats </joey>
<joey> 'cause all the seats say
reserved for Studio Trigger. </joey>
<joey> So I'm sitting there, and this
guy in like a final fantasy </joey>
<joey> like Claude cosplay comes up to me </joey>
<connor> and he goes, "Hey do you work at Trigger?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, no, these guys do. </connor>
<connor> He's like, and then I say that to him </connor>
<connor> and was like, Oh I've made a mistake, </connor>
<connor> 'cause then he's like, "Oh, hello." </connor>
<connor> And then I'm like, Oh my god." </connor>
<connor> Over me, he's like, "Hello?" </connor>
<joey> Bear in mind, he's full
costume, fuckin' giant sword. </joey>
<garnt> He's like, "How do I get
a job at Studio Trigger?" </garnt>
<connor> to this Japanese man who
can't speak a word of English. </connor>
<garnt> And he's like (sound) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you should've just
been like, "Not like this." </joey>
<connor> - Literally, I was like, </connor>
<joey> "Bro, I don't think
this is the right time." </joey>
<joey> He asked that to them,
they were visibly confused, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "Bro, I don't
think this is the right play." </joey>
<connor> He's like, "Oh, okay." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, what The fuck? </joey>
<joey> - With these kinds of people, </joey>
<joey> what do they expect the answer to be? </joey>
<joey> Be like, "Oh yes, here's my
business card, contact me." </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "You were the right guy. </joey>
<garnt> We were waiting for
someone to be bold enough </garnt>
<garnt> to ask us at the 'Promare'." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) Like, no, fuck off! </garnt>
<joey> - Like no, that's not how you get a job. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like one of those
moments, I was like, "Oh no." </joey>
<garnt> - That's secondhand embarrassment, right? </garnt>
<connor> - This is the biggest L
I've ever seen in my life. </connor>
<joey> - So, advice, at your next convention </joey>
<joey> and you see an industry
guest, don't do that. </joey>
<joey> That's not how you get a job. </joey>
<garnt> - I couldn't believe it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think they're looking to hire </garnt>
<garnt> when they're at conventions. </garnt>
<garnt> - The person that's
like, the hiring person </garnt>
<garnt> wouldn't go to that
event anyways, I think. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, if I ran an anime company, </joey>
<joey> the last place I would go to hire people </joey>
<garnt> is the anime convention. </garnt>
<garnt> - It just seems like the way to get hired </garnt>
<garnt> in Japanese companies it's just
first to be in Japan, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - In Japan or like apply to U.S companies, </garnt>
<connor> like Crunchyroll and Viz Media. </connor>
<connor> - Being outright and so like, not even, </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's a little
aggressive asking, right? </connor>
<connor> Like that kind of way, just doesn't work. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you gotta insert yourself. </connor>
<connor> - You weren't even cosplaying
as a Trigger character, </connor>
<connor> you're cosplay is fuckin' Claude. </connor>
<connor> - So if he turned up full,
like real "Kill la Kill". </connor>
<joey> - As you can see I am a
fan, can I have a job? </joey>
<garnt> - It's like our audience
knows what we think </garnt>
<garnt> about working in Japanese companies. </garnt>
<garnt> How has it for you who actually
works in a Japanese company </garnt>
<garnt> for the industry? </garnt>
<garnt> - I worked in different Japanese companies </garnt>
<garnt> before the anime one, awkward mode on. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's okay, it won't hurt
you, it's a microphone. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, you want me
to say it's like exciting, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like nervous.
- No, just be honest. </garnt>
<connor> - Are the rumors true, are
Japanese companies hell? </connor>
<garnt> I'm joking. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause just like black companies, white. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like, Japan
has like this terminology </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like, it's black or it's white. </garnt>
<garnt> White is like, they follow the rules, </garnt>
<garnt> they treat their employees nice, </garnt>
<garnt> and then black is like, they overwork you, </garnt>
<garnt> they ask you to work like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> 12 hours or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> But no, I got really lucky, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> The company I work for is
really like very aggressive </garnt>
<garnt> about telling their employees, </garnt>
<garnt> "Go home, have a social life." </garnt>
<garnt> And they highly, highly value that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's good.
- Well, what do you think </garnt>
<connor> about the Japanese like
work-life schedule? </connor>
<joey> - As someone who lives there. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's on average Japanese, </joey>
<connor> they work on average 80 hours a week. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - 80 hours a week. </connor>
<garnt> - How was like your work-life schedule </garnt>
<garnt> compared to when you are
working outside of Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> if you have any comparison. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I only worked
for an American company </garnt>
<garnt> in like San Francisco
for a month before I quit </garnt>
<garnt> and chase my anime dreams. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, based on that
one month experience, </garnt>
<garnt> it's very different. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, in America I would just clock out </garnt>
<garnt> and leave that's it, </garnt>
<garnt> Here, it's like, you wanna
impress your supervisor </garnt>
<garnt> with good results and sometimes
to get those good results, </garnt>
<connor> I mean, it doesn't
necessarily make more time </connor>
<connor> but if you spend more time
doing more research... </connor>
<connor> - Meilyne's a hard worker.
- I don't know, maybe. </connor>
<garnt> - On the polar opposite, </garnt>
<garnt> you got like the Scandinavian countries </garnt>
<garnt> which are like six hours a day is fine, </garnt>
<garnt> four days a week, that seems good. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, there's been plenty of studies </garnt>
<joey> that prove that working more </joey>
<joey> doesn't necessarily mean more money. </joey>
<joey> I mean, there's studies to actually prove </joey>
<connor> the opposite of that,
which is working less </connor>
<connor> tends to be more productive. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's where
the whole controversy </connor>
<joey> of the whole thing comes from, right? </joey>
<joey> Where like employees of
traditional companies </joey>
<garnt> are almost forced, like socially, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not a rule in the company, </garnt>
<garnt> but they're almost socially
bound to stay back overtime </garnt>
<garnt> to work. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think they should though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not because they need to do the work, </garnt>
<joey> but because as you said, </joey>
<joey> they wanna impress the supervisors, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, kind of. </joey>
<garnt> But there are some times, </garnt>
<garnt> I think they really shouldn't stay behind </garnt>
<garnt> even if they're not really
"working" or working </garnt>
<connor> because it really takes a
toll on their mental health. </connor>
<joey> Like for me, usually before an event </joey>
<joey> the month or month and a half, </joey>
<joey> I'm actually working like really late, </joey>
<garnt> like 11:00 PM or something </garnt>
<garnt> because crunch time type of thing. </garnt>
<joey> And I felt like, miserable
during those times, </joey>
<joey> so I can only imagine how
miserable Japanese people </joey>
<garnt> at Japanese companies that do overtime- </garnt>
<connor> - I feel sorry for them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I felt angry for no reason. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why am I angry? </connor>
<garnt> Oh, it's because, am I working too much? </garnt>
<garnt> But I really loved what I did. </garnt>
<garnt> Even if you love what you do though, </garnt>
<garnt> when you get tired, you get cranky. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that's the same as us. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we love our jobs
but we're always working, </garnt>
<garnt> and we never get a break but
even though we love what we do </garnt>
<garnt> there's times when I fuckin' hate anime. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just like, no. </garnt>
<joey> - There are times where I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> "I don't wanna work on this video man, </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanna play games." </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, I know.
- Watch porn or something. </garnt>
<garnt> it's like anything else to
just get my mind off of it. </garnt>
<connor> - Two hour porn marathon. </connor>
<joey> - Just watch it. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's just one of those days, you know? </joey>
<joey> - What's the convention
time like for you then? </joey>
<joey> Because for us, it's like,
especially AX is busy as hell </joey>
<garnt> but I've seen people
working in the industry </garnt>
<garnt> working fucking overtime when
it comes to convention season. </garnt>
<connor> - I wonder as well, expanding on that is, </connor>
<connor> how does it all work with
industries and the conventions? </connor>
<garnt> - I can only speak from my
particular perspective or spot. </garnt>
<connor> - I wouldn't expect you to
be the arbiter of knowledge </connor>
<connor> on conventions. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Japanese companies, I
think they have to prepare </connor>
<connor> a lot more than U.S companies </connor>
<connor> because we have to consider </connor>
<connor> people that don't speak
English coming over </connor>
<connor> and their first time
exhibiting at an event, </connor>
<garnt> and the amount of time it
takes to ship something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, if they're going to sell something, </garnt>
<garnt> at overseas at the convention, </garnt>
<garnt> shipping it might be a problem. </garnt>
<garnt> So it takes like a lot of time. </garnt>
<joey> - To be fair though,
if I can say something, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it's just Kadokawa, </joey>
<joey> I've noticed with any booth </joey>
<joey> that is run by a Japanese company, </joey>
<joey> the amount of staff they
have, it's kinda ridiculous. </joey>
<garnt> - There's usually like a supervisor </garnt>
<joey> that's watching another supervisor </joey>
<joey> watching other supervisors. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the entire supply
chain watching each other. </garnt>
<garnt> - In American company booths, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's like two to five max. </garnt>
<connor> The Kadokawa booth had like 60 people. </connor>
<joey> - I remember going inside
the Kadokawa booth, </joey>
<garnt> I remember there was like 30 employees. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, this is just stupid. </connor>
<garnt> - The reason is, each person,
like, even within Kadokawa, </garnt>
<garnt> say these are all from the same series </garnt>
<garnt> or no, not the same
series, same publisher, </garnt>
<garnt> each department has a
different person in charge </garnt>
<garnt> and that person charged
needs to be there to like- </garnt>
<joey> - But this feels like it's been like- </joey>
<joey> - But do they though? </joey>
<connor> - This feels like this
should've been like- </connor>
<joey> - Coordinated, right? </joey>
<connor> Just get like one person </connor>
<garnt> to just kind of look over everything </garnt>
<joey> and then once the event
is done, just report that. </joey>
<garnt> - Seems like a lot of redundancy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's also important
for them to go overseas </garnt>
<garnt> because they're like, their mind is open, </garnt>
<garnt> you become open-minded? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, sometimes. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just like how American otakus are. </garnt>
<joey> - But the problem is, half the employees </joey>
<joey> don't come out of the booth. </joey>
<joey> So they don't even get to
experience the culture. </joey>
<garnt> - But they can see, or
hear from outside the booth </garnt>
<garnt> like what item's being sold
the most and like take men- </garnt>
<garnt> - So what do they think
of foreign conventions </garnt>
<garnt> and the foreign culture
then, from your perspective? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've heard think it's
like, wow, amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> So different and like, so open </garnt>
<joey> compared to the fan otaku culture here. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I've heard from
a lot of Japanese people. </joey>
<garnt> - The fans here are really uptight. </garnt>
<garnt> Like for example, like
Comiket or anime events here, </garnt>
<joey> you can't go there and cosplay </joey>
<joey> because you would bring
shame to the event. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I've heard that story. </joey>
<joey> - Actually, my friends
and I cosplayed at Comiket </joey>
<joey> like six years ago, </joey>
<joey> and we were the top
trending thing at that time </joey>
<garnt> on tuchan, saying "These
three American girls </garnt>
<garnt> cosplaying as "Love Live" on the train." </garnt>
<garnt> And shame on me for not
doing my research beforehand- </garnt>
<joey> - But still, chill.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I had like friends in America, </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese friends in America messaged me, </garnt>
<garnt> "What are you guys doing over there? </garnt>
<garnt> You can't cosplay in the train." </garnt>
<connor> - Isn't it fun though? </connor>
<garnt> I'd love to see a cosplay on the train. </garnt>
<garnt> - We had like a circle follow
us from station to station. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like, "Oh,
can you take that off?" </garnt>
<garnt> But we were only wearing the wig. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I was wearing normal
clothes, just the wig. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you're not even
allowed to wear a wig. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and then my friend told her, </garnt>
<garnt> like, "You know, we're
only wearing the wig," </garnt>
<garnt> they're like, "No, they
know from your hair, </garnt>
<garnt> what character you are." </garnt>
<joey> - But look, I understand if
it's something gratuitous, </joey>
<joey> like if you were all
cosplaying as fuckin' Ryuko, </joey>
<garnt> where it's like a little
more like scandalous right? </garnt>
<garnt> But like, it's "Love Live",
you're in school uniform. </garnt>
<garnt> The only thing that separates
you from a regular school girl </garnt>
<joey> is just the wig. </joey>
<garnt> - But to be fair, they
wanna protect this culture, </garnt>
<joey> they wanna keep having these events. </joey>
<joey> - It's just gate keeping.
- That is gate keeping. </joey>
<joey> - For example a normie
would be on the train </joey>
<garnt> and they see some crazy cosplayer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Isn't it fun though? </garnt>
<connor> - But also like anime otakus in Japan </connor>
<garnt> aren't viewed in like a positive light. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think they necessarily
are though in the West. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't feel like
there's as bad a stigma </garnt>
<garnt> compared to this here. </garnt>
<garnt> - They think you're like
sweaty and I mean, I am, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, sweaty (laughing). </garnt>
<connor> You're just so weird,
you watch the weird stuff </connor>
<connor> on the internet. </connor>
<garnt> - Cosplay's not even that weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - I rocked up on the London
underground in a maid outfit. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, just did it, just like
40 minute commute, hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone loves it,
they're like all laughing, </garnt>
<connor> all giggling and asking questions. </connor>
<garnt> - Were they being like,
"What do you cosplaying </garnt>
<garnt> or dressing up as?" </garnt>
<connor> - I get heckled from the
other side of the thing, </connor>
<connor> and then like, you know,
it's just good fun. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I thought it was funny, </connor>
<connor> but obviously, I guess- </connor>
<joey> - It's such a weird double
standard though, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> Where it's like, anime-loving otakus </connor>
<connor> are like, "Ooh, sweaty, gross." </connor>
<garnt> And then meanwhile, if
there's a guy rocking up </garnt>
<garnt> with like full on like,
you know, idols shit, </garnt>
<garnt> they're like, "Yeah, he
just really likes idols." </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, no, he's just a sweaty. </garnt>
<joey> - A lot of people think it's gross. </joey>
<garnt> Every time I told Japanese people, </garnt>
<garnt> like, "Oh, I'm an otaku," </garnt>
<garnt> they're like, "No, you're not,
you don't look like otaku." </garnt>
<garnt> What does otaku look like? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, really, how
dare you insult my people? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, like what do they
expect an otaku to look like? </joey>
<garnt> Where it's like, you're
fuckin' 300 pounds. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's like how the word weeaboo </joey>
<joey> used to be seen like 10
years ago in our community </joey>
<garnt> where, who would identify
themselves as a weeaboo? </garnt>
<garnt> That's like a cringy person
nobody wants to know, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Because the stereotypical
otaku in Japan, </joey>
<joey> you don't see people like that anymore. </joey>
<garnt> There's people who like anime </garnt>
<garnt> and that's just normalized here. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was cool. </garnt>
<joey> Like 20 year old girls
have like the Ita-bags, </joey>
<joey> and love 2d boys. </joey>
<garnt> - And everyone loves JoJo's. </garnt>
<connor> That's like the Chi-Chi, right? </connor>
<garnt> Where you just where JoJo
merch to a business meeting- </garnt>
<garnt> - It just feels so good. </garnt>
<connor> - You'll get like a 50
year old businessman </connor>
<connor> and be like, I love JoJo's. </connor>
<joey> - I was buying manga,
like my local bookstore, </joey>
<connor> and I was wearing one
of the glam JoJo shirts, </connor>
<connor> and a guy stopped putting in the books </connor>
<garnt> and he's like, "Where'd
you get that shirt from?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh, glam." </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like, "That looks sick, dude." </garnt>
<garnt> He just high fived me, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never had this experience in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously this was before the
pandemic, social distance. </garnt>
<garnt> - And everyone clapped. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - And everyone in the
store applauded Joey. </connor>
<connor> - And then they played the
JoJo opening and I left. </connor>
<connor> - JoJo's theme came on.
- As I run out the store. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, he just straight up high-fived me, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, cool. </garnt>
<connor> Jojo brings people together
man, that's fucking awesome. </connor>
<joey> - I remember I mentioned in my, </joey>
<joey> like when I streamed the
dating in Japan video, </joey>
<joey> I mentioned like, oh yeah, </joey>
<garnt> I just openly said I was an otaku, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> why are people getting
all worked up about it? </garnt>
<garnt> And then I've got loads of comments </garnt>
<garnt> they're like, "It means
a bad thing in Japan." </garnt>
<joey> I was like, yeah, I
know, I just don't care. </joey>
<connor> If I can normalize it, I
can help to get there, sure. </connor>
<joey> - Someone wants to see
it in a negative light, </joey>
<connor> that's their prerogative. </connor>
<garnt> - Most of the people that I told it to </garnt>
<connor> just didn't give a shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Going back to conventions though, </garnt>
<garnt> one thing I've always been curious about </garnt>
<garnt> is how would you guys pick
the guests to bring over </garnt>
<garnt> and showcase to people? </garnt>
<garnt> Is there a process behind that or? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, for my company, there was, </garnt>
<connor> at the time when I was like
the person in charge of events. </connor>
<garnt> We would look first at the
sales, like, oh, what's trending, </garnt>
<garnt> what's like the top selling manga </garnt>
<joey> or light novels, the top 10, </joey>
<joey> and then I just contact them, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And because I'm in Book Walker, </joey>
<garnt> and Book Walker like has really close ties </garnt>
<garnt> to all different kinds of publishers, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess we're able to ask them. </garnt>
<garnt> - That makes sense, 'cause I've
done so many creative panels </garnt>
<garnt> especially at AX with Book Walker. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like "DanMachi",
"Overlord","Goblin Slayer", </garnt>
<garnt> "Monster Musume". </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember every time
one of those panels finish, </garnt>
<garnt> it's always one person who
comes up to me for some reason </garnt>
<connor> of all people and it's like, </connor>
<joey> "Hey, next year can you get
the author of this light novel? </joey>
<joey> That'd be really cool." </joey>
<joey> - Did you ever get people who thought </joey>
<joey> you were the author of something? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I've had that as well. </joey>
<joey> Someone came up to my thing, </joey>
<garnt> this is back when the
93% was still a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Some guy, like a 13 year
old boy came up to me, </garnt>
<connor> and I'm just like, that's weird, </connor>
<connor> why is there a guy in my line? </connor>
<connor> - The 7%? </connor>
<garnt> - He comes up to me and
he's like, oh yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> He took a photo, did the signing, </connor>
<connor> he's like, you're the author
of "Goblin Slayer", right? </connor>
<garnt> No kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "No." </garnt>
<connor> - Because we had autographs at our booth </connor>
<connor> for "Goblin Slayer". </connor>
<garnt> - He was like, "You're the
author of 'Goblin Slayer'." </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, do I look like Japanese? </connor>
<joey> - I don't get a lot of,
"Oh, you're the author," </joey>
<connor> but I always get a lot
of like, "You're the guy </connor>
<garnt> who does the official translation." </garnt>
<garnt> It's like because you translated
what the author was saying, </garnt>
<garnt> so you must split... </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, I remember I
had a guy just being like, </garnt>
<joey> when's volume three of "Goblin
Slayer" gonna get translated? </joey>
<connor> Like I fuckin' know. </connor>
<joey> - You should've just been
like, yeah actually tomorrow. </joey>
<joey> - I'm working on it right
now actually, don't worry, </joey>
<joey> it's coming soon. </joey>
<connor> - If you would've just left me
alone, it would've been done. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I get so many
people just being like, </connor>
<joey> "Hey, can you bring on this creator? </joey>
<joey> Or like this author?" </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, don't ask me
about it, I'm just hosting it. </joey>
<garnt> - The anime departments
of certain companies, </garnt>
<garnt> they usually bring guests of
like say directors or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> of whatever anime is
coming out that season, </garnt>
<garnt> and they have a premiere </garnt>
<garnt> and the author or director
comes to promote the premiere. </garnt>
<garnt> So not necessarily, it's like trending- </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's basically
just all marketing then, </garnt>
<garnt> is the way I see it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's all data, it's all marketing. </garnt>
<connor> - It's all data and marketing,
it's all businesses. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I always wondered, </garnt>
<garnt> AX must be really expensive </garnt>
<garnt> to like put up all the booth,
the staff, the marketing. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it like, I mean, it obviously
it must be worth it, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like, is the return on
investment huge then? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, they're not really
looking for sales directly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's just looking for presence. </garnt>
<garnt> - Brand presence.
- If you don't have presence, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like not being at
E3, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - Guess even companies now are questioning </connor>
<connor> if E3's worth it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, Sony wasn't there
E3 the year before I think, </connor>
<joey> and that was like massive news </joey>
<joey> because that was like a massive statement </joey>
<joey> being like, "Hey, we
don't fuckin' need E3." </joey>
<joey> - We're fuckin' Sony. </joey>
<garnt> - I wonder if that would
be a thing with that. </garnt>
<garnt> Like AX when the company is like, </garnt>
<connor> Oh we don't really need AX anymore. </connor>
<garnt> - A lot of companies
though, Japanese companies </garnt>
<garnt> are bringing their own guests </garnt>
<garnt> instead of doing the guest of honor thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like right now </garnt>
<garnt> with like anime growing
so much in the West, </garnt>
<garnt> I think there is a big, like
there's more eyes at AX now, </garnt>
<joey> so like, if you're not there, </joey>
<joey> then that's like a missed
opportunity more than, </joey>
<garnt> "Hey, this is E3, this
is already established." </garnt>
<garnt> - There's so much press too, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of news sites are all at this events </garnt>
<garnt> so they could arrange interviews </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever that could promote it. </garnt>
<joey> - So going back 900 million topics ago, </joey>
<garnt> with how we started it, piracy
and KissAnime going down, </garnt>
<garnt> like what are our final thoughts? </garnt>
<garnt> What are our like final
thoughts on pirating anime? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we've thrown around
a bunch of like different </garnt>
<joey> discussions about it. </joey>
<joey> - This episode's turned into like </joey>
<garnt> an anime industry episode as a whole, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think wrapping
up the piracy debates. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna get any companies </connor>
<garnt> that never wanna work with us. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean generally, piracy, bad. </garnt>
<garnt> I think we can all agree
piracy is not good, </garnt>
<garnt> but like everything in life, there is no- </garnt>
<garnt> - Sometimes it's a
necessary evil, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not always clear cut </garnt>
<garnt> and I think until people in
the positions of authority </garnt>
<connor> most of the time or who in the industry </connor>
<connor> recognize that there
might be, in some cases, </connor>
<connor> you know, it's like, whatever. </connor>
<joey> - It's much of a service problem </joey>
<garnt> as it is a community problem, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because like, yeah, of
course people will say like, </garnt>
<connor> oh you know, the only reason
these piracy sites are thriving </connor>
<connor> is because these legal
sites aren't doing the job </connor>
<joey> that these piracy sites are covering. </joey>
<joey> But then at the same time, </joey>
<joey> a lot of the community is like, nah, dude </joey>
<joey> let's just use the piracy stuff. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think you need to
justify or shame people either. </garnt>
<joey> - No, definitely not. </joey>
<garnt> - And I think there's one thing, </garnt>
<garnt> one last point I want to
make about the service thing </garnt>
<garnt> where no matter what, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think legal sites
will ever get to a point </garnt>
<joey> when they can fully compete with piracy. </joey>
<joey> I mean, there's never
going to be one company </joey>
<joey> that has all the shows or
has every show in existence. </joey>
<joey> - Even though every company
is trying their best. </joey>
<joey> - Every company is trying their best, </joey>
<joey> but I don't think we'll
ever get to a point </joey>
<joey> where we're going to get
like a legal KissAnime, </joey>
<joey> know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> or a legal whatever site. </joey>
<joey> And I think recognizing that
it is an uneven playing field </joey>
<garnt> and legal companies aren't perfect, </garnt>
<garnt> but in my eyes I give
them a bit of leeway. </garnt>
<garnt> All I look for is if I can
just play my fuckin' anime </garnt>
<garnt> on my Chromecast without any worries, </garnt>
<garnt> and that's pretty much all I
need for my $5 subscription. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I've paid for
Crunchyroll for years. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I just like, if we
could just stop the argument </garnt>
<garnt> being like, okay, you are
either on one side or the other </garnt>
<garnt> either with us or against us, </garnt>
<garnt> I think there's a healthy middle ground </garnt>
<garnt> for people to be hard. </garnt>
<connor> - Also, who the fuck
cares? Let's be honest. </connor>
<garnt> I'm gonna pay for it, </garnt>
<garnt> and if you don't want to,
I don't particularly care. </garnt>
<garnt> I think there's enough people like me </garnt>
<garnt> who have disposable income
and can afford to do so </garnt>
<garnt> and are willing to do so
that at the end of the day, </garnt>
<garnt> who fuckin' cares? </garnt>
<garnt> Mostly people who are
like on their high horse, </garnt>
<joey> shouting at people not to pirate, </joey>
<joey> you're shouting at like 12 year old kids </joey>
<joey> who don't know any
better, let's be honest. </joey>
<joey> That's what half of Twitter is. </joey>
<joey> Who gives a fuck? </joey>
<connor> I'll just keep paying, I don't care. </connor>
<joey> - That's like going to the lower class </joey>
<garnt> and being like, you
can't afford Balenciaga? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck's wrong with you? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, yeah, maybe
some people just can't. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean you're
buying knock-off Balenciaga? </connor>
<connor> - You're not supporting
the fashion industry </connor>
<garnt> because of that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, yeah, just do you man. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, none of us really
care that much, I don't think. </joey>
<joey> We're not like activists or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - If you pay for your anime legally, cool. </joey>
<joey> You pay for it illegally? Cool. </joey>
<garnt> - My philosophy has and always has been </garnt>
<garnt> just do what you can, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's situation is different, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's got a different reason </garnt>
<garnt> or is in a different position in life. </garnt>
<garnt> Just do what you can and
do what you feel like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't be a bully. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just don't be a dick.
- Don't be a dick, </garnt>
<garnt> and just like, don't try to
take advantage of the system </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah, that's pretty much my opinion. </garnt>
<connor> - And please, Konami stop
making Pachinko machines, </connor>
<garnt> I beg of you. </garnt>
<connor> Make anything but Pachinko. </connor>
<joey> - And checkout Book Walker. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> That's the bottom line. </connor>
<connor> Well you know what? </connor>

<joey> - Check out Book Walker instead. </joey>
<garnt> Do you run the Twitter
account for that still? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I stopped like

<connor> - That's why the memes became less fire. </connor>
<garnt> - The last thing I posted
was inter-species reviewers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you very much
for coming on Meilyne. </garnt>
<garnt> I know there was a lot of limited things </garnt>
<joey> you could not talk about, </joey>
<joey> especially still working on the industry, </joey>
<joey> but we very much appreciate you. </joey>
<joey> - That's business, man. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure people will be mad </connor>
<connor> that you didn't get to talk as much as us, </connor>
<connor> but you know, we talk our asses off. </connor>
<garnt> - If I talk too much, I
might say something illegal. </garnt>
<garnt> Just kidding. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - If you guys want more
Meilyne, don't worry, </garnt>
<connor> there'll be plenty of Meilyne,
us shouting at Meilyne. </connor>
<joey> - She'll always be behind
there somewhere, you know. </joey>

<garnt> 'Cause I know there's a lot of eyes </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't wanna get
fired or anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think a lot of people that
will appreciate your opinions </garnt>
<garnt> especially with the whole
like getting a job in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, check out Craigslist. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shout out to Craigslist. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shout out to Craigslist, except- </garnt>
<garnt> - Craigslist doesn't even
sponsor people, I think. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey, hey Craigslist. </joey>
<garnt> - Except when there are
cockroaches in the fridge. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I've seen too much, </garnt>
<connor> you should not be supporting this. </connor>
<garnt> - Craigslist gave you
your visa. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyway, thank you very
much for watching today. </garnt>
