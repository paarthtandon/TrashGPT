<connor> (Connor clapping) </connor>
<joey> - Congratulations, you've made it. </joey>
<garnt> - Congratulations. </garnt>
<connor> - You've made it to the
"Trash Taste" episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Congratulations.
- Congratulations. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt making bird noises) </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> Hope you guys are doing
well and enjoy yourself. </connor>
<connor> Have a nice seat, get comfortable. </connor>
<connor> Get a little popcorn or
something, I don't know, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause we're gonna the movies. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - We're gonna the movies? </joey>
<garnt> What are we seeing, dad? </garnt>
<garnt> - What is this, POV? </garnt>
<garnt> You're on a date with Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Yeah, get
yourself comfortable." </garnt>
<connor> - We're gonna the movies. </connor>
<garnt> - On a date with the boys right now. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know what else to say, </connor>
<joey> all right, all right?
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> You got me, okay? </connor>
<connor> How you guys doing? </connor>
<connor> - It's good, it's November, </connor>
<garnt> where the fuck has this year gone? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I can say this, because this is... </garnt>
<garnt> We don't have the buffer anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> So whatever we talk about, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we're filming this on Tuesday, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's gonna go out Saturday, </garnt>
<joey> which is, I think the first
time in "Trash Taste" history. </joey>
<garnt> - Little over, when the
"Trash Taste" episodes, </garnt>
<garnt> a meta reference. </garnt>
<connor> - So it's a shame, there's no, like, </connor>
<joey> hot topics to talk about. </joey>
<joey> I don't think there is any, recently. </joey>
<joey> - I watched the "Dune"
movie, is that a hot topic? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, not really. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, people are talking about it. </joey>
<joey> - It's a movie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I saw it. </joey>
<joey> - How was that? </joey>
<joey> - Fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Really? </joey>
<joey> - I genuinely don't understand, </joey>
<joey> like normally, right? </joey>
<connor> online, okay?
- [Connor] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - People love to be critics
about movies, right? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - You go onto Rotten
Tomatoes, you go onto IMDB, </connor>
<garnt> all sorts of self-acclaimed
critics, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, most of the time, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm okay with opposite opinions, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause, you know, I always wanna know </garnt>
<garnt> like what the opposite opinion is, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, okay, if I
really enjoyed something, </garnt>
<garnt> right?
- Where you going with this? </garnt>
<garnt> - Then I wanna see, like, how bad it is? </garnt>
<garnt> Like if I really hate
something, I wanna know, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, why people
might've enjoyed it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm usually open to it. </garnt>
<garnt> I think this might be
the first time in my life </garnt>
<garnt> where I don't understand
the opposite opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I saw so many people </garnt>
<garnt> on like Twitter and like Rotten Tomatoes, </garnt>
<joey> like, rating "Dune" is like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it was shit, it
was a disappointment." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Did you watch the
same movie that I watched?" </joey>
<joey> Because it was genuinely the
first time where I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> "I actually don't
understand your criticisms." </garnt>
<connor> Like, is that weird?
- Why are you brain-dead? </connor>
<connor> - Were you asleep during the movie? </connor>
<connor> - So what about it is so good then? </connor>
<joey> I mean 'cause I'm gonna watch it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, same here.
- But I've been watching, </joey>
<connor> like, every other movie,
except that movie. </connor>
<joey> - So like, for one,
it's like one of the... </joey>
<connor> So I'm like a massive fan of the books. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I haven't read the books. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, but that's all right.
- Can I still enjoy it? </connor>
<connor> - Yes, absolutely. </connor>
<connor> So I went with a couple of my friends, </connor>
<connor> one of them has read the books, </connor>
<connor> and the other two hadn't
read the books, right? </connor>
<connor> So it was good to find out, </connor>
<connor> if you needed to be a
fan of the books or not. </connor>
<connor> Luckily everyone enjoyed it.
- [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But I think it's because the
movie did a really good job </connor>
<connor> of like picking and choosing, </connor>
<connor> like, the right information </connor>
<connor> to leave in the movie.
- [Connor] Okay. </connor>
<joey> Because there's a lot of
information from the books, </joey>
<joey> that they didn't include in the movie. </joey>
<joey> - Naturally... </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's just
how book adaptations are. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, "Dune" is like... </joey>
<joey> especially "Dune" is like, </joey>
<garnt> so fucking extensive
when it comes to its law. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, literally the first
book, at the back of the book, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a literal glossary of terms </garnt>
<joey> that you need to understand,
- Wow. </joey>
<joey> - To read the book.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like, that's how it...
- So it's just like, </joey>
<joey> its own terms that it's made up of. </joey>
<joey> - Its own terms that it's made of. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Like Frank Herbert, who's
the creator, was like so light. </joey>
<garnt> He was so fivehead, with this shit, </garnt>
<garnt> because like, you also have to understand </garnt>
<garnt> this was written in, like 1965. </garnt>
<joey> Like, it's a 50-year-old sci-fi book. </joey>
<joey> - It's that old? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It's really old.
- Wow. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've heard it's like visually </connor>
<joey> and the sound is amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Dude, like, </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna... </connor>
<connor> This might be a hot take, </connor>
<joey> but I think it is one of Hans
Zimmer's best soundtracks. </joey>
<joey> - That is some fine works, </joey>
<joey> 'cause he's had some amazing soundtracks. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, I thought--
- The boom guy. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> The boom...
- The boom guy. </connor>
<connor> - Every Hans Zimmer one has the boom, </connor>
<joey> or something like that. </joey>
<connor> - I love Hans Zimmer...
- I could be wrong. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I love Hans Zimmer, </garnt>
<garnt> like "Lion King" soundtrack, epic. </garnt>
<garnt> "Inception"...
- He did "Lion King" ? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- He did "Lion King?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, he did "Lion King"! </garnt>
<garnt> - What! </garnt>
<garnt> - You didn't know he did the "Lion King?" </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- No. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Hans Zimmer did
the "Lion King" soundtrack. </joey>
<garnt> - Thought it was Elton John. </garnt>
<joey> I am joking.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - He solo carried. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, he did the "Lion King" soundtrack. </garnt>
<joey> - No fucking way.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Are you serious?
- Yup. </garnt>
<garnt> - He actually...
- To be... </garnt>
<joey> To be fair...
- You could fact-check, </joey>
<garnt> but I'm pretty sure...
- To be fair, </garnt>
<garnt> with "Lion King," </garnt>
<garnt> I don't remember the soundtrack </garnt>
<garnt> as in like the background track. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember Elton John.
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Just goin ham. </garnt>
<joey> - He did go ham on that. </joey>
<garnt> - To be fair.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but he did, you
know, he did "Lion King," </garnt>
<garnt> he did "Inception", he obviously... </garnt>
<garnt> Basically, every Christopher
Nolan movie, he did. </garnt>
<connor> And I thought he peeked at
like, interstellar, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, that's like the one
soundtrack, everyone says, </connor>
<joey> it's like, "yeah fucking
amazing movie soundtrack." </joey>
<connor> - So what would you give
the movie out of 10? </connor>
<connor> If I dare ask for your score. </connor>
<connor> This archaic system,
- Out of 10? </connor>
<connor> - Of judging movies.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I'd give it like a strong nine. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, wow.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I'm just gonna watch it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I was gonna watch it </connor>
<connor> because the biggest criticism I've heard, </connor>
<connor> if you can even call
it a criticism, really, </connor>
<garnt> is that, so much of it depends on... </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Number 2, right?
- Dune, part 2, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes.
- Because I've heard </garnt>
<joey> it's not a full movie. </joey>
<joey> It's just...
- It covers the first half </joey>
<joey> of the first book.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's a two and a half hour movie. </joey>
<connor> - Well, when they release "Dune 2", </connor>
<connor> they probably will do the whole, </connor>
<connor> you can watch the first
movie before the second one, </connor>
<connor> you know,
- Like a bundle package. </connor>
<connor> - Like they did with the "Avengers". </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can watch "Infinity
War" before "End Game". </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - What I've heard about part 1 of "Dune" </joey>
<garnt> is that it's not like say, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> "Avengers Infinity War" or like "Lord... </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not trying to
build a whole world... </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, where you don't get,
like, a natural story arc, </connor>
<connor> it's just, you get half a story. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've heard its abrupt, </connor>
<joey> yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it does kind of just end... </garnt>
<joey> - I can see where that
would piss people off. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I think as well, </joey>
<joey> the other big thing is that, I feel, </joey>
<joey> a lot of the criticisms I saw is that, </joey>
<garnt> I think, they kind of almost, </garnt>
<garnt> gave it a little bit of false advertising </garnt>
<garnt> with, like the trailer, because
I watched the trailer of it, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> it looks like an action Sci-fi. </joey>
<joey> - But the thing is, "Dune"
is not an action sci-fi, </joey>
<joey> it's a political sci-fi. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's one of the
things where it's tough </connor>
<joey> that you can't market politics. </joey>
<joey> Which is like, which is why... </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Which is like, why...
- Your fans are crying. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I am sure you can market...
- Where is my politics? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you can market politics </connor>
<connor> but in a movie, it's
kind of hard to be like, </connor>
<connor> "And then he signed the
paper, making the agreement." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, that's just like, </joey>
<connor> a lot of mecha anime, in a nutshell, </connor>
<garnt> people were just like, oh,
giant robots go pew, pew, pew. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it was like, "Wait a minute, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm really invested in these colonies </garnt>
<garnt> and the politics of these colonies." </garnt>
<garnt> - "What is all this government bullshit?" </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, its like "Game of Thrones," </connor>
<connor> you don't tell someone "Game of Thrones" </connor>
<connor> is like a political thriller
of backstabbing and stuff. </connor>
<garnt> You're like, it's got dragons and zombies. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- Exactly and then... </connor>
<joey> - Because I watched the trailer </joey>
<garnt> and literally the entire trailer is, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like 80% of it is a lot
of like, fighting scenes. </garnt>
<garnt> But what's funny is that, like, all of, </garnt>
<garnt> like, all the fighting
scenes in the trailer </garnt>
<garnt> are all the fighting scenes in the movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Okay.
- Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] All right, okay.
- And, so, I-- </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not gonna watch the
trailer now, it's just spoilers. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, no, so I can see why, like, </joey>
<garnt> I think people might've been, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like, misinformed about it, </garnt>
<connor> if they never, like read
the books or anything. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Maybe, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Since living in Japan,
I've been doing this thing, </joey>
<joey> where I just don't look at
reviews, before and after. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Full stop. </joey>
<joey> I just do not look at reviews anymore. </joey>
<garnt> I just look at the
movie, I watch a trailer, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "It looks okay."
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Or even sometimes I don't
even watch the trailer, </garnt>
<connor> I just pick one.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I just go to the cinema and I watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been really enjoying
movies a lot more. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's smart.
- I think that's </garnt>
<garnt> the right thing to do.
- Yeah, that's </garnt>
<connor> the right thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's hard because
sometimes I watch a movie </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "I think that was good," </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> but I need someone else to
also tell me it was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> - Because that's the days we live in. </connor>
<connor> - I experienced that recently with, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure, I don't think we can spoil it, </connor>
<joey> but we were asked to watch
something by a company, </joey>
<garnt> right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was the first time-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you have to make that so obvious? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, but it was the first time </joey>
<joey> that I had watched something. </joey>
<joey> I got like, given early
access to something. </joey>
<joey> So even if I wanted to, </joey>
<connor> there is no way I could
check, whether this... </connor>
<connor> What I was watching was good or not? </connor>
<connor> - And I can't wait to talk about that. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we were gonna
be talking about that </connor>
<connor> on another episode, </connor>
<garnt> but it was like such a weird
experience for me, to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Huh, I think this is good." </garnt>
<garnt> I am like, "My opinion,
I think is right, but..." </garnt>
<joey> - Doesn't it suck...
- It could be wrong. </joey>
<joey> - Doesn't it suck that,
at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> it just boils down to, I
liked it, but is it only me? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think that
I've started to, like, </connor>
<joey> from doing this a lot. </joey>
<connor> I've just, because now I
don't treat movies as, like, </connor>
<connor> "I wanna watch that one film that's good." </connor>
<connor> It's like, "I wanna just do
something for three hours." </connor>
<connor> That like, lets me shut off.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'll just go to the
movies, watch anything, </connor>
<connor> literally anything. </connor>
<joey> - My problem with movies right now is that </joey>
<joey> I have such a short
attention span, like I-- </joey>
<garnt> - It's the one place
I can, like, shut off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, 'cause I need, I
wanna shut off in the movie, </garnt>
<garnt> but I need to know that
it's worth my time, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's like, it's like
taking a leap of faith. </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing is, if you
take that leap of faith </garnt>
<garnt> and the movie ends up being good, </garnt>
<garnt> then you enjoy it way, way more. </garnt>
<joey> But I just have like, </joey>
<joey> I don't have the attention span </joey>
<joey> to sit through enough shitty
movies, that I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, I'm just not in the mood for this." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm not sure what's
changed, I know why I'm like... </connor>
<joey> - Because, I'll tell you
what I've been doing actually </joey>
<garnt> to offset this, which, I know
you think I'm a psychopath, </garnt>
<garnt> which is whenever I get recommended
random clips on YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> for a movie I haven't watched, </garnt>
<joey> I see that clip, and sometimes
it's like a banger clip, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "All right, </joey>
<joey> this movie is worth watching." </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna watch the entire movie. </joey>
<connor> - So you have to basically watch like, </connor>
<joey> a portion of the movie before you're like, </joey>
<connor> "I'm ready to watch the whole thing." </connor>
<garnt> - There needs to be something
to sell me on this movie. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't even need to be
like a high scoring movie </garnt>
<garnt> or something that people
like, everyone recommends, </garnt>
<garnt> there just needs to be
something about this movie </garnt>
<connor> that I'm just like, "Okay."
- A hook. </connor>
<joey> - Is there no part of you, </joey>
<connor> that just wants to turn up to a movie </connor>
<connor> and know nothing about it
and just watch something? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, I mean, </joey>
<garnt> I think that's the issue of
watching things for a job. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Where, I watch enough things
for a job, blind, anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> that, where in my free
time, in my downtime, </garnt>
<garnt> I want to know that this
shit is worth my time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I get that, I get that.
- Because if it's not, </garnt>
<joey> then it's just another job. </joey>
<connor> - I understand that. </connor>
<connor> It's weird because even
if the movie isn't as good </connor>
<garnt> as I would like it to be, </garnt>
<garnt> I still get the same level of enjoyment </garnt>
<garnt> from just being in the environment, </garnt>
<garnt> getting to experience watching something. </garnt>
<joey> Even if it's shit, I'm like, you know... </joey>
<joey> - I think you just like
the cinema experience. </joey>
<joey> - I really do, and also
I just like having, </joey>
<garnt> sometimes it's nice... </garnt>
<garnt> It's nice watching something,
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> that's bad, so I can have
a frame of reference. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right.
- It could be like, </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] This is... </connor>
<garnt> - If everything I watch is good, </garnt>
<garnt> I have no idea what's bad anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is why, I think,
I've relied on reviews, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I only ever watched
the things that were good. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah.
- And I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> the more I've just been watching stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and making my own opinions, </garnt>
<garnt> the more I'm kind of enjoying the process </garnt>
<garnt> of then just being like, </garnt>
<connor> "Okay, what do I think about that movie?" </connor>
<connor> I'm not not looking at anything else. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, I don't know,
'cause I definitely did feel </connor>
<garnt> that I was so spoiled watching everything </garnt>
<garnt> that was quote unquote good, </garnt>
<garnt> that it was getting to the point
where I'm like, "All right, </garnt>
<garnt> I say, this must be, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> this must be a weird take." </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, "What is good anymore? </joey>
<joey> I don't know." </joey>
<joey> - I mean,
- I get that. </joey>
<connor> - I watch enough shit things for my job. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right, you're used to... </garnt>
<garnt> - For me, like, there's nothing
that grinds my gears more </garnt>
<connor> when I watch something </connor>
<joey> and I feel like it was
just a waste of time. </joey>
<joey> Like something that's not entirely good, </joey>
<joey> but not even that bad, it was just... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the mediocre ones are the worst. </joey>
<joey> - The mediocre ones, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I could've done so many
things with that time." </joey>
<connor> - Which is why you would
never go out of your way </connor>
<connor> to watch a five or a
six out of ten, right? </connor>
<connor> - No, no.
- No, no. </connor>
<connor> - But if you turn up at a
cinema, you don't know what it is </connor>
<connor> and you watch a five or six out of ten, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "No, okay." </connor>
<connor> - But I'm not the kind of person </connor>
<connor> who just walks up to a cinema and goes, </connor>
<connor> "I'm just gonna watch something." </connor>
<joey> If I'm at a cinema, I'm
there for a specific movie. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Wow, I'm the opposite of that. </joey>
<joey> - For me to go to a cinema, </joey>
<connor> I am committed to whatever I'm watching. </connor>
<connor> - Movie theater, for you Americans? </connor>
<connor> I know, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> - No, because like, to me, yeah, I get it </connor>
<connor> because if you're in the movie
theater, like, you're just, </connor>
<joey> you're committed to be there. </joey>
<joey> And I've only ever walked
out of one movie in my life. </joey>
<connor> And that was...
- Which was it? </connor>
<joey> - Live action "Ghost in the Shell". </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, that's right. </joey>
<garnt> - And that was just
because I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I watched about 40
minutes and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is neither good, nor bad. </garnt>
<joey> This is a waste of my fucking time." </joey>
<joey> And I like, I went
there by myself as well, </joey>
<joey> so I'm like, "No commitments,
I am just going to walkout." </joey>
<connor> - I'm trying to think what movies, </connor>
<garnt> I watched "The Last Duel" recently. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you guys have heard of that movie? </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah.
- What the fuck is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, so exactly, right? </garnt>
<joey> So all--
- Is that a recent movie? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, all I knew about this movie, </garnt>
<garnt> is that it starred Adam
Driver and Matt Damon. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I knew about this movie. </garnt>
<garnt> I knew that it was kind of based in like </garnt>
<garnt> the 13 hundreds or something.
- [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it turns out the
plot is about something </garnt>
<garnt> where there was a famous rape case </garnt>
<garnt> in the 1300s in France, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was kind of like
unheard of that there would be, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, a court trial
around something like this. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it ended up in a duel. </garnt>
<garnt> And the whole movie of this thing </garnt>
<garnt> is like telling the
perspective of each person </garnt>
<garnt> involved in the rape. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey And Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's like the woman's perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> the guy during the rape and
then the husband of the woman. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Right, right.
- That he rapes. </garnt>
<connor> And it's obviously like the 1300s, </connor>
<connor> so the rules are all like
totally fucked and obscene. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- You know, and it was... </connor>
<connor> it was good, but it was
also like really weird. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we're supposed
to be like 1300s, France </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> and just Matt Damon was there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like an American </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> and then--
- Not even like-- </joey>
<joey> - Is this a new movie?
- Yeah, but, </joey>
<connor> and then like Ben Affleck was there. </connor>
<joey> - Were they doing like a
French accent or anything? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, just American,
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> but it's just kind of like...
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - It was the first time in my life </connor>
<connor> where I'd ever genuinely felt </connor>
<connor> like a movie was bogged down,
by having actors I knew. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I was like, this
is just like, I just, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need to see Matt Damon. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you can't un-see Matt Damon. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, I'm watching
this movie and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> there could have been
so many better people </garnt>
<garnt> who could've done this role.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, you know, if it was in French, </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't have cared. </garnt>
<joey> Obviously, it wouldn't have got the budget </joey>
<joey> and obviously, you know,
that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- But like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> it felt weird, 'cause then
there was like, American </joey>
<connor> and then super British dudes </connor>
<connor> and then some dudes with French accents. </connor>
<connor> And it was like this whole
weird thing where I was like, </connor>
<connor> like, I think the movie was good, </connor>
<connor> but also there was just like </connor>
<connor> the casting felt really weird. </connor>
<connor> I didn't really know what to think, </connor>
<connor> and then I did go online and
it was like 8.5 or something. </connor>
<connor> And I was like,
- [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> I was like, "okay." </connor>
<connor> I mean, "I guess that makes sense." </connor>
<joey> - Do your opinions get skewed
when you see online reviews </joey>
<connor> and like, when you have
your initial opinion </connor>
<connor> and then you see the reviews </connor>
<connor> and then you...
- Yeah, definitely. </connor>
<joey> - Do you think your like
opinion gets skewed, a bit? </joey>
<joey> - Um, sometimes.
- Sometimes </joey>
<joey> I'd love to tell you I'm immune, </joey>
<garnt> to my opinion being...
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone out there watching, </garnt>
<garnt> is just like, "Other people's
opinion do not affect me." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I have my opinion and that's
that and I'm just like... </joey>
<joey> - I think, for most things,
it doesn't affect me, </joey>
<joey> but then there are times again </joey>
<joey> where, like similar to your
situation, where it's like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm not sure if I enjoyed it or not, </joey>
<joey> so I need like a second opinion about it." </joey>
<joey> - I need someone to tell me.
- Yeah (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I need like a second opinion.
- "Bro, bro, back me up, </joey>
<connor> this was a good film, right? </connor>
<joey> This was a good film." </joey>
<connor> - You know, and the film
is very uncomfortable, </connor>
<connor> and you know, it's kind
of hard to watch at times, </connor>
<connor> but then I'm also like, </connor>
<connor> "I guess that's the point
though, that's the idea." </connor>
<garnt> This is not supposed to be fun to watch, </garnt>
<garnt> but then I'm gonna the movies
to pay for watch something. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, I was in this weird
spot where I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This could be a four or an eight </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know which one it is." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I like public consensus.
- So it's one of those </garnt>
<connor> kind of movies,
- One of those movies. </connor>
<connor> And I left it thinking like,
"Okay, I think it was an eight, </connor>
<garnt> but I just wish the casting was better." </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't read anyone else's reviews. </garnt>
<garnt> I just saw the score.
- [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, maybe people
disagree with me on that, </garnt>
<garnt> but I was like, yeah, I
was just like, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And then on the opposite end
of the spectrum, I was like, </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna watch James Bond.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> It was like, I know everything about this. </connor>
<connor> I've read all of Daniel
Craig's weird ass interviews. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen that man's interviews? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What the fuck is that man on? </connor>
<joey> - Its so funny. </joey>
<connor> - Have you seen some of
the shit this man's saying? </connor>
<connor> - It's so funny.
(Joey and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> Daniel Craig articles that
were better than the movie. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Reading these articles, </connor>
<garnt> I got like 10 times more
enjoyment, reading these articles. </garnt>
<garnt> Did you read the article
where he was like, </garnt>
<connor> "I kiss everyone on set." </connor>
<connor> Did you read this article?
- [Both] No. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to read. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - This article-- </joey>
<garnt> - Give your homies a little smoochie. </garnt>
<connor> - Nah, da da, da da da, </connor>
<connor> it wasn't just, it wasn't,
"Give your homies a smooch." </connor>
<connor> It was like, oh my God, all right. </connor>
<connor> - Say, I am Bond, James Bond, agh. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Daniel Craig and Remi Malek's claim </garnt>
<garnt> the pair kissed on James Bond shoot. </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm a very friendly guy," in quotes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, who said this, Rami Malek? </garnt>
<connor> - Daniel Craig.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Malek said Craig grabbed
him and picked him up </connor>
<connor> after he shared a good idea for the movie. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird.
- Like, you genius. </connor>
<connor> - It's so bizarre. </connor>
<connor> "He grabbed me, picked
me up in the moment." </connor>
<connor> "He grabbed me, picked me up, </connor>
<connor> and I can't tell who
initiated the next moment, </connor>
<garnt> whether it was him or I, </garnt>
<garnt> but a kiss transpired between
the two of us," he said. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, what kind of kiss? </garnt>
<garnt> - He said, "I'm gonna say Daniel Craig," </garnt>
<garnt> I need to know how much.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - How intense was the...
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Was there tongue? </connor>
<joey> - Was it like a full Frenchie </joey>
<connor> or like a little peck on the cheek? </connor>
<connor> - Was it like Sonic and Mario
making up, kind of deal? </connor>
<connor> Or were they like, rip the clothes off? </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna say that
Daniel Craig initiated it, </connor>
<connor> and I was very taken aback." </connor>
<connor> He added that the kiss was very welcome </connor>
<connor> and that, at the time, he asked Craig, </connor>
<connor> "So does this make me a Bond girl?"" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then, this is a
quote from Daniel Craig. </connor>
<connor> "I kissed him, all right,
I kiss lots of people," </connor>
<connor> Craig said.
(Connor chuckling) </connor>
<connor> "It's like, I'm a very friendly guy </connor>
<connor> and I wouldn't rank anybody." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> "That would be a terrible thing </connor>
<connor> to do."
- Ranking. </connor>
<connor> - To rank the best kissers, I would, </connor>
<connor> I would just, how many
people could I offend? </connor>
<connor> Terrible, thousands of people." </connor>
<connor> - My God. </connor>
<connor> - What's going on on
the set of James Bond? </connor>
<garnt> - He's just go around
to every actor and like, </garnt>
<joey> "Have I kissed you yet? </joey>
<joey> Not sure" </joey>
<garnt> - Going around like just Frenching people. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not the audition process. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, "You're suitable for the role. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> Now, okay, okay, get Daniel Craig in." </connor>
<connor> - This article is insane. </connor>
<connor> "Listen, this story's had
legs about kissing Rami. </connor>
<connor> I've just been trying to get it more legs. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's on social media. </connor>
<connor> I haven't got social media, </connor>
<connor> but I said, I used to kiss
Rami at the end of every scene. </connor>
<connor> This is like, it's just
like not a big deal. </connor>
<connor> God almighty, just spreading the love." </connor>
<connor> Malek,
(Connor laughing hysterically) </connor>
<connor> Malik, quipped, </connor>
<connor> "I would just rush through scenes, </connor>
<connor> just to get to the moment
that you would get kissed." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> What's going, what's-- </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, so, is like Rami Malek into it? </joey>
<connor> - He's loving it. </connor>
<joey> And the whole set is loving it. </joey>
<joey> - Sounds like a fucking
love story going on here. </joey>
<connor> - The director is like,
definitely, pushing through </connor>
<connor> one take wondering--
- It was just kinda like, </connor>
<connor> why don't you just like, just fuck. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> It was just such a bizarre read. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "What is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are they sharing this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds like an onion article. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - I love it. </joey>
<garnt> - I watched James Bond,
Daniel was nothing like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I watched James Bond and
I was just imagining him </connor>
<garnt> at the end of every scene. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> I just imagined him just running off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and going and making out with Malek. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love it, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is the best article
I've ever read in my life." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was laughing my ass off.
- [Joey] So funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like there's countless articles </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> from Daniel Craig before
this movie came out, </joey>
<joey> are just like, insane.
- Just losing his mind. </joey>
<joey> - Just saying the random-est shit. </joey>
<joey> He just brought up the one time, </joey>
<joey> he was like, he only goes to gay bars </joey>
<connor> because it's more friendly or something. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, what is--
- He's not gay though, right? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, he's like, I
feel more safe there, </connor>
<connor> other people won't try
and start fights with me. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "What are you doing? </joey>
<joey> Why you are getting in
fights, in every bar?" </joey>
<joey> - I mean, he is James Bond.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I know, but he's like 50, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Is he's just like method acting? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, man, I was like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> "You're going to gay bars,
you're kissing Malek" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like Craig, man, come on, let us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come on, just, what's going on buddy? </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> Like, you want me to say it, </connor>
<connor> like, it's cool, it's cool, dude. </connor>
<connor> It's 2021 bro, like, it's fine, right? </connor>
<joey> - I think it's gonna be </joey>
<connor> my favorite Daniel Craig
clip though, you guys know? </connor>
<connor> - The Weekend, yeah.
- Ladies and gentlemen. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, and there's--
- The Weekend. </joey>
<connor> - There's another article </connor>
<connor> where he didn't know about the meme, </connor>
<connor> and they introduced the meme to him. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And he's like, </connor>
<connor> "That's great, that's amazing." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, Daniel Craig articles </connor>
<garnt> are better than the fucking movie. </garnt>
<garnt> The articles are 10 out of 10, </garnt>
<garnt> the movie was a five out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- That's kinda how I see... </garnt>
<connor> - No, did you watch the movie?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - The time to kill, was it? </joey>
<joey> The new one?
- To die. </joey>
<joey> - "Time to Die." </joey>
<connor> - Time to die.
- It was all right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's fine. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I dunno. </joey>
<connor> - You should do a movie
Snapchat, or whatever. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not even really like
a fan of the Daniel Craig, </joey>
<joey> James Bond movies, like any of them. </joey>
<joey> - "Casino Royale" is good. </joey>
<joey> - I think that "Casino Royale"-- </joey>
<garnt> - Skyfall was okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I think, he more like,
peaked at "Casino Royale" </joey>
<connor> and then-- </connor>
<connor> - It's a shame that it
was like his first movie. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- After that he just-- </connor>
<garnt> - Well, that's when they like
really re-imagined James Bond. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> never really had like a
massive fan of James Bond, </garnt>
<garnt> but obviously, I just feel like </garnt>
<garnt> it's just not as massive
a franchise as it was </garnt>
<garnt> when, you know, we were growing up </garnt>
<garnt> when our, like our parents' age. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And I think like, </garnt>
<garnt> especially you'd said about
like the Matt Damon movie, </garnt>
<garnt> which I somehow haven't heard of, </garnt>
<garnt> like back in the day if Matt
Damon and who else was in it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Adam Driver and Ben Affleck. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it was a good movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, these
are like A-list actors, </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember back in the
day, if they were in a movie, </garnt>
<garnt> you'd fucking hear about it. </garnt>
<joey> But nowadays, I feel like movies... </joey>
<joey> It's weird 'cause movies aren't sold </joey>
<joey> on their actors anymore, I feel like. </joey>
<connor> - Well no, there's this amazing
interview at Comicon with, </connor>
<connor> I forgot what the name of the guy is, </connor>
<garnt> guy plays, the guy with
Iron Man, he's like, friend. </garnt>
<garnt> - John Favreau? </garnt>
<garnt> - John Cheadle?
- Not John Cheadle. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, another (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, now, wait, what,
who, wait, it wasn't him. </garnt>
<garnt> Who does? </garnt>
<garnt> He's a superhero. </garnt>
<joey> Anthony Mackie. </joey>
<garnt> - Anthony Mackie.
- Oh. </garnt>
<joey> - [Man Off Camera] That's falcon. </joey>
<joey> - That's Falcon.
- Falcon, that's who he was. </joey>
<connor> - That's not Iron Man's best friend, </connor>
<garnt> that's Captain America's best friend. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on there partner, get it together. </garnt>
<garnt> - The widest picture.
- Wide Anthony Mackie. </garnt>
<connor> - Actually, there's a,
so what's the quote? </connor>
<connor> So he did this formal
interview at Comic-Con, </connor>
<garnt> and it came on my recommended at one point </garnt>
<garnt> and it was him just basically
explaining how like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, </garnt>
<garnt> don't sell movies anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the superheroes that sell movies. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, nobody cares, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, they do care about
the actor who plays it, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not the actor who brings in the, </garnt>
<joey> maybe Robert Downey Jr.
- [Garnt] It needs to be like </joey>
<connor> It needs to be like the right actor. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause back in the day you
could just hire an actor </connor>
<joey> for a role.
- Just like, what was that? </joey>
<connor> What was that dreadful
movie that Robert Downey Jr. </connor>
<connor> did with like, it was like
Dr. Dolittle, but like. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- And like it bombed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember
- It was right after Endgame. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - His first like, big movie, apparently </garnt>
<joey> was this awful "Dr.
Dolittle" kind of version, </joey>
<garnt> and he was trying to do like
a Welsh accent or something. </garnt>
<connor> - [Man Off Camera] It
was a Dolittle movie. </connor>
<joey> - Was it a re-imagining of "Dr. Dolittle"? </joey>
<joey> - [Man Off Camera] It was a remake. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think it was a
remake of "Dr.Dolittle". </joey>
<connor> - It was like these movies </connor>
<connor> that don't need remake, "Dr. Dolittle". </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause the thing is,
yeah, Robert Downey Jr. </joey>
<joey> was massive as Iron Man,
but at the same time, </joey>
<joey> I think, Robert Downey Jr. was
just acting Robert Downey Jr. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - [Man Off Camera] He was
great in Sherlock Holmes, </garnt>
<garnt> just saying.
- Yeah, Sherlock Holmes... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but that's because
he was (indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> just playing a British version of himself. </joey>
<joey> - You know, like it's, </joey>
<joey> it's like the movie
culture I feel has changed </joey>
<joey> and people care more
about concepts nowadays. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, even with
something like "Dune", </joey>
<joey> that's a massive like,
new movie franchise. </joey>
<joey> I don't actually know
any of the actors in it. </joey>
<joey> Even though I know there are
some famous actors in it. </joey>
<joey> - There's some famous actors,
- Is Zendaya in it? </joey>
<joey> - [Man Off Camera] Timothee Chalamet. </joey>
<connor> - Is Zendaya in it?
- [Man Off Camera] Zendaya. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Zendaya's in it.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But like I, yeah... </joey>
<joey> - That's not the reason
you're watching "Dune". </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Jason Momoa's probably
the biggest one that's-- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, Jason Momoa's in it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> But that's like, not the
reason you're watching-- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] No.
- You know, so, in some ways, </connor>
<connor> I'm kind of glad that it's straight away </connor>
<connor> from the actors sell
movies, not the movie. </connor>
<connor> Like it kind of is, you know, </connor>
<garnt> it means that we hopefully
get different actors for what, </garnt>
<garnt> we still don't really but, </garnt>
<garnt> there's more chance that
you'll go to watch a movie </garnt>
<joey> because people say--
- Because of the concept. </joey>
<joey> - Not because Stallone's in it. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- Like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I was never really, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if this is 'cause of like, </garnt>
<connor> different generation thing, </connor>
<connor> but I never really cared
about the actor in it. </connor>
<joey> - No, I didn't either,
I mean, it sold movies. </joey>
<joey> - I am for the character.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> You know, the performance is good, great. </joey>
<joey> That's good for them, but...
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And it's a bonus if it's
like an actor that you like </connor>
<connor> or an actor that you know is
like perfect for the role, </connor>
<connor> but it's like, I'm not gonna go watch... </connor>
<connor> The only one I can think of
is like a Nicholas Cage movie. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'll watch him because
Nic Cage is in it. </joey>
<garnt> - But that's like a meme. </garnt>
<connor> That's just like watching
an Adam Sandler movie. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Now, Adam Sandler's
like the only guy now </connor>
<joey> who can like sell movies by just, </joey>
<joey> being--
- Being Adam Sandler. </joey>
<garnt> - Literally just being him. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> He's literally like the
only guy who could like </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> make a career of just,
fuck, like being like lazy. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Just like doing anything. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's true.
- You know, </connor>
<joey> even then he fucking
killed it in "Uncut Gems." </joey>
<joey> I'll say this for like
the 10 millionth time. </joey>
<joey> Watch that goddamn movie, it's amazing. </joey>
<joey> Do yourself a favor, </joey>
<connor> and you need to do yourself
a favor, watch that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like, I had this
thought the other day, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, on the
topic of celebrity culture, </connor>
<connor> I was like, </connor>
<garnt> do you think there's gonna be someone </garnt>
<garnt> who is going to be as
famous as Michael Jackson is </garnt>
<garnt> in our lifetime, again? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like--
- Probably. </joey>
<joey> - Hmm.
- You think so? </joey>
<joey> - Probably. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I don't
think there will... </joey>
<joey> - Who do you think is the
most famous person right now? </joey>
<joey> - Kim Kardashian, unfortunately. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, I actually googled this </garnt>
<garnt> after I had this thought. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know who is
ranked as the number one </garnt>
<garnt> most famous celebrity? </garnt>
<connor> - Lets think again.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait... </connor>
<connor> Isn't it like fucking, it's
a footballer probably, right? </connor>
<joey> - No.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel
Messi were in the top 10 though. </joey>
<joey> - What's the occupation?
- Actor. </joey>
<joey> An actor?
- Yeah, I was surprised. </joey>
<garnt> - I wish it's Adam Sandler. </garnt>
<garnt> - Number two was Donald Trump, </garnt>
<garnt> which was not surprising.
- Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now that I think about it, </garnt>
<joey> but number one really surprised me. </joey>
<garnt> - Male, female? </garnt>
<joey> - Male.
- Male, male actor. </joey>
<connor> - Hold on, I can think.
- Yeah, I can think, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't intend this
to turn this into a quiz. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Brad Pitt?
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> It is Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
(Man off camera laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah.
- No way. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, is he that famous? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, he is, he is.
- Is he? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah he is.
- Like, internationally? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't he's like one of the
most like highest paid actors? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, he is. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, "Fast and Furious" movies </joey>
<joey> are like everywhere. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Everywhere. </joey>
<joey> - He's also one of those actors
that looks and feels natural </joey>
<connor> in like an adult film,
like "Fast and Furious", </connor>
<joey> but also in like a Disney film. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- You know. </joey>
<joey> - Is "Fast and Furious" an adult film? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, compared to like "Moana". </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It's not a kids movie.
- It's not a kids movie. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's true.
- He's also, </connor>
<connor> you know, I mean, so you will, </connor>
<connor> but like having a recognizable
face and figure, is like, </connor>
<joey> definitely a part of it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And just his name's The
Rock, you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> People are gonna remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Rock. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
(speaking in Japanese accent) </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> - What surprised me is
that he wasn't like, </garnt>
<garnt> he wasn't the first
person to come up to mind, </garnt>
<joey> when I think of like a
famous person, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But he is just-- </joey>
<joey> - But he's also one of those guys where, </joey>
<connor> if you say the name, then
you're like, oh yeah, of course, </connor>
<joey> yeah, you know, like, "Yeah, he's famous." </joey>
<connor> - It's definitely easier </connor>
<connor> when you have like a
name that's super easy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> Dwayne The Rock Johnson. </connor>
<joey> - That is also a cool name, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's cool.
- The pain. </connor>
<joey> - It's more like catchy
than just Dwayne Johnson. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because like, </joey>
<joey> especially like, traveling
around the world now, </joey>
<joey> you realize that people are just like, </joey>
<garnt> like there's different levels of famous, </garnt>
<garnt> depending on where you are on the world. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cristiano Ronaldo is
like, known everywhere. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Football's massive except for
probably like the US, right? </joey>
<joey> That's probably like
the biggest place that-- </joey>
<garnt> - But they all probably
know Ronaldo still, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe.
- Do they? </garnt>
<connor> I dunno, Americans, do you
know who Cristiano Ronaldo </connor>
<connor> and Lionel Messi is? </connor>
<connor> - I know at one point,
David Beckham was like </connor>
<garnt> the most famous person on Earth. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't think he is now
'cause he hasn't really-- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- But I swear like 10, </garnt>
<joey> 20 years ago, he was
the most famous person. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because--
- Bend it like Beckham phase. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh, my God.
- Well, </joey>
<joey> it's weird to see how celebrity
culture has evolved, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I'm like, </joey>
<joey> how I got onto this thought was I remember </joey>
<joey> I got recommended a clip of
a Michael Jackson concert, </joey>
<joey> and it was just literally like, </joey>
<joey> Michael Jackson standing up on the stage, </joey>
<joey> standing still.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then people are just like
passing out in the crowd. </joey>
<garnt> It's fucking insane.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's this concert,
there's a really famous concert, </garnt>
<garnt> it's on YouTube, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The opening, right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The lights come on,
and then from the stage, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a trap door that opens </garnt>
<garnt> and Michael Jackson literally shoots out. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, emerges out. </joey>
<joey> - With some sunglasses
and he's standing there. </joey>
<garnt> And I swear for 10 minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> this crowd is losing their fucking mind. </garnt>
<joey> - There are people like... </joey>
<joey> - He literally just stands there. </joey>
<joey> - The literal clip on YouTube is called </joey>
<garnt> Michael Jackson Stands
Still and People Pass Out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> He's not even moving.
- It's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> And it's just like insane to think that </joey>
<joey> like he was, back in the day, </joey>
<joey> he was put up to like
almost godlike status. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I can't imagine someone today </joey>
<joey> having that kind of reaction </joey>
<joey> or anyone today having that kind of a... </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I feel that way as well </joey>
<joey> whenever I look at, you know, </joey>
<connor> like Beatlemania clips from like the 70s. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </connor>
<joey> - People losing their mind
to The Beatles, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's BTS now, right? </connor>
<joey> - Oh.
- You think so? </joey>
<joey> You think so? </joey>
<connor> - I don't think it's to the
same level as the Beatles high. </connor>
<connor> - I think the thing is, I
dunno, I think BTS is in line. </connor>
<connor> - The BTS fans are like,
oh, challenging accepted. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> - I think it's the closest thing </connor>
<connor> we've had to that level of like intensity. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] True.
- But I don't think </joey>
<connor> we've had any-- </connor>
<connor> - I think though the thing
is it doesn't look as intense </connor>
<garnt> because a lot of that is all online now. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whereas back in the, during Beatlemania, </garnt>
<garnt> like, if you wanted to go see The Beatles, </garnt>
<joey> you had to go, physically to go see them. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] That's true. </joey>
<joey> - I think another thing is
that you just know way more </joey>
<joey> about the celebrity, nowadays,
because of social media, </joey>
<joey> and it's like, it kind of
like humanizes them more </joey>
<garnt> than before, when your
only exposure to them </garnt>
<garnt> was through like, </garnt>
<garnt> news media and TV and like--
- Like interviews </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was the only slice
you got, behind what was, </garnt>
<garnt> what their lives were. </garnt>
<garnt> And now, you know about everything, </garnt>
<garnt> like, you know, the good and the bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I remember, it's so weird seeing, </garnt>
<garnt> like, for example, Chris Pratt, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when everyone
fucking loved Chris Pratt, </garnt>
<garnt> he was like,
(Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> he was like the golden child.
- Yeah, he was. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of the internet.
- Do you mean now? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, he's not.
- No, </connor>
<connor> and then suddenly people
just started hating him. </connor>
<joey> I can't remember what set it off. </joey>
<joey> I didn't even know why...
- Really? </joey>
<connor> - It might've been the, </connor>
<connor> I remember he did like a
lot of Christian remarks, </connor>
<connor> a lot of people like, were
not like, happy about that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, oh, okay.
- Oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> I guess I missed that arc of Chris Pratt. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I missed that arc, I just like, </joey>
<joey> one day I woke up and it was like, </joey>
<joey> it was cool to like Chris Pratt, </joey>
<joey> then I woke up on another year </joey>
<connor> and everyone was suddenly hating him. </connor>
<joey> - And now it's cool to
like Chris Pratt again. </joey>
<joey> 'cause he's getting everyone-- </joey>
<joey> - I could be mistaken on this, </joey>
<connor> I know that a lot of
people got annoyed at him </connor>
<joey> around the time of like, </joey>
<joey> I think when James Gunn got fired? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yes, yes, yes. </joey>
<joey> - And everyone from "Guardians
of the Galaxy" like, </joey>
<connor> tried to like, openly like
supporting, you know, James Gunn. </connor>
<connor> I think Chris Pratt didn't
really do anything in that, </connor>
<connor> like, kind of rubbed people the wrong way, </connor>
<garnt> or he gave some vague
Christian-esque statement </garnt>
<garnt> that people didn't really like. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I know that was around the time, </connor>
<connor> when I first started seeing stuff, </connor>
<garnt> people like, didn't like Chris Pratt. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- You know, I mean, </garnt>
<connor> it's all, you know, the
internet is like that. </connor>
<joey> - Now you can't stop
hearing about Chris Pratt, </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause not only now he's he Mario, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he's also Garfield, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't believe...
- Is he Garfield? </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - He's voicing Garfield. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, what? </connor>
<connor> When did this get announced? </connor>
<garnt> - Today.
- This morning. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, shit. </garnt>
<connor> - So like, the real MVP
here, Chris' agent is like, </connor>
<garnt> fucking...
- [Joey] Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who the fuck is that agent?
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> This man is insane.
- In his ways. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro, this agent, man, </garnt>
<joey> he better keep him on lock, man. </joey>
<joey> This agent is... </joey>
<connor> - Could you imagine if, just like, </connor>
<joey> your agent just walked in and
was like, "Oh, by the way, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be voicing
Mario and Garfield." </joey>
<connor> - Next up, next up,
you'll see it, tomorrow, </connor>
<connor> he's voicing Gru from "Despicable Me". </connor>
<connor> He's taking over Steve Carell, move aside. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> He's not as marketable anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> My God. </connor>
<joey> - Like this morning,
especially on Twitter, </joey>
<connor> I was like--
- Why's he Garfield? </connor>
<connor> - And also did you hear as
well that they're making-- </connor>
<garnt> So you know how Seth Rogan
is playing as Donkey Kong? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Donkey Kong is getting
his own movie, as well, </garnt>
<garnt> that's been confirmed.
- As Seth Rogan? </garnt>
<garnt> - As Seth Rogan.
- Fuck off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that was confirmed as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck off, you're lying. </connor>
<connor> - Unfortunately.
(Joey sighing) </connor>
<connor> - This is... </connor>
<connor> - It was the weird timeline
I woke up to this morning. </connor>
<connor> I'm like Seth Rogan, Donkey
Kong is getting his own movie, </connor>
<joey> and Chris Pratt is Garfield. </joey>
<joey> - What's going on with these movies? </joey>
<joey> - This is like the proof </joey>
<joey> that we live in a parallel universe. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing ) </joey>
<garnt> Like, we've like, somehow,
like we've jumped timelines </garnt>
<garnt> and we've not realized that
we've jumped timelines. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Do you want the Mario movie to be good? </connor>
<connor> - No.
(Joey sighing) </connor>
<garnt> - No.
- Why no? </garnt>
<joey> - I see--
- Define good, define good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - You want it to like legitimately be </joey>
<connor> a critically successful-- </connor>
<joey> - Do you think the "Sonic" movie was good? </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually liked the-- </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> I like the "Sonic" movie. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like you should go
into like that kind of realm. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, where it's like critically, </connor>
<joey> nothing to really get,
- Yeah, it's just fun. </joey>
<joey> - But it was good fun. </joey>
<joey> - Conceptually, it was fun, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I, yeah, yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, what do I want it to be? </garnt>
<joey> - I just don't know what
to think about it, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - I just can't put my, you know how, like, </connor>
<connor> when you hear the "Sonic"
movie and it's like, </connor>
<garnt> you can kind of figure out, "All right, </garnt>
<garnt> I can kind of understand, </garnt>
<garnt> where they would go with this
cast and these characters." </garnt>
<garnt> That makes sense
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> With the Mario thing that
they've announced so far, </garnt>
<garnt> I think, the reason why
everyone's freaking out, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause everyone's like, "What
the fuck is this movie?" </joey>
<joey> Like, "What are they doing?" </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Actually, it goes... </joey>
<connor> - What actually is this movie gonna-- </connor>
<connor> - It goes against what we
just said, where we said, </connor>
<garnt> celebrities can't sell a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> They fucking sold me on this, </garnt>
<connor> they sold me on the "Mario" movie. </connor>
<connor> - They sold me, but like, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, there's no
way this can be a movie. </garnt>
<joey> Like an actual thing.
- [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What's so surreal
about the "Mario" movie, </joey>
<connor> is that it's a fucking meme. </connor>
<joey> It is a shit-post that got
made into reality, right? </joey>
<connor> - How is Donkey Kong as Seth Rogan </connor>
<connor> gonna contribute to this plot? </connor>
<connor> I don't understand, because
Donkey Kong rarely contributes </connor>
<joey> to any-fucking-thing in "Mario". </joey>
<joey> He's kinda just chilling-- </joey>
<joey> - The one I'm personally
excited for is Keegan, </joey>
<connor> playing as Toad.
- How is... </connor>
<joey> How is that gonna come into this? </joey>
<joey> How are they gonna
introduce Keegan, as Toad? </joey>
<connor> How does that happen in the movie? </connor>
<connor> I'm thinking, I'm sitting here </connor>
<connor> and I hope this ages poorly or something. </connor>
<connor> I'm so confused. </connor>
<connor> And like, even now, like, </connor>
<connor> and then the real Mario voice
actor's gonna cameo, how? </connor>
<connor> How is that gonna happen? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's what I am wondering. </connor>
<connor> - Is he just gonna say,
"It's a me, "Mario" </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> and Mario is like, "Fuck it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "It's a you, Mario." </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> - Is he gonna say--
- "It's not a me" </connor>
<connor> - Pranks gonna be like,
"No, it's a me, Mario." </connor>
<joey> And then like, they
have this weird fucking </joey>
<joey> rush hour three-esque, stupid thing. </joey>
<joey> Like, is that what's gonna happen? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Like, the entire thing
could be like a new grounds, </garnt>
<joey> parody animation from like
2010 or something, you know. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like an OneyNG. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right, except
it's the fucking reality. </joey>
<connor> - And then it's by Illumination, as well, </connor>
<joey> which is also like "The fuck!" </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know what's going on. </joey>
<connor> - What have Illumination done? </connor>
<garnt> - "Despicable Me."
- "Despicable Me." </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - And that kind of, those kind of movies. </garnt>
<joey> - Did they make the "Emoji" movie as well? </joey>
<garnt> - No, that was Sony.
- Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sony movies...
- Luckily, no. </garnt>
<connor> - Sony movies, ah...
- Ooh. </connor>
<connor> - Well, they had like,
"Into the Spider-Verse", </connor>
<joey> then they were like, ton of backtrack. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's different for
different studios and stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, </joey>
<joey> I think that was a different studio </joey>
<garnt> and then "Into the
Spider-Verse" is kind of just, </garnt>
<garnt> its own anomaly, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there's no other
animated movie, I think, </garnt>
<garnt> that is just like "Into the
Spider-Verse", 'cause its, </garnt>
<connor> - No.
- Such a unique-- </connor>
<joey> - Still haven't watched it, and I wanna-- </joey>
<garnt> - You haven't watched it? </garnt>
<joey> - See, here's the thing, right? </joey>
<garnt> I really, really, really wanted
to watch it in the cinema </garnt>
<garnt> and I just didn't, </garnt>
<joey> and then now I really wanna
watch it, but I'm like, "Fuck, </joey>
<joey> it would just do a
disservice to watch it." </joey>
<joey> - I thought-- </joey>
<joey> - Just so, you just never
gonna watch it then? </joey>
<garnt> - No.
- You never. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's probably like, it's one
of the best animated movie. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't give a shit about
Spider-Man, but I loved it. </connor>
<connor> - Or maybe one day,
I'll just go to like a, </connor>
<connor> I'll find a really rich
friend and I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Can I go to your home cinema? </connor>
<garnt> And can we watch "Into the Spider-Verse" </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I've been like holding off on it? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, could we do that?" </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have any friends
with a movie theater-thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe face (indistinct).
- We'll make one. </garnt>
<connor> - The Trash Tastes Movies.
- Trash Taste Movies Theater. </connor>
<connor> - Well, let's move the Trash Tastes studio </connor>
<connor> to like, Arkansas or something. </connor>
<connor> I bet like, we could get like,
a big plot of land there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, probably. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, then we can get a theater there. </joey>
<connor> Arkansas fans, what do you say? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, one thing, I'm so jealous, </connor>
<joey> whenever I see American set up
their studios of their house, </joey>
<joey> it's just, like, they've
got so much fucking space. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<joey> If we paid the amount we're
paying for this studio, </joey>
<joey> in America, we'd have,
like, quadruple the space. </joey>
<joey> - Because, like, even in, </joey>
<connor> like, living in England, as well, </connor>
<joey> we don't get space in
England, as well, you know? </joey>
<joey> Like our houses compared to Americans' </joey>
<joey> are like, fucking tiny. </joey>
<connor> - Although they are bigger than Japan. </connor>
<connor> It's like, where I put Japan, </connor>
<connor> UK is 20% bigger and then 80% is-- </connor>
<joey> - What would you say, Japan or Tokyo? </joey>
<joey> Because there's two different things. </joey>
<connor> - But even outside of, you know, </connor>
<connor> you go to the countryside in Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> And you'll see these, like,
giant sprawling fields. </connor>
<garnt> You'll see four tiny houses,
just right next to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't want any privacy, </garnt>
<garnt> they decided, "Fuck privacy." </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, "The rice
fields need more room." </garnt>
<joey> Because that's what the countryside is. </joey>
<connor> It's like 90% rice fields. </connor>
<joey> - But with the amount we're
paying for this studio, </joey>
<connor> if we were like way outside in Japan-- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh, true. </connor>
<joey> - We'd probably get, like, at
least double, triple space. </joey>
<joey> - Some of those houses, they're
giving them away for free. </joey>
<joey> Some of them are, like,
a hundred bucks a month. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, like, the
housing market in Japan </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> is, like, not the most
healthiest thing in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean,
(Connor shouting) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what happens when you
have a declining population, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right?
- Yep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so people are
literally giving away houses </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> in some places? </joey>
<connor> - That's interesting,
'cause Japan's government </connor>
<connor> is just, like, "Yeah, it's a problem." </connor>
<connor> And then it was like,
"What are you gonna do?" </connor>
<connor> Japan's like, "Yeah, it's a problem." </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That's another social
issue in Japan, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, they say, </garnt>
<garnt> no, they go, "Oh, it's a problem, </garnt>
<garnt> what are you gonna do about it?" </garnt>
<joey> Like, "We'll make the
old people live longer." </joey>
<connor> - They're, basically.
- Up the healthcare. </connor>
<joey> - Their kids will stay in
the countryside, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah.
- Right? </connor>
<connor> - People wanna stay in the countryside. </connor>
<connor> - Will they have a job? I dunno. </connor>
<connor> - It's really interesting 'cause
it's one of those problems, </connor>
<connor> that, like, where its, </connor>
<connor> you can't have a platform to campaign on, </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, "Yeah, I'll fix the problems </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> that's gonna come in 30 years." </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is all politics, I guess, really. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>

<connor> is like using your smart
phone without a case. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt speaking
in foreign language) </connor>
<garnt> - Most of the time,
you'll probably be fine, </garnt>
<garnt> but all it takes is one accident drop </garnt>
<connor> onto solid concrete
(Joey gasping) </connor>
<connor> to make you wish you
had protected yourself. </connor>
<connor> - Nightmare fuel. </connor>
<joey> - Every time you connect

<joey> your online data is not secure. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> Any hacker on that same network </joey>
<joey> can gain access
(Connor gasping) </joey>
<joey> and steal your personal data. </joey>
<connor> - Are you serious?
- I am serious. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, and it actually doesn't take </connor>
<connor> much technical knowledge </connor>
<connor> to hack someone.
- [Joey] What? </connor>
<connor> - Just some cheap hardware is needed, </connor>
<connor> a smart 12-year old could do it. </connor>
<connor> And Joey, don't forget, </connor>
<connor> your data is valuable.

<joey> - [Connor] Wonderful.
- Back to the episode. </joey>
<joey> But no, yeah, I saw the
"Matrix" trailer, as well. </joey>
<garnt> And, you know, when,
- Oh, have we started? </garnt>
<joey> - I guess so, you brought up the "Matrix". </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- So Joey brought up, </joey>
<joey> seeing the "Matrix".
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> I saw the trailer for the
"Matrix Resurrection", </joey>
<joey> I think it's called.
- Yeah, yeah, </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna be honest with you, </connor>
<connor> I've watched all the "Matrix" movies, </connor>
<connor> and I cannot remember what
happened in any of them. </connor>
<joey> - Me neither. </joey>
<joey> - I kind of have, </joey>
<connor> because I went on a stint
of watching "Matrix" clips, </connor>
<garnt> like for some random...
- Not the movies. </garnt>
<connor> - Not the movies, the
clips and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> I think the second and
third movie were way better </joey>
<joey> than what I remembered, 'cause
I was watching these clips. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> I was watching the clips. </joey>
<joey> This is just how I
experience movies, nowadays. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt literally doesn't watch movies. </connor>
<joey> Garnt watches one fifth of a movie, </joey>
<joey> and decides if he likes the movie or not, </joey>
<connor> and then never watches it. </connor>
<joey> - I can't believe we're
about to live vicariously </joey>
<joey> through you, watching clips. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause, like, I just watch
the best parts of the movies. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> The great thing about watching
the best parts of the movies </garnt>
<garnt> is that you get to blank
out, all the shit-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Makes the movie look way better. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just makes the movie look way better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I remember saying in our movie episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I don't think the
"Matrix" has aged well at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> there was like so many
little things that I didn't </joey>
<joey> really understand when I first
watched the "Matrix" trilogy. </joey>
<connor> - Mm-hmm.
- Right? </connor>
<connor> - Apparently, the co-director
said that it was a metaphor </connor>
<connor> for being trans, the whole movie series. </connor>
<connor> - What?
- Really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I mean the,
Wachowski brothers did-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, they are the Wachowski sisters-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they are the sisters, so yeah...- </garnt>
<connor> - And it was a metaphor about being trans. </connor>
<joey> - I'm trying to... </joey>
<joey> Did that pop up in any of the clips? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I, you know, again, </joey>
<connor> this is just saying I read and I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, I didn't know that.
- [Joey] Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, cool, I mean, I didn't know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, </joey>
<joey> what I found was really cool,
was how the entire world, </joey>
<joey> was kind of, like, built,
like, you know, like a program. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't realize at the time </joey>
<joey> when I watched it as a kid, </joey>
<joey> that basically every character, </joey>
<garnt> like, represented a different program </garnt>
<garnt> or a different subsystem of the "Matrix". </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Oh, </garnt>
<garnt> there was so much thought,
that went into this </garnt>
<garnt> about "Matrix" law, that just
fucking flew over my head </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like, "Oh, cool, </garnt>
<garnt> people go bang, bang, bang, </garnt>
<garnt> pew, pew, pew."
- Yeah, slow-mo, yeah. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and that's all I care.
- Bang, bang, bang. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's all I cared about as a kid </joey>
<joey> and I realized when I was
like watching these clips </joey>
<joey> and like watching videos
about "Matrix" law </joey>
<joey> and like how and what-- </joey>
<connor> - Did you watch a 10-hour YouTube essay </connor>
<connor> about why the "Matrix" is
good and you should care? </connor>
<joey> - No, I watched-- </joey>
<garnt> - That was only about four hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it was two hours, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was only about four hours, </garnt>
<garnt> thank you very much.
(Connor and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I needed someone to tell me
what to think about the movie, </connor>
<joey> because...
(Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> - That's why I watch "Gigguk",
to get down with anime. </garnt>
<connor> So do you think it needs a new movie? </connor>
<connor> Do you want a new movie of "Matrix"? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I wasn't expecting
it, but you know what? </joey>
<joey> I am curious, if I were to be honest. </joey>
<joey> - I know if it makes Keanu
happy, I'm fine with it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think there is space for a new movie. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - The problem is, I don't
remember how the third movie ends. </joey>
<joey> - The third movie ends, spoiler alert. </joey>
<joey> - For a 20-year old movie. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, for a 20-year old movie, </garnt>
<garnt> with Neo and agent Smith fighting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And you know, </garnt>
<garnt> they're doing, like, the Superman shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah
- And then Agent Smith, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I forgot, like, what he, like, </garnt>
<garnt> puts his hand into Neo </garnt>
<garnt> who becomes agent Smith and
then Neo dies, because-- </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right, right, right.
- And then-- </connor>
<connor> - And that was it.
- [Connor] Epic. </connor>
<joey> - And then humans and
machines live in harmony </joey>
<joey> and the "Matrix" is saved,
(Joey snickering) </joey>
<joey> and that's it, then it's remade. </joey>
<joey> And I think that's the movie. </joey>
<joey> - So how would you go on, from that? </joey>
<joey> - Well--
- Good question. </joey>
<joey> - I can't remember what the
trailer of the plot was. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- It's just very confusing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I just think there is like, </joey>
<joey> because, that's what got me into it, </joey>
<connor> because I saw the trailer. </connor>
<connor> Now, I remember, because I was, like, </connor>
<connor> "How are they gonna make a fourth movie?" </connor>
<connor> And so that got me to look
into the original trilogy. </connor>
<connor> - This is why I go on
uploads once a month. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> - I'm like retracing my steps </connor>
<garnt> to why I started watching "Matrix" clips, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was because of the fourth trailer. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think there is space </garnt>
<garnt> because there is space
for more storytelling </garnt>
<garnt> with different iterations of the "Matrix". </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that was one
really interesting part </garnt>
<garnt> of the "Matrix" </garnt>
<garnt> that was never, been able
to, what was never explored </garnt>
<garnt> in the original, which was, </garnt>
<garnt> this was just one version of the "Matrix". </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah,
- So there were like, </garnt>
<garnt> there could be plenty of others </garnt>
<garnt> and there could be plenty
of others in the future. </garnt>
<joey> So there's so many ways you can-- </joey>
<joey> - So what you're saying is </joey>
<garnt> it could turn into like
a "Fate" situation. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no, no,
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I did not say that. </garnt>
<garnt> I did not say that.
- Okay, that was Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - That was Joey. </joey>
<joey> - You said there were multiple universes, </joey>
<garnt> multiple timelines, </garnt>
<garnt> and all I could think of
was, oh, it's just like, </garnt>
<connor> it's like "Fate". </connor>
<connor> - There's a moon,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> they have a moon.
(Joey gasping) </connor>
<garnt> Oh my, okay, so, </garnt>
<joey> I wanna watch the movie,
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> but I understand that I have to go back </joey>
<joey> and watch the other three.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't think you do though.
- No, really? </joey>
<joey> - No.
- Oh, really? </joey>
<connor> - I kind of want to, though. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel like, I've missed
so much point of the movie, </connor>
<connor> but then also re-watching
the other movies, </connor>
<connor> you can't not pay attention. </connor>
<connor> It's one of those movies, </connor>
<connor> you look away, your phone for one second, </connor>
<garnt> you're like, "Rewind that
two minutes, please." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, I do wanna watch it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, it was a different, </joey>
<joey> it was a different experience </joey>
<joey> going like revisiting the "Matrix". </joey>
<garnt> Like, I kind of realized </garnt>
<garnt> how much of an amazing
character Morpheus is, now. </garnt>
<garnt> And that makes me really sad, </garnt>
<garnt> that they didn't get Laurence Fishburne </garnt>
<garnt> to come back as Morpheus--
- [Connor] Oh yeah they-- </garnt>
<connor> Even though they got like the main-- </connor>
<connor> - Is there a reason why? </connor>
<connor> - I think because they're doing
young Morpheus, in this one. </connor>
<connor> So
- Ah, </connor>
<joey> I mean, it might be,
might be a plot point. </joey>
<connor> - But he was in "John Wick".
- I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - He was in John wick. </connor>
<connor> - Was he in "John Wick"?
- He's in John wick. </connor>
<connor> - Is he in "John Wick"?
- He's in "John Wick". </connor>
<garnt> Yeah.
- Oh. </garnt>
<connor> - I did like that Keanu Reeves </connor>
<connor> basically just--
- Looks like "John Wick". </connor>
<garnt> It was just basically "John Wick". </garnt>
<joey> - He's given up and I love that, though. </joey>
<connor> Like, I'm gonna contradict
myself to my point earlier </connor>
<connor> where I said that I don't watch
movies 'cause of the actors. </connor>
<connor> I will watch almost
anything with Keanu Reeves, </connor>
<joey> just because he's such a delight to watch. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah.
- Like, he does just have... </joey>
<connor> He always, you can tell he loves it. </connor>
<joey> - It's also a colder
thing that in real life </joey>
<joey> he's also really chill.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> You know, I know it's like the thing </connor>
<connor> you do on, when you're, on the internet </connor>
<connor> to just adore Keanu Reeves, </connor>
<connor> but like legitimately,
like when he's on screen, </connor>
<garnt> I love watching him.
- [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I genuinely feel that he loves
every second of performing. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And it's just a delight to watch. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes it's just nice to see someone </joey>
<joey> who loves something that they do. </joey>
<joey> - It's like saying, love
someone who loves their job. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I don't know, it's
the little things in life. </garnt>
<connor> - He's just, even when he's
doing these characters, </connor>
<joey> you can just tell, like, through it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah,
- I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> I don't know how you can
do that, but it works. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why but Keanu Reeves </joey>
<joey> seems like the kind of guy </joey>
<garnt> who would, like, collect
merch of the movies he's in. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - He's like that kind of guy, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "Yo, I've got this
"John Wick" action figures, </garnt>
<joey> fuck insane. </joey>
<connor> - "John Wick" is like
some of my most enjoyable </connor>
<connor> theater experiences. </connor>
<joey> Like, every single time
I've gone to watch it </joey>
<joey> in the movie theaters, I've
just had such a fucking delight. </joey>
<joey> - I've only seen the first one. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly.
- I've only seen </joey>
<joey> the first one as well.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Please watch the other
two, they're so fun. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- Really good movies. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Watch "John Wick".
- Just go watch "John Wick". </joey>
<garnt> - Watch "John Wick" for a day.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know what realization
I had the other day, </garnt>
<garnt> as you guys are talking about movies? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- So I haven't been watching </garnt>
<connor> movies recently. </connor>
<connor> I've gone back to watching anime now. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - I know, I know, </connor>
<garnt> I finished my seasonal
video and I'm just, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like continuing some of these shows </garnt>
<garnt> out of my, own volition.
- [Connor] Pride. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did you watch, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> What did you watch? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I just had this
realization the other day. </connor>
<connor> - Ah, I like anime.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - No, well, one, yeah,
I actually like anime, </joey>
<joey> and number two, </joey>
<joey> so I finished watching
some of these episodes </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt sighing) </joey>
<joey> I don't have anyone to talk to this about. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. (Joey laughing)
- Once again in my life. </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> - Once again in my life.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am sorry." </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - I realized that everyone
in my life around me, </joey>
<garnt> doesn't watch anime anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Am I the last motherfucker
who still watches anime?" </garnt>
<connor> (Joey singing "Mad World"
by Michael Andrews) </connor>
<connor> - I just watch, I watch
normie mainstream anime. </connor>
<joey> I don't watch...
- If it's not on Netflix, </joey>
<connor> Connor doesn't touch it. </connor>
<joey> - Listen, I'll watch it. </joey>
<connor> If it's off of Netflix, I'll
just begrudgingly do it. </connor>
<joey> I'll be like, "For fuck's sake." </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause it...
- Okay, go, go, go, go. </connor>
<joey> - It was so weird, </joey>
<joey> because, like, when me and
Sidney started our relationship, </joey>
<connor> we'd like, this side of
our relationship was like, </connor>
<connor> we'd watch like a new show or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. -
- Between us. </connor>
<connor> Like every, you know, </connor>
<connor> every time we had some free time </connor>
<connor> and now I'm just like, "Honey,
you wanna watch an anime?" </connor>
<garnt> And she's like, "No!" </garnt>
<garnt> "Show me a, put on a shitty horror movie. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I wanna watch. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's put on 90 day fiance." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> - "Get that Japanese shit outta here." </garnt>
<garnt> Eww. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, "Okay." </garnt>
<garnt> So I started my YouTube journey </garnt>
<garnt> having no friends around
me who watched anime. </garnt>
<garnt> Then I found--
- Too many. </garnt>
<garnt> - Too many friends who watch anime, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, every
time I hung out with friends, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone around me watch anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And then, now, I moved to
Japan, started an anime podcast, </joey>
<joey> I'm dating a girl, who, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to get married to a girl </joey>
<joey> who was a big weeb, an anime fan, </joey>
<joey> and no one around me
fucking watches anime. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck is going on? </joey>
<garnt> I've literally looped back
to where I started off at. </garnt>
<connor> - Those who don't learn from history </connor>
<garnt> are doomed to repeat it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - This cycle of a weeb. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is so surreal now, though. </garnt>
<garnt> I know more people who've watched anime </garnt>
<garnt> and who were like, heavy anime fans. </garnt>
<garnt> But are now just like, </garnt>
<garnt> now just like more integrated
into, like, the weeb culture </garnt>
<connor> or like the wider anime culture, </connor>
<connor> without actually watching anime. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird. </connor>
<joey> - You know that meme where it's like, </joey>
<joey> the floor is, </joey>
<joey> and it's like the meme, </joey>
<joey> it's like the floor is watching anime. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, literally doing everything, </connor>
<connor> but watching...
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I've been reading, like, books, recently. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like...
- Wait, what? </joey>
<joey> You've been reading books? </joey>
<joey> - Books, with no pictures.
(Joey gasping) </joey>
<garnt> I would talk about it, except
I haven't finished them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pics or it didn't happen. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm reading a few of them. </joey>
<connor> - What kind? </connor>
<joey> Like, storybooks, information books? </joey>
<joey> - Like, fictional,
nonfiction, autobiograpy? </joey>
<connor> - Ah, non-fiction.
- Just give us a taste. </connor>
<connor> - Non-fiction. </connor>
<connor> - I'll talk about when I'm,
I'm halfway through one, </connor>
<connor> that's really good, right now.
- Okay. </connor>
<joey> - It's about Japan, </joey>
<connor> and it's really good,
I'll talk about it later. </connor>
<joey> - Wow.
- Something good. </joey>
<joey> - Something's like, okay. </joey>
<connor> - But it's like literally,
the floor is anime, </connor>
<garnt> and I'm like, fucking
jumping in the air, like. </garnt>
<joey> - What timeline are we in?
- I don't know, man. </joey>
<garnt> I'm reading. </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor's reading a book,
Chris Pratt is Garfield. </garnt>
<joey> I'm not watching anime. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like we are in
the "Matrix" right now. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, all the signs you look for, </garnt>
<garnt> to, like, see if the world
we're living in is fake. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like there's enough
going on around me right now, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm just like--
- We're in the "Matrix". </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, stop the simulation. </garnt>
<garnt> I know that...
(Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Get me out, get me out. </joey>
<joey> - Connor read a book,
I'm gonna kill myself, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm in a simulation.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I watched, actually I
didn't tell you about this, </connor>
<garnt> I watched an anime on
the plane back to the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> and I watched eight
episodes and I stopped. </garnt>
<garnt> I was very angry.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I watched, was it? </garnt>
<garnt> 81, 87, was it? </garnt>
<garnt> - 86.
- 86. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> - Bro, It was shit.
- Was it? </connor>
<joey> - It was bad.
- You didn't like it? </joey>
<joey> - I thought it was bad. </joey>
<garnt> - I've heard really good things about it. </garnt>
<joey> - Bro, it was--
- Like, literally everyone, </joey>
<garnt> I know says its amazing.
- What was bad about it? </garnt>
<joey> I like it.
- What'd you like about it? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I just liked the concept, </joey>
<joey> it's been so long since we've seen, like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like it's the
closest we've had, to, like, </joey>
<joey> one of these mega shows
that I watched growing up, </joey>
<joey> at least, </joey>
<joey> where it was like two nations
going against each other, </joey>
<joey> and then there was some mystery going on </joey>
<joey> and you didn't know-- </joey>
<connor> - Did you like the mystery? </connor>
<connor> I was so bored by the mystery. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Okay, whatever." </joey>
<joey> And then the whole time--
- Don't look at me, </joey>
<garnt> I haven't seen it.
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - The whole time, they were
doing the whole thing of like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, obviously, racism is bad, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I get it.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But when they like
spoonfeed it to you, like, </connor>
<connor> "Racism-bad, huh?" </connor>
<connor> - It comes here and it's like,
- "Agh, racism!" </connor>
<connor> And its like, all right, I get it, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, such an unnuanced take about it </connor>
<joey> that I was like, "Okay,
all right, we get it." </joey>
<joey> - I get that. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I was just so, like,
I was so bored by it, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I get it," right? </joey>
<connor> I don't need you to tell
me that this is, like, </connor>
<connor> this is the story, like, this is... </connor>
<connor> And I should feel sad. </connor>
<joey> - So they were like, over-explaining it? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] To me it felt,
- I mean, it was very, </joey>
<joey> it was very much put in your face. </joey>
<connor> I mean, the entire thing </connor>
<joey> was basically based around World War II. </joey>
<connor> - But it was kinda like, nudging, like, </connor>
<joey> "Huh, is it bad? </joey>
<connor> Huh?" </connor>
<connor> And it was the whole time watching it. </connor>
<connor> I was just so bored. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, and the
whole mystery aspect to it, </connor>
<joey> I was not enjoying it. </joey>
<joey> So I, "Should we roughly explain </joey>
<joey> what the plot of the show is first?" </joey>
<joey> - Sure. </joey>
<joey> - What do you remember?
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> - I'm very curious.
- This has been a month. </joey>
<joey> It's been two months,
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> since I watched this
and it was on a plane. </joey>
<joey> - I love it when Connor
tries to describe an anime. </joey>
<joey> - There is a main MC who is a... </joey>
<joey> Everyone in this world, right? </joey>
<joey> Is in this beautiful homogenous society. </joey>
<joey> Everyone is the same,
has the same hair color, </joey>
<joey> and same, you know, </joey>
<joey> everyone looks exactly...
- Everyone's white. </joey>
<garnt> - It's Aryan bro, they're all Aryan, </garnt>
<garnt> that's literally what
they're trying to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just say that. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, then, they literally were like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> - They are all white, just say that. </garnt>
<connor> - But it's anime Aryans, </connor>
<connor> so they have green hair
instead of, you know. </connor>
<connor> (Joey mocking sarcastically) </connor>
<connor> And so they're in this world
and everything's perfect. </connor>
<connor> And they keep doing this
fucking stupid thing, </connor>
<connor> where they're like, and it was just like, </connor>
<connor> it was so obvious what they were tryna do, </connor>
<connor> where it was just, not happening. </connor>
<connor> I was just like, "Okay, we get it." </connor>
<connor> They were like, every
single day, they'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "We have zero casualties in
this war, isn't that amazing? </connor>
<connor> Zero casualties, zero casualties." </connor>
<connor> And the whole point of it is that </connor>
<connor> they have these mechs that are fighting, </connor>
<connor> and they're piloted by the other people, </connor>
<connor> who are not the perfect race.
- [Joey] Right. </connor>
<garnt> - And they make them fight in the mechs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Peasants. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they have, oh yeah, peasants. </garnt>
<garnt> Peasants, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> And they have these mech, like, captains, </garnt>
<garnt> these are the captains
that talk to the peasants, </garnt>
<garnt> God forbid they have
to talk to them, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Somebody has to talk to them, </garnt>
<garnt> in this world. </garnt>
<garnt> And our main protagonist, guess what? </garnt>
<garnt> She's sympathetic to the
peasants, as they say, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm calling them peasants, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, I've caught the cold. </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt said peasants,
(Garnt laughing hysterically) </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm running with it now. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're called the peasants now. </garnt>
<garnt> - So obviously she's sympathetic, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> and she starts to become
friends with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right.
- Oh, turns out, </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> these other race of people, </connor>
<connor> they're just normal human
beings, who would've thought? </connor>
<connor> You know, it's just like,
"All right, come on, man." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Like, come on! </connor>
<connor> - It does sound pretty dumbed down. </connor>
<connor> So like, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, like a Disney
movie take on it, you know? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It was just so, </connor>
<connor> it was like Dr. Seuss. </connor>
<connor> Like "Cat in the Hat"
level of talking about-- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right.
- I was just like, so </connor>
<joey> I already get it, come on,
we're in 21st century now, </joey>
<connor> we can do more nuanced takes about this. </connor>
<joey> - I'll tell you like a perfect analogy, </joey>
<joey> which will, I think
you'll understand, Joey. </joey>
<joey> It feels like, </joey>
<joey> a Gen Urobuchi show, </joey>
<joey> without being written by Gen Urobuchi. </joey>
<joey> So
- Yeah, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Explain that to me. </garnt>
<joey> - I get what, exactly
what you mean by that. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, you get it now?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You get it?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, now explain that to me. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so Gen Urobuchi is the
guy who wrote "Psycho-Pass", </connor>
<joey> who wrote "Madoka Magica" </joey>
<connor> and "Saya no Uta".
- "Saya no Uta". </connor>
<connor> - Well, "Psycho-Pass",
I thought was amazing </connor>
<connor> and like a really good take </connor>
<connor> on the whole societal aspect of that. </connor>
<connor> But like, this just felt like-- </connor>
<connor> - Yes, but that's what he means. </connor>
<garnt> It's like a show that's
written by Gen Urobuchi, </garnt>
<connor> but not...
- But worse. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But like, not as nuanced. </connor>
<joey> - Am I? Do you think it's bad? </joey>
<connor> Do you think my opinions on this-- </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I think, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I think you actually
have the correct opinion </joey>
<joey> where it's like very spoonfed into you, </joey>
<joey> like, racism is bad, </joey>
<joey> and that's never why I kind of liked it. </joey>
<joey> I kind of liked more, </joey>
<connor> I kind of more gravitated
towards like, the mystery aspects </connor>
<connor> of just like, 'cause one thing, </connor>
<connor> one big thing you missed
is they're at war, </connor>
<connor> so this nation is at war
with another nation, right? </connor>
<connor> - I could figure out,
roughly what was going on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, </connor>
<connor> and the other nation has robots </connor>
<connor> that are completely autonomous. </connor>
<connor> Like, they have technical, </connor>
<connor> they have a technology
that is way more advanced </connor>
<connor> and they have AI robots that
they're fighting against, </connor>
<connor> except, the nation that we're following </connor>
<connor> has human robots, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right. </connor>
<connor> - So apparently, the nation is like, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the exact details </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm not up to date, </connor>
<connor> but apparently, the nation
has a time limit, right? </connor>
<connor> And after this time limit is over, </connor>
<connor> then the robots are going to shut down </connor>
<garnt> 'cause there's no one
actually telling these robots </garnt>
<garnt> to fight.
- And then if they like, </garnt>
<garnt> year about Y2K, probably won't happen. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but, like, I was more, like, </garnt>
<garnt> what drew me in with this, </garnt>
<garnt> was more the mystery aspects </garnt>
<joey> and more like the character dynamics </joey>
<joey> between the main girl and
the and the group itself. </joey>
<connor> - I agree, but at times,
the character dynamics </connor>
<connor> did feel real predictable
and stale, for me. </connor>
<connor> It was just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> I wanted to know more about the enemy </connor>
<connor> and I wanted to learn
more about the mystery, </connor>
<connor> but everything else was
such a slog to sit through. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- That I was just like-- </connor>
<joey> - Is it maybe because it's a concept </joey>
<connor> that you've already seen in anime before? </connor>
<connor> - It couldn't be that, it
could also just be like, </connor>
<connor> I just didn't feel like, </connor>
<joey> although the mystery
aspect was quite good, </joey>
<joey> all the other aspects didn't
really entice me, personally. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<garnt> And also I was on a plane,
so it was the choice of like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can try and get some sleep here </garnt>
<garnt> or I can continue watching the show. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was really struggling, </garnt>
<joey> every episode I kept going on, </joey>
<connor> I kept thinking it's really going-- </connor>
<joey> - You know, it's not a good sign, </joey>
<joey> when you have to choose between </joey>
<connor> watching the next episode and sleep. </connor>
<garnt> - I really wanted it to pick up the pace. </garnt>
<joey> Like, it was really like
taking it's fucking time. </joey>
<joey> And they really-- </joey>
<joey> - That's something I agree on. </joey>
<joey> - They really, like, wanted to show </joey>
<joey> that the main character
was sympathetic, but like, </joey>
<joey> it was obvious, she was sympathetic </joey>
<joey> and they just kept doing things </joey>
<joey> to show that she was
sympathetic, over and over again. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, "I get it." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah,
- We get it. </joey>
<joey> We all know, we get it. </joey>
<joey> - There's lots of
sympathetic MCs out there. </joey>
<joey> - And like, </joey>
<joey> it was just so frustrating
watching the show </joey>
<joey> where they just had the same
copy and paste, like, action, </joey>
<joey> where she would talk to
someone, they'd be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, don't talk to the peasants." </joey>
<connor> And then she'd be like, "But I like them." </connor>
<connor> And then she would literally
have this conversation </connor>
<joey> with everyone. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, okay, maybe that
would happen in real life </joey>
<connor> if the situation was real,
but it was just so boring, </connor>
<connor> they had to show it every goddamn time. </connor>
<joey> We get it, it's not normal. </joey>
<joey> - I also think it was bad
timing that this came off, </joey>
<connor> came out after "Attack
on Titan", which is like, </connor>
<connor> I think a way better,
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Way to show some of the
themes that "86" was showing. </garnt>
<connor> - That's true, that's true. </connor>
<joey> - I think "Attack on Titan"
was kind of like a masterclass </joey>
<joey> in that sense. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, it took
aspects of "Attack on Titan" </connor>
<garnt> and weirdly "Code Geass" in
some sense with the whole, </garnt>
<garnt> Britannian and all that stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And didn't really land
it with any of them, </garnt>
<garnt> for me personally, like, I
didn't feel like it nailed it, </garnt>
<joey> but it got a second season, </joey>
<joey> so clearly it must have been-- </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean...
- I've heard... </joey>
<joey> - The second season is like
the second half of the story, </joey>
<joey> so it's kinda more, like,
just a continuation. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've only just
heard good things about-- </garnt>
<joey> - There, we spoke about anime, okay? </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> Okay, I'm moving you
two to go on more anime, </joey>
<garnt> whatever you want.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think I've been watching anime? </garnt>
<connor> - Joey watching anime?
- Joey, get out of here. </connor>
<connor> - I do wanna watch...
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I do wanna watch "Platinum End" though? </connor>
<connor> I do want to watch.
- Why? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause it looks edgy, it looks fun. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it is edgy. </joey>
<connor> - It looks dumb and fun. </connor>
<joey> - I've heard the ending of
that is like really bad though. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- In terms of like-- </connor>
<connor> - But it looks fun. </connor>
<connor> It looks like the high rise invasion shit. </connor>
<connor> Like, it looks like it's bad, but also-- </connor>
<connor> - Is that what you look for nowadays? </connor>
<garnt> - You know, I'm trying not
to be picky with anime, </garnt>
<garnt> because if I'm gonna be picky, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna be like Joey and
I'm not gonna watch anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause Joey's read all this shit, </garnt>
<garnt> but I haven't read this, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm like, I need to just stop reading </garnt>
<connor> about stuff too much, and just
pick something, and watch it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then I did that
with "86" and I hated it. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, that's the give and take. </garnt>
<joey> - But that might happen
with "Platinum End". </joey>
<connor> - That's true.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then I feel like if
I've at least done that, </connor>
<connor> I can, then, at least, if
I get to eight episodes </connor>
<connor> and I stop, </connor>
<connor> I probably have more to say
than if I watched 12 episodes, </connor>
<connor> and be like, "Eh"
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> I have more to think and I
have more to say about it. </garnt>
<connor> And then I can go onto the anime podcast </connor>
<connor> and talk about it. </connor>
<joey> - Why don't you watch,
like, something, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know, Komi-san? </joey>
<connor> Why don't we do a thing </connor>
<joey> where we--
- I don't think, </joey>
<joey> you'll enjoy Komi-san.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - We all--
- Komi-san, like, </connor>
<connor> Connor watching Komi-san? </connor>
<garnt> - I wanna hear Connor
talking about Komi-san. </garnt>
<garnt> - We should do an anime review, </garnt>
<garnt> like once a month </garnt>
<connor> where we all have to
watch one different anime </connor>
<connor> and present it like a book club. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's so much effort. </connor>
<joey> - Joey's not gonna do that. </joey>
<joey> - Not like-- </joey>
<garnt> - Can I do like a manga review? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> We gotta push an anime </connor>
<connor> 'cause we're an anime podcast.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> We're fucking talking about it. </joey>
<joey> - I don't even think </joey>
<connor> our viewers want that from us, honestly. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's funny 'cause people will like, </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> people will have like, </joey>
<joey> 95% of viewers who I swear, are like, </joey>
<joey> "I get bored when they talk about anime" </joey>
<joey> And there's 5% of viewers are like, </joey>
<joey> "I hate when they're talking about anime." </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I fucking hate them, </joey>
<joey> they call themselves the anime podcast, </joey>
<connor> what a fucking joke! </connor>
<connor> - I feel like our viewers have become </connor>
<connor> like everyone around me, </connor>
<garnt> which is everyone was an ex-anime fan </garnt>
<garnt> and now everyone just
finds himself watching </garnt>
<garnt> anything but anime.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I have noticed that, I think, </connor>
<connor> the episodes that we talk about anime, </connor>
<joey> I think, perform worse than the ones </joey>
<joey> we talk about normal stuff.
- [Joey] Yeah, they do. </joey>
<connor> So people don't like it. </connor>
<joey> - But it's weird because
the clips perform better. </joey>
<connor> - Yes.
- So I mean. </connor>
<connor> - I don't let the fucking viewers
decide what we talk about. </connor>
<connor> - I talk about what I
wanna talk about, you know, </connor>
<connor> and it's weird that,
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> it's weird that, I mean, </connor>
<connor> it's not weird because people will want, </connor>
<connor> people want us, I'm sure,
to talk about certain shows </connor>
<garnt> and certain series. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that's just gonna perform better </garnt>
<garnt> in a short lifespan, but as a whole, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, people just wanna hear us talk shit </garnt>
<garnt> and a chat about what's
been happening in our lives, </garnt>
<garnt> which right now has been not so much. </garnt>
<garnt> - This man's moving.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been moving and
it's almost done, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> It's almost done.
- Really? </garnt>
<connor> - My setup's almost done.
- Its never almost done. </connor>
<garnt> You think it's done, right?
- [Garnt] Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> You think it's done, </garnt>
<connor> and then there's something
else that pops up. </connor>
<joey> - All right, all right. </joey>
<joey> How did you guys decide how
you wanna decorate your rooms? </joey>
<connor> - Okay, you know what the hardest-- </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna sound like a
fucking robot right now, </connor>
<connor> but I'm just like, I look
at a blank canvas, right? </connor>
<garnt> I know I'm meant to show my personality </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, what do I show? </garnt>
<connor> How do I show personality?
- Well okay, so-- </connor>
<joey> - Give me a blank space, </joey>
<joey> I have no idea what to do. </joey>
<joey> - Here's what I did, right? </joey>
<joey> In my head, all right, I've
got all these Jo-Jo posters, </joey>
<joey> that's a must, that's going
somewhere on the wall. </joey>
<connor> I've got these big ass walls, all right? </connor>
<connor> So then I know that's going there. </connor>
<connor> So then, I kind of have to
figure out what goes in between </connor>
<connor> the posters or what
goes around the posters. </connor>
<connor> And then it kind of
starts to kind of form, </connor>
<connor> and then I'm like, "Okay,
here's what I want. </connor>
<connor> I want soundproofing, I want carpet, </connor>
<connor> I want soundproof squares." </connor>
<connor> So I have an idea of stuff I want. </connor>
<connor> - And then it's kind
of putting it together </connor>
<connor> and then thinking, "Okay,
how would it look like that?" </connor>
<connor> If you know my old room, it was like, </connor>
<connor> "I want this thing on the wall, that's it. </connor>
<connor> I want posters of this, this,
that, and I don't care." </connor>
<joey> - So for me, the problem is that, </joey>
<garnt> my room and the rest of my house </garnt>
<garnt> is designed by two different people. </garnt>
<joey> My room is-- </joey>
<joey> - But your room still looks good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, my room is good,
but like the way we, </joey>
<joey> the way myself and Aki
think about interior design </joey>
<joey> is completely like on the
opposite ends of the spectrum. </joey>
<connor> - Question, would you
decorate your bedroom, </connor>
<connor> if you lived alone? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Really? </connor>
<joey> What would you decorate it with? </joey>
<joey> - No.
- I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - I've never decorated my bedroom-- </connor>
<connor> - No, I've never decorated. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why it's so fucking
difficult for me, right? </connor>
<garnt> Because the way I approach interior-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, are you gonna
decorate your bedroom? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> No, oh no, my office, sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, so yeah,
- I go yeah, yeah, but I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the same kind of deal </garnt>
<garnt> where my approach to interior design </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> is my, same approach I have
with, like, engineering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all about practicality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's just not good
for interior design. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, I know,
'cause here's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's my biggest problem
with trying to fill up my room </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> right now, my office is,
I know what looks bad, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know how to make it look good. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - See, because like,
if you're an engineer, </joey>
<joey> when it comes to interior design, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like a programmer, where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "If white wall equals true,
fill white wall with something." </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, that's it. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, there's no,
like, opinion of like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, maybe I should put something here." </garnt>
<connor> It's like, no, if there's
a space on my wall, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna find something to fill it up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, one thing that's
good about living in Japan </connor>
<connor> is that Japan is extremely
focused on practicality </connor>
<garnt> of like, everything in your house. </garnt>
<connor> Everything has to be practical. </connor>
<connor> So I kinda took a lot of that in mind </connor>
<connor> when I made my office, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna make an office tour video, </connor>
<garnt> at some point, on my main channel, </garnt>
<garnt> where I just go through everything
that I did in the office, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I think it's
really, I think I did... </garnt>
<connor> I'm pretty happy in my office. </connor>
<connor> It took me, goddamn, forever though. </connor>
<connor> - So so, easy views. </connor>
<connor> - That's the way it is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But also I wanna talk about it </connor>
<connor> because it took me goddamn forever, </connor>
<garnt> so I wanna get some value out of it. </garnt>
<garnt> Took me two fucking weeks, </garnt>
<garnt> just to soundproof the fucking room. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think it's really easy
to decorate a room in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> when you can think more on,
like, practical sides of things. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you're like,
"Okay, I want this here. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I want all my anime figures." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, but I
don't want them in just, </garnt>
<garnt> like, a cabinet, like a glass
one, because I wanna be able </garnt>
<garnt> to move it so I can access
the cupboards behind it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't want it on the
wall with all the posters, </garnt>
<connor> see them blocked up, </connor>
<connor> so it's kind of like, "All right, so..." </connor>
<connor> There's like 10,000 things
you got to consider, </connor>
<connor> but you're just trying
to like compute them all, </connor>
<garnt> but then at some point you
just gotta do something </garnt>
<joey> and then see how it looks. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] 'Cause-- </joey>
<garnt> - And hope you didn't
waste your time and money. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> as I've just established,
I hate wasting time, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, I just want
something that looks good. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't know how to make it look good </garnt>
<garnt> without just trying it out. </garnt>
<garnt> What if I like rearrange all my furniture </garnt>
<garnt> after I've just spent
all this time building it </garnt>
<garnt> and like, you know, doing my best setup </garnt>
<garnt> and then it just looks shit. </garnt>
<garnt> What if it just looks shit? </garnt>
<garnt> Because like, I have a
bunch of like anime merch </garnt>
<garnt> and like, I just don't know
how to make it look good. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I've tried putting my anime figures </garnt>
<garnt> on like a shelf or something
and I don't know why, </garnt>
<joey> I just don't think, having
a bunch of anime figures </joey>
<joey> on the shelf looks good for my aesthetic. </joey>
<joey> I say this, I said, it was all this shit, </joey>
<joey> but I think it works for us, that's it. </joey>
<joey> I dunno if we came to this by
luck or if it just, you know. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so the way Aki does it, </joey>
<joey> which I think is kind of genius, </joey>
<joey> is that what she does is,
when we first moved in, right? </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I'm gonna do my room, </joey>
<garnt> you do the rest of the house." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you clearly have a
better sense of it than I do. </garnt>
<garnt> So what she does is she took
photos of the empty room </garnt>
<garnt> and then she would go into Photoshop </garnt>
<garnt> and literally just Photoshop
in different things </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> that she was thinking to buy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like, move it around and if-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I don't have
(indistinct), holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> - And if it looks good, then she buys it </garnt>
<garnt> and puts it exactly where
she envisioned it to be. </garnt>
<joey> And because then you know.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What it looks like before you bought it. </connor>
<joey> I mean, it's kinda big brain. </joey>
<joey> - Buy what you need, measure it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Well, one thing I've, like, noticed </joey>
<connor> around anime merch now, </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> now that I'm like trying to
make my room actually look cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So a lot of anime merch
just looks really tacky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And I didn't like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize this until
now that I've moved to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> and we've got like some cooler
things, but like I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I'll try putting
some wall scrolls up </garnt>
<joey> and now like--
- One star. </joey>
<joey> - Even wall scrolls, just look like-- </joey>
<joey> - I've graduated from wall scrolls. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, hello, I have been
to an anime convention </joey>
<connor> that is the look, when you
put up wall scrolls now. </connor>
<joey> - I've never understood
the appeal of wall scrolls. </joey>
<joey> I'll be honest.
- [Joey] Me neither. </joey>
<joey> - They look shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I mean, I did. </joey>
<connor> - There are like, you know, like, posters. </connor>
<garnt> You can get them framed.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Then they look so clean. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, symmetrical
as well, so beautiful. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the nice glass panel or plastic, </garnt>
<joey> whatever the fuck it is.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then you've got this like
poorly printed piece of paper </joey>
<joey> with two plastic scrolls
at the top and the bottom. </joey>
<joey> - And its never like fucking, </joey>
<connor> the string just looks so tacky. </connor>
<connor> - The string looks really tacky. </connor>
<garnt> - We're just calling out </garnt>
<garnt> everyone who has fucking
wall scrolls right now, </garnt>
<joey> which is so many people. </joey>
<joey> - I feel I went through that phase though, </joey>
<joey> so I understand. </joey>
<garnt> I went through the wall
scroll and poster phase </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, "I liked it at the time." </garnt>
<garnt> But then when I learned
about like, framed stuff, </garnt>
<connor> that's when I was like, "Oh." </connor>
<joey> - But here's the thing, right? </joey>
<connor> Those JoJo posters that I have, </connor>
<connor> they're $13 per poster, </connor>
<connor> obviously it's in Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then the frame is like 12 bucks. </connor>
<connor> That's like 25 bucks for
a clean ass, massive, </connor>
<connor> like really high quality. </connor>
<joey> - That's cheaper than a lot of
- Wall scrolls. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
(crosstalk) </connor>
<joey> - Like sometimes 30 to a box. </joey>
<connor> We're talking like even the A4 ones. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes they're 20 bucks, fuck that. </connor>
<connor> I won't pay on that, </connor>
<connor> and they're always like, they
always don't look as good. </connor>
<connor> Like, the print is never as clean. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't know, man,
I just, I don't see a-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm past the wall
scroll phase as well, </connor>
<connor> which is why, I had wall
scrolls in my old office </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, this just looks tacky, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't know how to, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what I wanna replace it with. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wall scrolls.
- And now, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going for that problem, </garnt>
<garnt> where I have to figure out
what I wanna replace it with. </garnt>
<connor> Well, I have like, </connor>
<connor> it's so, it's just so--
- You live in Japan. </connor>
<connor> You can get these.
- Because like-- </connor>
<connor> - B4 prints. </connor>
<connor> - I think I've done like one
cool thing with my office. </connor>
<connor> Because I have like a
few cool anime merch, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "What if I just put this
all in a glass case?" </connor>
<connor> And I bought like a glass case, </connor>
<connor> which is like a four-component glass case, </connor>
<connor> and I, you know, </connor>
<connor> I filled up, like, the top
one was the junji ito bag </connor>
<connor> that I got. </connor>
<garnt> The second one was like
all the anime watches </garnt>
<garnt> that I've got as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Third case was all the wine, </garnt>
<garnt> all the wine equipment or
the anime wine equipment </garnt>
<garnt> that me and Sydney have collected. </garnt>
<garnt> And the fourth case is going to be </garnt>
<garnt> for the Slam Dunk Air Jordans
that I found on Yahoo auction. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I put it up and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Damn, this looks awesome."
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I realized
that's like one 100th </garnt>
<joey> of the entire fucking room.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck!
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - That means you've got to
start collecting more stuff. </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, oh, it looks cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, it's like compared... </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> Like, putting it next to everything else, </joey>
<joey> it just looks so empty now. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, that one 10th
of my room looks epic. </joey>
<connor> - I know, right?
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - The people, when they
rob your house, man, </connor>
<connor> they're going right for that cabinet. </connor>
<connor> The entire Garnt Maneetapho wealth </connor>
<connor> is stored in one glass full cabinet. </connor>
<joey> - Like you've been collecting JoJo figures </joey>
<joey> or JoJo fucking merch. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, this is
how my collection starts. </joey>
<connor> It starts with one cabinet. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- My God. </joey>
<joey> - Nah, I bought one of those. </joey>
<joey> I didn't buy a glass cabinet </joey>
<joey> 'cause I wanted to be able to move it </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's blocking my cupboards, </joey>
<joey> so I bought one on wheels </joey>
<connor> that I can just kinda
like shove out the way. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Well, one thing I
definitely underestimated </joey>
<joey> was how heavy glass is. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, extremely so. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Why?
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Why? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> What made you? </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - Oh, yeah.
- No, no, well I mean. </joey>
<garnt> - That looks light. </garnt>
<garnt> - I felt like there was
another point coming down. </garnt>
<connor> I was...
(Connor laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - You literally just
went, "Glass is heavy." </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, I was waiting. </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay. </connor>
<connor> Why did you learn this? </connor>
<connor> What made you realize this?
- Okay, because... </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt goes glass heavy.
- Because... </garnt>
<connor> - That's all.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> My point was that glass
was heavy and I did not, </joey>
<garnt> like, did not--
(Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - What, you didn't think it was heavy? </joey>
<garnt> I didn't.
- It's fucking glass. </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't think about this, okay? </joey>
<joey> I don't think about this shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, I think everyone
knows glass is heavy, </garnt>
<joey> because--
- Water is wet. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like one big issue I've had </garnt>
<garnt> with living in a house now, </garnt>
<joey> is that you have to carry things upstairs. </joey>
<garnt> And luckily enough, </garnt>
<garnt> my office is on the ground floor </garnt>
<garnt> because I had the choice between </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> mine being on the ground floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and mine being on the top floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "I want
a glass case," obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once I got the glass case delivered, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, "Was
glass always this heavy?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I don't know how </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> I was meant to carry this
upstairs, if I needed to, </garnt>
<garnt> but thank God I didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn, glass in Japan
is really fucking heavy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So that was my story, Garnt
discovers that glass is heavy. </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt discovers that glass is heavy. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Hey man, I saw, picked up
a look at this metal thing. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Shit,
metal's kinda heavy." </connor>
<connor> - Wow.
- Damn. </connor>
<connor> Damn, okay, fine. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that was one thing definitely, </joey>
<joey> when I was designing my
office, where I realized, </joey>
<joey> I thought I had a lot of stuff, </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> but then, I realized that a lot of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was stuff that was on my wall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was things like
posters and wall scrolls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> Maybe it's time to change it up." </garnt>
<garnt> So then I got really picky </garnt>
<garnt> with what I would put on the walls, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So now I go like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> my junji ito bag or what the fuck, </garnt>
<garnt> your skateboards, you know,
my YouTube play button </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that, you know
stuff that is more limited </garnt>
<garnt> and like extravagant looking.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I realized, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> I actually don't have a lot of stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that is actually of value.
- [Connor] Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I went on this like crack binge </garnt>
<garnt> of buying expensive shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Now, I have the reverse problem </garnt>
<joey> where I have too much stuff now. </joey>
<joey> So I have to... </joey>
<joey> - Your room is just like
the weeb haven, you know. </joey>
<joey> - My room is, I have somehow,
I don't know when it happened, </joey>
<joey> but I've turned into, like,
a snobby art collector </joey>
<joey> when it comes to like weeb shit-- </joey>
<joey> - I think I'm going through that stage </joey>
<joey> where I'm like, </joey>
<connor> - I haven't got there
yet, I'm just like, Jojo. </connor>
<connor> Just give JoJo stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Like every time I go
into an exhibit now, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "so where are
the expensive paintings?" </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck the mugs or the posters.
- What anime does to you man? </garnt>
<joey> Fuck the T-shirts, fuck the mugs. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want your
fucking figures anymore. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I don't want the posters, </joey>
<joey> I don't want the fucking wall scrolls. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, I don't want any shit. </joey>
<garnt> Where are the paintings?
- Give me the cool shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, where's the limited shit? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, right?
(Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> What can I frame?
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> What can I display in the glass box? </joey>
<connor> - We got to do the anime
figure special, at some point, </connor>
<connor> you guys are saying this
shit, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> I love figures still, </joey>
<connor> JoJo (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - I'll walk into like a figurine shop </joey>
<connor> and I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "So were there more than
a hundred of these made?" </connor>
<connor> I don't want it.
- Wow. </connor>
<garnt> - You gonna love this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - You privilege is showing, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - Does this come with a
certificate of authenticity? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, my God. </connor>
<joey> The wealth has gone to this man's head. </joey>
<garnt> - But the thing about figures is that </garnt>
<joey> you just need a fuck ton of
it, before it looks any good. </joey>
<joey> Otherwise it just looks
a little bit tacky, </joey>
<garnt> because it's too small
to be a centerpiece, </garnt>
<garnt> but it needs to occupy, like, some space, </garnt>
<garnt> Right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just looks, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> unless you have like a
really, really massive figure, </garnt>
<joey> to me, it doesn't like, it's-- </joey>
<joey> - But even then like, a
really, really big figure </joey>
<joey> can still look a little tacky
depending on where it is. </joey>
<joey> That's where I was like, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause, I have that like
massive, bezerk figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, you do. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm still to this day, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to figure out where to put it. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's like, everywhere,
I've like, envisioned it, </garnt>
<garnt> putting it in my room, </garnt>
<garnt> it just doesn't look
right, for some reason. </garnt>
<garnt> And I realize it might be
because I need to have it </garnt>
<garnt> next to a bunch of other figures. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- But the problem is, </garnt>
<connor> my biggest shelf is like,
tucked away in a corner. </connor>
<garnt> So I can't, put it in.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, well fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> I have to like, put this,
like, shit in the living room </garnt>
<connor> or something like...
- Coffee table, </connor>
<connor> - Coffee table. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just take the whole coffee table. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Isn't this like that
fucking, what's that word </connor>
<connor> that's used to describe </connor>
<joey> how the energy of a room is dictated by-- </joey>
<joey> - Feng Shui.
- Feng Shui. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm trying to figure out the Feng Shui </joey>
<joey> of my giant Beserk. </joey>
<joey> - As a kid, I'm just
like, "This is stupid." </joey>
<joey> That they're like, </joey>
<joey> you can just put things
and it doesn't matter. </joey>
<connor> Now I've realized, </connor>
<joey> "Well, my mood is affected
by how my room looks." </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, why is... </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't go that
far personally, for me, </connor>
<joey> I'm like,
(Connor mumbling) </joey>
<joey> - Feng Shui, though it does
get pretty ridiculous at times. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's like you'll get bad luck if the-- </connor>
<connor> - Some of that is
ridiculous, but I don't know, </connor>
<connor> even like my bedroom, </connor>
<joey> 'cause like, I sleep better now, </joey>
<joey> because our bedroom is
orientated differently </joey>
<joey> from my old bedroom. </joey>
<joey> And I just realize, oh, </joey>
<joey> it's just 'cause of where it is </joey>
<joey> in relation to where the
window is and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Where was it before?
- Huh? </joey>
<joey> - Was it not near a window last time? </joey>
<joey> - No, it wasn't. </joey>
<joey> It was like on the opposite
side of the window. </joey>
<joey> (Joey snickering) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That probably
wouldn't have helped. </joey>
<connor> - Generally, I think,
seeing light outside is, </connor>
<joey> make your brain happier.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Normally, brain like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - For me like, 'cause back
then, I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Where can the bed take up </connor>
<connor> the most efficient amount of space?" </connor>
<joey> Right in that corner,
right away from the window. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Garnt] I'm just like-- </joey>
<joey> - Well, If you have room
to put it in the middle, </joey>
<connor> you put it in the middle, right? </connor>
<connor> But then that's like, </connor>
<connor> that's like a big brain
saying, like, "I have space." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, that's a flex. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, these
other sides of the beds. </joey>
<joey> I don't even need them. </joey>
<joey> Nothing needs to go there. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna put the bed in the middle. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I know, it's weird. </connor>
<joey> This is the first time I've actually like, </joey>
<joey> try to, think about this,
rather than just like, going-- </joey>
<joey> - Man discovers interior design. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, man discovers interior design. </connor>
<connor> - For me it was like, "Oh man,
I got more space on my wall, </connor>
<garnt> guess I'll buy more JoJo prints. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll buy double. </garnt>
<garnt> So now I have double the
JoJo prints on my walls. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> But I've got a nice,
really cool wall of JoJos, </connor>
<connor> it's really nice. </connor>
<joey> - What have you done with,
like, the rest of your merch </joey>
<joey> that you built up, at your place? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, this is JoJo?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's all on one like four-shelf rack. </joey>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - Managed to place it, </connor>
<connor> and then I put like the
anti-earthquake things </connor>
<connor> in the figures that fall over. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah. </connor>
<connor> I managed to somehow get it all in, </connor>
<connor> but then I've got a bunch of
other stuff in other cupboards </connor>
<garnt> that I can't like, display. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I have like, a
really big, wooden, oak box </garnt>
<connor> filled with the Jojo ties,
- [Garnt] Oh, right, right. </connor>
<garnt> - Separate and like neat and presentable. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But there's nowhere to put it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like,
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't just put it on the floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the Jojo ties, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this can't go on the floor, you're insane? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lose its value. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - Exactly, I own 14 or
15 something JoJo ties. </joey>
<joey> - Literally, every JoJo
tie that's ever been made. </joey>
<connor> - I actually don't, there's like 24. </connor>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<connor> - And I have all of the
ones from part four, </connor>
<connor> which is 12 ties in total.
- Holy shit. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's 12. </connor>
<connor> So there's 12 ties from part four, </connor>
<connor> and I think there's like eight
or something from part five. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't buy all of them from part five. </connor>
<joey> - You know like when are your kid, </joey>
<joey> when you'd see that documentary
about that guy or girl, </joey>
<connor> who would collect like
Barbie dolls and Ken dolls? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> You've become that, but
just with Jojo, man. </connor>
<connor> - I have not, don't you dare. </connor>
<garnt> No, 'cause they-- </garnt>
<joey> - Fast forward to like Connor in 50 years. </joey>
<connor> - They would go around,
they would dress up like Ken </connor>
<connor> and be like, "I'm Ken." </connor>
<garnt> And they'd be like, "Please call me Ken." </garnt>
<garnt> - You literally, you carry where you go, </garnt>
<garnt> you have a fucking JoJo suit. </garnt>
<garnt> - You wear a JoJo suit. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, come on, that's, dude. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the only
piece of dress you own. </connor>
<connor> - This is the meme where it's
like, we are not the same. </connor>
<connor> You wear a Ken outfit, I wear a Jojo suit. </connor>
<connor> We're not the same. </connor>
<connor> Garnt wipes his ass, </connor>
<connor> I pressure wash my ass, we
are not the same, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Don't compare, right? </connor>
<connor> Don't compare me to those
fucking people who cosplay. </connor>
<connor> We are not the same. </connor>
<connor> I wear drip, they wear
outfits, it's not the same. </connor>
<joey> - Wearing one suits, everywhere you go, </joey>
<connor> does not count as drip. </connor>
<connor> Everyone looks good in suits. </connor>
<connor> - Five suits Garnt, five-- </connor>
<joey> - Everyone looks good in a fucking suit. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone looks good in a suit. </joey>
<garnt> - Not, no, they don't, no they don't, bro. </garnt>
<joey> No, they don't. </joey>
<joey> - You'd have to be something
like really, really bad </joey>
<joey> to fuck up looking good in the suit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You could, you could do it.
(Garnt chuckling) </garnt>
<garnt> - Do it.
- How? </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me think about that.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Look bad in general, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - Just be really ugly. </connor>
<joey> - Just get a bad-fitting suit, </joey>
<connor> but if-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you know, you get
one too long, too short. </connor>
<joey> - Wear your dad's suit,
that's pretty much-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, wear your dad's suit. </joey>
<joey> - But if it's fitted then
everyone looks good, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I guess.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Gee, I don't wanna concede
this point, 'cause-- </connor>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause then I'm admitting
its the power of the suits. </connor>
<connor> - I am sticking by this point, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I can't remember, someone did like, </joey>
<joey> an Anituber drip tier list or something. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't remember who it was. </garnt>
<joey> I remember you were like... </joey>
<joey> - I think, Mudan did one, right? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think it was Mudan, </joey>
<joey> 'cause whoever this person--
- Oh, the first one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the first one, </joey>
<garnt> whoever this person was like,
put Connor in like S-tier. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> Connor does not deserve to
go in fucking S-tier drip, </joey>
<joey> he just wears one fucking Jojo suit, </joey>
<joey> and calls it a day. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone is blinded by the
Jojo suit, that is not drip. </joey>
<joey> - And I just say, it should be, </joey>
<connor> it's a good suit, it looks-- </connor>
<joey> - If everyone had a Jojo suit,
everyone would be in S-tier. </joey>
<connor> - Well then everyone should
get a JoJo suit, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - That's not drip. </joey>
<joey> - Just you wait. </joey>
<joey> - I want to start a charity service </joey>
<joey> to give everyone a JoJo suit
to move you down the drip tier. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's how much I care about this shit. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah, I saw that, I saw that-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna come back in a
few weeks with more drip. </joey>
<joey> - I saw that TLS video, </joey>
<joey> and when they put Connor on
S-Tier because of the JoJo suit, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, this man
literally is in a S-tier </garnt>
<garnt> while wearing an Emia like shirt. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, how the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna say, you're gonna tell me </joey>
<joey> the same fucking Emia shirts that he wears </joey>
<garnt> on like every other week of Trash Taste </garnt>
<garnt> puts him in S-tier on drip. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is...
- I'm leaving. </garnt>
<connor> - That is-- </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, I got fucking
B-tier compared to this pawn, </joey>
<connor> compared to this person. </connor>
<connor> - Boy, you are B-tier drip,
man, get off my S-tier. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, what's worse is that </joey>
<joey> I was also S-tier but
I worked for my shit. </joey>
<garnt> I actually have like a
wardrobe full of shit </garnt>
<joey> and I get beaten by one JoJo suit, </joey>
<joey> which I also have. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, which we all fucking heard. </connor>
<connor> - You should get five
then, shouldn't you Garnt? </connor>
<joey> And then we'll talk. </joey>
<joey> You have one JoJo suit, I have five, </joey>
<connor> we are not the same, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - The weeb standard of drip is so low </joey>
<connor> that's what I wanted to add. </connor>
<connor> - It's 'cause-- </connor>
<joey> - I'm not normally salty
but that day I was salty. </joey>
<connor> - That was the day, when I
was like, "What this fuck?" </connor>
<garnt> - This is my confirmation
that weebs do not have drip. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every time I post
pictures in the Jojo suit, </garnt>
<garnt> the perfect suit factory,
the maker of the suit, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> posts it to their Instagram. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do they actually?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At least twice they've done it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Oh, okay, cheers." </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> They're like, "Look, this is drip." </garnt>
<garnt> - See, the makers of the suit agree. </garnt>
<connor> I should be, I am drip. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think they post--
- They made the suit. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think they re-posting it </joey>
<garnt> because they think it's drip, </garnt>
<joey> I think they're re-posting it
because they fucking made it. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, </joey>
<connor> they're re-posting 'cause
they're like, "Shit, man." </connor>
<joey> - They're like this post got viral. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - We buy wierd Daiso socks </garnt>
<garnt> and put it up on an Instagram post. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure Daiso would re-tweet it. </garnt>
<garnt> And they won't say, "This is drip." </garnt>
<connor> They'll say thank you for buying
our fucking 100 Yen socks. </connor>
<connor> - All right, let's watch
it happen then, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> Well, no, I'm not going to go-- </connor>
<garnt> - Why not? </garnt>
<joey> No, no.
- I don't wear Daiso socks. </joey>
<joey> - You all wish, I'll buy you a pair. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck Daiso socks, its
all about the Family Mart. </joey>
<joey> - It's all about the fucking Family Mart. </joey>
<joey> - Are you wearing it now? </joey>
<joey> - It's all about the Family Mart socks. </joey>
<joey> - Have we ever talked about this before? </joey>
<joey> - No.
- [Joey] I don't know. </joey>
<joey> So Joey and Garnt came to me
one day and they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Have you worn Family Mart socks before?" </joey>
<connor> Family Mart socks, which
is a convenience store, </connor>
<connor> obviously, in Japan.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "No, why would
I wear Family Mart socks?" </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they were amazing. </connor>
<connor> - And then they were like, </connor>
<connor> "They're the most
comfortable socks on earth". </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "All right, okay." </connor>
<connor> - So one of my gaijin friends living here, </connor>
<connor> like, told me about this, </connor>
<connor> like, revelation being
like, "Have you heard?" </connor>
<garnt> He came to me like fucking
Jehovah's Witnesses, </garnt>
<garnt> like, "Have you heard of
the Family Mart socks?" </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "No, please do tell" . </garnt>
<connor> And they're like, I
think, like the 400 yens, </connor>
<connor> it was like three, four
bucks, for a pair of socks. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "How good
could a $4 pair of socks be </garnt>
<garnt> at a convenience store of all places?" </garnt>
<garnt> Wore it, felt like I was floating, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> Literally, and then I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I have to tell, it was
like, I am totally into it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, you got turned into a, like, </joey>
<garnt> a Jehovah's witness.
- Yeah, I was converted. </garnt>
<garnt> - He starts preaching to me about this. </garnt>
<garnt> I was around his house, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I was around his house, </garnt>
<garnt> I would play Mahjong, and
he starts preaching to me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, it's just
fucking socks, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> Aki comes back with
like five pairs of socks </joey>
<joey> then he goes, "Yeah, I'll
give you one for free." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I don't need
this, it's a pair of socks." </joey>
<joey> - It's literally the
guy giving the Bibles, </joey>
<joey> just give it a go. </joey>
<joey> What am I gonna do with this? </joey>
<garnt> And I remember I got home and
put it on when the corner. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember we had a Trash
Taste recording the other day, </garnt>
<garnt> and I hadn't done my
washing the day before, </garnt>
<garnt> I opened my drawer,
empty sock drawer, except </garnt>
<garnt> for the one Family Mart sock,
and he always, he was just, </garnt>
<joey> he was just staring me in
the face and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh fine, I'll wear
the Family Mart socks." </joey>
<joey> And like, there's this one
scene from "Rick and Morty" </joey>
<joey> where Rick gives Morty like
the perfectly flats piece </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> of land, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you remember that scene? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember where. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where it's like perfectly
flat and Morty's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, what is this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, it's just perfectly funny." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He steps on it, and he
literally starts coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> And I was like, "Oh, it's
just fucking so, so good, </garnt>
<joey> how good could this be?" </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> And I put it on and I'm just
like, "Oh, it fits so snugly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's hugging my feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this feeling? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this, cotton? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so soft." </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> It's like I'm walking on ship right now. </joey>
<joey> What is this?" </joey>
<joey> And I answer, and I text Joey, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Fuck you." </joey>
<joey> But I was like, I have
done, I have converted it. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know why it feels so smooth </garnt>
<joey> and so silky smooth on your skin. </joey>
<joey> - I can't wear any of those socks. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like a thousand
kisses on your feet. </joey>
<connor> - My favorite pair of socks,
I bought two years ago, </connor>
<connor> it's from Lawson's. </connor>
<connor> Telling you, they do a black pair </connor>
<connor> of socks and they are like
the cleanest socks I own. </connor>
<joey> - Are they as good as
the Family Mart socks? </joey>
<connor> - I think they're better. </connor>
<joey> I bought these socks, for two years, </joey>
<joey> I've been washing them. </joey>
<joey> - We have the Family
Mart gospel right now. </joey>
<joey> - They have not lost their
like, their firmness, </joey>
<joey> they haven't worn out at all. </joey>
<joey> You know, as soon as you
get socks to go crinkly </joey>
<joey> and they go hard after a
while when you wash them </joey>
<joey> because they've been used so much, </joey>
<joey> these socks, fucking warriors, bro. </joey>
<joey> They're like day one,
they look no different. </joey>
<joey> These socks are amazing. </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) mad brother,
but he's just lost his way. </joey>
<garnt> He's lost his way, we will guide
you to the right direction. </garnt>
<garnt> You guys give me a pair of Family Mart, </garnt>
<joey> I'll give you guys pair of
the Lawson's blacks I have, </joey>
<connor> you'll see. </connor>
<joey> - Trash Taste sock rating. </joey>
<connor> - You'll see, these socks are impeccable. </connor>
<connor> - It's so insane because
I remember walking </connor>
<connor> into a Family Mart in Tokyo the other day, </connor>
<connor> and they literally had a table just </connor>
<joey> for the Family Mart socks by themselves, </joey>
<joey> which just shows how far
the gospel was spread. </joey>
<joey> They've literally got a table, front </joey>
<joey> and center in the combination. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's because they're
probably always sold out. </joey>
<joey> Like every, I think
I've been to about four </joey>
<connor> or five different Family
Marts, after I'd try the socks, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "I have to get more." </connor>
<connor> So I was like scouting around Tokyo. </connor>
<joey> I swear, for the first
four or five Family Marts, </joey>
<joey> they were all sold out. </joey>
<connor> - I'm curious, what made you
buy them in the first place? </connor>
<joey> - It's just like a thing that started </joey>
<joey> with like, guidance living in Japan. </joey>
<joey> Like one, yeah, one of the
foreign is those leaving key, </joey>
<joey> like, posted on Twitter about like, </joey>
<joey> trying out these Family Mart socks, </joey>
<joey> and then it kind of just
spread like wildfire from it. </joey>
<joey> And then it made its way to me. </joey>
<connor> - [Man Off Camera] Yeah,
it's the Family Mart socks </connor>
<joey> and the pumpkin spice latte combo. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's right. </joey>
<joey> - And what was pumpkin spice latte got </joey>
<joey> to do with these? </joey>
<garnt> - [Man Off Camera] Starbucks,
it's a Gaijin thing. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, because pumpkin
spice lattes in the spot. </joey>
<joey> - Spice latte has only just
now become really massive </joey>
<garnt> in Japan because of the (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> And I guess the same thing happened </garnt>
<garnt> with the Family Mart socks, </garnt>
<joey> and so everyone was like, "All right, </joey>
<joey> let me tell you full
bucks, I'll try it out." </joey>
<connor> And then the gospel spread. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "This is, I'm pretty sure </joey>
<joey> this is how religion stuff (laughs). </joey>
<connor> - Through (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - Says it's good, and
then the rest follow. </garnt>
<joey> - One sock at a time, religion spread. </joey>

<joey> Fuck you, Garnt (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Going back on the topic
of watching stuff though. </garnt>
<garnt> So as I have been watching anime again, </garnt>
<joey> I wanted to know if you have
had the same experience, </joey>
<joey> where do the subtitles
actively distract you now </joey>
<joey> from like, what's going on? </joey>
<joey> - In English? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, if you have English subtitles on. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes, I can turn
off the part of my brain </connor>
<joey> that's trying to listen to the Japanese. </joey>
<connor> I can just ignore that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like, I, because like I, </connor>
<connor> this was the first time
I started watching anime </connor>
<connor> for my video, and of
course, I turn on subtitles </connor>
<connor> because I had to understand
what was going on, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've been watching anime as </connor>
<joey> for like a long period of
time without subtitles, </joey>
<joey> and it was so weird turning it back on </joey>
<joey> because it like actively,
I actually dislike it now, </joey>
<joey> it actively distracts me
from what's going on-- </joey>
<connor> - (indistinct) any anime
with subtitles now. </connor>
<joey> - I'm trying not to. </joey>
<connor> - You have become next level (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, trying to watch as much anime </joey>
<joey> without subtitle subtitles on. </joey>
<joey> I was like, because like, </joey>
<joey> what I've realized is that it actually, </joey>
<joey> it actively hurts your
language learning process </joey>
<joey> if you have English subtitles on well, </joey>
<joey> or at least here's the way-- </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - Here's the way I see it, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause say you have like
a Japanese sentence, </joey>
<joey> or hear a Japanese sentence </joey>
<joey> and you want the English
translation of that. </joey>
<garnt> If the translator for the
subtitle is doing their job, </garnt>
<garnt> they would have translated
what they're saying </garnt>
<garnt> into natural English, so
that it sounds natural. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas when I'm trying to learn Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm trying to process
the Japanese in my head, </garnt>
<garnt> what I've read in the subtitles, </garnt>
<garnt> and what's being said are
like all the same things, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's different. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I would actually, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I realized this where I
think it would be more useful </garnt>
<garnt> for me if I had Google
translated subtitles </garnt>
<joey> than an actual, like
professionally translated subtitle. </joey>
<joey> Because when I'm going back
and I'm trying to understand </joey>
<joey> something and I read the
official translation, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Well, yeah,
that," and I, you know, </joey>
<joey> I do my work to translate it. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Yeah, that's what's being said, </joey>
<joey> but that's not how I think
about that sentence being heard </joey>
<joey> in my brain. </joey>
<joey> - But that's also like the problem, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that I think at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> like, so much of it is nuanced </joey>
<garnt> because grammatically
it's just so different. </garnt>
<joey> A lot of it is just completely, </joey>
<joey> I've read some subtitles where
it's just being completely </joey>
<garnt> lost in translation because
there are just some things. </garnt>
<garnt> So some phrases and ways
of saying a sentence </garnt>
<garnt> and the way of describing something </garnt>
<garnt> that is so specifically Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> that if the translator
tries to translate it </garnt>
<garnt> without the translator notes,
you have to explain it, </garnt>
<garnt> then it just becomes like, </garnt>
<garnt> it becomes so nuance to the
point that it almost becomes </garnt>
<garnt> like a subjective
translation where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I personally think this is
what they're trying to say, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not true. </garnt>
<garnt> A hundred percent the same. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel that if people
try and use that as a way </garnt>
<garnt> to learn grammar, then they're
going to get one nuanced way </garnt>
<joey> of learning it, which
is not exactly accurate. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, when I was
watching the American films </connor>
<garnt> I've seen in Japan, they
have the Japanese subtitles </garnt>
<garnt> and it's really interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, it is. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm like, that would be </connor>
<connor> like, a really heavy amount of slang, </connor>
<connor> and I'll just translate it
into something extremely simple </connor>
<garnt> and mundane, but it doesn't really convey </garnt>
<garnt> the situation (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> But obviously, it works
all the way around as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, I watch, actually, </garnt>
<connor> you know it's quite helpful
watching Japanese TV, </connor>
<connor> because they have subtitles in Japanese </connor>
<connor> on the screen every goddamn two seconds, </connor>
<connor> rip editors, but yeah, </connor>
<garnt> they have the subtitles on
screen and I find it way easier </garnt>
<garnt> to watch Japanese stuff
with Japanese subtitles. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I know, I know
a fair amount of Kanji, </garnt>
<garnt> like basic stuff, so I
can normally kind of, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> it really helps me solidify the sentence. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> Because often I just, I'm just intaking </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't see anything
to kind of like lay it out. </garnt>
<connor> And when I'm hearing stuff
and I can see the line, </connor>
<connor> I can kind of be like, "Oh,
that's what he's saying." </connor>
<connor> Because there's some words
that can mean like, you know, </connor>
<connor> like, you wanna say
tata, like source tata, </connor>
<connor> but then like tata can mean
like so many different things </connor>
<connor> in so many different contexts. </connor>
<connor> If when there could be like advice, right? </connor>
<garnt> It could be like a recommendation of like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, you should do this right. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's really confusing because sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> if you stop paying
attention for one second </garnt>
<garnt> and then you hear something like tata, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you're panicking, </garnt>
<connor> figuring out what way
they're using this word, </connor>
<connor> that could mean so many things. </connor>
<connor> And so it's really confusing, </connor>
<connor> but then having the subtitles in Japanese, </connor>
<connor> oh, okay, well, I just saw the first part, </connor>
<connor> like, glanced at the second part, like, </connor>
<connor> I can figure out what's going on. </connor>
<connor> - I think every language
is like that though. </connor>
<connor> Even in English, where it's
like the word of, for instance, </connor>
<garnt> it can mean a million
different things depending </garnt>
<garnt> on the sentence. </garnt>
<garnt> And Japanese, I think is just
like a little more difficult </garnt>
<garnt> because you know it again,
like unlike in English, </garnt>
<garnt> where there is spaces between words </garnt>
<garnt> that clearly distinguished
between what this word means, </garnt>
<garnt> versus what this next word means, </garnt>
<garnt> in Japanese, we don't have that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just one continuous flow. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember the first
time I saw like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I opened like a Japanese light novel </garnt>
<garnt> or something and I'm just like,
"This fucking terrifies me." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's just one continuous line of text, </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, "What's--" </joey>
<joey> - The only thing that stops
it is a comma or a period. </joey>
<garnt> And then everything else
is still so nonstop. </garnt>
<joey> - I've never thought I
could get terrified by it, </joey>
<joey> like, just letters before, </joey>
<joey> until I opened like a
Japanese novel, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "This is just one line,
where's the separation?" </joey>
<joey> Come on guys." </joey>
<joey> - I feel like this is
a very small nitpick. </joey>
<joey> You know how? </joey>
<garnt> Because obviously in Japanese, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The subject comes first. </garnt>
<garnt> So more often than not when
they're like explaining </garnt>
<garnt> like plot twists in anime, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so hard to like hype it up </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> because the subject comes first, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like, gone, the
killer or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the killer was
gone, it's always like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - Actually, in Japanese, we can do that. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, we can do that way. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, for example, like, </garnt>
<garnt> Moda mystery stories in
Japanese do this a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, normally
if someone were to say like </garnt>
<connor> you're the culprit, in English,
we can do the same thing, </connor>
<connor> you can say the culprit is you, </connor>
<connor> or you're the culprit, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like, the same thing in Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> if I were to say "You're
the culprit," in that order, </garnt>
<connor> that'd be (speaks in Japanese)
versus (speaks in Japanese). </connor>
<joey> You're the culprit. </joey>
<joey> - Which one sounds more natural though? </joey>
<joey> Because like-- </joey>
<joey> - They're both natural. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, because what I noticed
about English is that-- </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just source of Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but what I've
noticed is that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the translation, it,
with translating the Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> like natural English or some
English that reads naturally, </garnt>
<garnt> like, sometimes you can get </garnt>
<garnt> the same meaning across in English, </garnt>
<garnt> it just sounds really Jahnke. </garnt>
<garnt> And especially with how
the sentence structure, </garnt>
<garnt> and the Japanese grammar is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sounds like languages are
like nothing alike, fudge. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not every language is like English. </garnt>
<garnt> - As like learning the second, </garnt>
<garnt> because like, obviously,
we've all had second languages </garnt>
<joey> that we've never really learned </joey>
<joey> as learning like a third language </joey>
<joey> for you made you appreciate
(indistinct) more. </joey>
<joey> - A hundred percent. </joey>
<joey> - A hundred percent. </joey>
<garnt> Straight up, no, not really
like, yeah, for sure. </garnt>
<garnt> I took it for granted,
but then again, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I also feel like God, I've like, </garnt>
<garnt> I never, ever wanted to learn, in my mind, </garnt>
<garnt> I always have the mindset
of like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I know this is very close
minded, but I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna not speak English, </garnt>
<garnt> I already hate the language,
I thought that way. </garnt>
<connor> And I still, to this day,
I hate learning languages. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I'm fucking tryna learn a third. </connor>
<connor> What's up with that? </connor>
<connor> What's up with that, man? </connor>
<connor> - I wanna learn a third language, </connor>
<connor> I just don't really
have the time right now. </connor>
<connor> - The problem is that you
won't like, (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> unless you're like one of those
people who's just obsessed </connor>
<connor> with languages and learning them. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I feel like you will
only learn the other language </garnt>
<garnt> if you need to, which is the
only reason why I'm doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I'm finally at a point </garnt>
<garnt> where I know people like online, </garnt>
<garnt> there was one, there are
high Japanese and stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's so hard to convey
how your Japanese is </garnt>
<garnt> when you don't need to speak it. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna speak it online sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's embarrassing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, Chris will always try
and get my fucking Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> I know why Chris is fucking doing it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause he wants to feel
good about his Japanese. </connor>
<connor> Motherfucker, 'cause
obviously, Chris's Japanese </connor>
<connor> is better than mine, like-- </connor>
<connor> - Not by much though. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I see Chris, he has no problem </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> in conveying a lot of like, thoughts. </connor>
<joey> - When I'm with him, </joey>
<garnt> he'll do anything he can
to not speak Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the same thing. </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) I wanna
do it in front of you </connor>
<connor> because it's embarrassing. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he's gonna feel like
I've been here for eight years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I should speak better. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> And like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever amount you wanna
learn, you can learn. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though I wanna get better, </garnt>
<garnt> I've gotten to a point now
where I can pretty much do </garnt>
<garnt> everything, except for
government documents. </garnt>
<garnt> Everything is not problem-- </garnt>
<connor> - I can barely do that. </connor>
<garnt> - I can go to the bank, </garnt>
<connor> that's how I know my
fluency is increasing. </connor>
<connor> As somebody who came here
literally knowing nothing, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty proud of where I've
come from, how far I've come. </connor>
<connor> But like, you know, it is,
again, it fucking sucks online. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause people expect you to
like, reach a certain level </joey>
<connor> by a certain time. </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes I forget what? </joey>
<joey> Sometimes I forget a
word that I should know, </joey>
<connor> sometimes I forgot an easy word. </connor>
<connor> - I'm exactly the same, </connor>
<joey> where like it's I was putting in hours, </joey>
<joey> like, every single day for
like, a good, like two, </joey>
<connor> three month periods. </connor>
<joey> And then I went back to England, </joey>
<joey> and it's like going to the
gym where you build up this, </joey>
<connor> you build up this routine
and you're like, great, </connor>
<connor> "I'm doing this routine." </connor>
<connor> And then something comes along
to fuck over that routine, </connor>
<connor> and then like, it just
cascades and you miss a day </connor>
<connor> and then you miss two days </connor>
<connor> and then you miss a week and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, now I'm starting
to forget (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> Like, that's where I'm at now </connor>
<connor> where like, I was making
such good progress, </connor>
<connor> and then I went to New England,
and then it just cascaded, </connor>
<joey> and I'm like, trying to
have to put the effort </joey>
<joey> in to relearn some of the
stuff that I knew before, </joey>
<joey> and now I've just forgotten </joey>
<joey> because I wasn't putting the
active hours in every day. </joey>
<connor> - I have, speaking of gym, </connor>
<garnt> I have really fucking
struggled to get back into it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it is hard. </garnt>
<garnt> I forgot how hard it was
to get back into the gym </garnt>
<connor> if you fall out because you know, </connor>
<connor> when you're going every week, </connor>
<connor> you don't really get
sore the next day much. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't really happen </connor>
<garnt> because you're pretty
eating the right thing, </garnt>
<garnt> your body's used to you doing it, </garnt>
<garnt> and like, I rarely got like very sore. </garnt>
<garnt> Now when I go, I'm sore
for like four days, </garnt>
<garnt> because I haven't gone a month. </garnt>
<garnt> So you combine that with like,
also having a busy schedule, </garnt>
<garnt> and I wanna go more, </garnt>
<garnt> but you need to go at least once a week </garnt>
<garnt> or more to kind of build it up, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But now if I'm sore for four days, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna go for these four days. </garnt>
<connor> And I gotta pray that
my schedule isn't full </connor>
<connor> on the other two days that
I'm able, and I want to go. </connor>
<connor> But of course, life isn't like that, </connor>
<connor> and most of the time, I'm doing something, </connor>
<connor> I've got to go somewhere for shoots, </connor>
<connor> so it's like, fuck man, I'm really trying </connor>
<connor> to get back into this, </connor>
<joey> but it is so goddamn hard to get back </joey>
<joey> into the gym as an adult
when you fall out of it, </joey>
<joey> it is so difficult, because
most people just aren't used </joey>
<joey> to making a lot of time for it. </joey>
<joey> And it's something that I
will not empty my schedule </joey>
<garnt> to go to the gym. </garnt>
<garnt> To me, it's like, I
know I should exercise, </garnt>
<garnt> I enjoy it. </garnt>
<connor> I really love going, but I
wanna do everything else first, </connor>
<joey> I wanna prioritize my work first, </joey>
<joey> and then I'll go to the gym. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's just being an adult. </joey>
<connor> - Have you signed up to a gym? </connor>
<connor> - I have them not signed up to a gym. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, like-- </joey>
<joey> - Are you going to? </joey>
<garnt> - Probably not. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of had this realization
where the little free time </garnt>
<garnt> that we have to work with, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm either gonna go to the
gym or I'm gonna use that </garnt>
<garnt> to learn Japanese. And I chose, </garnt>
<garnt> I made the active choice to be like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to put whatever free time I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into learning Japanese, that's my choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I'm not, like I, before
I was like, "I can do both, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got time to do both,"
and then what I realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that I didn't have time to do both, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And by trying to do both, I didn't either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I knew I needed to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> 'cause the thing is, either
with gym or language learning, </garnt>
<garnt> I think discipline is
the most important thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, the idea is nice, </garnt>
<garnt> if I could go into the gym
every week or every day, </garnt>
<garnt> or putting an hour of whatever you want </garnt>
<garnt> into learning Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not gonna happen
if you're not gonna like, </garnt>
<garnt> commit to it. </garnt>
<garnt> And you need to just be
like strict with yourself </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, "This is
going to go beyond me," </garnt>
<joey> just having this idea of I
wanting to do this thing, </joey>
<joey> and me just putting in
like the real hours to it. </joey>
<connor> - I think one thing that I, took this </connor>
<connor> from (indistinct) as well. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Is what he said. </connor>
<garnt> And honestly, it really resonated with me. </garnt>
<garnt> He said that like, he goes
to the gym a bunch, right, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously, because he's
an absolute human machine. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) on this man
is literally like, insane. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, and I, and to this day, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I still firmly believe this. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "Even if you have
the shittest day on earth, </garnt>
<garnt> if you go to the gym and you work out, </garnt>
<garnt> you've done something. </garnt>
<garnt> You've actively feel like
you've made some progress </garnt>
<garnt> on something. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, you know, work
doesn't have to go right, </garnt>
<garnt> your relationships don't have to go right, </garnt>
<garnt> but at least you had that
one thing that you've done </garnt>
<garnt> that was good for you. </garnt>
<garnt> And to be honest, when you go to the gym, </garnt>
<garnt> like, the one thing I
really loved about it, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> and this is part of the
reason I go is 'cause the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I like to go in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really like going at night, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not really my thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I go to the gym in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the rest of the day is like, amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, my energy is high, I feel great, </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> the next, I sleep well, </garnt>
<garnt> I normally have a good
next day too, as well. </garnt>
<connor> So I just find that
everything improves when I go, </connor>
<connor> that's why I do like going,
the fuck is it hard to do it? </connor>
<joey> - I like, this year, I opted
to get up at like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> around like, eight or 9:00 AM, 9:00 AM-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll be doing that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - And even if I got
barely any fucking sleep </garnt>
<garnt> the night before, even if I
went to bed at like 3:00 AM, </garnt>
<connor> I always try and get up at
least like, 9:00 AM latest, </connor>
<connor> just because I know that in
between 9:00 AM and lunch, </connor>
<garnt> if I get something done before lunch, </garnt>
<connor> I feel fucking amazing. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "I got something
done, it's just lunchtime." </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - It's such a simple life hack where like, </garnt>
<garnt> waking up early-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Wake up early. </garnt>
<joey> - (indistinct) Y'all you'll feel better </joey>
<garnt> if you wake up early. </garnt>
<garnt> As a kid, I'm like, "Shut
up, let me stay up till--" </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck you. </garnt>
<joey> - "Let me stay up till 5:00
AM playing video games, </joey>
<garnt> see how that hurts me." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> I know, who knew that it hurts you? </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - It hurts you, oh, it hurts. </joey>
<connor> - But the one good thing about, </connor>
<connor> there's two sides of this coin. </connor>
<connor> So if you are waking up
at nine all the time, </connor>
<garnt> even if you go to bed at like 5:00 AM, </garnt>
<garnt> you have like, a night out, </garnt>
<garnt> you'll probably still wake up at nine, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause your body is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is time to wake up, get up now." </garnt>
<garnt> And I have been, you feel shit all day, </garnt>
<garnt> but at least you still
maintain the sleep schedule, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> But on the other side,
I remember when I used </garnt>
<garnt> to wake up at like one or 2:00 PM, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not my proudest of days. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we've all been there, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would wake up at this time. </garnt>
<garnt> One good thing was that,
one, I normally just like, </garnt>
<connor> didn't eat as much. </connor>
<joey> I found that when I'm awake
all day, I'm eating a lot more, </joey>
<joey> that's good or bad. </joey>
<connor> - I wonder why. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I'm just having more shit to do. </joey>
<garnt> I would eat less, 'cause
I would just eat a meal </garnt>
<connor> at like, eight and then I
would go to bed at 4:00 AM. </connor>
<garnt> But the other thing is when
I go out with my friends </garnt>
<garnt> and we're going drinking, </garnt>
<connor> I'm getting really tired by like 10. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Fuck, (indistinct)." </connor>
<connor> I remember when I would
wake up at two, we went out, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, 4:00 AM, "Are you both good? </connor>
<connor> I'm still good to go, man,
let's go to this party, </connor>
<garnt> let's keep going." </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone's like, "Oh,
I'm so tired, I gotta go, </garnt>
<garnt> I got work tomorrow." </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Let's keep
going, let's keep partying." </connor>
<garnt> And then now I'm that guy who's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Dude, it's like 9:00 PM,
man, I gotta get back soon." </garnt>
<garnt> You know, sad, man, I
can't, it's so hard for me-- </garnt>
<connor> - I remember when I first, like, </connor>
<connor> when we first started coming to Japan, </connor>
<joey> like, me and Joey had this
thing, where every time </joey>
<connor> I would come, we would do
like Oni karaoke, every time, </connor>
<connor> every single fucking time. </connor>
<connor> - Like, twice a week. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, we're gonna have to do
that when people come here. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God, can we go in the morning </garnt>
<joey> and just go all the way
until like 10:00 PM in this? </joey>
<joey> - I hope he's right. </joey>
<connor> Content creators who wanna
come on Trash Tastes, </connor>
<garnt> your (indistinct) on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a very, very small
amount of people watching this. </garnt>
<garnt> If you come here, please, don't all come </garnt>
<garnt> at the same time, I'm begging, please. </garnt>
<connor> - We're gonna die. </connor>
<garnt> - It's gonna happen though,
when the country opens up, </garnt>
<connor> there's just gonna be a,
like a mass fucking people </connor>
<joey> just coming in the country. </joey>
<connor> - I saw people on Twitter
were like, talking, </connor>
<connor> they were like, "Any other
content creators wanna arrange </connor>
<garnt> a trip to Japan with the foot,
when it opens up right away?" </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Please, no." </connor>
<joey> - Come and smoke. </joey>
<garnt> - At let's not do the all
night karaoke, 'cause like, </garnt>
<garnt> man, that morning, that train home </garnt>
<garnt> or that taxi home or that, whatever, </garnt>
<joey> however the fuck you get home, </joey>
<joey> is like the most depressing
thing in the world. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, when I was coming back
from your housewarming party, </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like, 2:00 AM on a taxi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "God, I wanna die." </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> It was the most depressing
taxi I've been on in so long. </joey>
<joey> - There's just something about
going home after a night out, </joey>
<joey> when you can see the
sun, that is just like-- </joey>
<joey> - That is like, "What am I doing?" </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, you're walking in the streets </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone else is going to work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you're like, "Look
at all these people </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> with an adequate amount of
sleep in their body, fuck them." </garnt>
<joey> - I feel homeless. </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like a homeless
man roaming the streets. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, yeah, I remember that, </joey>
<garnt> I used to go out to like 4:00
AM when I first came here. </garnt>
<garnt> I liked that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was good times. </garnt>
<joey> - Those fun times, but-- </joey>
<joey> - I can still do it, I got it, </joey>
<joey> like, everyone's got to agree. </joey>
<joey> - It needs to be like, to
me, like, we used to do it </joey>
<joey> on a whim, but now I'm
like, it needs to be. </joey>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - We all got to agree, we're
like, this is a hard one, boy. </connor>
<connor> We're going hard, we're
all gonna get drunk. </connor>
<connor> - I got to like go to sleep
really early the night before </connor>
<garnt> so I can get like enough sleep </garnt>
<garnt> before my waking up at 8:00 AM. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - No, because like, for me, </joey>
<joey> I luckily, like, if I want to stay up, </joey>
<garnt> I can stay up really easily, </garnt>
<garnt> but what that just means
is I just lose a day. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just, I lose a day
if I stay up late now. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, my actions have consequences. </joey>
<joey> - At every part of-- </joey>
<connor> - Is this motherfucker who's last alive. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> He's always the one up until like seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like to, sometimes I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> I don't really get much
(indistinct) anymore at parties, </garnt>
<connor> I don't really feel
like I have to stay up. </connor>
<connor> Once I'm done, I'm like, "Later, guys," </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> If I'm the first to go to sleep, </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> I'm the first to go to
sleep, no qualms about it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's whatever my body is
saying, I'm like, "Later, guys." </garnt>
<garnt> Especially if I need to
do something the next day </garnt>
<garnt> or they wanna hang out again the next day, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna be awake to like
spend time with you guys. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) I must stay awake. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> - I dunno, it's just when
people are there, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I wish to converse now,
I wish to socialize." </joey>
<connor> - Okay, that I do feel
a bit if (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> If I haven't seen my
friends in ages, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I really want to talk to you, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm so tired, so I'm gonna go to bed." </garnt>
<joey> - Well that's the thing, right? </joey>
<garnt> It's like, if it's just
like a regular night, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, I could stay up </garnt>
<garnt> and do whatever I'm
doing until like 4:00 AM, </garnt>
<garnt> but then I think to myself, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is shit I can just
do tomorrow morning." </garnt>
<joey> So now it's like, "I
don't have to do it now." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, it's different,
like if it's like friends </joey>
<joey> I hadn't seen in a while,
I'll fucking stay up. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that is like the
one exception where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I'll be having be having
(indistinct) like 5:00 AM. </joey>
<joey> It was just like a normal nights out, </joey>
<joey> these lads who I see every week, I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> "Guys, I'm getting a bit tired--" </garnt>
<joey> - "I'm gonna see you next week." </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I'm going to bed, fuck you." </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> - I need a piss quickly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my, God-- </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sorry, I didn't take one last time </joey>
<joey> when we had a long break. </joey>

<joey> Link's down on the description below, </joey>
<joey> come and hang out with us, see you then. </joey>
<joey> - Make sure you hit that Follow button. </joey>
<joey> - Going back to like,
languages and stuff though. </joey>
<joey> Like I did have this thought
and I don't mean to like sound </joey>
<garnt> elitist or gatekeep something else, but-- </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think you can
truly understand the culture </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't like, have
at least like a bit </garnt>
<garnt> of an understanding of the language? </garnt>
<garnt> Because what made me think
this was, learning Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> has really made me appreciate
Thai and Thai culture, </garnt>
<garnt> and made me think about my own language </garnt>
<garnt> or my second language in a way </garnt>
<garnt> that I never thought about before. </garnt>
<garnt> Because to me, learning a
language or like, learning Thai </garnt>
<garnt> was just the way I communicated to my mom, </garnt>
<garnt> and it didn't like, I didn't
internalize just how much </garnt>
<garnt> of my culture was steeped into
my language until I started </garnt>
<garnt> to try learning Japanese. </garnt>
<joey> And you know, like, like we just said, </joey>
<joey> you can translate things, right? </joey>
<joey> You can translate ideas, but one thing </joey>
<joey> that I've found learning Japanese, </joey>
<joey> or like, now I appreciate
in time was like, </joey>
<joey> sometimes it's really hard to
translate a certain feeling </joey>
<joey> you get from a phrase. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's impossible
to learn a language </joey>
<joey> without learning the
culture, and vice versa. </joey>
<connor> - I think you can learn the language </connor>
<connor> without knowing anything
about the culture. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think you can. </joey>
<connor> - I think you can. </connor>
<garnt> - But I mean, what's the point? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you can't, but like, I think, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> of course, you can,
'cause it's a set of rules </garnt>
<connor> and you, you follow them
and you say the words like-- </connor>
<joey> - Because, you know, I did, but like-- </joey>
<connor> - You can teach a robot language, </connor>
<connor> doesn't have to understand
the culture behind it, </connor>
<connor> but it knows-- </connor>
<connor> - That's a robot, what
I'm saying is that like, </connor>
<connor> well, if that can be done,
that shows that, I mean, </connor>
<connor> you don't need to understand the culture. </connor>
<connor> Like you don't have to
understand the culture, </connor>
<garnt> but I think if you
wanna, on the other hand, </garnt>
<garnt> if you wanna understand
more about the culture, </garnt>
<garnt> now your question was
knowing the culture, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I think if you wanna
know more about the culture, </garnt>
<connor> the language is probably
the best way to do it. </connor>
<joey> - I would argue that they
kind of, they go hand in hand. </joey>
<connor> Like I feel because the language
of a country is a culture. </connor>
<connor> So it's like, I feel like,
yes, you could like, you know, </connor>
<connor> as you said, you can
teach a robot Japanese. </connor>
<garnt> And again, you know,
speak back in Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's because that's
a Royal right there. </garnt>
<garnt> It has the one to standing
all the actual language. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel in, you can only
get so far learning a language </garnt>
<joey> without knowing the culture. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and I'm only like
counterpoint to that. </connor>
<garnt> It's like, well, on the
other hand, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> English is constantly changing
as is, as are most languages. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you go back 80 years
and you watch Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> you already don't understand
the Japanese that well. </garnt>
<garnt> Same thing, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> language is a constantly changing thing. </garnt>
<garnt> But language is like culture
as a whole, but in some ways, </garnt>
<joey> culture is a reflection of the language </joey>
<joey> that changes over time. </joey>
<joey> - That's exactly my point, where it's been </joey>
<joey> like such a weird journey
for me learning Japanese </joey>
<connor> and just having, like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like having like a
different part of my mind unlocked </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's so it's so weird. </connor>
<connor> - To charge 1% of his brain. </connor>
<connor> - It's so weird to try to
describe this to someone who has </connor>
<garnt> never tried to learn a language or has, </garnt>
<garnt> or only knows one language. </garnt>
<garnt> You kind of like, even, </garnt>
<garnt> you could kind of even like
think differently with a second </garnt>
<joey> language or like, you know, it's a. </joey>
<joey> - People have told me,
people have told me, </joey>
<connor> I sound different when I speak Japanese. </connor>
<connor> Like I become a totally
different person, but I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I would argue that that's
because the Japanese side of me </connor>
<joey> that speaking Japanese follows
more of the Japanese cultural </joey>
<joey> way of life, </joey>
<joey> which is completely different
to the Australian way of life. </joey>
<joey> - Is there any like Japanese
concepts in language that you </joey>
<joey> think I like have combi translated
all like are difficult to </joey>
<joey> translate? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> Absolutely. I mean like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you know, it's, I
don't think it's just like, </joey>
<garnt> it's not just like one phrase
that can't be translated or </garnt>
<garnt> whatever. I mean, there's lots of, </garnt>
<joey> I would argue that there's a
lot of English words that can't </joey>
<joey> be translated to joy.
That's definitely, but yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Like Boston, for instance. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Oh, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of Japanese woods
that take an entire sentence </garnt>
<garnt> to describe in English. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, you know, there are
some like, especially like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I think the whole thing of like, </garnt>
<garnt> just Kanji especially is
so difficult to translate </garnt>
<garnt> without fully first explaining
what the Kanji even is. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I always found
it interesting that there are </garnt>
<garnt> so many like Japanese, like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> manga anime and stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> that so heavily rely on the
Japanese language and therefore </garnt>
<garnt> the Japanese culture that
have somehow been translated </garnt>
<garnt> and have somehow still
been understood by people </garnt>
<garnt> who have no knowledge of
the language or the culture. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it still baffles my mind, </garnt>
<garnt> how popular the "Monogatari"
series is outside of Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> because that show I've seen the subtitles. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of it gets lost in
translation so hard. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> But somehow people still enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> - Ideas are still there. </connor>
<garnt> Maybe. I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> But I feel that like, you know, it's, </connor>
<connor> it's interesting to see like
how a Japanese person would </connor>
<connor> react to a show like that
versus how a non-Japanese person </connor>
<connor> will react to a show, both
good, both positive outcome, </connor>
<joey> but a completely different
level of understanding of what </joey>
<connor> makes it good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and like the language
also tells the history </connor>
<garnt> of the country. Well,
you know, like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> we have a lot of French words
in English from when France </garnt>
<garnt> had control over England, </garnt>
<garnt> but Japanese has tons of
English words and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it also Japanese have a lot of
words that are like very cute </garnt>
<garnt> sounding to reflect the nature </garnt>
<garnt> of Japanese society right now. </garnt>
<garnt> It all, it all kind of reflects
it in a way that's really </garnt>
<connor> interesting and kind of bizarre, really. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't really make much sense of yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause because I, </connor>
<connor> I realized when I went back
to England and I was speaking, </connor>
<connor> you know, speaking Thai
against my mum there, </connor>
<connor> they were just like some tie
concepts and tie like words </connor>
<connor> that I just didn't know </connor>
<connor> couldn't be translated into English, </connor>
<connor> into my thought about it. </connor>
<garnt> There's this concept of entire called Jai </garnt>
<garnt> which means the heart's right, </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of things, a
lot of things revolve </garnt>
<garnt> around this concept of Jai. </garnt>
<garnt> So basically lawn means hot heart. </garnt>
<garnt> So that means you're in patients. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's, that's the
literal translation, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Gin means patients cold hearts right now. </garnt>
<connor> There's this word called Lam lungi, </connor>
<connor> which means water flowing from the heart. </connor>
<connor> And you explain that to English. </connor>
<garnt> Like what the does that water, </garnt>
<garnt> water flow from the heart disease? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like it's drinkable water flowing </garnt>
<garnt> from the heart means it's
someone giving genuine acts </garnt>
<garnt> of kindness with no strings attached. </garnt>
<garnt> They just wanna be welcoming. </garnt>
<joey> And they are willing to give
just these genuine acts of </joey>
<joey> kindness so that everyone
around them has a good time </joey>
<joey> and is more welcomed. </joey>
<joey> And they do that with no strings
attached. And like, there, </joey>
<joey> there is no English
translation for that. Like, </joey>
<joey> cause the closest thing you could say is-- </joey>
<connor> - 90 words to explain it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, the
closest thing you can say </joey>
<joey> is like kinds, but it's
not, it's not really kind, </joey>
<joey> but like, unless you know, Tai, </joey>
<joey> I mean not unless, you know, Tai, </joey>
<joey> but like if you've been to Thailand, </joey>
<joey> you can feel this feeling, right. </joey>
<joey> This feeling that exudes from
the country, which is why, </joey>
<joey> which w which is why it's a
great place to go on holiday. </joey>
<joey> Cause everyone they're so
welcoming because a lot of people </joey>
<joey> there have non PII and like, it's, </joey>
<joey> it's so hard to explain that
into a different language </joey>
<joey> because in Thai, </joey>
<joey> that is just a concept that
you feel because it's just so </joey>
<joey> steeped in the culture and
you feel it when you go there. </joey>
<joey> But if you don't speak the language, </joey>
<garnt> then you don't have a proper
word to place on this feeling </garnt>
<garnt> that you feel, people exuding, </garnt>
<garnt> same thing with Japan as well. </garnt>
<garnt> You feel a certain feeling
from, you know, that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> someone who grew up in Japan
may have a different way of </garnt>
<garnt> thinking and a different way
of acting than say someone who </garnt>
<garnt> grew up outside of Japan. And there's, </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many like nuances
with just culture and just </garnt>
<garnt> psychology that is so like
steeped into language that it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's, you can explain it,
but from what I've, from, </garnt>
<garnt> what I've from, </garnt>
<garnt> what I've experienced is the
difference between explaining a </garnt>
<garnt> joke and understanding
a joke. You know, now, </garnt>
<garnt> now that I've been an avid anime
watch of my entire life and </garnt>
<joey> I've had Japanese concepts
explained to me it's like been so </joey>
<joey> weird actually feeling some of
these concepts as opposed to </joey>
<joey> just understanding them. And I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like one concept I
can think of in Japanese, </joey>
<joey> it's like this idea of reading
the room or reading the-- </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So kooky for like air in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> But like, and you know, we say
like, when we read the room, </joey>
<garnt> we say cook you'll you'll
know which means to read the, </garnt>
<garnt> read the air, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not quite the same as
when you say reading the app or </garnt>
<garnt> reading the room in English,
there's like a whole other, </garnt>
<garnt> like, it's, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a socio psychological
element that it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so important to read the
room and not reading the room </garnt>
<garnt> or not reading the air in
Japanese culture is so like not </garnt>
<garnt> good. Like that's like, you're
basically just, you know, </garnt>
<joey> societaly just, it's, it's
a societal death basically. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a communication
within Japanese society that </joey>
<joey> doesn't require. </joey>
<joey> - It's. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's, it's a thing that
doesn't require was, </joey>
<joey> and it's like this, </joey>
<joey> like non-spoken social
etiquette of sorts that Japanese </joey>
<joey> people have just hardwired into
the brain from a young age, </joey>
<joey> because it's just so
integrated and it's a society. </joey>
<joey> And you know, again, </joey>
<joey> that's like another concept
where you can explain it in </joey>
<garnt> another language and I'm sure, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> if you like looked into it and
understood it, then you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you can be like, all right,
I get what that means. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I can, I know how
to say it in this context, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, even for me, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I could fully use
or utilize the word or fully </garnt>
<garnt> understand what that word means, </garnt>
<garnt> because I personally didn't
grow up as heavily in an </garnt>
<connor> environment like that.
Like I grew up with it. </connor>
<garnt> Sure. But I wasn't born
and raised in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, there's that
sort of disconnect of yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> As you said, </garnt>
<garnt> like understanding it from
an explanation and just </garnt>
<joey> understanding it through
osmosis and like yeah. It's. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of
things I've never thought </joey>
<garnt> about in English as well, then maybe, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's just like purely
unique to our culture and our </garnt>
<garnt> language. And it's just like, I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> It was, it's just been,
it's just been really weird. </garnt>
<garnt> It's it's made me think about
things I've always took for </garnt>
<garnt> granted in my life where like
language was just me conveying </garnt>
<garnt> an idea. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just didn't realize
that me speaking English meant </garnt>
<garnt> that I was learning a part of
the history that our country </garnt>
<garnt> has been through. You
know, that's just, it's, </garnt>
<joey> it runs way deeper than
I gave it. Any credit. </joey>
<joey> - Men discovers language. </joey>
<joey> - I can see why people
get into like linguists. </joey>
<joey> I didn't get it either at first, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, literally. </joey>
<garnt> - Just talking about linguistics. </garnt>
<joey> - The longest time I'm like, wait, </joey>
<joey> so what are you studying linguistics. </joey>
<joey> - That. I'm like, do
you know how to speak? </joey>
<joey> What'd you need to know. </joey>
<garnt> - One more. Is that a learn about it? </garnt>
<garnt> But now I understand I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> it runs so much deeper than
just, I know a lot of woods, </joey>
<connor> you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It makes me in some
ways, cause I, you know, I'm, </connor>
<connor> I'm floating whilst obviously
I lived there all my young </connor>
<connor> adult life, I guess. </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah. No child life before. </connor>
<garnt> And you know, in some ways I'm like, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> I think I'm I'm I know the culture. </connor>
<connor> Of course I know the culture
and I'm like, wait, wait, wait, </connor>
<garnt> what exactly is it again? I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like sometimes I think, oh man, </connor>
<garnt> it's kind of hard to define it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of hard to explain
anything in some ways I'm just </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> like, yeah, it's like the UK,
but like way more friendly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that kind of, it just the
culture like first similar, </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> but friendly I guess. And, </joey>
<joey> and more focused on being
expressive. It's not until. </joey>
<joey> - You look at it through like a. </joey>
<connor> - Third person perspective. </connor>
<connor> I feel like sometimes dare say it's like, </connor>
<garnt> it's almost easier to, to, </garnt>
<garnt> to look at a culture and its
totality when you're not a part </garnt>
<garnt> of it. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Because you can kind of like
disconnect yourself from it. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes whilst I'm like
something like explain most </connor>
<connor> cultures to me, I'm like, ah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. That's, what's so hot. </joey>
<connor> It's like, is it actually part
of that country's culture? </connor>
<connor> Or is it, what is it just your experience? </connor>
<joey> - I think through that
culture. Right, right. </joey>
<joey> That's what I, I don't, you know, </joey>
<connor> and obviously something my
experience different to someone </connor>
<connor> else. And so there would be cultural. </connor>
<joey> - Would it be easier to
describe Welsh culture? </joey>
<joey> If the other person
spoke Welsh, you think. </joey>
<connor> - It would probably be a good way </connor>
<connor> to kind of hash things out? </connor>
<garnt> I be like, think about this. </garnt>
<garnt> This is what you say. This is, </garnt>
<connor> it's one of those things
where it's like, I, you know, </connor>
<garnt> getting a cultural, you know, hearing, </garnt>
<connor> if I explain Welsh culture to you, </connor>
<connor> it could be totally different
to how someone else. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I feel we've experienced that
quite a few times on this </joey>
<garnt> podcast where we'd say
something, oh yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> All Australians like this, and then-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Every type person is just
happy to like be recognized. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's just like, okay,
I'm not gonna call me out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. There's no enough
profitable to even the, </garnt>
<joey> that like don't even
watch so much trouble, </joey>
<connor> but don't a lot of them don't speak. </connor>
<joey> - But it's always been
fascinating whenever I've like </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> experienced my perspective
of like Australian cultural, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there've been people on
the other side watching our </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> show, being like, no, that's this year. </garnt>
<garnt> And it kind of opens my
eyes being like, oh yeah, </garnt>
<joey> maybe it is just me. </joey>
<connor> - Did you get accused of
being a fake Australian? </connor>
<joey> I think we spoke about this before. </joey>
<connor> Sometimes I've been accused so
many times fake Walsh online </connor>
<connor> that I, why does he sound English then? </connor>
<connor> What have an English accent?
How does that happen? </connor>
<joey> - I think at one time, in an episode, </joey>
<joey> I said that all Australians
own passports and a bunch of </joey>
<connor> Australians will like,
But all of my friends did. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. I mean, </connor>
<garnt> you also have a lot of international
friends as well. Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Just different crowd. </connor>
<joey> So then that's when I realized
I'm like, oh, it's not. </joey>
<connor> - Actually just integrate
it as hopefully as well. </connor>
<connor> The higher income, </connor>
<joey> the more likely you are to
having a passport because </joey>
<connor> obviously it's a luxury to travel. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. And I mean, </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> my view of England is a very
skewed from a lot of people's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> view because I've only really
grown up in the south. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> - From like the south, it's
like the rich Poppy's okay. </joey>
<joey> For the ball. That does well for itself. </joey>
<garnt> North is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, I, I mean back, </garnt>
<garnt> it took me like until like 24, </garnt>
<joey> 25 before I even went
beyond London, basically. </joey>
<garnt> - This is like all the UK though. </garnt>
<connor> Don't go above London. </connor>
<connor> I know that. It's like, oh, </connor>
<connor> I've done well suited
to fields and Schiller. </connor>
<connor> - But to me, </connor>
<connor> like the Midlands was just
this urban legend that people </connor>
<garnt> would make up. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like Midlands
doesn't exist. It's just, </garnt>
<joey> it's all the north. It's all the north. </joey>
<joey> - It just sounds like a Lord of the rings. </joey>
<connor> - You call it the north in, in Australia. </connor>
<connor> Do you have like the north section? </connor>
<joey> - No, we have, we have the coast and not. </joey>
<connor> - The, this is a great debate in the UK. </connor>
<connor> Where does the north begin? </connor>
<joey> - Because there's unfortunately,
there's no big ice. </joey>
<connor> - Walls. People in the Midlands,
people in the Midlands, </connor>
<joey> Midlands wall, </joey>
<connor> people in the Midlands where
they live in the middle, </connor>
<connor> they don't wanna be in the
north because the north has bad </connor>
<connor> connotations Pura, you know? </connor>
<connor> So a lot of people will
debate where the north is, </connor>
<connor> but I believe there was a
census of where the north is and </connor>
<connor> it's not a line. </connor>
<garnt> It's this weird diagonal
line that goes from like, </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember where
it's, it's a very weirdly, </joey>
<connor> almost vertical line. </connor>
<connor> It's closer to being
vertical than is horizontal. </connor>
<connor> If I remember correctly, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It could be like 45 degrees.
It just goes like this. </connor>
<connor> That's why we went. </connor>
<connor> Some people say you're not
from the north from Wales. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> But, well she's well she's north about </connor>
<connor> if you've got a Wells, it's the door, bro. </connor>
<connor> Like, you haven't been to that. </connor>
<joey> You would know. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't the latitude
wise. It's like the same </joey>
<joey> as most of the Midlands? </joey>
<connor> - Looks like. </connor>
<connor> It's like almost same where
I'm from is almost the same </connor>
<connor> latitude as Liverpool. </connor>
<connor> And that kind of area.
That seems pretty north. </connor>
<joey> I think I would say it's
from my understanding. </joey>
<joey> - Of where Liverpool
is in my map, it seems. </joey>
<connor> - Pretty good. It's pretty up there. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. To me
it's like Birmingham is, </connor>
<connor> you could maybe argue
as north, but bubbling. </connor>
<connor> It's pretty Northern as
well. I'd say, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - I've met more people from
Birmingham that would claim that </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> Birmingham is not from the north. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> No, we're from the Midlands Midlands. </garnt>
<connor> - That's an old. </connor>
<joey> - Man. I think we're Austin, Australia. </joey>
<connor> I'm going. </connor>
<connor> - To kill the saying that. </connor>
<connor> - I think for us in
Australia, it's more so about. </connor>
<connor> Cause the Mo the majority of
the population lives on the </connor>
<garnt> coast line. So for us, the
argument has always been, </garnt>
<garnt> where does the coast, </garnt>
<garnt> like the coastal cities stop
and starts becoming the inland </garnt>
<garnt> cities and like, no, one's
been able to figure it out. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Because like, I think
for people on the coast, </garnt>
<joey> the coast seems a lot more
narrow than it actually is. </joey>
<connor> - I think I read something ages ago. </connor>
<connor> There was something
like in most countries, </connor>
<garnt> like if you don't artificially
create a border like Eastern </garnt>
<garnt> west Germany, </garnt>
<garnt> it'll almost always become
like a north south divide. </garnt>
<garnt> Rarely becomes a, and even
if it's not geographically, </garnt>
<garnt> a north and south divide, </garnt>
<garnt> it's called the north
south divide will weird. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know why I put
this. Bring more to it. </connor>
<connor> I just didn't read the rest of it. </connor>
<connor> I think about a lot of countries
with divides of like, well, </connor>
<connor> it's like Germany has a north
south divide with like Bavaria </connor>
<connor> being a rich pop Germany in the south of. </connor>
<connor> - Italy is like. </connor>
<connor> - That as well. Has it? </connor>
<joey> France is like that too. </joey>
<joey> A lot of countries are
like that, North America, </joey>
<connor> most European countries. </connor>
<joey> - Like that. I don't think. </joey>
<connor> - America is like that. </connor>
<connor> There's like the south Southern states. </connor>
<garnt> - I was thinking about
America seeing east. </garnt>
<garnt> - And west coast. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like everywhere divided. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone's killing. </garnt>
<connor> - Americans, like a quad dog. </connor>
<connor> - I guess kind of a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - Japan is like Tokyo,
Kyoto and everywhere else. </joey>
<connor> - No, a weird place. </connor>
<joey> - Japan actually is east and west. </joey>
<connor> - No, it's not. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> And combo. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But then also I would argue
in some ways it's north of the </connor>
<connor> south, because that's the
whole, a whole like Hertz, </connor>
<joey> electrical grids being different. </joey>
<joey> That's but it's like cut
off from like totally Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a 45 degree angle. </joey>
<connor> - Tokyo upwards. And then to
the east of it, but it's up, </connor>
<connor> it's doing like this way. It's going up. </connor>
<garnt> So it's a kind of south kind
of goes to the south. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Also, how did that happen? </garnt>
<connor> Oh, </connor>
<connor> it's something to do with one
side of Japan wanting to do </connor>
<connor> European way and the other,
just wanting to do its own way. </connor>
<connor> And for some reason, </connor>
<connor> I dunno why Japan still
has the whole 5,060 heads, </connor>
<connor> which by the way, </connor>
<connor> when you're filming stuff is
really inconvenient because you </connor>
<connor> have to change. </connor>
<connor> You have to remember to change
your camera from 50 to 60 </connor>
<connor> Hertz. Otherwise, when we go
to a place and we'll record, </connor>
<garnt> there'll be, the
flickering will be insane. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I filmed a crane game in Sendai, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think that's also on 50. </garnt>
<garnt> But then I think we filmed
something when we went to </garnt>
<garnt> Hiroshima, which is 60. </garnt>
<connor> I think one of us, </connor>
<connor> we got to change one of the
GoPros and the GoPros is like, </connor>
<connor> just unusable because it
was just like strobe. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, how does
this happen in such a, </connor>
<connor> but in other ways, I'm like, this is, </connor>
<connor> of course this happened to
Japan because I mentioned the </connor>
<connor> bank system. Of course
something stupid, like phase. </connor>
<joey> - Out the floppy disks. </joey>
<garnt> Oh God. Once something is decided here, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just the way it's gonna be. </garnt>
<joey> There is no turning back. There is no. </joey>
<connor> - That's all, that's all weekly
complain about Japan bit. </connor>
<connor> Welcome. You're welcome. </connor>
<joey> Complained about America with complainant. </joey>
<joey> - Even talked about anime. </joey>
<connor> The bingo card is full. </connor>
<connor> - Music. </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I love talking about
the differences between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> countries so much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it also becomes like
a tedious to a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> listeners. Maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. I just, I just, I just, </garnt>
<garnt> I definitely think that growing
up cause I've traveled a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch and I was very, </garnt>
<garnt> very fortunate that I've traveled a bunch. </garnt>
<garnt> I definitely learned a lot
about other countries. My, </garnt>
<connor> my dad lived in Germany mostly. </connor>
<connor> So it was really cool getting
to learn about all these </connor>
<connor> different cultures,
obsessed with U us culture. </connor>
<connor> But sometimes it's really
hard to talk about it online </connor>
<connor> because sometimes someone
living in that culture was like, </connor>
<garnt> no, yeah, you're wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> But I also wanna give it a
little talk about it to be </garnt>
<joey> educated, but I would argue
that that's on that person. </joey>
<connor> Right. Because it's like,
well, yeah, obviously, okay. </connor>
<connor> If I say something very
skewed perspective, it also, </connor>
<garnt> if I say something
blatantly wrong, then yeah. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like France is a
good country. You know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if I say that, then
that's fair enough that I'm, </SPEAKER_03>
<joey> you know, I'm joking, I'm joking. </joey>
<connor> I'm British. We make the joke. </connor>
<connor> You can move to the UK. Go for it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. No, but like, I feel
like especially now that now, </joey>
<joey> now that living in another country, </joey>
<joey> like probably living in another
country and integrating into </joey>
<joey> its society. I mean, this is the first, </joey>
<joey> this is my first real experience
trying to integrate into a </joey>
<joey> society where I have not grown up in. </joey>
<joey> I have no prior experience in. </joey>
<joey> It's just been a shot in the dark. </joey>
<joey> I give you guys props for
that. It is, it is a learning. </joey>
<joey> It's hard because he was
different from me living in </joey>
<joey> Thailand because I'm just
like, yeah, I've never, </joey>
<joey> I've never properly
lived in Thailand before, </joey>
<joey> but it's got like family, </joey>
<joey> their family that I've
visited there. Enough. </joey>
<joey> I speak the language. </joey>
<joey> I understand the culture
as we've just said. </joey>
<joey> So it's it's, it was much
easier for me to integrate. </joey>
<joey> And there wasn't as many surprises. </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't say I got like a
culture shock per se. I dunno. </joey>
<joey> What is culture shock? </joey>
<connor> - Culture shock is when
you go to a country </connor>
<connor> and you realize that
something that you didn't </connor>
<joey> think is normal is normal in Wisconsin, </joey>
<connor> or like the daily norms that you did, </connor>
<joey> our normal normal rethink
the way you think. </joey>
<joey> Okay. Okay. </joey>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<joey> I guess maybe we've had culture shock, </joey>
<connor> but not like the UK reverse
culture shock. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I had more question to you, boys. </connor>
<connor> Do you find yourself more
critical of your home country </connor>
<garnt> after leaving south country? Yes. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> it's really easy for me to
look at the UK and be like, </connor>
<connor> what a mess. </connor>
<garnt> But I knew it was a mess. I lived there, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was your mess. </garnt>
<garnt> It still is my mess. I still love it. </garnt>
<garnt> I still love the UK, but
holy, what the are we doing </garnt>
<garnt> right now in the UK? There's this? </garnt>
<connor> There's this, this is
like no truck drivers. </connor>
<joey> Like no two people talking
about the fuel crisis. </joey>
<garnt> They it's not that it's that
we have no truck drivers </garnt>
<garnt> because we stopped letting
immigrants into drive trucks. </garnt>
<connor> And so then it turned out
that we were only hiring </connor>
<connor> immigrants to drive tracks before. </connor>
<connor> And then suddenly they were like, ah, </connor>
<connor> who's gonna drive the trucks.
And so now there's no, </connor>
<connor> there's no truck drivers. </connor>
<connor> And all of a sudden now
they're like, we should've, </connor>
<connor> we should've thought about this. </connor>
<connor> Sorry. Then I'm not
commenting on all that. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's a minefield. But
there was this, there was this. </connor>
<connor> Now there was this there's
this news thing on BBC. </connor>
<connor> So because there's no truck
drivers, what they've done. </connor>
<joey> Oh, I dunno if this is just like, </joey>
<joey> this could have been just
news bait or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it was, but
this clip was just so funny. </joey>
<joey> I don't care if it's true or not. </joey>
<joey> There was this BBC a bit about
how now they were recruiting </joey>
<joey> prisoners who had truck
licenses to drive trucks. </joey>
<garnt> But then they, that like,
they're like meet Steve. </garnt>
<connor> This is Steve. He's a,
he's a truck driver. </connor>
<connor> And he was in bed. </connor>
<connor> Steve C was arrested for
smuggling cocaine on a truck, </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> into the UK. It's could they
not have, like, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it. I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> He's a great truck. I was like, </connor>
<connor> this man is really good
at driving. I was like it. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, that's trying
to sell the public on this. </connor>
<connor> And that is the one example
they give I'm like, come on. </connor>
<connor> People are not gonna be
happy with that. People like, </connor>
<connor> people don't wanna Pablo
Escobar managing that </connor>
<connor> infrastructure. You know what I mean? </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Steve, he ran over
70 people with a truck. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> The problem was that
it was delivered food. </garnt>
<joey> That is people being like
immigrant truck drivers. </joey>
<joey> man. It's like, it's
like, you can't make this. </joey>
<joey> Like they wouldn't bother a
guy who like broke the law, </joey>
<connor> then get them, get someone
who can't speak English. </connor>
<connor> Well, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's up. And I know that's
this whole politics. </connor>
<connor> I don't, I don't give a. </connor>
<connor> But that, that, that whole
thing is just absurd. </connor>
<connor> But it was just that the humor
of it was just the reason why </connor>
<connor> faddish so funny. She said we
should deliver through that. </connor>
<connor> Traditional BBC, no opinion, </connor>
<garnt> no emotion vibe where it
was just like the British </garnt>
<garnt> government has resorted to
hiring inmates to try and trucks. </garnt>
<garnt> This is Steve. He was caught
smuggling cocaine on a truck. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just like, this is so
not even a single emotion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this thing. And it was just so jarring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Chris sent me the clarity.
It was just terrifying. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> I was like, this is so funny. </connor>
<connor> It's just all my God. What is going on? </connor>
<connor> The absolute state, </connor>
<connor> the state of truck drivers
in the UK stay in the UK. </connor>
<connor> Oh my Lord. BBC went downhill
since can't let that. </connor>
<garnt> - That's that's. I
mean, that's why I left. </garnt>
<connor> Right. I got off all those stories. </connor>
<garnt> - They reported that the best, </garnt>
<connor> most funniest way they could have. </connor>
<connor> I was very happy with that. </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes it's just the
way they like BBC news. </joey>
<garnt> It's just sometimes the way
they present it. So how can, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the word? </garnt>
<joey> - The cold months, </joey>
<joey> gold standards of not inserting
opinion in terms of at least </joey>
<joey> just the, the broadcast airing. </joey>
<joey> And like when they factually presented, </joey>
<joey> they have a lot of articles
that are absolute with full </joey>
<connor> opinions of garbage. But yeah,
generally the prime time TV, </connor>
<connor> when they're just saying the
thing, normally it's good. </connor>
<connor> It's good. It's a good example
of how it is then normally </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> recently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the got the BBC was
a kind of a gold standard and </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> television and it was, and that's kind. </garnt>
<connor> - It. </connor>
<connor> - Was. </connor>
<joey> - That's gone down hill when they reported </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> that a Gundam as a
transformer, I was like, that. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> - Was the final. </connor>
<joey> - Salvo was the final straw. Couldn't. </joey>
<connor> - Even make the research to
call it a Gunda. I put the. </connor>
<connor> - Letter of resignation on the table. </connor>
<connor> - You know, </connor>
<garnt> you know how like actors send
letters to other actors that </garnt>
<garnt> like your performance was amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a God sent the letters to the BBC. </garnt>
<garnt> I am disappointed the. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolute state of. </connor>
<connor> - This new state. What has
happened to the great to BBC. </connor>
<joey> - I wanna strike this from
my CV. So nobody ever knows. </joey>
<garnt> I worked for the BBC. </garnt>
<garnt> Nobody ever will. The money I
would like to boycott the BBC. </garnt>
<joey> I would like to rescind my
employment at the BBC, please. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just, oh God, cause
you already, you, you know, </garnt>
<connor> when you're living there, </connor>
<garnt> you get to experience the nice
parts and, and the fun parts. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I only just hear about
the mess that's going on with </garnt>
<garnt> the news articles and stopped
my parents being like, </garnt>
<garnt> so the world is on fire here, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like, oh yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> energy prices went up
like 1000% or something. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like, the energy
bill went from like 40 pounds. </garnt>
<garnt> So like 500 pounds. And I'm
like, what the is going on? </garnt>
<connor> And Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, like, even
like deep during the pandemic, </joey>
<connor> when I heard about the 5g
things, because I'm so bad. </connor>
<garnt> I remember back back when it
started, we were just like, ah, </garnt>
<joey> look at, look at all the silly Americans. </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - British people in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> Legitimately think that
crazy people only existed in. </connor>
<connor> They, they don't believe that
crazy places just in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - So crazy people exist everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been all these news
articles about people like Bernie </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> 5g towers in the UK came out
and the rest of the world would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, yo, get your, man's get your man's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just like, say my man's
man, A Japanese citizen. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> - It's really bad. </connor>
<connor> It's like all the videos online
of 5g towers being torn down </connor>
<connor> or like sat on fire. Every time
I was watching, I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh, what was his Florida or something? </connor>
<garnt> And then you hear a broody
thick British accent. Like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh God, that's pretty bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if we were just blind
to this when we were living </garnt>
<garnt> there, but I've always
just been exacerbated when. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's about five years, </garnt>
<garnt> it's gone lifeline it's
skyrocketed. And yeah, </garnt>
<connor> it's really pretty tragic. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like, especially during
like these past few years, </joey>
<joey> we've seen like the
stupidest parts of humanity, </joey>
<connor> just like on all like on front and center. </connor>
<connor> - They don't think they think stupid. </connor>
<connor> - It's unfortunate that, you know, </connor>
<connor> our country was like
part of that stupidity. </connor>
<joey> We thought every country
thinks there and mean to it, </joey>
<joey> but we felt we soon find out that we are, </joey>
<joey> we are not in the justice. </joey>
<garnt> - Any, any country with internet, </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna happen to every single, </garnt>
<connor> every country that has the
internet. It's unfortunate. </connor>
<joey> - Joe, do you know what I realized? </joey>
<connor> Ah, you know, </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> like every cheesy hero movie
or every like cheesy heroic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment where the hero asks
the entire world to come </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> together, cooperate. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you remember that scene
in dragon ball Z where Goku </garnt>
<garnt> asks everyone to give me your energy, </garnt>
<garnt> energy for the Spiro BombBomb. </garnt>
<garnt> I realized that's the entirely. </garnt>
<garnt> Like imagine if that tried
to even imagine if that like </garnt>
<garnt> happened in real life, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like the Americans would argue
whether they have the right </garnt>
<connor> to not put that hands up. Right. </connor>
<connor> Japan would take six months
to approve any of their </connor>
<connor> citizens. Putting that
hands up the UK was started, </connor>
<connor> would start burning 5g towers
and Australia would probably </connor>
<connor> go back into lockdown. </connor>
<connor> - Ground. </connor>
<joey> - No one would put their hands up. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. I would like,
I would like to see that. </joey>
<joey> I would like to see that Goku
seen post COVID let's let's </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> let's see how that turns out. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> I think it would go on for
twice as many episodes. Right? </garnt>
<joey> It's just like, there's
just like the bad guys. </joey>
<joey> It's like. </joey>
<connor> - Go, go cross to go on a
PR trip around the world, </connor>
<joey> kissing babies. </joey>
<joey> - Convince everyone. </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> - Smoke weed on. </SPEAKER_03>
<connor> So what you're saying is Goku. </connor>
<connor> He said everybody has to
put their hands up. Really? </connor>
<garnt> Really. </garnt>
<joey> - People be like, I dunno, right? </joey>
<garnt> Wing thing to say, I don't
know about this margin. </garnt>
<garnt> Bukari so you say he's the
greatest threat in the universe? </garnt>
<garnt> How come I haven't heard of him? </garnt>
<joey> Sounds like a hoax to me
turning the frog's game. </joey>
<joey> I haven't got any proof that he's exists, </joey>
<joey> but he's not some liberal, </joey>
<garnt> some something made up by the liberals. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_03> It's liberal propaganda.
I tell you, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> - So when someone needs to
make a political satire, </garnt>
<garnt> dragon ball Z, that'd be the
funniest thing in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> New grounds. </garnt>
<joey> You need to come into the
dark ages and to make that. </joey>
<connor> - It sucks just being like, I don't give </connor>
<SPEAKER_03> about any of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<garnt> It sucks being like, yo, you're all crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> What are you guys doing? </garnt>
<garnt> Just be normal. </garnt>
<garnt> So hard. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so hard to be normal
because that in itself is a take. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like, what do you mean? </garnt>
<garnt> You don't have strong opinions
on this weird that I read </garnt>
<connor> online. </connor>
<connor> I don't care, man. </connor>
<connor> I'm just trying to chill, man. </connor>
<joey> I just think that like, why
don't you be nice to people? </joey>
<joey> I don't. </joey>
<joey> - Know. It must be nice to have
the privilege to just chill. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, at the end
of the day, I, you know, </joey>
<joey> I it's one of those things
where I it's unfortunate because </joey>
<joey> I don't think inherently people, </joey>
<joey> I think there are a small
amount of people that genuinely </joey>
<joey> are like extremely hateful
in a sense. I don't think, </joey>
<garnt> you know, it's why I hate
demonizing any side too much. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like just saying
one side is right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I think at the end
of the day, even though, </garnt>
<garnt> as long as they're not
posting harmful stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> which I'm solid, unfortunately they are, </garnt>
<garnt> they are posting harmful misinformation. </garnt>
<garnt> It sucks because I don't think
that anyone is inherently </garnt>
<garnt> like evil or trying to spread hate. </garnt>
<garnt> I think they genuinely just
believe that what they're </garnt>
<garnt> spreading is gonna save
people's lives will help. </garnt>
<garnt> Which sucks. Because then, </garnt>
<joey> then when someone believes
that firmly about it, </joey>
<joey> it is impossible to. </joey>
<joey> - I th I think it's just, </joey>
<joey> it's been exacerbated by
the internet. I mean, it's, </joey>
<joey> it's like being in social media. </joey>
<joey> It's so easy just to fall
in an echo chamber, right. </joey>
<joey> Where you were, because
you think a certain way, </joey>
<joey> and there's nothing you get
exposed to that challenges you </joey>
<joey> or challenges the way
you're thinking. Right? </joey>
<joey> Because you know, in the
old days you hear something, </joey>
<joey> you hear something that you
disagree with and maybe you have </joey>
<joey> a, maybe have a debate
or, you know, maybe you, </joey>
<joey> you talk to someone about it, </joey>
<joey> but in here you can just simply mute them. </joey>
<joey> Or you can just simply not
follow people who have that </joey>
<joey> opinion. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's the problem
I have with it. It's like, </joey>
<garnt> I don't really mind people
giving like extreme opinions </garnt>
<garnt> about things on the internet. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> believing in something that
they firmly believe in. </garnt>
<garnt> The problem I have is that no, </garnt>
<garnt> one's having a open
conversation about it. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And no one is no one is
ready to be like, say, </garnt>
<garnt> say the opposite opinion
to me, I'm listening. </garnt>
<garnt> And I will, </garnt>
<garnt> and I will try and understand
that the best I can, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like, blah, blah, blah. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm right. you mute. </garnt>
<connor> You know. </connor>
<connor> - You know, it's, it's the incident. </connor>
<connor> It's very powerful because I
think growing up anything you </connor>
<garnt> read it's in a it's in
books. It must be true. </garnt>
<garnt> You've been told that stuff
you read or stuff that you've </garnt>
<joey> experienced. So stuff that
you're told is always true. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. So and even then
it's not sometimes, right. </joey>
<garnt> Like I remember when I was like 12, </garnt>
<garnt> I first came across like the
moon landing. Conspiracy. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, for like a week, I've
already thought it was true. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Because I, I read
it and I thought, well, </garnt>
<garnt> that makes sense. </garnt>
<connor> This posting explained it
well enough to me. And then, </connor>
<connor> you know, but I was 12, I
was 13 or whatever, you know, </connor>
<connor> like, you're, you're a idiot. </connor>
<garnt> You can't think about staff. You can't. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. You can't be like, oh,
maybe they cherry picture. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they presented information. </garnt>
<garnt> This all seems like it
makes sense in my world. </garnt>
<garnt> And that I understand. So
it it's, it's, it's tough. </garnt>
<joey> And some people, </joey>
<connor> I feel like almost kind of
have that mindset going forward </connor>
<joey> and never really liked, tend to think, oh, </joey>
<joey> maybe I should look at other stuff. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> What was that? </joey>
<joey> - I've never written by the
losers or something like that </joey>
<joey> because it's like, </joey>
<garnt> it takes energy and time
to look at the other side. </garnt>
<garnt> And a lot of people don't have
the energy and time to look </garnt>
<connor> at the other side nowadays. And. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, train
yourself to like, kind of. </connor>
<joey> - You have to go against your, you know, </joey>
<joey> your own gut feeling. </joey>
<joey> And you're just like, okay, </joey>
<joey> I have to literally go out of
my comfort zone and see what </joey>
<connor> the other side is saying, </connor>
<garnt> which is why I like on
my social media. I try, </garnt>
<garnt> even if I don't, </garnt>
<garnt> even if there's someone out
there who I don't agree with, </garnt>
<garnt> I still like sometimes
follow them or I still like, </garnt>
<joey> sometimes want them to
appear on my feet. Just so, </joey>
<joey> just so like, I know
what the other side is. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I do. </connor>
<connor> I do hate this idea that you
can't follow anyone who has </connor>
<connor> like controversial takes or
anything on Twitter. I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I was so war it's like, you
know, you're not promoting them. </connor>
<connor> If you're following them,
it's like, all right, </connor>
<connor> well just let them follow them.
Like, what harm is it doing? </connor>
<connor> Why would you want an echo chamber? </connor>
<connor> I don't understand this whole
process of only experiencing </connor>
<connor> your thought process and people
who think similarly to you. </connor>
<joey> I, to me. </joey>
<connor> - Surrounded by nothing. But yes, man, </connor>
<garnt> that equally turns you into. </garnt>
<connor> - Because someone has
committed like war, war crimes, </connor>
<connor> or genocide. </connor>
<garnt> Maybe it's a little different. </garnt>
<connor> But if someone just said
something that's but yikes on </connor>
<connor> Twitter, it's like, I mean, if
someone just gave an opinion, </connor>
<connor> it's tough. </connor>
<joey> I got canceled for that or
canceled. I remember they like, </joey>
<garnt> he's following he's Ben
Shapiro or something. </garnt>
<garnt> He's he's right. Waiting bro. </garnt>
<connor> Or Jordan pizza or
whatever. Like that kind of. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think that's like. </connor>
<connor> That's like the next
level of just like, oh, </connor>
<garnt> you it's not even, you agree
with this person it's you are, </garnt>
<garnt> you have a platform where you
listen to this person, the by, </garnt>
<garnt> by therefore you aren't
supporting them. I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanna know what
the other side is saying, </garnt>
<garnt> because I think it's interesting to see, </garnt>
<garnt> to have a different perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> even if I don't necessarily agree with it. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I think, </garnt>
<garnt> I think a big reason why I
just like don't have the energy </garnt>
<garnt> for like a lot of politics
nowadays or like this, </garnt>
<garnt> this spectrum of a mentality
is that everyone has something </garnt>
<garnt> to say, but everyone knows
what they stand against, </garnt>
<garnt> but no one knows what they stand for. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how I feel, where
you can like a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> There's so many people who
say, you can say, this is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> I disagree with this. I disagree
with this person and this, </garnt>
<garnt> I disagree with that person, </garnt>
<garnt> but they've never told me
what they stand for or what, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, what, what their
fight, you know, what, </garnt>
<garnt> what opinions are standing
for. And I'm just like, well, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what? You can,
you can discredit someone, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can't come up with an
argument force your own values </garnt>
<garnt> or your own views. And I
think, I think that's why I, </garnt>
<garnt> that's why, like, I don't have
the energy for this anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why, that's why I've
started to just, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I've I've I just listened to people. </garnt>
<garnt> I like listening to people
when I feel like even listening </garnt>
<garnt> to the other side of the
argument really broadens your </garnt>
<garnt> horizons. Even if it's
something you don't agree with, </garnt>
<garnt> or even if you think the
other side is stupid, </garnt>
<garnt> which you know, kind of
happen, certainly do it. </garnt>
<connor> It does keep you grounded. </connor>
<joey> And it does help form your volt
form your worldview as well. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<connor> Very eloquent. </connor>
<garnt> Thank you very much. Thanks
for coming to my Ted talk. </garnt>
<joey> Very eloquent. Almost like the
patrons of today's episode. </joey>
<connor> Oh my godly eloquent on screen
right now. Look at them. </connor>
<connor> They're not overly opinionated, </connor>
<joey> but they're also very eloquent. These, </joey>
<joey> these people would put
the hands up for Goku. </joey>
<SPEAKER_03> These people wouldn't
burn 5g towers, but Hey, </SPEAKER_03>
