<connor> - I can't stop farting recently. </connor>
<connor> It's terrible. </connor>
<connor> - I just had the most unpleasant shit, </connor>
<connor> like, five minutes ago. </connor>
<connor> Are we rolling? </connor>
<joey> - I swear it's not a
"Trash Taste" recording day </joey>
<connor> unless Garnt takes, like, a wicked shit. </connor>
<connor> Like, I know we're
about to start recording </connor>
<connor> when Garnt comes out of his, like, </connor>
<joey> shit training arc. </joey>
<connor> - It's just on schedule, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt's like, "Oh, its
two PM, all right let's go." </garnt>
<garnt> (chill techno music plays) </garnt>
<connor> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> I'm your host of course, your boy Connor </connor>
<connor> with Mike Wazowski here. </connor>
<connor> Nice seeing you back, Mike. </connor>
<connor> And no one else. </connor>
<connor> - I like how you grabbed the G Fuel there. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't want to hurt Mike like that. </connor>
<connor> - By the way. </connor>
<connor> - Mike! </connor>
<connor> - Mike. </connor>
<joey> I can't handle Mike that harshly. </joey>
<joey> It's great seeing you back, Mike. </joey>
<joey> And of course the boys, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - I love how we're second to Mike. </joey>
<connor> - Of course, we're all
second to Mike, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - He's the real player four. </joey>
<connor> - Mike Wazowski for all
you listeners out there. </connor>
<joey> - People are like, "Oh,
there's a guest called Mike." </joey>
<connor> - I forget sometimes that
we have audio only listeners </connor>
<joey> which shout out to you guys. </joey>
<joey> Hello. </joey>
<joey> I'm waving at you right now
even though you can't see. </joey>
<joey> - Let us know your presence. </joey>
<joey> Oh wait, you can't. </joey>
<joey> It's audio. </joey>
<connor> - So what've you boys been up to recently? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, fuck all, I guess. </joey>
<joey> I mean, this is the
first recording session </joey>
<connor> of the new year for us, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> - So we just come out of our Christmas </connor>
<joey> and New Year's I guess "break." </joey>
<connor> Because it didn't really
feel like a break to me. </connor>
<joey> - Even though it's never
really a Christmas holiday </joey>
<joey> for YouTubers because I feel like, </joey>
<joey> we've talked about this many times before, </joey>
<connor> but we never, we are very
bad at taking breaks. </connor>
<joey> - If anything, it's like the
last minute grind, right, </joey>
<joey> we do at the end of the year. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I've just been
watching a shit ton of anime </connor>
<garnt> because it's the end of the year. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember when I used to do that. </joey>
<garnt> - This is like my one time of the year </garnt>
<garnt> where I actually just sit down </garnt>
<connor> and just catch up to the year. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you don't feel bad, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you know that everyone's not, like, </connor>
<connor> doing anything, so it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't feel bad for,
like, binging a few shows. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - What did you binge, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> What did you watch? </connor>
<connor> - Basically most of
everything I missed in 2020. </connor>
<connor> So I watched "Jujutsu Kaisen." </connor>
<connor> - Yes, that was so good. </connor>
<connor> Have you watched that yet? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - Bro, it's so good! </joey>
<joey> - I don't watch anime. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Have you read the manga at least? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really fuckin' good. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I was going into it thinking like, </garnt>
<joey> are we just going to get, like, </joey>
<connor> every year there's everyone's like, </connor>
<joey> "Dude, this is the shonen. </joey>
<joey> "It's gonna replace-" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what
I've just been hearing. </joey>
<connor> Then I'm just, like, they
said that about "Dr. Stone." </connor>
<joey> They said that about a lot of
shows last couple of years. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, all right. </joey>
<connor> - "Jujutsu Kaisen" is where
I've actually got, like, </connor>
<connor> a chub watching it. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm actually, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm actually like hyped,
like see where it goes. </connor>
<connor> - It's a show that is just, </connor>
<connor> it just knows what it's doing. </connor>
<connor> And it's obviously been, like, </connor>
<connor> influenced from previous shonen. </connor>
<connor> But my God, it's just doing everything </connor>
<connor> that it needs to do right. </connor>
<joey> - All I've heard is that
if you watch the anime </joey>
<joey> it basically does
everything the manga does. </joey>
<connor> So it just makes the manga obsolete. </connor>
<connor> - Great. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, that was just
"Demon Slayer," right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I want no manga. </connor>
<connor> Get rid of manga. </connor>
<joey> I'm sick and tired of these, </joey>
<garnt> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Why would you disrespect- </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like this man's done, like, </garnt>
<connor> entire manga reading streams before. </connor>
<connor> - I'm about ready to
throw hands right now. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I'm tired of manga readers </connor>
<connor> constantly playing the
same damn card, right? </connor>
<joey> When is that card gonna get old? </joey>
<joey> How many times can you use the
"I've read the manga" card? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I use it all the fuckin' time. </joey>
<joey> - How many times can you use it </joey>
<connor> before you're just an asshole? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I just don't care. </joey>
<connor> I think a lot of manga
readers just don't care. </connor>
<connor> - So everyone just says </connor>
<connor> the "Jujutsu Kaisen" anime is exactly- </connor>
<joey> - Basically what I've heard is </joey>
<joey> that the anime does everything
the manga does but better. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, from what I understand </connor>
<connor> that's just a lot of shonen jump titles. </connor>
<connor> - Seems to be the way to go though. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, "Demon Slayer" did it. </connor>
<joey> You know, "Attack on Titan" is doing it. </joey>
<connor> - Like, I don't understand
why there was even a thing of </connor>
<connor> "let's just change the story" </connor>
<garnt> unless, you know, it
hadn't been adapted yet. </garnt>
<garnt> Hadn't been, sorry, finished yet, sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> Why even changed the story in my mind? </garnt>
<connor> When everyone loved this thing. </connor>
<connor> So everyone's like, yeah,
everyone loves this show, </connor>
<connor> let's just change it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like you've
started watching anime </connor>
<connor> after the period where there was, like, </connor>
<garnt> so many anime adaptations
that just fucked around </garnt>
<joey> with the manga and the story </joey>
<garnt> that you've forgotten that
this was a legitimate, like, </garnt>
<connor> selling points where we
had a manga that followed, </connor>
<connor> I mean, we had an anime
that followed the manga </connor>
<connor> through to the end. </connor>
<connor> - I can understand why they did it. </connor>
<connor> In the 90s or 80s, whatever. </connor>
<joey> - You didn't watch the 90s
shonen jump adaptations </joey>
<joey> where it's just like, "Oh
no, I liked this manga." </joey>
<joey> - I imagine the producers were just like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm sick and fuckin' tired
of these manga readers </joey>
<garnt> "on their high horse. </garnt>
<garnt> "You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm a fuck them over and make something </garnt>
<garnt> "they can't say, oh, I know what happens." </garnt>
<garnt> That's probably why </garnt>
<garnt> because they probably, like, </garnt>
<garnt> brought the manga readers
to the screenings. </garnt>
<connor> They were like, "Yeah, yeah? </connor>
<connor> "You know where it's going, do you?" </connor>
<joey> - No, if anything, it made
the manga readers look better </joey>
<joey> 'cause then the anime
watchers would be like, </joey>
<connor> "Well, I've heard from the manga readers </connor>
<connor> "that this anime's pretty good." </connor>
<connor> And then they go and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "So what happens in the manga? </connor>
<connor> "Could you tell us? </connor>
<connor> "Could you tell us? </connor>
<joey> "We're interested now finally." </joey>
<connor> - But do you find that
like the older you get, </connor>
<connor> like, the less anime that you watch </connor>
<joey> but the more manga that you read? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm in that right now. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like that's like
the path of every anime fan. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe I'm not old enough yet. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I haven't got there yet. </connor>
<joey> - You're, like, what, two
years younger than me? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Is 25, like, the turning point? </connor>
<joey> - To be fair it was around
your age where I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Manga's a thing." </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - At 24? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You didn't start reading
manga properly, like, until- </connor>
<joey> - No, I've been reading manga all my life. </joey>
<joey> But the thing is like
up until around, like, </joey>
<joey> a couple of years ago I would
be like very heavily, like, </joey>
<garnt> I'd say like 80/20 anime/manga, </garnt>
<garnt> but now it's like kind of flipped around. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like 80/20 manga to anime now. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you just realize </connor>
<connor> that reading manga is
basically watching anime </connor>
<connor> but just more optimized. </connor>
<connor> It's basically the speed run
version of watching anime. </connor>
<connor> - Basically. </connor>
<connor> - And no voice acting, no music. </connor>
<connor> What am I supposed to do? </connor>
<joey> Do this shit myself? </joey>
<joey> - The only part where it could, like, </joey>
<joey> potentially fuck up is,
like, on the author. </joey>
<joey> There's, like, no second hand to- </joey>
<joey> - It's like pure story, right? </joey>
<joey> You don't need anything else
but just the pure story. </joey>
<connor> And sometimes- </connor>
<connor> - There's only one person
to blame if it sucks. </connor>
<connor> - That's because it's like you don't know </connor>
<garnt> what you're missing out because
you never think about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you would never, I'll
keep coming back to it, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't know that you needed
"Giorno's Theme" in your life </garnt>
<joey> until you had "Giorno's
Theme" in your life. </joey>
<joey> Like, Part Five was amazing
without "Giorno's Theme," </joey>
<joey> but now Part Five has "Giorno's Theme," </joey>
<connor> it's like 10 times better. </connor>
<connor> - Didn't you read the manga of Part Five </connor>
<connor> before you watched the anime? </connor>
<connor> - I did, and I think the anime is better. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, we can agree with that. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, we all agree with that? </connor>
<garnt> I was like, wait. </garnt>
<garnt> I was giving it a second to sit there. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, all right I'm
waiting for the fans to turn. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Of "Jojo's" by the way. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I haven't seen
all of Part Five yet, </connor>
<connor> but the little that I have seen is, like, </connor>
<connor> already better than the manga. </connor>
<connor> But that's not to say
that the manga is bad. </connor>
<connor> - This is a very rare case </connor>
<connor> where I feel like a legendary
manga has been adapted </connor>
<garnt> into a legendary animation. </garnt>
<garnt> And we don't get many of those I think. </garnt>
<connor> It's always one or the other. </connor>
<connor> - Because the problem is </connor>
<connor> when you have a legendary manga </connor>
<connor> everyone's expectations
is so fuckin' high. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's what's happening </connor>
<connor> with "Attack on Titan" right now. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I swear to God, </connor>
<garnt> everyone is looking for
every little fuckin' nitpick </garnt>
<garnt> they can think of to shit on, like, </garnt>
<garnt> the, like, the change of studios. </garnt>
<garnt> Where I think MAPPA's doing a
great fuckin' job right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're fuckin' killin' it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the amount of, like,
shitty takes I've seen on Twitter </garnt>
<connor> when the first episode aired. </connor>
<connor> - I was streaming the
day after it came out, </connor>
<garnt> and all the comments were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What do you think of the 3D CGI, Connor, </garnt>
<garnt> "in 'Attack on Titan?'" </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "I didn't
even fuckin' notice it. </garnt>
<garnt> "What do you mean? </garnt>
<garnt> "It was fine." </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, "It looked gross! </garnt>
<garnt> "What do you mean?" </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, but it was like two
seconds and it looked fine. </connor>
<connor> Stop fuckin' nitpickin'. </connor>
<joey> Holy shit. </joey>
<joey> - I love all those shitty
takes where it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's done by, </joey>
<connor> "knowing now that it's
done by MAPPA instead of," </connor>
<connor> was it Silver Link? </connor>
<connor> No, not Silver Link. </connor>
<connor> - Studio Wit. </connor>
<garnt> - It was Studio Wit. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, it's like, "Knowing
that it's done by MAPPA </garnt>
<garnt> "instead of Studio Wit, it
just feels different now. </garnt>
<connor> "It just feels different." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I had this image in my head </joey>
<joey> of someone in their house, right. </joey>
<joey> They've got, like, </joey>
<connor> "Shingeki no Kyogin"
shit all over the room, </connor>
<connor> waiting with that popcorn. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Yes!" </connor>
<connor> The moment, like, the CGI comes on, like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, fuck this!" </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> "I knew they'd fuck it up!" </connor>
<connor> - No, 'cause what I want to know is </connor>
<connor> that did they just forget </connor>
<connor> what the Colossal Titans looked like </connor>
<connor> in season two and three? </connor>
<connor> - It looked shit! </connor>
<connor> - It looked like absolute
garbage compared to the CG now. </connor>
<connor> And just because every Titan is CG now, </connor>
<connor> people, like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's just bad takes. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like it's just </connor>
<connor> because it's such a
massively popular franchise </connor>
<connor> that I feel the new, like, </connor>
<connor> MAPPA are doing a great job. </connor>
<connor> And you got a great story anyway. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I love
about following, like, </joey>
<joey> those, like, massive toxic fan bases. </joey>
<joey> It's just the amount of shit
takes that come out of it is </joey>
<joey> just so entertaining. </joey>
<connor> - And people like shitting
on the opening as well. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> - I saw that. </joey>
<connor> - what was wrong with the opening? </connor>
<connor> - That's what people said
about the last opening! </connor>
<joey> And now everyone fuckin'
loves the last opening. </joey>
<connor> - I already get it, man. </connor>
<connor> People just get angry
every fuckin' season. </connor>
<connor> But I guess it's 'cause
the problem is, right, </connor>
<garnt> is that someone has a bad take on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> and then everyone fuckin' clowns on them, </garnt>
<garnt> so that's the only take that anyone sees </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause everyone's fuckin'
clownin' on that guy </garnt>
<connor> who's like, "The opening sucks. </connor>
<connor> "Why's it all colorful?" </connor>
<joey> - Although to be fair, the
"Attack on Titan," like, </joey>
<connor> when episode one came out,
there was a lot of shit takes. </connor>
<connor> It was just all over my timeline. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, who are these people? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause people want brownie points, man. </connor>
<joey> And so if you're- </joey>
<joey> - Brownie points for what? </joey>
<joey> Looking like a clown? </joey>
<joey> - Well, that's the thing, right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause to these people, it's like, </connor>
<connor> people aren't gonna see if you're a clown. </connor>
<connor> But if that one time you
get a successful take </connor>
<connor> that, like, takes off. </connor>
<connor> Imagine the clout you get, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "Yes!" </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the hot, the
science behind hot takes, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause hot takes aren't
actually hot takes. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like saying
unpopular opinions, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The unpopular opinions
that people up vote aren't </garnt>
<garnt> actually unpopular opinions. </garnt>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> It's just, like, people
say unpopular opinions </joey>
<joey> just so they can get brownie points </joey>
<joey> because it's never actually. </joey>
<joey> If it's an actual unpopular opinion, </joey>
<connor> that's the opinion that people shit on. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - That statement alone just, like, </joey>
<joey> completely negated my
"Let's Fight" series. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's what that show is all about. </joey>
<joey> Taking unpopular opinions. </joey>
<joey> I love that. </joey>
<joey> But like, that's why I have such trouble </joey>
<garnt> with, like, making a next episode of that. </garnt>
<garnt> Because every time I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey guys, give me your
unpopular opinions on anime." </garnt>
<garnt> The top replies are like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Boku no Piko was bad." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Really? </garnt>
<joey> "You don't fuckin' say, mate." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember, like, </connor>
<joey> 'cause voice actors do a lot
of those challenges on Twitter </joey>
<joey> that like, "Hey man, like, </joey>
<garnt> "what's an unpopular
voice acting opinion." </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You know, I think hard
work matters the most." </garnt>
<garnt> And then stuff like that. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, what do you mean? </joey>
<joey> That's not even an opinion. </joey>
<joey> That's genuinely good advice. </joey>
<joey> Just do the thing. </joey>
<joey> - What's unpopular about it? </joey>
<joey> - That's like the level of, like, </joey>
<garnt> yeah, I don't know, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's what happens. </garnt>
<garnt> Twitter's weird, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially when you're in
like communities on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> that's, like, creative stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I love watching, </garnt>
<connor> artist Twitter is my favorite. </connor>
<connor> - Artist Twitter is like
watching trash TV to me. </connor>
<connor> It's like you can just grab the popcorn. </connor>
<garnt> And it's like watching "90
Day Fiance" or something, </garnt>
<garnt> you know? </garnt>
<garnt> The amount of tea that
is spilled on, like, </garnt>
<garnt> artist Twitter, like, it's more tea </garnt>
<joey> than the fuckin' Americans
threw into the water </joey>
<connor> when, like, they gained independence, man. </connor>
<connor> My fuckin' god. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why, </joey>
<joey> but why is it almost always
written in lowercase? </joey>
<garnt> It's, like, it's never proper punctuation. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, let's just make
it as lowercase as possible. </garnt>
<joey> Fuckin' seven tweet thread. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like. </joey>
<joey> It's just shit that you could've summed up </joey>
<joey> into just one tweet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a lot of funny ones. </connor>
<connor> I love it as well when it's like people, </connor>
<connor> just artists are, like,
giving advice to each other, </connor>
<connor> and they all like repeat the same stuff. </connor>
<joey> And it's always interesting sometimes </joey>
<joey> because they'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, you should charge
people for your art." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, is this like not known? </joey>
<joey> You should charge people for work. </joey>
<joey> Like what? </joey>
<joey> Apparently it's pretty common though. </joey>
<connor> I mean, you see the messages
on, like, For Exposure, right? </connor>
<connor> That Twitter account. </connor>
<connor> For Exposure is a Twitter
account people, like, </connor>
<connor> ask people to do things "for
exposure" which is very funny. </connor>
<joey> - Is that an unpopular
opinion you just gave? </joey>
<connor> - Doing work for free. </connor>
<joey> - That artists should get paid? </joey>
<connor> - Guys, I'm gonna do an
unpopular take right now. </connor>
<connor> - Guys, guys, guys,
don't count me for this, </connor>
<connor> but artists should get
paid for their work. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - To be fair though, I joke on that, </connor>
<connor> but a lot of voice actors, like, </connor>
<connor> where they start out they'll
spend all their money on, like, </connor>
<connor> the new stuff and then they'll be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Yeah, I'll do your commercial for free." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's different with artists </garnt>
<garnt> and I think voice actors
'cause voice actors, like, </garnt>
<garnt> you get credits. </garnt>
<garnt> You need credits. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like a race. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's just, like,
de-valuing themselves </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I'll do your
Kellogg's commercial for $2 </garnt>
<garnt> "and a Kit-Kat bar. </garnt>
<garnt> "Like, that's fair. </garnt>
<garnt> "That seems good. </garnt>
<garnt> "My name's on the credit though, right?" </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think there is a
balance that should be taken </connor>
<connor> because there is value in clout basically. </connor>
<joey> I mean that's how we
make our money, right? </joey>
<joey> It's literally we are monetizing clout. </joey>
<joey> That is the modern day. </joey>
<joey> - We are clout chasers as an occupation. </joey>
<connor> - Go on. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, but like I get, you know, </connor>
<connor> artists should definitely be paid </connor>
<connor> and you definitely have a skill set, </connor>
<connor> but there's also building up
your personal branding as well </connor>
<connor> which you have to worry about. </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem, right, </connor>
<joey> is that so many artists starting out, </joey>
<connor> they don't see themselves
as a brand per se </connor>
<garnt> because of that artist mentality. </garnt>
<garnt> They're not like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh no, I'm just doing it
because I like drawing. </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't want to make this a profession." </garnt>
<garnt> But then they make one piece
where it's really popular </garnt>
<garnt> and getting shared fuckin' everywhere. </garnt>
<connor> And then suddenly they're like, </connor>
<joey> "Actually I'm a brand. </joey>
<connor> "You're stealing." </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I've seen the
exact opposite of, like, </connor>
<joey> talented artists who just
don't know how to charge here </joey>
<garnt> where you have like an artist
who has like two drawings </garnt>
<garnt> on their portfolio or something </garnt>
<garnt> and are charging, like,
ridiculous amounts of money. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like, come on. </garnt>
<connor> There's a balance that
needs to be taken here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my favorite is when they're like, </connor>
<connor> I've worked with some artists before. </connor>
<connor> And like great. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's all good. </connor>
<connor> You know, and it's all reasonable. </connor>
<connor> All the prices seem fair. </connor>
<garnt> And then I'm like, oh, it's
for, like, commercial use </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, "Oh,
you're like selling it?" </garnt>
<garnt> And then they might, like,
try and figure out like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, you make this much money. </garnt>
<garnt> "It's now worth $10,000 for this piece." </garnt>
<joey> And it's like, what? </joey>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> What? </joey>
<connor> No, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure on
your website it said $20. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Looks at industry standard rates. </joey>
<joey> That ain't right, okay. </joey>
<connor> Well I'm not Pepsi. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Which is basically the
Fiverr environment, right? </connor>
<connor> How is it like working with people. </connor>
<connor> How do you know how much you're worth? </connor>
<connor> And how to sell yourself on Fiverr? </connor>
<connor> - Because I think on Fiverr, </connor>
<connor> it's inherently people,
like, devalue themselves. </connor>
<joey> But there are people on Fiverr
who are charging like $500 </joey>
<joey> for honestly what is
like really bad quality. </joey>
<garnt> But then the thing is right on Fiverr, </garnt>
<garnt> at least I can only speak for voice actors </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I've hired a lot
of voice actors on Fiverr, </garnt>
<garnt> and like voice actors
on Fiverr there's, like, </garnt>
<garnt> $5 is, like, you get a very
wide variety of, like, skill. </garnt>
<garnt> You go all the way from headset mic. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause Fiverr there's no checks. </connor>
<connor> There's no one on Fiverr being like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, you seem like a voice actor. </connor>
<connor> "You're good to go, champ." </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Oh, you have
something that your PC recognizes </connor>
<connor> "as an audio recording device. </connor>
<connor> "You're good to go." </connor>
<connor> - Tyler1 fuckin' headset
microphone all the way. </connor>
<connor> - I've heard people with
worse quality microphones </connor>
<connor> than Tyler1 screaming. </connor>
<garnt> They're charging, like,
$20 with commercial rights </garnt>
<garnt> as an option. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> - What commercial? </garnt>
<garnt> - How do you not know
what a good microphone is, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know that you should be charging </garnt>
<garnt> for commercial rights? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, these two things are like, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> But then Fiverr does, like,
scummy things as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, Fiverr takes cuts
from, like, the tips, </garnt>
<joey> and Fiverr also, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't like personally
that Fiverr charges extra </joey>
<joey> for, like, higher quality audio files. </joey>
<joey> I just think you should
just send them a WAV file. </joey>
<connor> Or high quality MP3s. </connor>
<connor> - So are people just sending MP3s- </connor>
<connor> - 128 kilobytes MP3. </connor>
<connor> - Fuckin' putting the WAV
behind jail or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they put like WAV files
behind paywalls some times. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, why? </garnt>
<garnt> Don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> Just give me the fuckin' WAV file. </garnt>
<joey> Why would you not do that? </joey>
<joey> That's, like, difference
between high and low quality. </joey>
<connor> It doesn't matter. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know fuckin' </connor>
<connor> the voice acting industry had DLC now. </connor>
<garnt> Jesus Christ! </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> That's literally DLC. </garnt>
<garnt> - The WAV expansion. </garnt>
<garnt> - You want the ray tracing
voice acting pack add on. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you gotta fuckin' pay $5 extra. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's, like, there's people on Fiverr </garnt>
<garnt> who, you know, charge industry rates. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't think Fiverr given the, </garnt>
<garnt> Fiverr shouldn't be charging
industry rates in my opinion </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's like not really
where you should be hiring. </garnt>
<garnt> Industry shouldn't be hiring on Fiverr, </garnt>
<garnt> and the ones that do I think
should be kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know. </garnt>
<garnt> We won't get into that. </garnt>
<garnt> I never had that experience myself. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, no, I mean it's difficult, </garnt>
<connor> and Fiverr voice actors are, </connor>
<connor> just listen to their audio. </connor>
<connor> You'll know if they're worth it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's not just Fiverr audios. </connor>
<connor> It's Fiverr- </connor>
<connor> - Everything. </connor>
<connor> - Everything, every creative
job you can think of. </connor>
<connor> The way I feel about Fiverr
is that a good testing ground </connor>
<connor> 'cause you've got such a wide range. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like it would be a good place </connor>
<connor> to build up your portfolio </connor>
<joey> because from what I see, like, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't really matter </joey>
<joey> where you had your education or whatever. </joey>
<joey> What we really care about </joey>
<joey> 'cause most of the time
we are the clients now. </joey>
<joey> We're buying the service. </joey>
<joey> We just care about your portfolio. </joey>
<joey> That's the thing that's
most important to me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, show me your work. </connor>
<connor> - It's a good place to build
up your portfolio as well </connor>
<connor> and also get paid. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I used to recommend
to voice actors, you know, </connor>
<connor> if no one's hiring you, you
don't know where to start, </connor>
<connor> you know, don't go to
one of these websites </connor>
<connor> that costs, like, $400
a year to sign up too </connor>
<connor> 'cause you're not gonna
make your money back. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like for example, </connor>
<connor> if we're hiring video editors, </connor>
<connor> like we can get emails about people </connor>
<connor> who are qualified for X, Y, and Z. </connor>
<joey> But at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> we're most likely gonna pick people </joey>
<joey> who have worked on anime videos </joey>
<joey> 'cause we know they
have experience working </joey>
<joey> in that fuckin' field. </joey>
<joey> - Or who, like, actually know us </joey>
<joey> and, like, watch our videos and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> So, that's the thing. </joey>
<connor> It's more about knowing
your target audience </connor>
<connor> and knowing what your
personal branding is. </connor>
<connor> And it's less important
about what you put on your CV </connor>
<connor> because we don't really
care about CVs that much. </connor>
<connor> - I don't give a shit
what school you went to. </connor>
<joey> Is the shit good or not? </joey>
<joey> Like, it's all there is to it. </joey>
<joey> - There's lots of video editors out there. </joey>
<joey> It's just a matter of- </joey>
<connor> - I normally go to,
like, Fiverr or somewhere </connor>
<garnt> for like if I need something,
like, one off and, like, fast. </garnt>
<joey> Like, I just like, because other times </joey>
<connor> it's a bit of a pain to search around. </connor>
<joey> - Have you used Fiverr other
than in your Fiverr videos? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I've used it. </joey>
<connor> I used it for, where did I use it? </connor>
<connor> If I need something composed. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't know any composers. </connor>
<connor> Like, making music. </connor>
<connor> - I go from knowing zero
composers to Kevin Penkin. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I can't go, "Oh, Kevin mate. </connor>
<connor> "I got this video idea. </connor>
<connor> "Could you just compose
me a track for it?" </connor>
<garnt> Like, so I'll go to someone I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm only like make it,
like, a middy track of this </garnt>
<garnt> or make, like, a version of that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's normally very basic, like, thing </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm, like, "Copy this thing." </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I mean, I think I've had, like, </garnt>
<joey> some emotes on my Twitch drawn there. </joey>
<joey> It was pretty decent. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, there's a lot of
Twitch stuff on there. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, there's a lot of
artists on Fiverr, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, oh my god, there's so many. </connor>
<connor> - Or "artists." </connor>
<connor> - Is that where you get your Twitch stuff? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I've actually been looking to try </garnt>
<garnt> and, like, upgrade my Twitch presentation </garnt>
<connor> because my Twitch
presentation is fuckin' shit </connor>
<connor> because I've never given the
shit about streaming before. </connor>
<connor> - Problem is on Fiverr,
it's tailored towards, like, </connor>
<garnt> I think what the like
general audience of people </garnt>
<garnt> who are looking to get into
live streaming would want. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's all like very gamer looking. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean
when I say that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, 90% of the Fiverr
stuff for, like, Twitch, </garnt>
<joey> like, Twitch overlays
all looks like something </joey>
<joey> that is an application to the FaZe Clan. </joey>
<joey> Like, it doesn't look like- </joey>
<joey> - It's like the default ones </joey>
<joey> that you get on, like, Streamlabs, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, which is why I think
I ended up hiring someone </connor>
<connor> who I know that did a lot of this stuff </connor>
<joey> and who watched some of my stuff. </joey>
<garnt> So they were kind of
familiar with my stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm thinking to update mine as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And I met an artist recently </garnt>
<garnt> who probably gonna get to hire </garnt>
<garnt> because yeah, at the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, right now I'm using,
like, a default one. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, should probably
personalize it a little more, </garnt>
<connor> make it stand out a little bit. </connor>
<connor> - How'd you guys find artists? </connor>
<connor> You just DM people on Twitter? </connor>
<connor> - I just tweet out or,
like, ask on live streams. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Hey guys, I need something. </connor>
<connor> "Can someone tell me like where I go?" </connor>
<joey> - A lot of them actually
I find through, like, </joey>
<garnt> them doing fan art of me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like the person I'm
probably gonna be hiring soon </garnt>
<garnt> is Rocket Cat who did
like a bunch of, like, </garnt>
<connor> drawings with me and Chris,
the journey across Japan stuff. </connor>
<garnt> And it was really fuckin' cute. </garnt>
<garnt> So I asked her and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can you do some Twitch stuff?" </garnt>
<connor> And she was like, "Okay." </connor>
<joey> So just asking around really. </joey>
<connor> - I have, like, no idea what art is worth, </connor>
<joey> so whatever they give me,
if it's not ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sure, fuck it. </joey>
<connor> I'll pay that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm way more comfortable
being like, "What do you want?" </connor>
<connor> You know, versus like,
"I'll give you $15." </connor>
<joey> - There's always a debate, right? </joey>
<connor> Is it you as the buyer should ask </connor>
<garnt> or should the person, the client, say, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, this is what I'm worth." </garnt>
<garnt> Because it frustrates me when I hear like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What's your budget?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, I don't
have a fuckin' budget. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you worth? </garnt>
<garnt> - What's your hourly rate? </garnt>
<garnt> You tell me. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> I understand that that's in place </garnt>
<garnt> for people who can't maybe
afford, like, a lot of things. </garnt>
<garnt> But I'm like, "I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> "Whatever you think it's
worth, tell me, I'll pay it." </connor>
<connor> - It's like a fuckin' standoff, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, you're
waiting for the first one </connor>
<garnt> to, like, say a number. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, how much is this worth? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what's your budget? </garnt>
<joey> I fuckin' hate that debate! </joey>
<joey> - I get it from the artist's perspective </joey>
<joey> because like, they're probably like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, if I say something
that's a little too high </joey>
<joey> "then I'm afraid I might lose the client." </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> That's when you can negotiate, right? </joey>
<joey> You can be like, "Ah, I think
that's a little too high." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but a lot of them starting off </joey>
<joey> don't know any better. </joey>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> - I was afraid at first as well. </connor>
<connor> Like, when you know, I'd get
sponsorship opportunities </connor>
<joey> they'd be like, "What do you want for it?" </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "Ah, fuck. </connor>
<joey> "I don't know. </joey>
<connor> "How much do you have?" </connor>
<connor> - Have either you been ever
good at, like, bartering or? </connor>
<joey> - I love doing it. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I've learned to do it </joey>
<joey> just 'cause my dad was really good at it. </joey>
<connor> - I fuckin' suck at it, man. </connor>
<connor> This is why I love Japan </connor>
<connor> where everything is labeled and priced. </connor>
<garnt> Because whenever I go to Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> you just play this dance
around everything you buy, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it is a fuckin'
dance where you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, okay, so you're gonna charge me that? </garnt>
<connor> "Well, I'm gonna, like, say a
price that's 10 times lower." </connor>
<joey> - In Australia it's, like, a
dance that you will only dance </joey>
<joey> if you decide to enter the ring. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's like, you can stand back
and just kind of be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this is how much you want? </joey>
<joey> "All right then." </joey>
<joey> Pull your wallet out. </joey>
<connor> But then you could also be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hold on, let me roll up
my sleeves real quick. </connor>
<connor> "Let's samba, baby." </connor>
<connor> Because like my dad was so fuckin', </connor>
<connor> 'cause my dad has been,
like, an IT salesman </connor>
<connor> for, like, the past 30 years. </connor>
<connor> So this man, I don't know
how the fuck he did it, </connor>
<connor> but I remember, like, when
I was in, like, high school </connor>
<connor> or something and I wanted
to buy my first guitar, </connor>
<garnt> like a proper electric guitar. </garnt>
<garnt> And he bought me like this like
really nice Epiphone guitar </garnt>
<garnt> which is worth like
two grand or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And he looked at it and he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "So this is just the guitar, right?" </garnt>
<garnt> And the guy's like, "Yeah." </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "Can I have
a chat with you, mate?" </garnt>
<connor> And he took the dude back
behind the counter into a room. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Hold on, son." </connor>
<connor> - Did he fuckin' beat him up? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know! </joey>
<joey> - Why'd he have to go in the back? </joey>
<connor> Why couldn't he do it at the counter? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But he like took him to the back. </connor>
<connor> He was like, "All right, let me talk." </connor>
<joey> And then I think maybe like
10 minutes later he came out. </joey>
<joey> - It's free. </joey>
<joey> It's free. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Black eye. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He came out 10 minutes later, </joey>
<joey> and he's like, "All right,
so the guitar now is 1500." </joey>
<joey> And he threw in a free amp. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "What did you say? </joey>
<joey> "What did you do? </joey>
<joey> "How did you do it?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "I just talked to him, mate." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Like, if it was that easy, </joey>
<joey> then everyone would be getting deals. </joey>
<joey> It's not just a matter of,
"Oh, I just talked to him." </joey>
<connor> - Well, what did you say to him? </connor>
<garnt> Everyone can talk. </garnt>
<garnt> - He'll never know. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, "What did you say?" </joey>
<joey> - Did he do a fuckin' Jedi mind trick? </joey>
<joey> That's technically
fuckin' talkin' isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Did you like inception,
like, plant the seed? </connor>
<joey> And he's just like, "It's 1500 now." </joey>
<connor> - The first time I ever
saw, like, bartering happen, </connor>
<garnt> I was like, my mind was blown. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Wait, you can go against
the price that's written?" </garnt>
<garnt> - You can do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's an option? </garnt>
<garnt> Because, like, we were on
a school trip to New York. </garnt>
<joey> It was the first time
our school ever, like, </joey>
<joey> went to a different country. </joey>
<joey> - You got to go to New York for school? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> It was chaos. </garnt>
<garnt> It was pure fuckin' chaos. </garnt>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - How old were you? </connor>
<connor> - 16 I think. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - It was an absolute mess, bro. </connor>
<connor> - The only school trips I went to was </connor>
<connor> just, like, France at most. </connor>
<connor> That was the furthest that I've
ever gone to a school trip. </connor>
<connor> - That was, like, the bougiest one. </connor>
<garnt> And for some reason, for one
year, they never did it again. </garnt>
<garnt> I think they realized
it was horrible mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> They took us to New York. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a fuckin' mess. </garnt>
<garnt> It was awful. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, if I was a teacher
there I would have hated it. </garnt>
<garnt> I had a great time. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I remember
it was very expensive, </garnt>
<garnt> but we stayed in, like,
really fuckin' sketchy motels. </garnt>
<garnt> I can talk about it more after the story, </garnt>
<garnt> but we were basically like, </garnt>
<garnt> I really wanted converse </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause obviously when you're like 15, 16, </garnt>
<garnt> you see the shit on, like, American TV, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like, "Yo, Converse." </garnt>
<garnt> So I went to a store and
my friend was with me, </garnt>
<garnt> and he was in the year above me. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Man, I want to get these. </garnt>
<garnt> "But I've only got like 30 bucks left </garnt>
<garnt> "and they're 40 bucks." </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "Oh, I'll ask
him if we can do it for 30." </garnt>
<garnt> He was like 17, bartering with him. </garnt>
<garnt> And then eventually he said, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'll give you for 30 if
you give me a $2 tip." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Is that okay? </garnt>
<garnt> "Are you allowed to do that?" </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if he's the owner or what, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's what he got it down to. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was so impressed. </garnt>
<garnt> When I went home to the
UK, I tried to do it, </garnt>
<garnt> but immediately all the
stores are like, "No." </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what store was this? </connor>
<connor> - In America or the UK? </connor>
<connor> - In America. </connor>
<connor> - Was it an official store? </connor>
<connor> - I think it was like in a mall, </connor>
<connor> and it was like an
independent store maybe? </connor>
<connor> I think that's why I got away with it. </connor>
<connor> So I went to like a fuckin'
supermarket in the UK, </connor>
<connor> go to the theater- </connor>
<connor> - Go to fuckin' Tesco. </connor>
<joey> - Five pounds is a little
too much for this meal deal. </joey>
<connor> - You're selling me this
Kellogg's fuckin' Krispy Kremes </connor>
<connor> for like how much? </connor>
<connor> - I'll be like, you know, </connor>
<joey> "Three pounds is a little expensive. </joey>
<joey> "Could you do 2.50?" </joey>
<joey> - "Yeah, I'll do 2.50. </joey>
<joey> "I'll do 2.50." </joey>
<joey> - "I'll give ya 2.50." </joey>
<joey> She's like, "No, no." </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, oh, okay, fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I never tried
it again for awhile. </garnt>
<garnt> But I like going to
places where you can do it </garnt>
<connor> because I like trying to do it. </connor>
<connor> I don't often succeed though. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know how, like, </joey>
<joey> I probably could do it
if I really wanted to, </joey>
<connor> but I'm always just so fuckin'
afraid to do it as well. </connor>
<connor> - You're like um. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause with that kind of stuff, </connor>
<connor> if you're not coming in with confidence, </connor>
<connor> you're basically fucked. </connor>
<joey> There's no way you're gonna win it. </joey>
<joey> - You need to come in with,
like, a winning mentality. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta come up in with,
like, the biggest dick energy. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I can do it. </joey>
<joey> It just takes so much fuckin' energy. </joey>
<garnt> But whenever you're in a
place in, like, Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like 90% of the stores you go to, </garnt>
<garnt> and you just want a store
where you pay the price </garnt>
<garnt> that they originally ask for </garnt>
<connor> and just not have to like do
this mini game every time. </connor>
<connor> - I remember I watched like the, </connor>
<garnt> I think I mentioned him
on the YouTube rep series. </garnt>
<garnt> He does videos about Prague. </garnt>
<garnt> He covers, like, taxi scams. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was in Prague, and I had a taxi, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like this is
like in the simulations. </garnt>
<garnt> This is exactly what he spoke about </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they were trying to charge me </garnt>
<garnt> what he said was being overcharged. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I was with my mate in a taxi. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "No, no I've
seen the YouTube video. </garnt>
<garnt> "I've got this." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "I'm not paying that. </garnt>
<garnt> "That's too much." </garnt>
<garnt> And eventually we got
it, like, half the price. </garnt>
<garnt> It was supposed to be, like, 50 euros </garnt>
<garnt> for like the equivalent in Czech money </garnt>
<garnt> for, like, it was supposed
to be, like, half that. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like only like a 20
minute, like 15 minute journey. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "No, I've
seen the simulations. </garnt>
<garnt> "I know this is right." </garnt>
<connor> And there's YouTube channels of dudes </connor>
<connor> who go around India, like, bartering. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I can imagine bartering in
India is just like next level. </connor>
<connor> That's like expert mode, man. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally, </connor>
<connor> it looks like a reality TV
show with every purchase. </connor>
<connor> The guy's like, "I'm walking away. </connor>
<garnt> "I'm going, I'm not getting in your taxi." </garnt>
<garnt> And then they're like following him. </garnt>
<joey> - "No, no, no, please, please!" </joey>
<connor> - "Please, please, sir!" </connor>

<joey> - Thank you to Princess Connect Re:Dive </joey>
<connor> for sponsoring this episode. </connor>
<connor> Back to the video. </connor>
<joey> - Get good, Conner. </joey>
<garnt> Get good. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, back to my
school trip to America. </garnt>
<connor> It was my first time
ever going to America. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember there was two things. </joey>
<connor> I was really excited for going to America. </connor>
<connor> What do you think they were? </connor>
<joey> - In-N-Out? </joey>
<connor> - No, I didn't go there. </connor>
<joey> I only went to New York. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you only went to New York. </joey>
<joey> - The food? </joey>
<joey> - I wanted two things from
what I'd seen from media. </joey>
<joey> I wanted Twinkies, </joey>
<joey> and I wanted Mountain Dew. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, do they not
have Mountain Dew in UK? </joey>
<joey> - They do, but it's not, like, </joey>
<joey> it's the stuff without,
like, the green stuff in it </joey>
<joey> because that stuff's illegal in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Is it? </joey>
<connor> - Our Mountain Dew just
tastes like Sprite. </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<connor> - We have it, but it's not that popular </connor>
<joey> and it doesn't taste
like Mountain Dew at all. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - It's not proper Mountain Dew. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is in Mountain Dew </connor>
<joey> that makes it illegal in the UK? </joey>
<connor> - The stuff that makes it super green. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Like, 'cause I'm pretty sure, like, </connor>
<connor> all the sodas in the UK </connor>
<connor> you're not allowed to
use corn syrup either. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - So, like Coke and soda
in America tastes different </connor>
<connor> from, like, sodas in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Ours does have less sugar in it as well. </connor>
<connor> - It has, like, a little less
sugar, and you can taste it. </connor>
<joey> You can definitely taste the difference. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> The first time I had,
like, proper Mountain Dew, </connor>
<joey> or I guess now I know is
proper Mountain Dew in America, </joey>
<joey> was like- </joey>
<connor> - Australia might have
different, it might not. </connor>
<connor> But Twinkies are shit. </connor>
<joey> Twinkies tastes like ass. </joey>
<joey> - Why did you think it was good? </joey>
<joey> - Because in all the TV shows </joey>
<garnt> they made Twinkies look amazing! </garnt>
<garnt> - Did they? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - From what TV show? </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe like "Zombie Land"
or something actually </garnt>
<garnt> because he's obsessed with
them in "Zombie Land." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then I also learned that they, like, </garnt>
<garnt> can survive nukes or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think that's true at all. </garnt>
<connor> But in "Family Guy-" </connor>
<joey> - It's like survival food. </joey>
<garnt> - I wonder how much Twinkies
paid "Zombie Land" like </garnt>
<connor> to fuckin' promote. </connor>
<connor> - That was fantastic advertising. </connor>
<connor> - That was like five head
advertising right there. </connor>
<connor> - I went there as a teenager,
and I fuckin' wanted Twinkies. </connor>
<joey> - The shitty spongy thing
that you put into your mouth, </joey>
<connor> survival food. </connor>
<joey> During an apocalypse. </joey>
<connor> - My God, so like I'm prone
to getting like nosebleeds </connor>
<garnt> as well until I got my nose cauterized </garnt>
<garnt> which is like, when you
get like fuckin' burn it. </garnt>
<garnt> So, if it got like even remotely
hot I would get nosebleeds. </garnt>
<joey> So when I went to America,
it was just too hot </joey>
<connor> 'cause it was in the summer </connor>
<connor> and I just every day I had nose bleeds. </connor>
<joey> - How hot does it get in
New York in the summer? </joey>
<connor> - It's pretty damn hot. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty humid. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember I went to
New York once in the summer, </connor>
<connor> and it was like pretty hot and humid. </connor>
<connor> Like, in the 30s. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why I thought </joey>
<joey> because it's so cold in the winter </joey>
<joey> I would assume it got, like,
quite cool in the summer. </joey>
<connor> - It was great though </connor>
<connor> 'cause any of the like
really boring places, </connor>
<connor> I would just be like, come on. </connor>
<garnt> And then I'd get to go get
ice cream or something. </garnt>
<garnt> The staff would go take me out. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause we were like going
through like one museum </garnt>
<joey> that was really fucking boring. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember what it was as a kid. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's the big museum
in New York, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, the Smithsonian was pretty cool </joey>
<joey> 'cause that has, like,
loads of exhibits and stuff. </joey>
<joey> There was some other
museum they took us to </joey>
<joey> which was like, maybe it was, like, </joey>
<joey> some CIA thing that was, like, just books. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I have
no interest in this. </joey>
<joey> - I have no interest. </joey>
<connor> Pow! </connor>
<connor> - They just like, let us go
around Times Square on our own. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> That could have gone horrendously wrong. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that sounds really dangerous. </joey>
<joey> Like, Times Square is like- </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't let my 16 year old kid. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even feel safe
during the day in Times Square </joey>
<connor> let alone at a night. </connor>
<connor> - I don't feel safe as an adult there </connor>
<joey> let alone like a 16 year old kid. </joey>
<connor> - And I remember (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's just so funny. </connor>
<connor> One of the kids came back
and he had a bunch of CDs. </connor>
<connor> And we were like, "Why do you have CDs?" </connor>
<garnt> He's like, "Oh, well the
guys kept coming up to me </garnt>
<garnt> "and telling me if I
wanted to hear them spit. </garnt>
<garnt> "So I kept having to buy
them for five dollars." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, you know, the
dudes come up to you like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yo, here's mix tape." </garnt>
<connor> He was paying every time for
everyone that came up to him. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - So he just has all of
these, like, shitty mix tapes. </joey>
<connor> - I can't remember what I did. </connor>
<connor> I think I just went around all the stores, </connor>
<garnt> just looked at it and be like,
"Wow, it's just so strange." </garnt>
<garnt> Would go in like M&M World and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Wow, I can't afford any of it." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Because it would be like
$10 for a pack of M&Ms. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Wow, I'm really broke, huh? </garnt>
<joey> "My parents really didn't
give me enough money." </joey>
<joey> - Can't even afford M&Ms. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> I remember as well, our
hotel, they put us in, like, </joey>
<joey> I think it's like the sun
inn, what is that called? </joey>
<connor> It's like the Comfort Inn or something? </connor>
<connor> Is that what it's called? </connor>
<connor> The chain? </connor>
<connor> - It's the sun... </connor>
<connor> - It's got like a sun logo. </connor>
<connor> I think it's called Comfort Inn. </connor>
<connor> And I remember we were all baffled </connor>
<connor> because the only thing they had </connor>
<connor> for breakfast was like burgers
that could be microwaved. </connor>
<joey> And it was disgusting. </joey>
<joey> We were all like, "Yeah, American food!" </joey>
<joey> We ate it, and we were
like, "Oh, American food." </joey>
<joey> - It's like some White Castle shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was gross. </joey>
<garnt> I remember as well that we
had to get the bus everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just the worst
'cause they tried to fit, </garnt>
<connor> like they used public
buses, like private coaches. </connor>
<connor> - The more you're talking
the more I'm realizing </connor>
<connor> who decided to go on a
school trip to New York? </connor>
<connor> - I think it must have been one teacher </connor>
<joey> that really fuckin' wanted to go. </joey>
<joey> - It makes sense that they
didn't do it the year after. </joey>
<garnt> - So, we would go on,
like, the public buses. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, the whole, like, </garnt>
<joey> 40 kids would go on a normal public bus. </joey>
<joey> It was already full. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and then all the dudes
were like topless on the bus. </joey>
<joey> And we were like, "Oh God,
oh God, I'm in danger." </joey>
<connor> And then when the teachers
would all go to bed, </connor>
<connor> all the fuckin' kids
just went out at night. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> And we were in 'cause we were obviously, </connor>
<joey> we were like not a rich school at all. </joey>
<joey> So we were in, like, the really
sketchy part of New York. </joey>
<joey> - But you're rich enough
to go to New York though. </joey>
<connor> - Not really. </connor>
<connor> I remember the whole trip
for like four or five days </connor>
<connor> with flights and five
hotels was, like, 800 pounds </connor>
<joey> and everything was taken for. </joey>
<joey> - I guess that has to
compensate for the flights. </joey>
<garnt> - Very budget, very budget. </garnt>
<connor> So the hotels we stayed in
were, like, not good at all. </connor>
<connor> - Were they, like, in the ghetto? </connor>
<connor> - Bro, we were hella. </connor>
<connor> Imagine it, you've got like 40 just, like, </connor>
<joey> white school kids that have
no idea what's going on. </joey>
<joey> Then they break out at
night in like a ghetto. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh God. </joey>
<joey> - Were you guys in, like,
Harlem or something? </joey>
<joey> - I can't remember where we
were, but we were very far away. </joey>
<joey> It was like a 40 minute
bus journey into town. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Jesus, that could've
been anywhere sketch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think we were- </joey>
<joey> - Like Queens maybe. </joey>
<joey> - I think we might've been
around somewhere like that. </joey>
<joey> It was definitely, I remember that, </joey>
<garnt> I remember having these, </garnt>
<garnt> because you would see on the
movies that New York was like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah man, it's bustling, it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Why is where we're staying
everything is boarded up </garnt>
<joey> "and dirty? </joey>
<joey> "What's up with that?" </joey>
<joey> - Because the hustling
bustling is like two blocks </joey>
<connor> in Manhattan. </connor>
<connor> - I distinctly remember I
really didn't like New York, </connor>
<connor> and I liked DC because when we went to DC, </connor>
<connor> it was really nice. </connor>
<connor> And I remember that </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was just scared
when we were in New York. </connor>
<connor> - That was my first impression
going to New York as well. </connor>
<garnt> I also went when, I was a bit older. </garnt>
<connor> So I was like 22 or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like when you're 16 and 22, </connor>
<connor> the way you see the world
is completely different. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I still had this, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> the American film image of New York. </connor>
<connor> And I remember my first time going there, </connor>
<connor> I remember thinking, </connor>
<connor> "Man, there's a lot of street
corners that I've never seen </connor>
<connor> "in any films that look
pretty fuckin' dodgy." </connor>
<connor> - This is where, like,
Spider-Man's parents got killed. </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing. </joey>
<joey> When I went to New York
like four or five years ago, </joey>
<joey> like, it was really good </joey>
<connor> as long as your neck was
like above, like, landscape. </connor>
<connor> Like, "Wow, these buildings
look really good." </connor>
<connor> And the moment you look
down and just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, that's a lot of trash." </joey>
<connor> - That was my first impression. </connor>
<connor> There is a lot of trash </connor>
<connor> that just has never appeared on any films. </connor>
<joey> - Like, there is mountain
of trash on this corner </joey>
<joey> that is like reaching,
like, traffic lights. </joey>
<connor> - Like, my God, going to
Chinatown for the first time, </connor>
<garnt> it don't hit different. </garnt>
<connor> It smell differently, man. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - This is episode 33
where we clown on America. </connor>
<joey> - Actually I remember on stream yesterday, </joey>
<joey> I had a person coming and being like, </joey>
<connor> "Why do you guys hate America?" </connor>
<connor> - We don't hate America. </connor>
<joey> I love how absurd America is. </joey>
<connor> - The way I talk about Americans is </connor>
<joey> like the way I like to shit on my cousins. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> It's like the distant cousin </joey>
<joey> that I just like to talk shit about. </joey>
<connor> - We don't hate on America. </connor>
<connor> We just like making fun of America. </connor>
<joey> There's a big difference. </joey>
<joey> - You know, Europe's boring. </joey>
<connor> There's nothing weird about it. </connor>
<connor> America is weird to a T, </connor>
<connor> and that's why I love it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no, it comes from a place of love. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> This is how us Brits show like, </connor>
<connor> we, you know, we talk
shit to our like mates. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's how I see it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Innit, oh, your teeth are shit. </connor>
<joey> "Go drink and some tea." </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "Wait, why
are you making fun of America?" </joey>
<connor> - Call your mates "cunts,"
and ya call cunts "mate." </connor>
<connor> That's how it works. </connor>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> Would you ever live in America? </connor>
<connor> Have I asked this before on the podcast? </connor>
<joey> - I don't think you've
asked me on the podcast. </joey>
<connor> - I think I've asked you personally. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Can't remember what your answer was. </connor>
<joey> That's why I'm asking again. </joey>
<joey> - I mean like, I've given it- </joey>
<connor> - You're dating, because
you're both with Americans. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we hate Americans. </garnt>
<connor> We hate America, we hate
Americans so much so </connor>
<joey> that are significant others are </joey>
<connor> from that country.
- Are Americans. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know the way Sydney talks to me </connor>
<connor> about food sometimes
with, like, a nostalgia. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, disgusting. </connor>
<joey> Gosh. </joey>
<joey> - I've considered living in
America for maybe like a year </joey>
<joey> just to like give it a go. </joey>
<connor> - Like, it's an asylum. </connor>
<joey> I would go there to visit, you know? </joey>
<connor> - Like, for real I don't hate visiting. </connor>
<connor> Like, I love visiting
America, but I don't, like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Just difference in
personality at least with me </connor>
<connor> and, like, way of living is, like, </connor>
<connor> it's very different to
what I'm used to open. </connor>
<joey> - I love how open everyone is. </joey>
<connor> - I do love how open everything is, </connor>
<connor> open everyone is. </connor>
<connor> I feel like the biggest thing
I would have to get to is, </connor>
<joey> like, I like feeling safe. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - No, legit, legit. </connor>
<garnt> The only thing stopping me
from living in America is </garnt>
<joey> the fact that even during
the day I don't feel safe. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like it's so weird for me </connor>
<connor> where you can be in some
of the most famous places </connor>
<garnt> in the world in America, and
you just can't walk anywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> I like walking to places,
you know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Japan is all
about walking everywhere. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like I have to
recalibrate my brain in order </garnt>
<garnt> to travel to places in America </garnt>
<garnt> because I forget that you
have to just drive everywhere </garnt>
<garnt> and just walking isn't normalized </garnt>
<garnt> because, you know, it's just not safe. </garnt>
<joey> - Even when you're in like
the middle of LA, right? </joey>
<connor> Like, you'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you know, I'll just
like go to the Starbucks </connor>
<connor> "that's just around the corner." </connor>
<connor> You know, it's like just going
to the next town in an RPG. </connor>
<connor> And yet on the street corner, </connor>
<joey> there's a level 100 crackhead
standing there being like, </joey>
<joey> "You gonna come passed me?" </joey>
<connor> - When I was in San Francisco, man, </connor>
<joey> just walking back to my
hotel at 2:00 AM felt </joey>
<joey> like a Cyberpunk mission, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<joey> It's scary there! </joey>
<connor> - The fuckin' music
was playing in my ears. </connor>
<connor> - The fact that you said
you walked back at 2:00 AM </connor>
<connor> just like already scares me. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I legit have never been scared </connor>
<joey> just walking somewhere. </joey>
<joey> I was right in the middle </joey>
<garnt> of like the financial
district in San Francisco. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've mentioned it
before on the podcast a while. </garnt>
<joey> But yeah, that was fuckin' scary. </joey>
<joey> Fuck, I'm scared. </joey>
<joey> I'm scared thinking about it. </joey>
<joey> - That's the only thing that's stopping me </joey>
<joey> from living in America. </joey>
<connor> - Also everyone I know from San Francisco </connor>
<connor> has had their car broken into. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've heard so many
weird stories about, like, </connor>
<connor> some of the stories that Meilyne says </connor>
<connor> 'cause Meilyne is from San Fran </connor>
<connor> where it's one of it's, like, </connor>
<connor> it's so counter-intuitive for
me where this is the place </connor>
<connor> where it's got like one of, like, </connor>
<connor> the highest cost of living in the world. </connor>
<connor> - Pay like a million dollars
a year to live there. </connor>
<connor> - Like, a millionaire is
considered like poor there. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> That's kind of the place
we're talking about, </garnt>
<garnt> yet it's a place where the
cost of living is so high, </garnt>
<garnt> yet it seems like you still need to worry </garnt>
<garnt> about some of the stuff </garnt>
<garnt> where I feel like if I'm
earning a million dollars, </garnt>
<joey> I wouldn't need to worry about it. </joey>
<connor> Like, why would I need to worry? </connor>
<joey> Like why would I need to pay this much </joey>
<joey> and worry about living in a neighborhood </joey>
<joey> where my car could get broken into? </joey>
<joey> Yet, it feels like everyone </joey>
<connor> who I've met from San Fran
has had something stolen </connor>
<joey> or something robbed. </joey>
<garnt> - They talk about that
as if they got, like, </garnt>
<garnt> a parking ticket. </garnt>
<connor> You know, it's like, "Ah, shit. </connor>
<joey> "Got it again. </joey>
<connor> "Oh, well." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, when Meilyne was talking </joey>
<joey> about how she has to have
like one headphone in </joey>
<joey> just in case of someone
behind her to, like, </joey>
<connor> take her purse or something, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<joey> - Like, why would you, how
do you feel safe living </joey>
<joey> in a city like that or a country
like that for that matter? </joey>
<connor> - This is why I'm convinced
the Cyber truck's being made. </connor>
<joey> It's purely so it can withstand criminals </joey>
<joey> in San Francisco breaking in. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's gonna be in, like, </joey>
<joey> fuckin', like, armored
trucks in San Francisco. </joey>
<connor> But they'll still find
a way to break into it. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing, </connor>
<joey> the only places I feel
safe in America are, like, </joey>
<joey> the super tourist heavy places right. </joey>
<joey> So like the piers in San Francisco, </joey>
<joey> or like, you know, fuckin' Vegas strip. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, UK's somewhere
in the middle I think. </connor>
<connor> Like, you can't really,
like, leave your laptop </connor>
<connor> on the dashboard really? </connor>
<joey> - I would argue though,
like, other than Japan, </joey>
<connor> there's not a lot of countries
where you can do that. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, not really. </joey>
<joey> But like in the UK, I'd leave, like, </joey>
<joey> my headphones on the chair. </joey>
<garnt> I don't really mind risking that. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I wouldn't even do that. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, it depends where you are. </joey>
<joey> London? </joey>
<connor> No. </connor>
<connor> Like, Wales? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's whatever. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, because
that's countryside, right? </joey>
<connor> - What are they gonna do? </connor>
<joey> Run away with the sheep? </joey>
<joey> - Get on the sheep. </joey>
<joey> "All right, go, go, go!" </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's weird. </joey>
<joey> I've always said this
I've always wanted to live </joey>
<joey> in America for a year. </joey>
<joey> - I would like to live in America for- </joey>
<joey> - I wouldn't mind trying it out. </joey>
<connor> - I think if I moved from Japan, </connor>
<connor> I think I would like to try and get- </connor>
<connor> - I'm still like because
me and Sydney want to move </connor>
<connor> to America for a bit </connor>
<connor> because, like, her family's there </connor>
<connor> and, you know, she wants
to be close to her family </connor>
<joey> for a while. </joey>
<joey> It's just finding the perfect place </joey>
<joey> that I would actually want
to live in for a while. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't know where I
could see myself settling down </joey>
<connor> in America. </connor>
<joey> - Because like, you know,
for YouTubers it's, like, </joey>
<joey> the number one spot is always
LA, but fuck living in LA. </joey>
<joey> Sorry if you're from LA. </joey>
<connor> - No, it's not about LA. </connor>
<connor> It's about LA YouTubers, man. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - LA YouTubers are different beasts, man. </joey>
<connor> - They are a different breed. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like there's literally
just two scenes on YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube and LA YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> It's totally different. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, and you know, when
someone's living in LA I swear </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause when you talk to them, you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Bro, you're just, like,
in another reality." </garnt>
<joey> - "You sound brainwashed." </joey>
<garnt> - But I get it because
like when you're there, </garnt>
<garnt> like, you feel it. </garnt>
<connor> You feel like you're in a
different place when you're in LA, </connor>
<connor> and you feel like everything you do </connor>
<connor> somehow has a bigger weight to it I think. </connor>
<connor> I think that's what they think. </connor>
<connor> - Everything's like
brand, fuckin' marketing. </connor>
<joey> - We were talking about
clout chasing before, </joey>
<connor> LA's like the epicenter
of clout chasing I feel. </connor>
<joey> Like, everyone's out to get some clout. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel dirty when I'm there. </joey>
<connor> When I'm talking to people. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just, like, I'm just
trying to get Starbucks, bro. </connor>
<connor> Like, why are we talking
about how many subs you have? </connor>
<joey> Like, I don't care. </joey>
<connor> - But did you see, like, that
Dunkey video where he, like, </connor>
<connor> did a commentary over- </connor>
<garnt> - The 100 Thieves. </garnt>
<garnt> - The 100 Thieves one. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, the house! </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the 100 Thieves house. </connor>
<joey> - 100 Thieves is an E-sports
organization made by Nadeshot </joey>
<garnt> who used to be a YouTuber. </garnt>
<connor> But yeah, he started one,
so he has his own little, </connor>
<connor> you want to go tell the rest of it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so he basically
commentates over, like, </connor>
<connor> this house tour. </connor>
<connor> And it is like, the way
Dunkey commentates it is </connor>
<connor> basically like you're going
into a different fuckin' world </connor>
<connor> 'cause what was like the room? </connor>
<connor> Like the fuckin' </connor>
<connor> - Tortino's. </connor>
<connor> - Tortino Fortnite
training room or something. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, this sounds like a, </joey>
<joey> you say out of context </joey>
<connor> and this sounds like
a dystopian nightmare. </connor>
<connor> - Every room has a
sponsor in the building. </connor>
<connor> So when you mention I'm in this room, </connor>
<connor> you have to say like, I'm in
the Monster Energy gaming room. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I want that for Trash Tastes. </connor>
<joey> - This is our Del Taco's toilet. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I'm in the Tenga recording room. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, I'll fuckin'
have Tenga sponsor us. </joey>
<connor> - Tenga coffee room. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, yes, yes. </connor>
<connor> - We should probably
explain what a Tenga is </connor>
<connor> to the audience I guess. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah 'cause YouTube
just recently got one, right? </joey>
<connor> - We got a joke gift from a friend of ours </connor>
<connor> who gave us a Tenga which is just- </connor>
<joey> - A Tenga is just a, </joey>
<connor> is a branded fleshlight. </connor>
<connor> - A fleshlight. </connor>
<garnt> No, a Japanese fleshlight. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a high class fleshlight. </connor>
<connor> - Fleshlights when I see them, </connor>
<connor> they make me look uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> Like, sorry, when I see
them I feel uncomfortable. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I see it and I'm like,
why does it look like that? </garnt>
<garnt> Why's it look like Donkey Kong's lips? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> It's fuckin' disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> What is that? </garnt>
<joey> It's so gross. </joey>
<joey> - I've never heard anyone refer to a Tenga </joey>
<joey> as Donkey Kong's lips. </joey>
<connor> - No, the stereotypical
fleshlight you see, </connor>
<joey> why would anyone want to
stick their dick in that? </joey>
<joey> It looks disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<connor> - How horny you gotta be to do that? </connor>
<connor> You know, I don't wanna know. </connor>
<connor> - Because the thing is no
one's using like a fleshlight </connor>
<connor> and actually looking at it to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, I'm like basically
fucking a pussy a now." </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like, nobody cares what it looks like. </connor>
<connor> - That's so gross. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know how Tenga
managed to make it look normal. </joey>
<joey> - No they make it look like a- </joey>
<connor> - Like an ornament. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like a sleek thing. </garnt>
<garnt> If you come to Japan, go check it out. </garnt>
<connor> They're in, like, Don Quijote. </connor>
<connor> Like, in a lot of stores. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so there's like
different types of Tenga. </connor>
<connor> I remember the first
time I heard of it was </connor>
<joey> just the Tenga eggs, which- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How do those work?
- I've never seen that. </joey>
<connor> - You've never seen them? </connor>
<garnt> It's, like, you can get like a half dozen </garnt>
<connor> or like a dozen of them. </connor>
<joey> It's in an actual, like, egg carton. </joey>
<connor> - So yeah, they sell actual egg cartons, </connor>
<connor> and there's these Tenga eggs, </connor>
<connor> which are actually like, I've never- </connor>
<connor> - Where do you put your dick in there? </connor>
<connor> - So, how does it work? </connor>
<connor> - So you have to like crack it open </connor>
<joey> and then it kind of stretches out. </joey>
<joey> So, it's basically just like- </joey>
<connor> - So wait, you literally just
crack it open on the side and- </connor>
<joey> - You kinda just fuckin' do
this and it cracks on the side. </joey>
<joey> And then basically, like,
the fleshlight part is </joey>
<garnt> kind of, like, squashed in. </garnt>
<garnt> So you like stretch it out, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you kind of just wrap it up. </garnt>
<joey> Don't ask me how I know that. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - You know what's one thing
I've never understood? </connor>
<connor> People who jack off in their socks. </connor>
<connor> What's up with that? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know anyone who
jacks off in their socks. </connor>
<joey> - I hear it all the time. </joey>
<connor> - I thought that was just an urban legend. </connor>
<connor> - There was someone in
my university who did it. </connor>
<joey> He would jack off into, </joey>
<joey> he had socks specifically for jacking off. </joey>
<joey> - Why would you give your
dick carpet burn like that? </joey>
<joey> Like, how is that fuckin'
comfortable at all? </joey>
<joey> - For some reason, </joey>
<connor> the thought of using
tissue is too much effort. </connor>
<joey> - It's like rubbing your
bare dick on the carpet. </joey>
<joey> It just sounds like it hurts. </joey>
<connor> - Is that how furries happened? </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the first step of yiffy. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how you yiff. </garnt>
<connor> - You get a taste for the
fur, you can't go back. </connor>
<joey> - But you hear it all the time, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like the whole, like,
crusty socks kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, (laughs)
that's a funny fictional thing </joey>
<connor> that never happens. </connor>
<connor> - So the guy in my one, he would use them, </connor>
<connor> like he would use his
dirty socks that he could, </connor>
<connor> you know, when you go to
bed, you take off your socks. </connor>
<connor> So, he would just throw them in his room. </connor>
<connor> Then when he was going to
do it, he would grab one. </connor>
<connor> And then he was like,
"Well, it doesn't matter. </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna wash it anyway." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "So wait, you're telling me, </connor>
<connor> "Let me get this straight. </connor>
<connor> "You might've played rugby,
you might've gone running. </connor>
<connor> "You would use that sock and then-" </connor>
<connor> - Dude, he literally gave
himself his own foot job. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> He gave himself a self
foot job, basically. </connor>
<joey> - But a sweaty stinky foot job. </joey>
<joey> - I'm so sorry to the listeners
who are grossed out by this. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I just couldn't believe it. </joey>
<connor> And I've asked people
like, "Do you do this? </connor>
<connor> "Is this is a thing? </connor>
<connor> "Do you know anyone?" </connor>
<connor> I know people who know people who do it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Why are
you friends with them? </connor>
<connor> "What's wrong with you?" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but what if they're doing like a, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, a friend of a friend of mine," </joey>
<connor> but it's actually them? </connor>
<connor> - I've heard people who
have found out, like, </connor>
<joey> the sister found their brother doing it. </joey>
<joey> I've heard that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's the worst. </joey>
<joey> - That's gross. </joey>
<joey> Imagine walking in your brother's, </joey>
<joey> you see his, like, socks. </joey>
<joey> "Why are they crusty?" </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just don't understand how they, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I've heard of people
as well using the same sock </connor>
<connor> more than once without cleaning it. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Do they want to get like a fuckin' UTI? </connor>
<connor> - It's just like the speed
run any percent to, like, </connor>
<joey> a sexual transmitted disease. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't understand. </joey>
<joey> - Chlamydia any percent. </joey>
<connor> - This is like Victorian
era syphilis simulator. </connor>
<connor> Like, what is this? </connor>
<connor> - At which point was the
tissue just too, like, </connor>
<connor> complicated to figure out? </connor>
<connor> - Get a box. </connor>
<joey> They're not hard to put on any surface. </joey>
<joey> They're flat, you know, just. </joey>
<joey> - Or if you can't even do that, </joey>
<joey> just roll of toilet paper, you know, </joey>
<joey> like that'll also suffice. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't understand. </joey>
<connor> - I mean like, dude, aside from, like, </connor>
<connor> fuckin' apparently wanking into socks </connor>
<connor> which is what we're talking about. </connor>
<joey> Do you actually know
anyone who owns, like, </joey>
<joey> a fuckin' pocket pussy? </joey>
<joey> - Like, a non Tenga? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like a non Tenga. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like people don't admit it. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's probably
way more than I realize. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know anyone who's, like I- </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they're not telling you, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> They're not telling you. </connor>
<connor> - Is it just a thing that guys
just don't tell each other? </connor>
<connor> Or is it just a thing
that guys just don't buy? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I think there's a
certain shame in admitting </connor>
<connor> that you cum into a plastic toy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I feel as well, like maybe
we're just hanging out </joey>
<joey> with, like, not those kinds of people. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] I think it's also because like- </joey>
<joey> - No, I'm kidding.
(everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Like you said, they look fuckin' ugly </joey>
<joey> and look fuckin' weird. </joey>
<connor> Like, there's no way that
your mom opens a drawer </connor>
<connor> and sees like an owner
hole or pocket pussy. </connor>
<connor> How do you explain that shit away? </connor>
<connor> - Like, to me in my mind, </connor>
<connor> it has to be like,
there's two graphs, right? </connor>
<joey> There's effort to clean it
and enjoyment I get out of it. </joey>
<joey> And it- </joey>
<joey> - Are you like midmaxing
pocket pussies right now? </joey>
<joey> - Because the problem is, right, </joey>
<joey> is that I don't want to clean it. </joey>
<joey> I don't want anything to
do with it when I'm done. </joey>
<garnt> I want it to be done and dusted. </garnt>
<garnt> You get it in a tissue,
you throw that shit away. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gone. </garnt>
<garnt> It's out of my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, worst case scenario </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm really desperate
for lube for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure I can just lube up my hand. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't want to make a mess. </garnt>
<garnt> That is like my priority here. </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to get this over with. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not trying to have, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not lighting candles,
you know, scenting the air. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just trying to get it done. </garnt>
<garnt> - Turn on the mood lights. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I don't understand, like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's that enjoyable to them </garnt>
<garnt> that they're willing to
go then to the kitchen, </garnt>
<garnt> have this shameful thing and just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "All right, I'm gonna clean out my jizz." </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't want to touch that. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to fuckin'
do anything with it. </garnt>
<garnt> I get disgusted when I get
a little bit on my hand. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh no, that won't do at all. </connor>
<joey> "Get that off." </joey>
<connor> - It's just some people
just don't care, man. </connor>
<connor> - It's just weird for me because, like, </connor>
<connor> it seems like it's, you know, </connor>
<connor> socially acceptable for
girls to have, like, </connor>
<connor> whatever sex toy they want, right? </connor>
<connor> And I mean, they sell it
on high street stores. </connor>
<connor> Like in England we have Ann Summers </connor>
<connor> where you can go in there and- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I get it. </connor>
<connor> For a guy it's like you can
do it in, like, two seconds. </connor>
<joey> Get it done, done and dusted
if you really need to. </joey>
<connor> For a girl I guess it takes longer. </connor>
<connor> It's a bit harder. </connor>
<connor> - For the girl, you
actually have to, like, </connor>
<joey> light the candles and
turn on the mood lights. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but I also imagine, like, </connor>
<connor> fingering yourself is, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't know. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's probably a little more difficult. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> - I wouldn't know that
the thumb is way harder </joey>
<garnt> than the pinky, no. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - I wouldn't know. </joey>
<garnt> - This is getting way too
graphic for this podcast. </garnt>
<connor> - Cut that, cut that. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you though? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<joey> Fingered myself? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, me neither. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay Joey, what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm guessing we're cutting this. </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck? </garnt>
<connor> Where the fuck did that come from? </connor>
<connor> - Are you admitting that
you fingered yourself? </connor>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<connor> - Do you have something
you wanna tell us, Joey? </connor>
<garnt> - I said no! </garnt>
<garnt> - Something you wanna admit, bro? </garnt>
<garnt> - I said no! </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like the have you ever? </garnt>
<garnt> - We're all homies here. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - My homies don't like fingering. </connor>
<connor> - Joey's like, "My stool broke one time. </connor>
<connor> "I've never been the same." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I guess like coming to Japan </connor>
<connor> I am impressed by the
fuckin' variety of sex toys. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I see it way more often </connor>
<connor> because you know I'm fuckin' dating Sydney </connor>
<connor> and it's her fuckin' job </connor>
<connor> to review these different types of things. </connor>
<connor> But man, they are so imaginative and I- </connor>
<joey> - I unironically love going to just, like, </joey>
<garnt> there's one in Akihabara </garnt>
<garnt> that I always go to called Love
Merci, I think it's called. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like under the bridge, </garnt>
<joey> and it's like a four-story
fuckin' sex shop. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> And that's right in the
middle of Akihabara, isn't it? </connor>
<joey> - Right in front of the station! </joey>
<connor> - It doesn't look like a adult store. </connor>
<joey> - And like the fourth floor,
like the top floor is, like, </joey>
<joey> no females allowed </joey>
<joey> 'cause, like, that's where
all like the guy toys </joey>
<joey> and, like, the fucked up porn is. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "How bad could it be?" </joey>
<connor> So I went up there, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I'm allowed on
this floor technically </connor>
<connor> "under the rules of the store, </connor>
<connor> "but I don't want to be on this floor." </connor>
<joey> - It feels illegal just being around that. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like I'm committing
a felony just being here. </joey>
<joey> - When you get up higher and
then you see the sex dolls. </joey>
<connor> - They creep me the fuck out, bro. </connor>
<connor> - And they're fucking expensive too. </connor>
<connor> - Like, 10 grand, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Like, the good quality ones. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, what's the difference? </connor>
<connor> - The thought of having
to clean out, like, </connor>
<connor> a fake person is so disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - What is the maintenance cost
on these fuckin' dolls, man? </connor>
<connor> Like, they must be more
expensive to fuckin' maintain </connor>
<connor> than just going out to a soapland. </connor>
<joey> - But that's what I'm thinking. </joey>
<joey> These things are so expensive. </joey>
<joey> You're better off going
to, like, a soapland, </joey>
<joey> you know, 10, 20 times. </joey>
<connor> - I guess there's the shame, right? </connor>
<connor> I get it. </connor>
<joey> It's a bit different, but I get it. </joey>
<joey> I get it though. </joey>
<joey> Like financially it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - The shame? </joey>
<joey> - The shame of having
to go to a prostitute </joey>
<connor> or something basically. </connor>
<joey> - I think I'd rather do that
than fuckin' buy a doll. </joey>
<connor> - The shame of having
someone look back at you. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> As opposed to like
looking at lifeless eyes. </garnt>
<connor> They can't judge. </connor>
<connor> - If other people want to
fuckin' do it, that's fine. </connor>
<connor> I don't care. </connor>
<connor> I can't do that, man. </connor>
<connor> The shame would be too much for me. </connor>
<connor> - I had a mate who, like,
couldn't go to any strip clubs </connor>
<connor> 'cause he was just like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> "Going to a strip club is
just like looking at porn </connor>
<connor> "that can look back at you, man." </connor>
<connor> - I've never been to a strip club, </connor>
<connor> and they always just seem
weird, the idea of it. </connor>
<connor> And it's sad because
everyone always tells me </connor>
<garnt> the food is, like, normally
the best part of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<connor> - I would not order food at a strip club. </connor>
<garnt> - Me and the boys go to a strip club </garnt>
<connor> just to have, like, a
five-course delicate meal, man. </connor>
<joey> - Why not? </joey>
<joey> I would! </joey>
<joey> - It's like your friend is like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, I know this fuckin' great strip club. </joey>
<joey> "Steaks are fuckin' bomb here." </joey>
<connor> - Someone said, like, I
can't remember who it was, </connor>
<connor> someone in America. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Yeah, dude,
the wings were bomb." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah, in my mind, </connor>
<connor> if any food would be good in a strip club </connor>
<connor> for some reason it would be wings </connor>
<connor> - At that point, does that
mean you've just gone to </connor>
<connor> too many strip clubs where you go there, </connor>
<connor> and they're just like naked girls dancing, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> "Give me the wings. </connor>
<connor> "I want the wings." </connor>
<connor> - I would pay for a YouTube series </connor>
<connor> where someone is, like,
very loudly in, like, </connor>
<garnt> a music blaring, he's like
reviewing a strip club </garnt>
<garnt> and the wings. </garnt>
<joey> I would pay good money for that. </joey>
<joey> - A review. </joey>
<joey> - Like, a report of the
week in a strip club. </joey>
<joey> Like, reviewing the wings. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Can you turn the
music down a little bit?" </joey>
<joey> I fear for what I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to use any of these sex toys </joey>
<joey> because I don't want to start liking them. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like I'm
just gonna just get more </joey>
<joey> and more extravagant with it </joey>
<joey> until the maintenance
costs are through the roof. </joey>
<joey> I'm happy with where I'm at right now. </joey>
<joey> Just beating my meat and
just getting it done. </joey>
<joey> - With my own trusty hand. </joey>
<joey> - It does the job. </joey>
<connor> I don't need more than that. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I'm afraid of, like, </connor>
<connor> trying something like VR porn. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Where it's just, like, this is going- </connor>
<connor> - What if I like it? </connor>
<connor> - This is going an extra mile here. </connor>
<connor> Exactly. </connor>
<joey> Like, what if I like it? </joey>
<connor> What if I experienced
something new from this? </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I don't want, I'm in a happy relationship. </connor>
<joey> - You recently bought a VR headset, right? </joey>
<connor> - I bought it to play fuckin' games! </connor>
<joey> I want to play Half-life Index, okay? </joey>
<garnt> - There is no way there is
a part of you that is, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I gotta try this out. </garnt>
<joey> There is no way there isn't a part of you. </joey>
<joey> - Of course there is. </joey>
<connor> - So? </connor>
<connor> - I just don't like the idea
of cumming with a headset on. </connor>
<connor> There's something about
that that feels wrong. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm wearing a big headset </connor>
<connor> with these controllers and shit. </connor>
<connor> Are you kidding me? </connor>
<connor> - I can imagine just, like, you climax </connor>
<garnt> and, like, the post nut shame
must be on another level. </garnt>
<garnt> - Take the headset off. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, "Oh, God!" </garnt>
<garnt> - You've got the
controllers and you're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, this is where my
life has led me now." </connor>
<connor> - You're just like, "(sighs) Beat Saber." </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Again, like, I feel like- </connor>
<connor> - You just did a video
on this, didn't you? </connor>
<joey> Where you went to illusion. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I went to illusion
and played the VR porn games </joey>
<connor> that they made. </connor>
<connor> It's fuckin' weird. </connor>
<connor> Like, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I did like a "safe for work" one. </connor>
<connor> It was barely safe for work. </connor>
<connor> - If you were in the privacy of your home, </connor>
<connor> could you nut to it? </connor>
<connor> (Joey sighs) </connor>
<connor> - If I tried really hard, maybe. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean if you
could try really hard? </connor>
<connor> - If I was given like 30
minutes to myself, like maybe. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure I could
manage to cum to anything </joey>
<connor> if I had 30 minutes. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> - It's not the optimal thing I would use </joey>
<connor> because it's like, I dunno. </connor>
<garnt> There's a part, </garnt>
<garnt> it was really fun to do because
it's just so ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> But there's just so much
about it that's just so jank </garnt>
<garnt> where you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, okay, I'm supposed to
be lying down in this thing </garnt>
<joey> "but I'm also standing up. </joey>
<joey> "And if I look down, I just
look into the guy's neck." </joey>
<connor> It's just a bit weird. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing about VR porn, right? </connor>
<connor> I mean, you have to be
dedicated to this wank session. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> There are so many steps you are putting on </connor>
<connor> just to jack off, you know? </connor>
<connor> - What if the sensors get, like, </connor>
<garnt> they stop working midwank? </garnt>
<garnt> What am I supposed to do? </garnt>
<connor> Just finish? </connor>
<joey> - I guess so, I guess so. </joey>
<connor> - It's not exactly a casual wank, is it? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - It's a ranked competitive wank. </connor>
<joey> - It's a fuckin' side quest. </joey>
<connor> - I guess the thought I had was </connor>
<joey> I've watched the least
amount of anime this year, </joey>
<joey> and I feel like a lot of people- </joey>
<joey> - You mean last year? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, sorry, fuck off. </joey>
<connor> Last year. </connor>
<connor> - Hey. </connor>
<connor> - I've watched the least
amount of anime last year. </connor>
<garnt> And I feel like a lot of people
in the anime fandom have. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like the
community now is evolving </garnt>
<garnt> from just being like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a difference between
now being an anime fan </garnt>
<garnt> and a weeb, and we
touched on this earlier. </garnt>
<garnt> But I realized this when
hanging out with Connor, </garnt>
<garnt> how much of a normie Connor is
compared to both me and Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, how's it feel- </garnt>
<connor> - What re you saying? </connor>
<joey> - We're saying you're a normie. </joey>
<joey> - How does it feel for you hanging out </joey>
<connor> with like people like us, I guess? </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean people like you? </connor>
<joey> - We're a different breed apparently. </joey>
<connor> - Why do you think I'm
a normie, first of all? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, because- </joey>
<joey> - You don't care about
anime as much as we do. </joey>
<connor> - I care about anime. </connor>
<connor> - You care about anime, </connor>
<connor> but you only go so deep into the culture </connor>
<connor> where you don't really get waifu culture, </connor>
<garnt> you don't really get a
lot of, like, VTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> - No comment. </garnt>
<connor> Is VTubing part of the culture? </connor>
<connor> - I think it is. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it grew out of
the anime culture, right? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you know, you
gotta kind of have a like, </joey>
<joey> an appreciation, for anime </joey>
<joey> in order to watch anime girls streaming. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I guess. </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - How deep do you say
your anime fandom goes? </connor>
<connor> - That's a weird question. </connor>
<connor> - Could you frame me maybe scale </connor>
<connor> or something that you can judge me by? </connor>
<joey> 10 being a fake fan. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, one is like, </connor>
<garnt> you know, I watch "Attack on
Titan" and "My Hero Academia." </garnt>
<garnt> Like, just getting started level. </garnt>
<garnt> And 10 is like, I look at an anime, </garnt>
<joey> and I know exactly who the
Genga artist for this is. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck that. </connor>
<connor> What are you on that scale? </connor>
<connor> Where would you put
yourself actually then? </connor>
<connor> This might help me. </connor>
<connor> - Like, a seven or an eight I would say. </connor>
<connor> - I would put myself
as a seven or an eight. </connor>
<connor> - It probably would have been like a five, </connor>
<joey> but now it's probably like a four, </joey>
<connor> maybe even a three honestly. </connor>
<connor> It's probably gone down to
a three, you know, recently. </connor>
<connor> - Do you feel like you've
become less of an anime fan, </connor>
<connor> like, more recently? </connor>
<connor> And have you like falling
out with the culture </connor>
<connor> ever since you moved to Japan? </connor>
<connor> - I guess, I guess because... </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's not like
you don't watch anime. </joey>
<joey> Like, you still keep up
to like all the stuff. </joey>
<joey> - I love anime memes,
I love otaku culture, </joey>
<joey> I love like the community in general. </joey>
<joey> But I think just when
you get so deep into it </joey>
<joey> and the community, I just start to, like, </joey>
<joey> not enjoy the community
when it got into a point </joey>
<joey> where it was getting really deep </joey>
<joey> and everyone was like, "Name
your favorite key animator." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, what, who cares? </joey>
<joey> I like the show and the story. </joey>
<connor> Why do I need to care about that? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we can argue that
Garnt and I are probably </joey>
<connor> at that point too, </connor>
<connor> but if someone came up to me and said, </connor>
<connor> "Name your favorite key animator," </connor>
<joey> I'd be like, "Fuck if I know." </joey>
<connor> - I think there was just a lot
of like, at least when I was, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if it's still going on. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, you guys can tell me, </garnt>
<garnt> but when I was trying to
get really deep into it </garnt>
<garnt> and I really wanted to
learn more about it, </garnt>
<joey> it got very, like, gatekeep-y at a point. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it definitely did. </joey>
<joey> - It's been like that
for a while to be honest. </joey>
<joey> - To where I just started to,
like, not really enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> And then I realized, </joey>
<connor> I think I just enjoy these shows way more </connor>
<joey> when I'm just casual. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I just kinda
learned to appreciate it more </joey>
<connor> and kind of get deeper into it </connor>
<joey> without really interacting
with the community around it. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I guess for a lot of people, </connor>
<connor> I think me included, </connor>
<garnt> when I get into something the one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that I will always do is just, like, </garnt>
<garnt> look at the community for it and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> all right, what's the norms? </garnt>
<garnt> What should I get into? </garnt>
<garnt> What's everyone saying
like the best thing? </garnt>
<connor> Because that's a way of
like guiding your, like, </connor>
<connor> it's like a tailored experience of, like, </connor>
<connor> what everyone thinks are the
best way of enjoying something. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I feel like
you don't really follow </connor>
<connor> seasonal anime anymore. </connor>
<connor> You just kind of wait to see
what everyone's talking about </connor>
<connor> and what's worth watching. </connor>
<connor> Like, how do you decide
what anime to watch? </connor>
<connor> - But I think that's because, like, </connor>
<connor> the seasonal experience of viewing anime's </connor>
<connor> kind of like died almost. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think people nearly
talk about seasonal anime </connor>
<connor> in a week by week way like they used to. </connor>
<connor> - I disagree. </connor>
<connor> I just think it's because
last year was, like, </connor>
<connor> so dry for seasonal anime </connor>
<connor> that there was just nothing
for people to talk about. </connor>
<connor> - It was just a lot of
mid shows last year. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like now,
especially with, like, </connor>
<joey> Netflix coming and releasing
the episodes in batches. </joey>
<joey> Everyone is like, it's not, you know, </joey>
<connor> "Did you watch the latest
episode of Beastars? </connor>
<connor> "Did you watch Beastars?" </connor>
<joey> - But, like, that's like one </joey>
<joey> out of every fuckin' 100 anime
that comes out every year. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like everyone asks that now. </connor>
<connor> It's not, "Did you watch
the newest episode?" </connor>
<connor> It's "Are you watching Attack on Titan?" </connor>
<connor> - I would say like,
people are still asking, </connor>
<connor> "Are you watching the newest
episode of Attack on Titan?" </connor>
<connor> - People just say "Are you
watching Attack on Titan?" </connor>
<connor> Not, "Are you watching
the newest episode?" </connor>
<connor> - Literally every stream
I do, there's always, </connor>
<connor> it's like, "Have you watched this anime?" </connor>
<connor> - "Attack on Titan" is different. </connor>
<connor> "Attack on Titan" is like- </connor>
<connor> - No, not "Attack on Titan." </connor>
<joey> Like, any seasonal anime. </joey>
<connor> - No, normally I never get
seasonal anime people asking me. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, I get that all the time. </joey>
<joey> - No one gives a fuck
if I was watching, like, </joey>
<garnt> Oriomon, what is that called? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck is it called? </garnt>
<joey> What's it called? </joey>
<joey> - "Oreimo." </joey>
<garnt> - That's it. </garnt>
<joey> Who the fuck gives a shit? </joey>
<joey> - Were you trying to say
"Oreimo" and "Doraemon?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, who gives a shit? </joey>
<joey> - That's cursed. </joey>
<joey> - Generic feels good anime
that's an eight season, you know, </joey>
<joey> like, are you watching that? </joey>
<garnt> No one asks me fuck if
I'm watching that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> No one asks me if I watch "Deca-Dence." </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I fuckin' mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, no one gives a shit </garnt>
<connor> 'cause there's so many
animes that are so mid now </connor>
<connor> and there's so many coming out. </connor>
<connor> - God, I remember "Deca-Dence." </connor>
<connor> I tried watching that. </connor>
<connor> - There's so many animes
that are coming out </connor>
<connor> that the only ones people,
I seem to have that, </connor>
<connor> because it used to be, </connor>
<connor> again when there's a
lot less anime as well, </connor>
<connor> that everyone could kind of ask </connor>
<connor> are you watching these shows? </connor>
<connor> Are you watching it weekly? </connor>
<connor> And now there's just so fuckin' many. </connor>
<connor> And we have so many like good shows </connor>
<connor> but like we only really, </connor>
<connor> I find in my experience at general, </connor>
<connor> Twitter only really asked </connor>
<connor> if you're watching a show weekly now </connor>
<connor> or keeps up with the hype, </connor>
<connor> if it's a big event
like "Attack on Titan." </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel it was missing last year was </connor>
<connor> that fuckin' big event. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause last year we had something
like the "Demon Slayer," </connor>
<connor> that "Demon Slayer"
episode that really like- </connor>
<connor> - But even then I never saw,
like, week by week plays </connor>
<joey> by "Demon Slayer." </joey>
<garnt> - Week by week plays. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - "Yo, Demon Slayer episode 17! </garnt>
<garnt> "Boys, what we all sayin' on Twitter?" </garnt>
<garnt> You know, there wasn't like any of that. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just episode 19 was amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> It gave the birth of my children. </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus Christ is re reborn. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's what happened. </garnt>
<garnt> That was it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, there wasn't anything else </garnt>
<garnt> other than like, "Demon Slayer good." </garnt>
<garnt> That was it. </garnt>
<connor> Do you not think that's kind
of like, it shifted a little? </connor>
<connor> Am I seeing something you guys aren't? </connor>
<joey> - I think maybe it's just shifted </joey>
<joey> just because you've kind
of shifted away from it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've also shifted away from it too. </joey>
<joey> And I've definitely
noticed like the lack of- </joey>
<connor> - I do feel like that's so many people </connor>
<connor> 'cause I know so many
people now who, like, </connor>
<connor> they say they're anime fans- </connor>
<connor> - It shifted to manga, 100%. </connor>
<connor> - And all they do is read
manga, watch VTubers, </connor>
<joey> and play gacha games. </joey>
<joey> - Wow, I'm in this photo and I hate it. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> That's literally me! </garnt>
<joey> That was me in 2020. </joey>
<connor> - I never see people talk
about "episode three of this." </connor>
<connor> It's always "chapter this of this manga." </connor>
<joey> 'Cause everyone knows that
they're released at this point. </joey>
<joey> And then everyone keeps
up with it on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> But I never see it for anime. </joey>
<garnt> No one does anime episode reviews anymore </garnt>
<garnt> except for like big shows
like "Attack on Titan." </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone does manga chapter things still. </garnt>
<garnt> They're so popular. </garnt>
<garnt> I genuinely think it's shifted. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I'm the weird one here. </garnt>
<joey> I think you guys can't see the truth. </joey>
<connor> What's happening? </connor>
<connor> - I disagree with, like, </connor>
<connor> "no one does episode reviews anymore." </connor>
<garnt> - Not really. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause there's still like
a big group of YouTubers </garnt>
<joey> who still do it. </joey>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<connor> You watch episode reviews? </connor>
<joey> Name every episode reviewer right now. </joey>
<connor> - Chibi. </connor>
<connor> - Chibi's probably the only person I know. </connor>
<joey> - Chibi's the only one. </joey>
<joey> - YouTube will be taken down </joey>
<joey> and Chibi will still be making reviews. </joey>
<connor> I don't know who like, come
on, that doesn't count, man. </connor>
<joey> - That's the only one that
matters in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> - I guess, I mean- </joey>
<connor> - I feel like that kind
of mirrors the culture now </connor>
<connor> because I feel like definitely
being an anime YouTuber </connor>
<connor> last year was fuckin' hard. </connor>
<connor> Anime content last year was, like, </connor>
<connor> from my perspective, </connor>
<connor> anime content on YouTube
just didn't do as well. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause no one was watching any anime. </connor>
<connor> But videos around anime culture, </connor>
<connor> like what you guys were doing, </connor>
<connor> you guys fuckin' killed it
last year, in my opinion. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like that's because, like, </connor>
<connor> people care less about
individual shows now. </connor>
<connor> And people just more
care about the culture. </connor>
<joey> - I think the last time
I did a show or a video </joey>
<garnt> on a show that was like seasonal </garnt>
<garnt> and ongoing was fuckin'
"Promised Neverland." </garnt>
<garnt> And that was what, two years? </garnt>
<connor> Three years ago almost. </connor>
<connor> - I think mine's like "Banana Fish." </connor>
<connor> It's fuckin' amazing. </connor>
<connor> - It was like two or
three years ago, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's like, since then, </connor>
<connor> it's just like every season comes around </connor>
<joey> and I do a what will I be watching? </joey>
<joey> And then I look at the
list and I was like- </joey>
<connor> - The biggest lie of the century. </connor>
<joey> - Joey needs to change the title to </joey>
<garnt> "I Lied to You For 20 Minutes Straight." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - "What I'm Looking At." </joey>
<connor> - I love how the comments
have finally called you out </connor>
<joey> on it though. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Don't fucking lie to us." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> No, that series now is just
a fuckin' quick easy way </joey>
<garnt> of being like, "Oh, let's see
what Joey thinks about this. </garnt>
<garnt> "We know he's not gonna watch it, </garnt>
<joey> "but at least we'll know
what he feels about it." </joey>
<connor> - For me, seasonal anime has just become </connor>
<garnt> this glorified manga
recommendation system. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Where if I find a series
like this, it's so rare- </garnt>
<connor> - This is what, like,
shopping is to Amazon. </connor>
<connor> I go to the store to go
and buy it on Amazon. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause most of the
time you find an anime </connor>
<connor> and it's like, we talked
about this before, </connor>
<connor> where it's not an
adaptation that's amazing. </connor>
<connor> It's a passible adaptation
where I'm just, like, </connor>
<connor> I don't get anything more than this </connor>
<garnt> from, like, watching the anime
versus reading the manga. </garnt>
<garnt> So you just end up reading the manga. </garnt>
<garnt> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is like
one of the few, like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Jujutsu Kaisen," "Jojo," </garnt>
<garnt> and like some of like
the big shonen ones are </garnt>
<garnt> one of the few exceptions
where they actually have budget </garnt>
<garnt> and money behind this to make this </garnt>
<garnt> a fuckin' amazing production. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> But for the most part
you have a production </garnt>
<joey> that's just mediocre. </joey>
<joey> It's okay. </joey>
<joey> - They're just there. </joey>
<joey> - They're just there, and it's just like, </joey>
<joey> I'd rather just read
the manga and get ahead </joey>
<connor> and speed run this stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<joey> Like, that's how I've
kind of found myself too. </joey>
<joey> And also like, you know, </joey>
<joey> at least very unique
opportunity for me is that like, </joey>
<garnt> I can read 90% of the shit
that hasn't come out yet. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<joey> So it's like, why not just
get ahead on that shit? </joey>
<connor> - Do you feel like you'd read more manga </connor>
<connor> if you could actually read it physically? </connor>
<connor> Or do you not care? </connor>
<connor> - Probably would. </connor>
<connor> Although I would annoy me
having fuck tons of manga </connor>
<connor> at my house 'cause I've read it. </connor>
<connor> I'm not really gonna read it again. </connor>
<connor> - Call Joey out like that. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm in this photo and I hate it. </garnt>
<joey> - How often do you pick up
a manga and just read it? </joey>
<garnt> - Every day. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a fuckin' lie. </garnt>
<garnt> I was ready for that. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not joking. </joey>
<garnt> I have to because I have so
many that I've yet to read. </garnt>
<connor> - But, you never reread the
ones you've read, right? </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes I do. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<connor> - Because I like it otherwise
I wouldn't fuckin' buy it. </connor>
<connor> If there's a new manga I pick up- </connor>
<connor> - Maybe if I could speak
Japanese, it'd be a different. </connor>
<connor> - If there's a new manga I pick up, </connor>
<connor> and I pick up new manga
all the fuckin' time, </connor>
<joey> because it's like, "Oh, I
don't know anything about this. </joey>
<joey> "This just came out. </joey>
<joey> "Might be good." </joey>
<joey> And I buy it. </joey>
<joey> And I don't like it, I resell that shit. </joey>
<connor> - Rewatching media to me
feels like playing, you know, </connor>
<connor> casual games on, you know, </connor>
<joey> when there's a ranked playlist. </joey>
<joey> It's like, why would I waste
my time on this casual game? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but you never casual game. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I casual game all the time. </joey>
<joey> - To me when, you know- </joey>
<joey> - I'm just built different. </joey>
<joey> - Back in the day when you'd meet a girl, </joey>
<joey> and you'd be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh cool, yeah, what movie
do you want to watch?" </joey>
<joey> Just like, "Let's watch White
Girls, my favorite movie. </joey>
<connor> "I've watched it like 15 times." </connor>
<connor> Like, 15 times? </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<connor> Why would you watch "Frozen" 16 times? </connor>
<connor> Did you get something the
16th the time that you, </connor>
<connor> you know why? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I've seen "Pulp
Fiction" about 30 times </joey>
<connor> - Okay, movies like that
where you miss a shit tons, </connor>
<connor> I get it to go back. </connor>
<connor> But you ain't missing any like deep themes </connor>
<connor> from "Frozen" or "White
Chicks," you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, come on. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like part of the
allure of rewatching films </connor>
<connor> or media with people you
haven't watched it before- </connor>
<connor> - Okay, with people who haven't watched. </connor>
<connor> I understand that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because I feel like the only time I </connor>
<connor> actually rewatch something now is </connor>
<connor> when I'm with someone who
hasn't watched this show. </connor>
<connor> You're just like waiting
for their reaction. </connor>
<connor> Just like, "Oh, oh, oh. </connor>
<connor> "The big part's coming up." </connor>
<connor> And they're on their phone,
and it's like a heartbreak. </connor>
<connor> It's like fuckin' heartbreaking to you. </connor>
<connor> You want to politely say, </connor>
<connor> "Pay the fuck attention, you scrub!" </connor>
<connor> But like, you don't want to
sound like an asshole, you know. </connor>
<joey> - That is my fuckin' pet peeve, dude. </joey>
<joey> And the worst is like, </joey>
<joey> I remember one time I was showing, </joey>
<joey> I forgot what movie it was to Aki, </joey>
<joey> and, you know, she was like really quiet </joey>
<joey> for like the first hour. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, she must be
really paying attention." </joey>
<joey> I look over she's fuckin' asleep. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, this is so sad, Alexa. </garnt>
<connor> - Doesn't she make you,
like, watch Disney movies </connor>
<connor> all the time? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair though, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't watch half the movies </joey>
<joey> that she shows me unless it, </joey>
<joey> but at least the good thing
is 80 to 90% of the movies </joey>
<joey> she actually does show me,
they're actually pretty good. </joey>
<connor> - I think if you asked me, </connor>
<connor> would I rather be
interrogated in Guantanamo Bay </connor>
<connor> or have a girlfriend who's obsessed </connor>
<garnt> with Disney or Kingdom Hearts? </garnt>
<garnt> I think I'd take Guantanamo Bay. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I'd have more
chance of staying sane. </garnt>
<garnt> I cannot stand girls </garnt>
<garnt> who always just want
to watch Disney movies. </garnt>
<connor> It drives me insane. </connor>
<joey> That's like 90% girls. </joey>
<joey> - No! </joey>
<connor> - I'm sorry for you, Joey. </connor>
<connor> That's my nightmare as well. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I thought I was
gonna hate it but then again, </joey>
<joey> I've seen so few Disney
movies, understandably. </joey>
<connor> - I'm so glad that girls
are moving away from that </connor>
<connor> and getting into true crime now. </connor>
<joey> I can get behind girls
wanting to watch true crime. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no.
- My fucking god! </joey>
<garnt> - If anything I would
rather watch Disney movies </garnt>
<connor> than true crime. </connor>
<joey> - No, I love true crime! </joey>
<connor> - No, I would have to
go with the true crime. </connor>
<joey> - But you don't understand Aki. </joey>
<joey> Every morning I wake up </joey>
<connor> to some kind of police
interrogation tape audio. </connor>
<joey> - Same here! </joey>
<connor> - Joey wakes up and is like,
"Is it a rapist today, honey?" </connor>
<connor> - Every time he's just
like, "So why did you do it? </connor>
<connor> "So why did you do it?" </connor>
<joey> I don't want to wake up to this! </joey>
<connor> - It's that criminal
psychology channel, right? </connor>
<connor> That I swear every girl is watching now. </connor>
<connor> - Jim Can't Swim Psychology. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> But there's so many of them. </connor>
<joey> There's so many channels like that. </joey>
<connor> And I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I watched the
Jim Can't Swim Psychology </connor>
<garnt> and then the recommended was just, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the new reaction YouTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> They're all reacting to interrogations. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, what is happening? </garnt>
<connor> Why are we reacting to interrogation? </connor>
<connor> - Like, I get it because you watch it </connor>
<connor> and you almost feel physically suffocated. </connor>
<connor> Because I remember watching
some of these videos </connor>
<connor> and you feel like a kid again, </connor>
<connor> where you, you'd like stole a cookie </connor>
<connor> and your mom's like,
"Did you steal a cookie?" </connor>
<connor> And you're just like, "Oh, what do I say? </connor>
<connor> "What do I say?" </connor>
<connor> And it's like that simulator </connor>
<connor> without being back in that- </connor>
<garnt> - They have the thing. </garnt>
<connor> They'll pause the interrogation </connor>
<connor> and be like, "This is the backward Suplex </connor>
<garnt> "mental gymnastic move." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I love it when my mother
used to do that one to me. </garnt>
<garnt> Or like, "This is the alter
ego sufficing technique." </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, loved it
when my dad did that to me. </connor>
<connor> That's a classic. </connor>
<connor> I love that one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like being
back in school, you know. </connor>
<connor> Getting told off for detention. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the detectives would be like, </connor>
<connor> "We have proof." </connor>
<connor> And they wouldn't say the proof. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, this is like
the big mind game at school. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, "We know you did it." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Bullshit you do. </garnt>
<connor> "You got no proof. </connor>
<garnt> "No proof!" </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they would go,
"We don't need to show it. </garnt>
<garnt> "Just know that we have it." </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - They're just shitting their pants. </garnt>
<garnt> - And just seeing like
good cop bad cop in action </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing it actually work. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I can see how you can
fall down that rabbit hole </garnt>
<connor> and become addictive. </connor>
<connor> - I do like it, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's interesting, don't get me wrong. </joey>
<joey> But every day? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly, I could
probably watch it everyday. </joey>
<connor> - Every fucking morning? </connor>
<connor> - I couldn't do it every day. </connor>
<connor> - It's not something I want to watch </connor>
<joey> first thing in the morning. </joey>
<connor> - I would rather watch
a mediocre documentary </connor>
<connor> over a good movie. </connor>
<connor> - You have programmed your brain wrong. </connor>
<connor> You literally have
programmed your brain wrong. </connor>
<joey> - That just doesn't make sense. </joey>
<connor> - I just like real life
stuff way more than like, </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> I've somehow gotten into it </connor>
<connor> where I just really enjoy
like stories of real people. </connor>
<connor> - But like here's the thing, </connor>
<connor> because I've thought about this recently </connor>
<connor> where I feel like a lot of
people now are more, like, </connor>
<connor> will be more willing to watch something </connor>
<connor> that they don't have to
pay 100% attention to. </connor>
<connor> So if you have like a
really high quality movie </connor>
<garnt> or something that you need
to like pay attention to, </garnt>
<garnt> you're less likely to watch that </garnt>
<garnt> then say fuckin' Trash Tastes, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> just three people chatting
shit for two hours </garnt>
<garnt> or like a real life documentary </garnt>
<garnt> where not every detail is important. </garnt>
<connor> You just get like the
basic story around it. </connor>
<connor> - That's fine. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I'm like that. </connor>
<connor> I just enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's people
out there who are the same. </connor>
<connor> Like, 'cause on Netflix I
think all I watch is, like, </connor>
<connor> documentaries. </connor>
<connor> - Every time I meet you you
watch a new documentary. </connor>
<joey> I have no idea where you
find the time to do that. </joey>
<garnt> I play a lot of them in the background. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But does that count as watching it? </connor>
<joey> - Well, like I said, some of them are mid, </joey>
<joey> so it's like just put it on the background </joey>
<connor> and let it do its thing. </connor>
<joey> - That's the one thing I've
never understood is, like, </joey>
<joey> people who say like, "Yeah,
I've watched like 500 movies." </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh, how did you watch it?" </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I just let it play in the background </connor>
<connor> "while I was like cleaning." </connor>
<connor> Does that count as watching the movie? </connor>
<connor> - I'm, like, I'm typing out
while it's in my peripheral </connor>
<connor> and I'm listening to it. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno. </joey>
<joey> I don't really count that as watching it. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> Fuck off. </connor>
<joey> That's watching </joey>
<joey> - I can't concentrate on it. </joey>
<joey> - It's watching, </joey>
<connor> but you couldn't do that to
something like "Pulp Fiction." </connor>
<connor> - No, God, no. </connor>
<connor> That's why I would never
treat it like that. </connor>
<connor> Same with anime. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like doing that, </connor>
<connor> I've realized that because
I've been doing that more often </connor>
<connor> with YouTube videos as well, </connor>
<connor> and I've found it harder and
harder just to fuckin' sit down </connor>
<connor> and watch something. </connor>
<connor> Like, do you find that like watching, </connor>
<connor> unless it's like a super engaging show, </connor>
<connor> like watching any standard show now </connor>
<connor> it's just 10 times harder </connor>
<connor> 'cause you kind of just want to skip to </connor>
<connor> where the important plot points are. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I've been watching
some pretty good shows recently </connor>
<connor> that I haven't really had trouble with, </connor>
<connor> but yeah sometimes I have that problem. </connor>
<joey> - I'm glad I've never
subjected myself to that </joey>
<garnt> 'cause otherwise I'd probably
be feeling the same pain. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't put something on
unless I have the full intent </garnt>
<garnt> of putting 100% of my
concentration into it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh man. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't see the point
of like working on something </garnt>
<connor> while something else is
playing in the background. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause then I'm just gonna get distracted </connor>
<connor> by whatever's playing. </connor>
<connor> So either way I can't
concentrate on watching the thing </connor>
<connor> and doing whatever the fuck else. </connor>
<connor> - I can't focus without some noise. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I just put music on. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, music or put something on. </connor>
<joey> It's whatever. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but like I can't have anything </connor>
<connor> that's like visual on. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - What's the last thing you put on </joey>
<connor> that you properly concentrated on? </connor>
<connor> Was it "The Boys?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I watched "The Boys." </connor>
<connor> - "The Boys" was a good TV show. </connor>
<connor> - That was really fuckin'
good, really good. </connor>
<connor> - That was really fuckin' good. </connor>
<connor> - I've heard good things about that, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, I didn't reach
out my phone or anything. </connor>
<connor> I was just watching it the whole time. </connor>
<connor> Season one was really fuckin' good. </connor>
<connor> - That's the kind of experience I want </connor>
<garnt> whenever I watch something. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I've been noticing
I've been getting </garnt>
<garnt> so distracted recently when watching stuff </garnt>
<connor> that I just I enjoy it less, </connor>
<connor> and I miss the enjoyment I
had when I guess I was a kid. </connor>
<joey> - Are you one of those people </joey>
<joey> who, like, can't be watching something </joey>
<joey> unless they have, like,
their phone in their hand? </joey>
<connor> - I didn't used to be like that. </connor>
<joey> I've slowly become that
person, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And doing that on anime is hard mode, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Because you gotta read the subtitles. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I gotta read the subtitles! </garnt>
<garnt> My fuckin' god, it's like
trying to watch "Monogatari" </garnt>
<garnt> when you're eating something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's so fuckin' difficult. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, "Wait, I missed
the one second of dialogue </joey>
<connor> "that was important </connor>
<joey> "because of the crunching
sounds in my ears!" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't really do it with anime </joey>
<joey> 'cause anime, again, you have to focus. </joey>
<joey> Can't get distracted, </joey>
<joey> which is why I think I find I don't watch </joey>
<connor> as much anime as I used to
is 'cause it is kinda like- </connor>
<connor> - That's why watching anime
on Netflix is so much easier </connor>
<garnt> because you watch the
dub and it becomes, like, </garnt>
<garnt> same type enjoyment now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But watching subbed anime, </garnt>
<connor> watching seasonal anime has
just become that much harder </connor>
<connor> because of that exact reason. </connor>
<connor> - Going back to the debate
about, am I a real anime fan? </connor>
<connor> But like, 'cause you mentioned something </connor>
<joey> you said like VTubers, whatever, </joey>
<joey> anime, manga, gacha games. </joey>
<connor> Why do you feel like gacha games is, like, </connor>
<connor> a big part of being an anime fan? </connor>
<joey> - Because gachas originally
fuckin' from anime. </joey>
<connor> The Japanese kind of invented it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but it doesn't mean, </joey>
<joey> it's not that deep in anime culture. </joey>
<joey> - No, it kind of is. </joey>
<joey> - You can be an anime fan without
ever playing a gacha game. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> But you can't play, </joey>
<connor> but you very rarely play a gacha game </connor>
<joey> without being an anime fan. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - I mean there's plenty of original, like, </connor>
<connor> gacha games out there that
aren't anime based at all. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but how many
people play those compared </joey>
<joey> to the anime based gacha games? </joey>
<connor> - Well, I mean, </connor>
<connor> is Genshin Impact an anime game? </connor>
<connor> - How is Genshin Impact not an anime game? </connor>
<connor> - Well, I would consider anime being </connor>
<connor> like the actual like manga anime shows. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - I'm more talking about
like the anime art style. </connor>
<connor> - The Arknights. </connor>
<joey> They weren't based off anything. </joey>
<connor> - Same with VTubers, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, I would say who's watching VTubers </connor>
<joey> who's never watched anime before? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - A confused dad. </joey>
<connor> That's who's watching it. </connor>
<connor> - I like the gacha games. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I really enjoyed
Arknights when I was playing that. </connor>
<connor> I don't really play it anymore. </connor>
<garnt> But like, and Genshin was fine. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't like how I couldn't skip </garnt>
<garnt> any of the fuckin' dialogue. </garnt>
<garnt> I think they added that now though. </garnt>
<garnt> - They've added that now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally rage quit one of my streams </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there was so much
dialogue and it wouldn't stop. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, and you would walk 10
seconds to get another dialogue </garnt>
<garnt> for two minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> This is taking the piss. </garnt>
<joey> This is ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> No one can enjoy this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I want to see
you play Yokis again. </connor>
<connor> You'd probably lose your fuckin' mind. </connor>
<connor> - I'd be like, "What is happening? </connor>
<joey> "What is going on?" </joey>
<garnt> And like, (sighs) I don't get it </garnt>
<connor> how people can get excited for
every new fuckin' gacha game. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's a question
you have to ask Tectone. </joey>
<connor> - We've also been brainwashed </connor>
<connor> into being excited for rates
that are higher than 2%. </connor>
<joey> We're like, "Boys, boys,
it's practically 50/50. </joey>
<connor> "It's practically-" </connor>
<joey> - Once it's above 2%, it's
basically a guaranteed draw. </joey>
<connor> - I feel called out now. </connor>
<connor> - They've all memed it so much </connor>
<connor> that they're actually like
proud of it when it's like 2%. </connor>
<joey> They're like, </joey>
<connor> "They're practically giving
the five stars away." </connor>
<joey> Like, do you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - That's practically a guaranteed draw. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - A lot of the stuff, </connor>
<connor> I just hate how games have just
completely normalized, like- </connor>
<joey> - Microtransactions? </joey>
<joey> - To death, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I enjoyed Arknights. </garnt>
<garnt> It was fun, but like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd spent like 800 bucks on that game </garnt>
<garnt> and there was still some
missions I couldn't do. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, "How much do I need to spend </connor>
<connor> "to be able to like do
the hardest missions? </connor>
<connor> "Tell me. </connor>
<connor> "How much? </connor>
<connor> "It's ridiculous." </connor>
<connor> - Just turn your brain off
and just enjoy the game, </connor>
<connor> and you'll just enjoy the experience. </connor>
<connor> - You can't because
then it fuckin' is like, </connor>
<connor> "Beep beep, you got no
fuckin' resources left. </connor>
<connor> "You want to pay? </connor>
<garnt> "You want to pay a little
money to keep playing, do you?" </garnt>
<connor> Like, I hate that </connor>
<garnt> - I would say the only
real gacha game I'm playing </garnt>
<garnt> right now is Genshin. </garnt>
<garnt> And my biggest problem with
Genshin has nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> with like the gacha system </garnt>
<garnt> even though the pull rates suck ass. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, like if the
drop rates are fuckin' ass, </garnt>
<connor> then I don't go into
it with a mentality of, </connor>
<connor> "I'm going to get this character," </connor>
<connor> or "I'm going to get this person." </connor>
<connor> When you come in with
expectations, that's when you lose. </connor>
<joey> - It's like walking into
a casino being like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm gonna win the jackpot." </joey>
<connor> - My actually biggest problem
with Genshin right now is that </connor>
<connor> when you reach the end game, </connor>
<connor> it really feels like
you reached the end game </connor>
<garnt> because you are, like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're squeezing out content
that's just not there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we went over that. </garnt>
<connor> - It's become so apparent with Genshin </connor>
<connor> as opposed to other gacha games </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm sure we've
played enough gacha games </connor>
<joey> that you reach that point where you- </joey>
<joey> - You open into the
dailies and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "I got nothin' to fuckin' do." </joey>
<garnt> - This is just a part-time job. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fucking grinding away. </garnt>
<joey> - I gotta clock in on my daily. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just watching numbers go up. </joey>
<joey> But it's less noticeable
when it's a phone game. </joey>
<joey> But when it's on Genshin </joey>
<joey> 'cause I dunno how fuckin'
people play Genshin </joey>
<joey> on the phone, man. </joey>
<joey> - Disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - How you do storm terror
or the fuckin' wolf boss </joey>
<joey> on your phone, that's fuckin' beyond me. </joey>
<joey> But, like, it feels so weird </joey>
<joey> when I got to the end game in Genshin, </joey>
<joey> and I would log on for like
an hour a day on the PC. </joey>
<joey> And I would just, like, </joey>
<connor> I would just grind and I
will do nothing but grind. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'd gone through all the, like, </connor>
<connor> the actual content of the game. </connor>
<connor> And it really feels, like, </connor>
<connor> it's really apparent on Genshin </connor>
<connor> because it feels like
the first real gacha game </connor>
<connor> that should be played on console, </connor>
<connor> and it feels more like an RPG. </connor>
<connor> Whereas if it's a mobile game, </connor>
<connor> I mean, you can do it whenever. </connor>
<connor> You can do it in your free time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because I mean, </connor>
<connor> I definitely felt like when
I was grinding Arknights, </connor>
<connor> and I was over leveled
for a lot of things, </connor>
<connor> even though I still
couldn't beat some stages, </connor>
<connor> like, 'cause you would do it daily </connor>
<connor> 'cause you've been conditioned to, like, </connor>
<connor> get your daily rewards, man. </connor>
<connor> Get them. </connor>
<connor> To the point where anytime
any new content ever came out, </connor>
<connor> I fuckin' steamrolled
it, like, immediately. </connor>
<connor> I was like, well that was
like two hours of fun. </connor>
<connor> I waited three months
for that content update. </connor>
<connor> - I do feel like a bit like Pavlov's dog. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Where it's just like, "Ooh, good, good." </connor>
<connor> - New content, new content! </connor>
<connor> - And it's just like, </connor>
<connor> you can't shit on these games </connor>
<connor> and like, say, "Oh man,
yeah, it's super grindy. </connor>
<connor> "You know, the microtransactions
are a little bit much." </connor>
<connor> Whatever. </connor>
<connor> And then people are always
so quick to like defend them. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, just admit that it's shit, </connor>
<connor> and what they're doing is
like, you get a free game </connor>
<joey> and then you have to
put up with this shit. </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "Well,
I'm free to play." </joey>
<joey> I don't give a shit if
you're free to play. </joey>
<joey> Other people are out there
spending a thousand dollars. </joey>
<joey> Why is it okay if it's just
you're fuckin' free to play? </joey>
<joey> That's always the excuse
you see this shit. </joey>
<joey> It drives me insane. </joey>
<joey> - Like as long as I'm not paying money. </joey>
<joey> - People are like, "What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> "I'm free to play. </joey>
<joey> "I've never had any difficulties." </joey>
<connor> It's like, well good on you
that you have willpower. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I'm one of
those people honestly. </connor>
<connor> - What, free to play? </connor>
<connor> - No, not free to play,
but I'll defend the fact </connor>
<joey> that you can play these
games being free to play </joey>
<joey> because all you need is willpower. </joey>
<joey> And you know- </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Shut the fuck up. </joey>
<joey> - All you need is the power of friendship. </joey>
<joey> That's all you need. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, if I wanted to,
I could be free to play. </connor>
<connor> I just don't want to. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I feel bad for the people </connor>
<connor> who physically like can't
control their gambling. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean- </connor>
<connor> - They shouldn't be playing it. </connor>
<joey> - But they should not be
playing games like this. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like these
games should really come </joey>
<joey> with a warning. </joey>
<connor> - Tell that to Tectone. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> There should be, like, heavy
warnings on games I think </garnt>
<garnt> to like say, "Hey listen,
you can spend a grand </garnt>
<connor> "and come out with PNGs." </connor>
<connor> What was that? </connor>
<connor> What're you looking at Garnt? </connor>
<connor> (fly buzzes) </connor>
<connor> Okay, sorry. </connor>
<connor> There should be like a
heavy warning saying, </connor>
<connor> "Listen, you can spend a
grand for like an animation </connor>
<connor> "and PNG that gets you a
little bit of serotonin." </connor>
<joey> Like that's. </joey>
<joey> Like, no money involved. </joey>
<connor> Like, gambling totally fair. </connor>
<connor> I just, it angers me so much. </connor>
<connor> How, like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You just don't see
the value in those PNGs. </connor>
<garnt> - That's just the new generation, right? </garnt>
<garnt> What would you want to pay for it? </garnt>
<connor> Do you want to pay for more money? </connor>
<connor> Nah, I'll pay for a
little bit of serotonin. </connor>
<connor> - People don't often, </connor>
<connor> you never hear people, like,
defending gambling odds. </connor>
<connor> They're just like, "Yeah, dude. </connor>
<joey> "It's what it is. </joey>
<joey> "Gambling is what it is. </joey>
<joey> "You go in there and it's fucked. </joey>
<joey> "And yeah, if you want to
go and waste your money." </joey>
<garnt> - House always win. </garnt>
<garnt> - But in gachas everyone's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh no, actually." </garnt>
<connor> Like it's, everyone's like, </connor>
<connor> I guess 'cause the option
there is free to play. </connor>
<connor> - There's no free to play gambling option. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Well actually, some
casinos give you free drinks </connor>
<garnt> if you just turn up. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's go. </garnt>
<joey> I guess that's the
equivalent of free to play. </joey>
<joey> "I'll have an orange juice please. </joey>
<joey> "No gambling." </joey>
<joey> - That's the equivalent of
like free ten pull today. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and they are generous. </connor>
<connor> But I guess, if you don't
have a gambling addiction, </connor>
<garnt> you can't understand </garnt>
<garnt> how it feels to have a gambling addiction. </garnt>
<garnt> And I get it why some people
might just want to play a game. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't know that it has
like gambling in it maybe, </garnt>
<connor> essentially. </connor>
<connor> And then they get, like,
kind of tricked into it </connor>
<connor> 'cause they've been weaned on the game. </connor>
<connor> - That's just modern apps in my opinion. </connor>
<garnt> - It sucks though! </garnt>
<garnt> - Because we've just found a way </garnt>
<garnt> to literally hack our brains. </garnt>
<garnt> Like human beings,
like, we'd like to think </garnt>
<garnt> that we're not predictable, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But like, five, 10 years ago, </garnt>
<garnt> can you imagine like, just
having most of your life, </garnt>
<garnt> most of my life now is
scrolling down on something. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Most of my life when I'm
not talking to you guys, </garnt>
<connor> I'm scrolling down on some
kind of fucking timeline. </connor>
<connor> It's never ending. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I get it. </connor>
<connor> We'll get into some
philosophical stuff here, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> But back to the point of gacha, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The other thing that we've done is </garnt>
<garnt> that we've done the best
thing that we could ever want </garnt>
<garnt> for these companies. </garnt>
<garnt> We've memed spending money. </garnt>
<connor> Nobody wants to feel bad for wasting $200 </connor>
<connor> and not getting what they want. </connor>
<connor> So what do you do? </connor>
<connor> You go to Twitter, you tweet
out how you didn't get anything </connor>
<connor> and you may pick like the pain
Peko or whatever it's called. </connor>
<garnt> - The pain Peko. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that what it's called? </garnt>
<connor> I'm such a fucking boomer! </connor>
<connor> - You sound like a dad. </connor>
<connor> - That's like a dad
trying to describe a meme. </connor>
<joey> - "Hey son, pain Peko." </joey>
<joey> - "What is that pain Peko? </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, that is a pog
champ right there, son." </garnt>
<connor> - I am not a boomer! </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Garnt, stop meming about me
being a boomer for one second. </connor>
<connor> Listen, we have all
like tricked each other </connor>
<connor> into making gambling,
like, a community event </connor>
<connor> and like enjoying it </connor>
<connor> because no one wants to lose alone! </connor>
<connor> - Because we share the pain, right? </connor>
<joey> - We share the pain Peko. </joey>
<joey> - We've done exactly what
these companies wanted us to do </joey>
<garnt> which is make, like, the gambling
into a form of acceptance. </garnt>
<garnt> You haven't joined the gacha community </garnt>
<garnt> unless you've fuckin' gambled 1,000 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> and haven't got the one with thick thighs </garnt>
<connor> that you forget about three months later. </connor>
<connor> Fuck! </connor>
<connor> - No, are you telling
me that part of, like, </connor>
<connor> the gambling experience, </connor>
<connor> like you go into a casino, </connor>
<connor> I remember the last time I
went to a casino with you. </connor>
<garnt> - Great time </garnt>
<garnt> - Great time because you got to, </garnt>
<garnt> you fuckin' egged on Eugene
to, like, lose his money! </garnt>
<garnt> You thought it was fuckin' hilarious! </garnt>
<garnt> - That was funny. </garnt>
<connor> - Eugene's our friend. </connor>
<connor> - So you basically did the exact same. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> What happened was, you know, </connor>
<connor> at the time he didn't have a job, </connor>
<connor> and we were telling him, you know, </connor>
<garnt> "You probably shouldn't
be spending your money." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, you know, I kept playing. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't lose much like 100 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> I was spending that much. </garnt>
<garnt> And he wanted to keep up with me, </garnt>
<joey> and I was like, "If you
want to, you can go ahead. </joey>
<joey> "But you don't have to do it." </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, man. </connor>
<connor> That sounds very suggestive to me. </connor>
<garnt> It's the reverse psychology. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, "I'm going to do a 10 pull. </connor>
<connor> "I mean, you don't have to do a 10 pull. </connor>
<garnt> "I mean, it's a raid up today." </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not streaming me going to a casino </garnt>
<garnt> and being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey guys, let's fuckin'
gamble on blackjack. </garnt>
<connor> "Pog, man, go blackjack." </connor>
<connor> - It's the equivalent though. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it is the equivalent of that. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, like I said,
gacha is a waifu casino. </connor>
<connor> - Can you stream gambling? </connor>
<connor> Poker, I know. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, there's poker, there's blackjack. </joey>
<joey> - Can you? </joey>
<joey> There's pretty heavy rules
around it though, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, probably. </garnt>
<connor> - But there's not heavy
rules around gacha. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - Why not? </connor>
<connor> Should there be? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know maybe. </connor>
<connor> - There honestly should be. </connor>
<connor> I think there should be some regulations. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the biggest
thing about gacha is </connor>
<connor> that people should know </connor>
<connor> what they're getting themselves into. </connor>
<connor> - People should know a lot of things. </connor>
<connor> That's why people should
also have the option </connor>
<connor> to tell casinos, "Hey, can you ban me? </connor>
<connor> "Because I have no self-control." </connor>
<connor> There's no way to do that with gacha. </connor>
<connor> - Is that an option with casinos? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, in every country you can do that. </connor>
<joey> - So what you're saying is we
need to come up with, like, </joey>
<joey> the gacha police. </joey>
<connor> - Gacha police! </connor>
<joey> - Ring, ring, you've spending
too much money on gacha. </joey>
<joey> - I am dead serious. </joey>
<joey> There should be something
on the play store </joey>
<joey> or something that you can be like, </joey>
<joey> "Listen, I gamble too much. </joey>
<connor> "Can you please not allow me to spend more </connor>
<connor> "than like 100 bucks like
a year or something?" </connor>
<connor> Like, set a hard limit that
there's no way to turn off. </connor>
<connor> - I agree with you on that. </connor>
<connor> - Because if you go to the casinos, </connor>
<connor> you fill out the form says, </connor>
<connor> "Please ban me from this casino." </connor>
<connor> They will never let you in ever. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they have like a database </connor>
<connor> and a lot of the time, if you, </connor>
<connor> I think sometimes some
courts require you to do it </connor>
<connor> for certain occasions, </connor>
<joey> but it's very popular and common </joey>
<joey> that people who gamble too much </joey>
<joey> they what they want to
get that life on track. </joey>
<joey> You know, because it's,
it's easy to have a lapse </joey>
<joey> in like willpower and
you go to the casino. </joey>
<joey> So if 95% of the time, you're like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm never gambling." </joey>
<joey> - Basically just chastity belt themselves. </joey>
<joey> - Basically. </joey>
<joey> You can say like, "This
is not good for me. </joey>
<joey> "I'm gonna fill out a form." </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't know you could do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> In the UK 100% </garnt>
<garnt> because gambling is a
huge problem in the UK </garnt>
<joey> for like betting shops and
stuff, so they'll do it. </joey>
<joey> And you can basically,
if it's a chain as well, </joey>
<connor> they'll ban you from every chain. </connor>
<connor> - But like, I do think
you're talking about, like, </connor>
<connor> a vast minority 'cause
like most of the people </connor>
<connor> who I've met who are playing gacha games, </connor>
<connor> they're not like us. </connor>
<connor> But for us, it's kind of
like, like for me at least, </connor>
<connor> you know, it kind of
revolves around my job. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - You stream, you do it, it gets views. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> But like for most people
that I know that play gacha, </connor>
<connor> they haven't spent like an
inordinate amount of money on it. </connor>
<connor> - But like, I don't think
there should be an ability </connor>
<connor> to ruin your fuckin' life
for pulling anime girls. </connor>
<connor> Like, we know Tectone, who's
a popular gacha game streamer. </connor>
<joey> And at one point he used
to play, what was it? </joey>
<joey> - [Computer] Summoner's War. </joey>
<joey> - He nearly- </joey>
<joey> - He went homeless. </joey>
<joey> - He legit went like financially, </joey>
<garnt> I think he might've filed
for bankruptcy or something. </garnt>
<garnt> He went fully broke from gacha games. </garnt>
<garnt> That should never be a thing. </garnt>
<connor> That should never be able to happen. </connor>
<joey> - I remember him telling me that </joey>
<joey> like it was like a fuckin' war story. </joey>
<connor> - That should never be a thing
for casinos either, right? </connor>
<joey> - No, but I mean- </joey>
<connor> - I agree there should be
more regulations about it. </connor>
<joey> - There needs to be a gacha police. </joey>
<connor> That's all we need! </connor>
<joey> - Again with casino, </joey>
<connor> it is extremely heavily
regulated and you can win money. </connor>
<connor> So it makes sense that
you can't have the risk </connor>
<connor> of winning money without losing money. </connor>
<connor> But with gacha games (laughs) come on. </connor>
<joey> - For some people though that
PNG is worth more than money. </joey>
<joey> - It is to me. </joey>
<connor> - It blew my mind. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm fucking serious! </garnt>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> What's wrong with you? </garnt>
<garnt> What happened in your childhood, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I've never cared about- </garnt>
<garnt> - Anything. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Until those PNGs came along. </joey>
<joey> - I've never cared about winning money </joey>
<connor> 'cause like, you know,
to me money has value. </connor>
<connor> Like obviously like- </connor>
<garnt> - You can't put a price on. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't put a price on waifus. </garnt>
<connor> That serotonin here when you
win like a fuckin' character </connor>
<garnt> that you're actually
emotionally attached to. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause people who win money in casinos, </garnt>
<garnt> they're not emotionally
attached to this money. </garnt>
<garnt> - I doubt that. </garnt>
<garnt> I doubt that very much. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I've had friends who
have actually had actual, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, proper gambling
problems as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember this, I knew
a friend in a university </garnt>
<garnt> who one day won like
10,000 pounds in a casino. </garnt>
<connor> Could have paid off his student loans, </connor>
<connor> could have been like completely debt free. </connor>
<connor> And within three weeks he had
spent the 10K, 10,000 pounds. </connor>
<connor> - On gambling? </connor>
<connor> - On gambling. </connor>
<connor> Mostly on gambling. </connor>
<connor> And I asked him, </connor>
<connor> "Dude, you could've fuckin'
invested this money. </connor>
<connor> "You could have used it like more wisely. </connor>
<connor> "You could have used
it to better your life. </connor>
<connor> "Why did you spend it on gambling? </connor>
<connor> "Or why did you spend it so easily?" </connor>
<connor> And he said, "Because I
didn't care about it." </connor>
<connor> Because he didn't earn it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he had no emotional
attachment to the money </connor>
<connor> 'cause he was just given it. </connor>
<connor> So to him it just felt like- </connor>
<joey> - It is the equivalent of
just someone coming up to you </joey>
<joey> and being like, "Here's 10K." </joey>
<connor> - A lot of these, you know,
the serotonin hit you get </connor>
<connor> from these waifus, three months
later you don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - So, that's on you. </connor>
<garnt> That's your prerogative, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you give a shit
about some of the games </garnt>
<garnt> that you pulled for </garnt>
<connor> and got that lovely serotonin
hit like months after? </connor>
<connor> - No, but I have a nice
memory, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - He goes to his fuckin', like, wall, </connor>
<connor> like, "Ah, yes, I remember
the time I pulled-" </connor>
<connor> - I had a good experience playing, like, </connor>
<connor> all the gacha games I've played. </connor>
<connor> Otherwise I wouldn't have
played them in the first place. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, you know, small, </joey>
<joey> basically the same as like going </joey>
<connor> to a fuckin' arcade or something </connor>
<connor> and, like, putting money into that. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> - That's different. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's different. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, yeah, you're only, you know, </connor>
<connor> maybe 100 yen, at a time,
but it's still the same. </connor>
<connor> It's like why- </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem is that
you could do 100 yen at a time </connor>
<connor> and if I wanted to spend 500 bucks, </connor>
<joey> which I tried to do, it
takes like five hours. </joey>
<joey> It's a long time. </joey>
<joey> If you want to spend 10 grand on gacha, </joey>
<connor> give yourself 20 minutes. </connor>
<joey> - 10 grand in 20 minutes? </joey>
<connor> - You probably could. </connor>
<connor> If you were just buying the
highest option multiple times. </connor>
<connor> - Speed running
bankruptcy, let's go, baby! </connor>
<connor> - Like, you could I'm sure, you know. </connor>
<garnt> Like, you see the streamers
who spent like 10 grand </garnt>
<garnt> but they're making the money back. </garnt>
<garnt> Think about all the
people who are doing that </garnt>
<joey> who aren't making the money back. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, some people are probably </joey>
<joey> in the financial position
to be able to do that. </joey>
<joey> But why even give yourself
the chance of like making </joey>
<joey> that happen to other
people who aren't, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, and again, you
hear the horror stories </joey>
<connor> of kids spending their mother's
money and shit like that. </connor>
<connor> Like, why is this even able to happen? </connor>
<connor> There should always be
a hard limit built in </connor>
<connor> that shouldn't be able to like- </connor>
<connor> - I think that's on the person though. </connor>
<joey> - Let me ask you this, </joey>
<joey> what regulations would
you want to see then? </joey>
<connor> How do you fix this problem
that you've presented? </connor>
<connor> - I think when you download the game, </connor>
<connor> and there is gacha in it, </connor>
<connor> there should be an immediate question </connor>
<connor> of what is the maximum
you're willing to spend </connor>
<connor> in like one year? </connor>
<connor> And you physically no matter what you do </connor>
<connor> cannot go over that. </connor>
<connor> Like it will not let you. </connor>
<joey> - But what if you said zero
and then you change your mind? </joey>
<connor> - Well, that's on you. </connor>
<connor> You've already said zero. </connor>
<joey> - Isn't that the same as just putting </joey>
<joey> in the credit card numbers
by yourself anyway? </joey>
<connor> - You've decided zero, you
then can't hurt yourself more, </connor>
<connor> and you're stuck with the thing
because you agreed to zero. </connor>
<connor> I think that should be a thing. </connor>
<connor> - No, because like on the other side then </connor>
<garnt> that means spending money in
essence is also on you, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, that shifts responsibility </garnt>
<connor> from just one place to another. </connor>
<connor> - This is the problem. </connor>
<connor> Like, the problem that
people have with I think </connor>
<joey> when they're talking about,
like, gambling addicts is </joey>
<joey> that we don't think of it 'cause
we're not gambling addicts. </joey>
<joey> We can't think of it as, </joey>
<garnt> "Why don't you just not spend money, bro?" </garnt>
<garnt> That's not how it works. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the problem is </garnt>
<garnt> that I think people alienate these people </garnt>
<connor> and don't even remotely think how it is </connor>
<connor> to be in their position. </connor>
<connor> - I totally understand. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time, </connor>
<connor> it's what I'm trying to say is </connor>
<garnt> obviously there are people that
are proper gambling addicts </garnt>
<garnt> that have a problem that
they, you know, physically, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, like cannot control, </garnt>
<garnt> have a harder time to control. </garnt>
<garnt> But how would you introduce
a system where, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> how do you introduce a system
that can regulate that, </garnt>
<connor> you know, as opposed to, you know, </connor>
<connor> other people who have, you
know, no problem, you know, </connor>
<connor> having willpower and being able </connor>
<connor> to control their spending
and financial decisions. </connor>
<connor> - I do think that there
should be a hard limit </connor>
<connor> on monthly amount of money
you can spend on any game. </connor>
<connor> I legitimately believe that. </connor>
<connor> - I believe that as well. </connor>
<connor> - I do not think that, like, </connor>
<connor> anyone should have any excuse
to spend over like $10,000 </connor>
<connor> on a video game a month. </connor>
<connor> Like that should be just, </connor>
<connor> that should be like a hard limit baked </connor>
<connor> into the game or app store. </connor>
<connor> Something like that. </connor>
<garnt> Because, realistically, no one
needs to spend over a grand. </garnt>
<garnt> And if they do, </garnt>
<garnt> if everyone's playing by the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> of no one can spend over a grand, </garnt>
<garnt> the devs won't make games
that are able to get benefit </garnt>
<garnt> of spending over a grand,
you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't understand </garnt>
<connor> why there hasn't been some
kind of like hard limit </connor>
<connor> on video game spending. </connor>
<joey> - Because why would the devs
cuck themselves like that? </joey>
<connor> - It's in the government's best interest. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no, that's probably
the best solution I can, like, </connor>
<connor> agree on because I do feel like
there should be a hard limit </connor>
<connor> on how much you can spend on mobile games. </connor>
<connor> - I think there should be
something again with like </connor>
<connor> how you can say, I want
to quit like casinos </connor>
<connor> because, you know, gambling addicts </connor>
<garnt> probably aren't gambling addicts 24/7. </garnt>
<garnt> It's probably like a
lapse of like willpower </garnt>
<garnt> where they're like,
"Fuck, I need to gamble. </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm depressed," or some shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fuckin' know. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how it works. </garnt>
<garnt> But there should be
something in the system </garnt>
<garnt> that's like, okay, I want to gamble. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you can say that, </garnt>
<garnt> or at one point when you
download the game say, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to gamble. </garnt>
<connor> You can only change this in say seven days </connor>
<connor> of like, are you sure? </connor>
<connor> So you say yes, I want to gamble. </connor>
<connor> All right, come back in seven days. </connor>
<connor> If you're sure you want to
gamble, we'll let you gamble. </connor>
<connor> Why not something like that? </connor>
<connor> - Developers. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Because most of the money I bet is spent </joey>
<joey> is everyone's moment of weakness </joey>
<garnt> where they're like, "Fuck
it, I'll spend 100 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> "Let's see what I get, come on." </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> How often would you spend
100 dollars on the gacha </garnt>
<connor> if I had to ask you Joey,
come back in seven days, </connor>
<connor> tell me you still want
to spend that 100 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - And I just wouldn't
bother with playing the game </connor>
<joey> at that point. </joey>
<connor> - You'd play it free to play. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, or not play it at all. </connor>
<joey> I say more than anything, I'd
probably not play it at all. </joey>
<connor> - What, if you can't
spend money in the game? </connor>
<joey> - No, if I'm persistently being
asked, like, are you sure? </joey>
<joey> Are you sure you want to do it? </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I'm not
even gonna bother with it. </joey>
<joey> - It was that intrusive? </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> "What do you mean you won't
let me spend my money? </connor>
<connor> "I'm furious!" </connor>
<connor> - It's like, leave me alone. </connor>
<joey> I'll spend it if I want to spend it. </joey>
<connor> - It's like the opposite now </connor>
<connor> where they're like,
"Spend money, spend money. </connor>
<connor> "Get this pack, a deal!" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and I'm in a
position where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I'll get the pack if I
feel like getting the pack." </joey>
<joey> But I'm not going to if
I don't feel like it. </joey>
<joey> - But it's the same thing. </joey>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<connor> You can just say no to the money thing! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You literally just said the same thing. </connor>
<connor> You're just being an asshole now! </connor>
<connor> I literally just gave you
the opposite situation </connor>
<garnt> where I was like, "Spend
money, spend money." </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, "I'm fine. </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't want that." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So what's the difference of saying no? </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<connor> I feel like you're just
playing devil's advocate </connor>
<connor> just to piss me off. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I love pissing you off. </joey>
<joey> It's my favorite hobby </joey>
<connor> - No, I mean, I can agree. </connor>
<garnt> - That's my serotonin. </garnt>
<connor> - I just think that there's
been way too many cases, </connor>
<garnt> obviously, of people going fuckin' broke. </garnt>
<garnt> - How many cases do you know of? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, how many do you know of? </connor>
<garnt> - You hear it all the fuckin' time. </garnt>
<garnt> - From who? </garnt>
<garnt> - I bet if you asked how
many people had, like, </garnt>
<garnt> spent a significant
amount of their savings </garnt>
<garnt> or like spent too much money, oh, sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> Spent an amount of money
that they regretted. </garnt>
<garnt> I bet it would be like 50% minimum. </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - We can do it right now. </connor>
<connor> We can fuckin' do it. </connor>
<connor> - That's fine. </connor>
<connor> Let us know on Twitter, </connor>
<connor> have you ever spent an amount
of money on a gacha game </connor>
<connor> or video game that you ended
up severely regretting? </connor>
<joey> - And be honest. </joey>
<connor> - Be totally honest. </connor>
<joey> - This is a proper scientific
conduct we're doing right now. </joey>
<connor> We actually want to know. </connor>
<connor> - Like, no meme, I'm
actually genuinely curious. </connor>
<connor> - I love gaming. </connor>
<connor> I am a gamer, gamers rise up. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Rise and grind. </joey>
<joey> - I am a casual gamer. </joey>
<joey> I just like enjoying my
time playing a video game. </joey>
<joey> And if I, you know, if
I wanted to, you know, </joey>
<connor> enjoy my time pulling for some waifus, </connor>
<connor> then I know that that's on me </connor>
<connor> because I know that that's
what I'm paying for. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - I also, me as well. </connor>
<connor> I understand that. </connor>
<connor> I have self control. </connor>
<connor> - I don't regret any money
that I've ever put into gacha. </connor>
<connor> From the beginning. </connor>
<connor> - Would you ever say that
you've fallen for something </connor>
<connor> that is perhaps like, you know, </connor>
<connor> not predatory but close to it. </connor>
<connor> Maybe like they keep offering you stuff, </connor>
<connor> you know, there's deals constantly. </connor>
<connor> - Look, I'm not going to lie </connor>
<connor> and say that gacha isn't just
fuckin' gambling with waifus </connor>
<connor> 'cause it fuckin' is, okay? </connor>
<connor> But like, I've never seen
the appeal of casinos </connor>
<connor> because of the reason that I said where, </connor>
<connor> you know, to me casinos are scary. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you pay for the
chance to win more money. </connor>
<connor> And that's like, </connor>
<connor> that's to me that's like a risk, right? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause that's literally just gambling. </joey>
<joey> But to me like gacha is I'm
paying for an experience. </joey>
<joey> I'm paying because I
actually want this thing </joey>
<joey> that I'm putting money into. </joey>
<joey> I actually want it. </joey>
<joey> And it's different where people
are gonna meme this and say, </joey>
<joey> "Garnt doesn't care about getting money." </joey>
<joey> That's not what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> I'm saying if I'm going to get money, </joey>
<joey> there are plenty of other ways </joey>
<joey> that I would want to get money. </joey>
<joey> - Gambling is the last resort. </joey>
<garnt> - Gambling's the last way I
would use to actually get money. </garnt>
<connor> I wanna work for that shit. </connor>
<joey> - But there's only one way to get waifus. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I rarely give a shit
about what memes do. </joey>
<joey> I'm not like that. </joey>
<joey> But I guess because we're in the position </joey>
<joey> where we all have our own job. </joey>
<connor> We're all old, old people
compared to the zoomers out there. </connor>
<connor> - And apparently you're the youngest one, </connor>
<connor> but you're the boomer of the group. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like a boomer, man. </connor>
<connor> When I go on Twitter sometimes
I feel like a boomer. </connor>
<garnt> - You are the boomer. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, it's all hella normalized, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Spending, you know, 100
bucks on a few pulls. </garnt>
<garnt> Me and the boys gonna pull a few waifus. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, you know, we're
joking about it on Twitter, </garnt>
<joey> you know, we're going to be stream it, </joey>
<joey> but it's not like, you know, </joey>
<joey> someone goes to a casino and is like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, we do a cheeky like
10 pull on roulette." </joey>
<joey> And then like everyone's meming it. </joey>
<garnt> "Hey, the classic, you know, bet on red." </garnt>
<garnt> We're meming the shit
to like 16, 15 year olds </garnt>
<connor> who are then wanting to do it. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It feels weird. </connor>
<connor> - Okay well, what I would say is, okay, </connor>
<connor> like part of the reason
I've been spending more </connor>
<connor> on, like, gacha now is
because 2020 has been boring </connor>
<connor> as fuck or 2020 was boring as fuck. </connor>
<connor> And I think to myself, </connor>
<connor> what would I have spent
that money on anyway? </connor>
<connor> Probably going out and getting pissed. </connor>
<connor> Like, how much do you
spend on a night out? </connor>
<connor> - It depends, right? </connor>
<joey> - How big the sesh is. </joey>
<joey> - Let's say a standard sesh in
London with the boys, right? </joey>
<connor> You can spend upwards of like
100, 200 pounds on drinks. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, no. </connor>
<connor> What are you getting up to in London? </connor>
<connor> - Popping champagnes in London. </connor>
<connor> - When one single cocktail
in London is like a tenner, </connor>
<garnt> like you start off at like
a Wetherspoons or something. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, that's the cheap drinks, </garnt>
<garnt> but as you get further and
further on in the night, </garnt>
<garnt> people easily spend 100 to
200 pounds on one night. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you get more out of that 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> of pulling that gacha than a
whole night with your boys? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I would say that- </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<garnt> No, no, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you, a
politician right now, Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<garnt> Come on, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Answer the question. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just saying like- </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I'm being attacked right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I am attacking you. </garnt>
<connor> - I need to fuckin' defend myself. </connor>
<connor> I need to fuckin' defend this shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Mister speaker, if I may interject. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you know, you say
we've normalized the stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, you are fine, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> spending that much on a night out </garnt>
<garnt> because that's what you choose. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, that's what you
choose as the experience, </garnt>
<connor> and that's what you choose
is okay for the price. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - So basically what you're
saying is a night out </joey>
<joey> with the boys is the equivalent </joey>
<joey> to getting your favorite waifu. </joey>
<connor> - There's tangible stuff you're buying. </connor>
<connor> You're buying drinks there. </connor>
<connor> That is stuff that has to be made. </connor>
<connor> You're going, you're transporting. </connor>
<connor> This is all stuff that, you
know, has a cost for a reason. </connor>
<connor> The gacha it's conflated </connor>
<connor> because they know they
can get away with it. </connor>
<connor> They know they can charge
this much for a pull. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's the equivalent of, like, </joey>
<joey> going out to a bar and
buying a tenner drink </joey>
<garnt> and going home and pouring
yourself that same drink, right? </garnt>
<connor> - No, it's different. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's the same. </garnt>
<garnt> Because like getting your
favorite waifu on a free pull </garnt>
<joey> is the pouring your drink at home. </joey>
<connor> - No, it's not. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, it is. </joey>
<connor> - What's the going out then? </connor>
<connor> What's that? </connor>
<joey> - The fuckin' ten pull you pay for. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<garnt> No! </garnt>
<joey> - That's exactly what it is! </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, this is such low brain IQ. </joey>
<garnt> No dude, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> When you go to, like, let's
say you go to a bar in London. </garnt>
<connor> You pay, I don't know, fuckin'
nine pounds for a cocktail. </connor>
<connor> You're not paying for the ingredients. </connor>
<connor> You're paying for someone one, to make it- </connor>
<connor> - You're paying for the experience. </connor>
<garnt> - You're paying for the experience, </garnt>
<garnt> you're paying for like,
you know, the glass, </garnt>
<garnt> the expertly prepared. </garnt>
<garnt> - The glass. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you have nice
cocktail glasses at home? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I ain't gonna buy them. </garnt>
<garnt> They're like fuckin' 30 quid. </garnt>
<garnt> They have really nice ones, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Everything you get is tailored experience. </garnt>
<garnt> That's where the price goes. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it a bit of a rip off? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, kinda. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's not, like, to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where I feel like I'm
being taken advantage of. </garnt>
<garnt> With gacha games I kind of do. </garnt>
<joey> - But that's just on you. </joey>
<joey> - No, I feel like they, </joey>
<joey> I genuinely believe
that, like, gacha games </joey>
<connor> to some extent are like just getting away </connor>
<connor> with as much as they can
to take advantage of you. </connor>
<connor> - Of course it is. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna say that
they're not getting away with </connor>
<connor> as much as they can. </connor>
<garnt> I totally believe that
there should be regulations </garnt>
<connor> around this stuff. </connor>
<garnt> That's not the argument here. </garnt>
<connor> - The fact that it took, like, </connor>
<connor> multiple governments to get involved </connor>
<garnt> just to make them show you
the odds is ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, how long were
people getting fucked over </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they didn't know
the percentage was 0.001? </garnt>
<connor> - A long time. </connor>
<garnt> - A lot of people. </garnt>
<connor> But they probably also didn't care. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but how is it ever acceptable? </joey>
<joey> Like, that that was okay? </joey>
<joey> Like casino, you know, the odds. </joey>
<joey> Like, even casinos aren't that scummy. </joey>
<joey> They'll let you know. </joey>
<connor> Like, this is just blows my mind </connor>
<connor> and how people constantly defend them. </connor>
<connor> I would be more okay with
if everyone just admitted </connor>
<connor> it's just one big scam. </connor>
<connor> And we're all just in for it- </connor>
<connor> - No, it's not a scam though. </connor>
<connor> It's not a scam! </connor>
<connor> - It's like one step away from a scam. </connor>
<connor> - What's that one step? </connor>
<connor> - What is a scam for you then? </connor>
<garnt> What is a scam for you? </garnt>
<garnt> Because to me a scam is like it means </garnt>
<garnt> that you are getting, what's
the word I'm looking for? </garnt>
<connor> Like, the user's in the dark. </connor>
<connor> We know exactly what we're
getting ourselves into. </connor>
<connor> And that's why, to me, it is not a scam. </connor>
<joey> - A scam is like saying like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, on this banner, </joey>
<joey> "the ten pull is a guaranteed six star," </joey>
<connor> when it's not a guarantee. </connor>
<connor> - That's come in to stop any
more government regulation. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if they were trying
to get away with that for- </connor>
<connor> - No, that is a scam. </connor>
<garnt> If they're actively lying to the user base </garnt>
<garnt> then that to me is a scam. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which I'm sure many of
them were at some point. </garnt>
<garnt> - But we don't know that. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, come on (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - The best weapon against
that is just education, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's like- </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> No, no! </garnt>
<garnt> - DARE, don't do drugs. </garnt>
<joey> - Just have a wrinkly
brain, that's all it is. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I meme it the fuck up, </joey>
<connor> but if you want me to talk
about the realities of it, </connor>
<joey> I will talk about the
fuckin' realities of it. </joey>
<connor> And that's because I don't want, </connor>
<connor> I know exactly what I'm
getting into with gacha games. </connor>
<connor> And I know what my limits are. </connor>
<connor> - I do think it's gotten
much better since they've, </connor>
<connor> one, you get a guaranteed </connor>
<connor> and, you know, you get to see the rates. </connor>
<connor> That's much better. </connor>
<connor> That's increased it a lot. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I meme the fuck up </connor>
<connor> that I'm like spending money on, like, </connor>
<connor> literally a fuckin'
0.6%, but that's on me. </connor>
<connor> - You're in a financial
position to be able </connor>
<connor> to make that decision though. </connor>
<connor> - But even if I wasn't,
you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - That's on the person. </connor>
<connor> - Not always. </connor>
<connor> I think sometimes depending on how, </connor>
<connor> we're going in circles kind of, </connor>
<connor> but like depending on how the
game is presented and made </connor>
<joey> I think sometimes a
fault can be on the game. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I hate how you can't
even have this discussion </joey>
<joey> without people being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh you're just whining, bro. </joey>
<joey> "It's free to play any way." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, it's not that simple. </joey>
<joey> I think it's never that simple. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I feel like if- </joey>
<connor> - I think not opening the door </connor>
<connor> to that conversation is irresponsible. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, for me, </connor>
<connor> I feel like the conversation
to me, it always ends at </connor>
<connor> if it doesn't feel like, you
know, your type of game, like, </connor>
<connor> I don't feel like you
are made for gacha games. </connor>
<connor> And I genuinely believe that </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like someone
with your personality, </connor>
<connor> like a true fuckin' gamer </connor>
<connor> just would never enjoy gacha games. </connor>
<connor> - No, I don't. </connor>
<connor> I hate that I'm paying
for part of the game. </connor>
<connor> I hate that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm completely fine with that. </connor>
<connor> The reason I love gacha games is </connor>
<connor> 'cause it suits my lifestyle perfectly. </connor>
<connor> It suits my mentality </connor>
<connor> when it comes to playing games perfectly. </connor>
<joey> - He's a true gacha gamer girl. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not saying that
Gacha shouldn't exist </connor>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> I totally recognize that it has its place </connor>
<connor> and it's got its value. </connor>
<connor> I just want like everything
to be more transparent. </connor>
<connor> And there'll be systems in place </connor>
<connor> to stop people going broke from them. </connor>
<connor> I don't think anyone should
go broke from fuckin' like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Fuckin' Arknights. </connor>
<connor> Are you kidding me? </connor>
<connor> Like, no one should be going
broke from fuckin' video games. </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<connor> Why was that even an option? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it shouldn't be an option </connor>
<garnt> and that's what we agree on. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<garnt> It's like, we've totally
made it totally memeable </garnt>
<connor> and okay to be like,
"(laughs) He's gone broke. </connor>
<connor> "What an asshole." </connor>
<connor> - We haven't memed up people going broke! </connor>
<garnt> - People do, man! </garnt>
<garnt> What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - But that's not us. </connor>
<connor> We're not doing that! </connor>
<garnt> - Who's meming? </garnt>
<connor> - Go on Twitter, I bet there's some, bro. </connor>
<joey> - But Twitter you meme
up fuckin' everything. </joey>
<connor> - If someone's like, </connor>
<connor> "(laughs) I just spent
100 dollars on a gacha </connor>
<connor> "and I pulled nothing." </connor>
<connor> That's basically like the same </connor>
<connor> as what you did to
fuckin' Eugene being like, </connor>
<connor> "(laughs) You just spent
100 pounds on a casino </connor>
<connor> "and you didn't get anything." </connor>
<joey> - Also there's nothing on Twitter </joey>
<joey> that's not getting memed up. </joey>
<joey> Like, you can scroll
on Twitter being like, </joey>
<connor> "LOL his dad died." </connor>
<connor> - If someone has a legitimate problem </connor>
<connor> and someone's like, </connor>
<joey> "Dude, I fully regret
spending this much on gacha." </joey>
<joey> Then I'd be like, "Bro, I feel you." </joey>
<joey> - Like, sorry. </joey>
<joey> - "You just got to quit. </joey>
<joey> "You know what I mean?" </joey>
<connor> This is bad. </connor>
<connor> - Well, there's nothing else to say. </connor>
<connor> - They're gambling addicts for a reason. </connor>
<joey> You can't just quit. </joey>
<joey> It's not that easy. </joey>
<joey> - There's nothing else we can say. </joey>
<joey> In our position there's
nothing else you can say. </joey>
<connor> - "Just stop doing drugs, bro. </connor>
<connor> "Just stop. </connor>
<joey> "Why're you doing drugs, man?" </joey>
<connor> Like, it's not that easy. </connor>
<connor> End of point. </connor>
<connor> No more. </connor>
<connor> There should be regulations. </connor>
<joey> - Bottom line. </joey>
<joey> Someone needs to make the
gacha police a reality. </joey>
<connor> - Bottom line there should be regulations. </connor>
<connor> How strict they are that's up for debate </connor>
<connor> between gacha players and
pro gamers apparently. </connor>
<connor> - Pro gamers. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> Pro gamer girls and gacha gamer girls. </joey>
<connor> The never-ending war. </connor>
<garnt> - I think there should be
like a cool-down period, 100%. </garnt>
<garnt> That's my closing statements. </garnt>
<connor> Are gacha games predatory? </connor>
<connor> That's the title. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - Why not? </connor>
<connor> That's a brilliant title. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause then the entire
fuckin' gacha game community is </connor>
<joey> just gonna destroy us. </joey>
<connor> - See, that's the problem is </connor>
<connor> that the gacha gamers get offended </connor>
<connor> when you insinuate there could be anything </connor>
<connor> even predatory about it. </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<connor> - That's not what we said. </connor>
<connor> - I know, but why though? </connor>
<connor> Why do they? </connor>
<connor> I've seen the moment you
complain about gacha rates, </connor>
<connor> there are like a hoard
of people being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh I'm free to play. </connor>
<connor> "No, no, no, no." </connor>
<connor> - Because we hurt their feelings. </connor>
<connor> - Because basically from a
lot of people's perspective, </connor>
<connor> it sounds like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh you're enjoying this thing? </garnt>
<garnt> "No, you're not allowed to enjoy this." </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> It's like, why, why are you enjoying this? </connor>
<connor> It's wrong to enjoy this thing. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, the games are totally good. </connor>
<connor> The games are great. </connor>
<connor> Genshin's a great game. </connor>
<connor> All chill, whatever you want. </connor>
<connor> You want free to play? </connor>
<connor> Cool. </connor>
<connor> You want to spend money? </connor>
<connor> Cool. </connor>
<connor> But I just think </connor>
<connor> that there shouldn't be
like predatory systems </connor>
<connor> on anything to do with video games. </connor>
<connor> It's like having like a Fisher-Price toy </connor>
<connor> and being like, </connor>
<connor> "Do you want to roll
for a new fuckin' toy? </connor>
<connor> "You want a 10 dollar?" </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, we don't put that shit near kids. </connor>
<joey> - So you're not the kind
of person who's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, there's a new DLC." </joey>
<connor> - I don't give a fuck about DLC. </connor>
<connor> You give me the game as is. </connor>
<connor> That's what I'm playing. </connor>
<connor> - You're just a true gamer, man. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe. </connor>
<connor> - The most vanilla gamer out there. </connor>
<joey> - How's that vanilla? </joey>
<connor> Hardcore, I'd like you to add. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Go and fuckin' play a
fuckin' disguised book </connor>
<connor> and call it a game, Joey. </connor>
<connor> - What is your perfect
gaming experienced, Connor? </connor>
<connor> What is your perfect gaming experience? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, League. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> Fuck off. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> No League player would ever say that. </connor>
<joey> - Then why do you play it so much? </joey>
<joey> - That's a good question, Joey. </joey>
<joey> Addiction. </joey>
<connor> There should be a systems in place. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - There should be restrictions. </garnt>
<garnt> - You meme, but League
addiction is a fuckin' thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't try to tell me- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you memed that! </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't try to tell me League
addiction is not a thing. </garnt>
<connor> It is a fuckin' thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but it's not like you, </connor>
<connor> I mean, you have to try
very hard to ruin your life </connor>
<garnt> with a League addiction. </garnt>
<garnt> You have to really be on
that path of ruining it. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Perfect game for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe like something like
one of the Halo games. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a very fuckin' good game. </garnt>
<joey> Perfect game experience. </joey>
<joey> You get a good game. </joey>
<joey> Maybe some of them had like DLC, </joey>
<joey> but that's (mutters) </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Points down for that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Are you talking about, like, OG Halo? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, OG Halo. </connor>
<joey> - Like, Halo one and two. </joey>
<connor> - Halo one and two are
really fuckin' good games. </connor>
<joey> Just a game that has an experience </joey>
<joey> that when it's over it's over. </joey>
<joey> - What about, like, a current game? </joey>
<joey> - A current game. </joey>
<joey> Hades is probably the best
game I've played recently. </joey>
<joey> That's a fantastic example of a game. </joey>
<connor> No DLC, no bullshit. </connor>
<connor> You just play the game. </connor>
<connor> You know, you get the
story if you want that. </connor>
<connor> I'm not into that. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> That ain't me. </connor>
<connor> But the gameplay, fuckin' amazing! </connor>
<connor> - To me, like, 90% of the games
I ever play, I don't finish. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - Such a fuckin' weak mindset. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, like, I get to a point during- </connor>
<connor> - Do you cum during sex? </connor>
<connor> Or do you just walk out
halfway through, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Does the sex- </garnt>
<connor> - Does the sex take 50 hours? </connor>
<connor> - Does the sex take 40 to 50 hours? </connor>
<connor> - Bare in mind I don't play Final Fantasy. </connor>
<garnt> I don't play your coups. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't play any of
those long games at all. </garnt>
<garnt> The longest game I played
was like fuckin' Blue Dragon </garnt>
<connor> or some shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, I have to be properly
invested in this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm the type of guy who, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I get really into a game </garnt>
<garnt> and then I hit around
like the 20 hour mark, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I still have a
quarter of the story left </garnt>
<garnt> or a quarter of the gameplay left. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like I've gotten
everything out of that game </garnt>
<garnt> that I need to do, and
then I just stop playing. </garnt>
<garnt> Know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, a big reason why I, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> even with gacha games
is that if there's not </garnt>
<connor> that reason for me to keep playing </connor>
<connor> or if I'm not getting
something new out of it, </connor>
<connor> then I just drop it. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> It's just a fuckin' daily quest every day. </connor>
<connor> - Well, sometimes I like the story. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I, you know,
sometimes it is, you know, </connor>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you want to get
that grind for that character- </garnt>
<joey> - The moment you said
story he just checked out. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> I could see his brain just power down. </joey>
<joey> - I cannot fathom why
people want to grind. </joey>
<connor> Like, why do people put
themselves through that? </connor>
<connor> It's torture. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's kind of like
just that mindless task, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just something to do. </joey>
<joey> - You feel like you're- </joey>
<connor> - Go fuckin' knit or some shit. </connor>
<connor> - You're telling me that League
isn't a grind after a point. </connor>
<connor> It's a fuckin' grind. </connor>
<connor> It's just a grind with
more complicated controls. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Yes it is. </connor>
<connor> - There's a loss, </connor>
<connor> and there's like a win and a
loss have different outcomes. </connor>
<joey> Grinds there's only one outcome. </joey>
<joey> You just win. </joey>
<joey> You just, you do the thing
that you're meant to do. </joey>
<joey> And then you've already planned- </joey>
<joey> - Well, it depends how you grind. </joey>
<joey> - But it's like, all right,
I've got my spreadsheet out. </joey>
<joey> It's gonna take eight years of grinding </joey>
<joey> of killing these boars. </joey>
<joey> - What is- </joey>
<joey> - Is that how you view every JRPG player? </joey>
<joey> That we have a fuckin' spreadsheet? </joey>
<joey> - No, but in your mind it's like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm gonna do this
mindless task five times </joey>
<joey> "to get this thing." </joey>
<connor> - What is the end goal of League? </connor>
<connor> - There is no end goal. </connor>
<connor> It's like self-improvement in mechanics. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly.
- Checkmate. </connor>
<connor> - That's exactly it. </connor>
<connor> Because that's my problem
with competitive games. </connor>
<connor> I, you know, every time I
get to do a competitive game </connor>
<connor> whether it be League, Overwatch, </connor>
<connor> fuckin' Valorant, whatever, </connor>
<connor> is like the golden
period is the first time </connor>
<connor> when you're learning the game. </connor>
<connor> And then you started
getting good at the game. </connor>
<connor> And then you start learning the systems. </connor>
<connor> And then you start the ranks
playing, you start climbing. </connor>
<connor> That's when the game is fun. </connor>
<garnt> When you feel like </garnt>
<garnt> what you've learnt has had
a tangible effect, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But everyone, everyone will hit that wall. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone will hit that wall </garnt>
<garnt> where you climb as hard as you can, </garnt>
<garnt> unless you're fuckin' faker or something </garnt>
<garnt> and you've won like the world tournament. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that is basically the
only end goal there can be </garnt>
<garnt> in any competitive game, to
be the best in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> And so everyone will reach a
point where it becomes a grind </garnt>
<garnt> because there's no way that
you can overcome that wall </garnt>
<connor> without grinding your way
to overcome that wall. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's like
a self-improvement thing. </connor>
<connor> - And then after you do
that you reach another wall </connor>
<connor> and another wall after that. </connor>
<connor> - But it's constantly
like improving a skill, </connor>
<connor> but in like JRPGs and you know gacha games </connor>
<connor> often it requires no
skill to do the grinding. </connor>
<connor> In fact, it requires the opposite. </connor>
<connor> - But what I'm saying
is you feel like you're- </connor>
<joey> - But you're working towards a goal. </joey>
<joey> - You talk about self-improvement, </joey>
<joey> well you're working towards a goal. </joey>
<joey> You're gaining something. </joey>
<joey> To us gacha games is just that. </joey>
<joey> I mean, like, not just gacha games, </joey>
<connor> but like I'm pretty sure in like any MMO </connor>
<connor> when you're grinding, </connor>
<connor> you just feel like you're making
progress towards something. </connor>
<connor> You just less- </connor>
<connor> - That's like fun to people? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! </connor>
<connor> - Just having like the super
easy thing just play out. </connor>
<connor> And you're like not engaged at all </connor>
<connor> just because you're
going towards something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you know, sometimes
I don't want to feel shitty </connor>
<connor> when I've played five League
games and lost five in a row. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I play games to
have fun, not to rage. </joey>
<joey> - It's just, like, </joey>
<connor> you're just activating
the fuckin' neurons. </connor>
<connor> You don't need to worry about it. </connor>
<connor> - I just like being challenged constantly. </connor>
<connor> Like, I want something
that is challenging always. </connor>
<joey> Like, the moment you grind- </joey>
<joey> - How do not get tired? </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> I like being challenged constantly. </connor>
<connor> - Do you not feel like
competitive games get </connor>
<connor> to a grind after a point? </connor>
<connor> Do you not feel like- </connor>
<connor> - No, it gets to a
point where I feel like, </connor>
<connor> okay, I genuinely think unless
I put X amount of effort in, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not going to improve at this game. </garnt>
<garnt> I normally just quit at that point </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm like, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I've gotten
all the challenge I can </garnt>
<connor> out of this game in a
reasonable amount of time. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to find something else. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and that's
exactly the same for me. </connor>
<connor> When I reached the point
where I reached that grind- </connor>
<connor> - Half these gacha games have auto-play, </connor>
<connor> so what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> - Sorry? </connor>
<connor> - What are you doing? </connor>
<joey> - I'm doing other things. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, that's why, you know, </connor>
<connor> the only times I'm okay with auto-play is </connor>
<connor> when it's on a mobile because- </connor>
<joey> - I'm not fuckin' staring at my phone </joey>
<connor> while it's auto-playing the entire time. </connor>
<joey> I'm doing other shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but I've been out with you </connor>
<connor> and your auto playing on the thing, </connor>
<connor> and you gotta keep track
of it a little bit, </connor>
<connor> make sure it's all going well. </connor>
<joey> You're like, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, for like two seconds, </joey>
<joey> and then I'm doing other things. </joey>
<joey> - You also can't use
your phone in that time </joey>
<connor> because you are doing the
mission, so you can't reply- </connor>
<joey> - Oh sorry, I have other things
to do than look at my phone. </joey>
<connor> - I have emails to reply to, Joey. </connor>
<connor> I have, you know, messages
I've got to reply to, man. </connor>
<joey> You know, it's busy life. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know about that. </joey>
<garnt> - I also like not fucking my battery </garnt>
<garnt> which is like really
annoying on the gacha games. </garnt>
<connor> When I was playing Arknights, </connor>
<connor> I had to carry a fuckin' spare
charger with me everywhere. </connor>
<connor> My battery was fuckin' dying. </connor>
<connor> - For me when gacha
games stop getting fun is </connor>
<garnt> the moment I start thinking
about optimization. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause when I start
thinking about optimization, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, okay, now I'm just like- </garnt>
<connor> - That is the challenge
for me in gacha games. </connor>
<garnt> - That's exactly the point. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is problem. </garnt>
<garnt> Because once I figure out </garnt>
<garnt> how I can optimize this game maximized, </garnt>
<garnt> then it's not fun anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Then its not fun! </garnt>
<garnt> - But I figure that out immediately </garnt>
<garnt> because all the shit's online, </garnt>
<joey> and everyone tells you how to do it. </joey>
<connor> So once you've seen the spreadsheet- </connor>
<joey> - So, you basically, like,
just willingly is like, </joey>
<joey> "I just figured out a way
to make this game not fun." </joey>
<connor> - There is nothing fun
about pressing auto-play. </connor>
<connor> That's fuckin' shit. </connor>
<connor> - When you're opening up a spreadsheets </connor>
<connor> and you know, actually, thinking
about how to optimize this </connor>
<connor> and optimize that, that's
when it stops getting fun. </connor>
<connor> I just like the experience of just doing </connor>
<garnt> like a very simple activity. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need to worry about it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just feel like
I'm gaining something, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm not gonna say that, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, this is the peak
of all entertainment. </garnt>
<garnt> "This is why I play video games." </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean. </connor>
<connor> It's just a nice little
thing in the background. </connor>
<connor> - I cannot understand. </connor>
<connor> Like, my brain cannot
wrap around the thought </connor>
<connor> of just I'm just progressing- </connor>
<connor> - Maybe I'm the monkey
brain in this instance. </connor>
<connor> - To me, the idea of progressing to a goal </connor>
<connor> without actually doing anything, </connor>
<connor> it seems like the dumbest thing ever. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - How is it a goal if
you're not progressing? </connor>
<connor> - Because fuckin' life
is stressful enough, bro. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, I get rid of my stress- </connor>
<joey> - Life is already a challenge! </joey>
<joey> I don't want another
challenge on the side. </joey>
<connor> - I de-stress by getting
like challenged to do stuff </connor>
<joey> outside of, like, life. </joey>
<joey> - No, you're fuckin' weird. </joey>
<garnt> - Because there's no pressure. </garnt>
<garnt> If I lose in a ranked
game, I don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<connor> I'm not gonna get my fuckin'
mortgage taken away from me. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's nothing like that. </connor>
<joey> - With a mindset like that, </joey>
<connor> I'm surprised you're not a speed runner. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Because that's the exact
same mentality I feel. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<joey> That's psychotic 'cause that's like, </joey>
<connor> "I want the same experience
again with a minute difference." </connor>
<connor> That to me like blows my mind. </connor>
<joey> - But that's exactly what
I'm hearing right now. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause when I get done with
the challenge, I'm done. </connor>
<connor> I'm on with another game. </connor>
<connor> Like, these speed runners
will spend like two months </connor>
<connor> to get a one second optimization. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like- </joey>
<joey> - Aren't you all about optimization? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and other things, </connor>
<connor> but not my like complete my fun. </connor>
<connor> Like, my fun is learning something
and getting better at it. </connor>
<connor> Like, I will optimize- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, wouldn't you say
that that is speed runners </connor>
<connor> because they're learning a game? </connor>
<connor> - I think it's almost an
obsessive amount though I think. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I get it 'cause I got
into like speed running Cuphead </garnt>
<garnt> at one point. </garnt>
<garnt> That was quite fun because I
was seeing good improvements. </garnt>
<garnt> But the moment it became not fun is </garnt>
<garnt> when I would do a 40 minute run, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just like, "I don't
really know what to do now." </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't really see much to improve. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I would look on
the line and I'll be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, I guess I can do this." </garnt>
<garnt> But then like, yeah sure, </garnt>
<garnt> the mechanical aspect
of trying to get better </garnt>
<garnt> at like a certain thing was better but- </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's a challenge. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but it was not, </garnt>
<garnt> when you play against other players, </garnt>
<garnt> there's always a constant
direct challenge facing you. </garnt>
<garnt> And every second there
is constant decisions </garnt>
<garnt> you have to make to outplay. </garnt>
<garnt> And every new game is a new experience. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of things that are the same. </garnt>
<garnt> But with a speed run, I think
the problem I have with it is </garnt>
<garnt> that it's always, like,
we follow the formula </garnt>
<garnt> and then we try and improve on
the formula little by little </garnt>
<garnt> which is not kind of fun </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause if you're doing, like, </garnt>
<garnt> people do like three hour
games that speed runs. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, they might do like a
two second optimization here </garnt>
<connor> and then redo everything the same way. </connor>
<connor> That sounds like insanity to me. </connor>
<connor> You're not changing anything. </connor>
<connor> There's no variation. </connor>
<connor> You're just changing one detail, </connor>
<connor> constantly trying to improve it. </connor>
<connor> And sure, I can understand
why that's fun to someone. </connor>
<connor> But for me I can't do that. </connor>
<connor> And I just can't get invested in that. </connor>
<connor> That's just not what I do. </connor>
<garnt> - So what do you get invested in then? </garnt>
<garnt> Self-improvement? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, self-improvement. </joey>
<connor> - What is your definition of fun? </connor>
<joey> - What is fun for you? </joey>
<joey> - It's a skill. </joey>
<joey> And then seeing how well
I can apply the skill </joey>
<joey> on the fly to things. </joey>
<joey> Like, how well I can learn it </joey>
<joey> and adapt to situations
is what's fun to me. </joey>
<connor> I like losing 'cause that
means I can get better. </connor>
<connor> - See, for me, I play video games </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just like escapism. </connor>
<connor> - That is my escapism. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, to me video games, I
do that enough in my real life. </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> That's probably why I
fuckin' watch so many isekai. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just realizing this now, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Escape to another world. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, it's just like, </joey>
<joey> I want to do something
where it's, you know, </joey>
<joey> sometimes with gacha games, you know, </joey>
<joey> there's no way you could
lose at the gacha game </joey>
<connor> unless you were fuckin' spending money. </connor>
<connor> But like, in terms of like
the grinding and the progress, </connor>
<connor> there's no way to lose against it. </connor>
<connor> - So you just don't like losing? </connor>
<connor> You don't like losing? </connor>
<connor> - Who does like losing? </connor>
<joey> - I like losing. </joey>
<joey> - You're fuckin' weird. </joey>
<garnt> - No, it's not. </garnt>
<garnt> Every fighting game player's
obsessed with losing I swear. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's why they're all psychotic. </connor>
<connor> - That's like some martial arts mantra. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I was playing Mario Kart With someone, </connor>
<connor> and they couldn't drift on Mario Kart. </connor>
<garnt> And I thought this is
a very basic mechanic. </garnt>
<garnt> This is not that hard to understand. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You should just try it
without the baby mode on." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel like the baby mode </garnt>
<joey> just all you're then doing is holding A. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the fun part about
Mario Kart is drifting I think. </joey>
<joey> And nailing drifts, and,
you know, playing the game. </joey>
<garnt> I like drifting in Mario Kart. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I'm gonna say that
for like the 90th time. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you like drifting in Mario Kart? </connor>
<connor> - I love drifting in Mario Kart. </connor>
<joey> - You say that is if it's
an unpopular opinion. </joey>
<connor> - I was playing with
someone the other day. </connor>
<connor> And I was like- </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm glad you laughed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, hot take. </connor>
<connor> I drift in Mario Kart. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Hot take, hot take. </garnt>
<garnt> So they couldn't beat me in Mario Kart. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, it's 'cause you're
not fuckin' drifting. </garnt>
<garnt> "You're never going to beat
me if you're not drifting." </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like, "Oh,
okay, I guess I'll try." </garnt>
<garnt> And they tried it once. </garnt>
<garnt> They tried it without baby mode on. </garnt>
<garnt> They kept falling off the
edge, and they're like, </garnt>
<connor> "No, I don't like Mario Kart now. </connor>
<connor> "It's not fun." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what did you expect? </connor>
<connor> That you were just gonna
be amazing right away? </connor>
<connor> No, you've got to put some effort in? </connor>
<connor> Start learning how to
drift, you dumb fuck! </connor>
<connor> Try it! </connor>
<garnt> - The fact that you've
gotten that competitive </garnt>
<connor> over fuckin' Mario Kart just
shows what your mentality is. </connor>
<connor> - It drives me insane when
people try something like that. </connor>
<connor> That is not that, </connor>
<connor> we're not talking about, I'm not like, </connor>
<connor> "Just get good at StarCraft, bro." </connor>
<connor> I'm not asking that. </connor>
<connor> I'm like press one button on Mario Kart </connor>
<connor> when you come to the corner. </connor>
<connor> That's all I'm asking. </connor>
<connor> That's what I'm trying to explain to you. </connor>
<connor> People who like throw a fit and are like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't wanna play anymore. </connor>
<connor> "It's not fun now. </connor>
<connor> "I failed this one mechanic
and I don't care to learn it." </connor>
<connor> Like, that drives me insane. </connor>
<connor> - I can imagine the dad you're gonna be. </connor>
<joey> Like, "Son! </joey>
<garnt> "You can't drift in Mario Kart. </garnt>
<connor> "You're a disappointment. </connor>
<connor> "Dead to me!" </connor>
<connor> - I do not have like, people will be like, </connor>
<connor> "Wow, Connor's that guy," </connor>
<connor> 'cause to me fighting
game combos are absurd. </connor>
<garnt> Like, the amount of combos </garnt>
<garnt> and inputs you have to
put in is just too much. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, there was just such
a steep learning curve. </garnt>
<garnt> Again, the fighting game
community will be up in arms </garnt>
<garnt> now that I've said that. </garnt>
<garnt> They'll be like, "(scoffs) Okay, Connor." </garnt>
<garnt> The drifting in Mario Kart is
such a low barrier of entry </garnt>
<joey> in terms of intense mechanics. </joey>
<joey> - For you. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<connor> Is it really? </connor>
<joey> Do you think it is? </joey>
<joey> - I know some people who just,
no matter what game it is, </joey>
<garnt> some people just don't, </garnt>
<garnt> their brains just don't operate
when it comes to like games. </garnt>
<connor> Even a simple mechanic like drifting, </connor>
<joey> they're just like, "I
don't understand that." </joey>
<connor> - I think to me it's, like, </connor>
<connor> if they had never wanted
to drift, it's fine. </connor>
<connor> But they wanted to drift
and wanted to learn. </connor>
<joey> And then it was difficult,
and they gave up immediately. </joey>
<connor> And that's what annoyed me is
that they immediately gave up. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean- </joey>
<connor> - How do you get anything done in life? </connor>
<connor> - But isn't that the equivalent
of you playing Tekken </connor>
<joey> and being like, "I want to do this combo." </joey>
<joey> And you try and you're
like, "I don't like it." </joey>
<connor> - No, I would try the combo
and I'd be fuckin' shit at it. </connor>
<joey> And I'd get my ass clowned on. </joey>
<joey> Then I realize I'm just not
getting better at this game. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the exact the same! </garnt>
<connor> That's the exact same thing! </connor>
<connor> - No, I would try multiple
sessions to get good at it. </connor>
<connor> - What's the difference? </connor>
<connor> - It's just the same thing </connor>
<garnt> with a different difficulty curve. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the difference of I have one life </garnt>
<connor> versus I have three lives. </connor>
<joey> Oh, game over, woops. </joey>
<joey> - This is why I said, I
prefaced right in the start, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, it's not like
I'm asking you to get good </joey>
<joey> at StarCraft or anything intense. </joey>
<connor> I'm not asking you to
learn intense mechanics. </connor>
<joey> It is Mario Kart drift. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but you have to understand people </joey>
<joey> for some people that is intense. </joey>
<connor> - How? </connor>
<joey> How is that intense? </joey>
<joey> - It's just how it is! </joey>
<connor> - I refuse to believe that's intense. </connor>
<connor> - Are you telling your grandma can fuckin' </connor>
<connor> figure out Mario Kart straight away? </connor>
<connor> - If you're my age, </connor>
<connor> Mario Kart drifting should
not be an intense mechanic. </connor>
<connor> I think it's like early onset dementia </connor>
<joey> if that is a problem for you, honestly. </joey>
<joey> - That's some big claims there, buddy. </joey>
<joey> - I do not expect my grandma </joey>
<garnt> to even know how to get like, </garnt>
<garnt> just click the fuckin' menu
on the Nintendo Switch. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not expecting her to do that. </garnt>
<garnt> Very extremely basic
mechanics, like, okay. </garnt>
<connor> Again, this is not my problem
that they can't do it. </connor>
<connor> It's that they gave up right away. </connor>
<connor> The first failure of the first track, </connor>
<connor> they're like, "I'm done, I quit." </connor>
<joey> - Maybe because they don't want </joey>
<joey> a fuckin' challenging
experience in a video game. </joey>
<joey> Maybe they just want to play it for fun. </joey>
<joey> - You're like the Navy Seals dad. </joey>
<joey> - No! </joey>
<joey> I despise those people. </joey>
<joey> - You're becoming one! </joey>
<joey> - I would never expect someone
to be good at any video game. </joey>
<joey> - "Are you trying to say </joey>
<joey> "that you're playing Mario Kart for fun? </joey>
<connor> "No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> "It's all about the challenge. </connor>
<joey> "It's about the challenge." </joey>
<garnt> - I would never claim to be, </garnt>
<garnt> I want to be good at fighting games </garnt>
<garnt> and then I'll try and give up. </garnt>
<garnt> If I want to actually learn something, </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna do it. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna throw a hissy fit </connor>
<connor> and give up when I'm not good at it. </connor>
<joey> - But, that's just how you operate. </joey>
<joey> So you have to realize not
everyone is an epic gamer girl. </joey>
<connor> Some people just don't see games that way, </connor>
<garnt> and you just have to accept that. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I just think it was annoying. </connor>
<joey> - No, I get it. </joey>
<joey> I get like, that's annoying to me as well, </joey>
<joey> but I'm not gonna get
like pissed off at them. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, well, that's
just how you play games. </joey>
<connor> - That just means probably it
just ain't the game for them. </connor>
<joey> - It's just not the game for them. </joey>
<joey> Maybe they just don't like
playing games like that. </joey>
<joey> - I just genuinely off the top of my head, </joey>
<connor> I can't think of an
easier mechanic to learn </connor>
<joey> than the Mario Kart drift. </joey>
<joey> Can you? </joey>
<joey> Name an easier mechanic, go right now. </joey>
<joey> - Probably accelerating in Mario Kart. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Actually no, it's automatic now, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Is it actually? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's an option. </joey>
<connor> It's on automatic by default. </connor>
<connor> So, you don't even have to do that. </connor>
<joey> - Turning in Mario Kart. </joey>
<connor> - On baby mode it's automatic! </connor>
<connor> That's what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> There's literally the game play- </connor>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> There's a reason why they
added those mechanics </joey>
<connor> because for some people
it's just too much. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I'm saying then- </connor>
<connor> - They just want their monkey
brain neuron activation- </connor>
<connor> - To you Mario Kart might be a baby game. </connor>
<joey> But for some people </joey>
<joey> it's the equivalent of playing StarCraft. </joey>
<connor> - I never said it was a baby game. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just saying what happened was is that- </garnt>
<joey> - What you're saying is- </joey>
<garnt> - They were complaining
that I was winning. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "You're never going
to win if you don't drift." </garnt>
<garnt> So my problem was is
that they're complaining </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm winning, I told
them how I was winning, </garnt>
<garnt> I explained to them,
this is how you can do it </garnt>
<garnt> and how easy of a mechanic it is to learn. </garnt>
<connor> Like, you can learn it in
one sitting very comfortably. </connor>
<connor> Like, most people would if
they actually just tried. </connor>
<connor> But they just gave up immediately. </connor>
<connor> - "Son, just start winning." </connor>
<connor> - "Just get good!" </connor>
<connor> - "Son, son!" </connor>
<connor> "Why aren't you winning, son?" </connor>
<connor> - "Why aren't you winning?" </connor>
<joey> - It would never get to that point. </joey>
<joey> My son would be disowned before- </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> I would be like, "Why haven't
you won already, son?" </joey>
<garnt> I'm kidding, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, am I being- </garnt>
<garnt> - My son was winning out the womb. </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor doesn't ask,
"Are you winning, son?" </garnt>
<connor> - Why am I the asshole? </connor>
<connor> - "You're winning right, son?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Why am I the asshole
for thinking, that's like, </connor>
<connor> just like, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> You should maybe just not give up. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you're literally complaining </connor>
<connor> about competitive Mario Kart! </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm not complaining about that! </connor>
<garnt> I'm complaining about the part </garnt>
<garnt> that they gave up immediately </garnt>
<connor> and were like, "I can't do it." </connor>
<connor> I hate when people do that. </connor>
<connor> Like, "I just can't do that." </connor>
<joey> - I hate it too, </joey>
<connor> but I'm not like fucking
lose my shit over it. </connor>
<connor> - I don't give a shit about it. </connor>
<connor> It's fuckin' Mario Kart. </connor>
<joey> - If they don't want to win
in Mario Kart that's on them. </joey>
<connor> - It's fuckin' Mario Kart. </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit if someone
gives up in Mario Kart. </connor>
<connor> - No, but they were having
like a little hissy fit. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "That's your problem, man. </connor>
<connor> "Stop giving up on shit in life. </connor>
<connor> "This is why you get nothing done." </connor>
<joey> - That's why you're not in the Navy Seals. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - That's why you never
excelled at anything, son, </garnt>
<connor> because you gave up the first time! </connor>
<connor> - If you're getting pissy over
someone losing in Mario Kart </connor>
<garnt> or someone throwing a
hissy fit in Mario Kart, </garnt>
<garnt> imagine something more
intensive in life for them. </garnt>
<connor> - No, you guys are
taking it out of context. </connor>
<connor> I'm saying they were getting pissed off. </connor>
<connor> And then it kind of pissed me off </connor>
<connor> that they were getting pissed off about it </connor>
<connor> because they didn't put any effort in. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, but like- </joey>
<connor> - Then you tried to got me
like with a gotcha moment </connor>
<connor> on fighting games and it's
completely not related at all. </connor>
<connor> - It is related! </connor>
<connor> We're talking about- </connor>
<connor> - You gave me an entirely
different situation. </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<connor> What we're saying is
that you got pissed off </connor>
<connor> with someone having a hissy thing. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't even bother getting pissed off </connor>
<connor> at someone having a hissy fit </connor>
<joey> 'cause it's fuckin' Mario Kart. </joey>
<connor> - It irked me. </connor>
<connor> - Basically them giving up on
not being able to learn drift </connor>
<connor> in Mario Kart is exactly
the same situation </connor>
<connor> as you not being able to
learn the difficulty curve </connor>
<connor> in the fighting game. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> It's completely different thing, right? </connor>
<connor> If that was my own choosing,
and I went through that, </connor>
<connor> or like someone pushed me on it, like, </connor>
<connor> "You should start learning combos." </connor>
<connor> I could totally understand
if I was pushing it on them </connor>
<connor> but they wouldn't want to do
it or wouldn't be good at it. </connor>
<garnt> Because I mean, I'm putting it on them. </garnt>
<garnt> They never wanted to do
it in the first place. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you were pushing them to drift. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I never said that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you did. </garnt>
<garnt> - They said, how was I winning? </garnt>
<garnt> I said, drifting. </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like,
"Oh, I want to do that." </garnt>
<garnt> I literally said that. </garnt>
<garnt> Stop putting words in my fuckin'
mouth, Joey, you asshole. </garnt>
<garnt> What I'm saying is like, </garnt>
<garnt> if I was pushed into doing it, </garnt>
<garnt> totally understand why
you would then give up. </garnt>
<connor> - Basically you just
hate people who give up. </connor>
<connor> - I hate people who give up right away. </connor>
<connor> I hate it, dude. </connor>
<connor> - What's the right amount
before someone gives up </connor>
<connor> when it becomes acceptable? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you can tell if
you're like good at something </connor>
<garnt> when someone just isn't
getting the hang of it, </garnt>
<garnt> and they aren't gonna get a hang of it. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, if you have been doing
something for a long time, </garnt>
<garnt> you can just tell they're struggling. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, most people,
like, not most people. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a fair amount people out there </garnt>
<garnt> who are perfectly capable
of doing something </garnt>
<garnt> who just give up immediately </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they failed the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Probably with you guys
with ranked games I imagine. </connor>
<connor> - No, I mean, I don't give up immediately. </connor>
<joey> I just get bored. </joey>
<joey> - Go and spend your money. </joey>
<connor> Go and get that serotonin. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even start 'cause
I know I'm gonna hate it. </joey>
<joey> I don't even try. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you have a hissy
fit when you lose at games. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> And I don't want to have a hissy
fit when I'm losing a game. </joey>
<connor> That's not why I play games. </connor>
<connor> - Why do you get a hissy
fit when you lose at a game? </connor>
<joey> - Because when does it ever feel- </joey>
<connor> - Someone has to lose. </connor>
<garnt> - Name me a moment where
I'm like, "Oh man, I lost." </garnt>
<joey> Like, no one says that. </joey>
<connor> - I don't give a shit
when I lose at a game. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "All right, well fair enough. </connor>
<connor> "I got outplayed, you know. </connor>
<connor> "It is what it is." </connor>
<joey> - Does that feel good to you? </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes if I know
where like I could have- </joey>
<joey> - The fuck's wrong with you? </joey>
<joey> - I think it is, like, a
healthier mindset to be of, </joey>
<garnt> "I don't mind losing so I can improve." </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not, I'm not- </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck that is the
complete fuckin' opposite </connor>
<connor> of League experience, my friend. </connor>
<garnt> The League experience
is, "Fuck me, I lost. </garnt>
<connor> "Was it my fault or was
it my teammate's fault? </connor>
<connor> "I have literally no fuckin' clue." </connor>
<connor> - No, I deadass know in League </connor>
<connor> when it was completely my fault. </connor>
<connor> I mean, there are some games you know </connor>
<connor> it is 100% not your fault. </connor>
<connor> - There are some games when
it's like the 50/50 game, </connor>
<connor> and then your teammate is
just caught out one V five </connor>
<connor> while, like, you're all
doing Baron or something, </connor>
<connor> and then you just fuckin'
lose the game thanks to that. </connor>
<connor> And that feels horrible. </connor>
<connor> That feels awful. </connor>
<connor> - That doesn't feel great. </connor>
<joey> But then, you know, you can
leave that game be like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, I could
have set that up better. </joey>
<joey> "I could have done things better </joey>
<connor> "to make that W more secured." </connor>
<joey> - I don't look at games that deep, man. </joey>
<joey> I just do it to fuckin' escape. </joey>
<connor> - Well, no, I don't look at it deep. </connor>
<connor> What happens is that I enjoy games, </connor>
<garnt> and then I look into now,
when we're talking about it, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm thinking, "Okay, why do
I enjoy the games that way?" </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I'm talking
about it now, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not sitting there at my window sill. </garnt>
<joey> Like, "Why do I enjoy suffering in League? </joey>
<joey> "I don't know." </joey>
<joey> - And that is the question
that we're posing. </joey>
<joey> Why do you enjoy suffering in League? </joey>
<connor> - That is the question to
all League players right now. </connor>
<connor> - I'm League free, man. </connor>
<connor> I haven't played the game in- </connor>
<connor> - I'm League free. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I haven't played a ranked game of League </connor>
<connor> in like two months, man. </connor>
<connor> Three months. </connor>
<joey> - I went to League anonymous, </joey>
<joey> and I just fuckin' said it, man. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Yeah, I'm League free." </connor>
<connor> Congratulations, everybody claps. </connor>
<connor> - Basically I enjoy league the most </connor>
<connor> when I don't care about winning or losing. </connor>
<connor> Like, that's literally my enjoyment </connor>
<connor> of those types of competitive games. </connor>
<connor> - I think Joey's just
a little gamer bitch. </connor>
<connor> A little crybaby boy. </connor>
<connor> And that's where we're
going to end it today. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I'm sorry I enjoy winning at games. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sorry I just enjoy the- </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna so be one of
those old people like, </connor>
<connor> "These kids these days they
don't know how to lose. </connor>
<connor> "They need to learn how to lose it all." </connor>
<connor> - "How do they expect to win at life </connor>
<garnt> "if they can't even win at a video game?" </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's what I'm sayin', man. </connor>
<connor> How can you expect to win at life, Garnt, </connor>
<connor> when you can't even take a loss
in fuckin' Smash Bros, Joey? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<connor> I'm winning so far. </connor>
<connor> - Wait until that loss comes along, Joey. </connor>
<connor> You won't be able to
suffer as a human being. </connor>
<connor> You better work. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, I apologize that I'm giving off </joey>
<joey> a very normal human fuckin' experience. </joey>
<connor> - People take enough Ls in life. </connor>
<connor> Life throws enough at fuckin' people </connor>
<joey> that some people would just
want an escape from that, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Some people just want an escape! </joey>
<garnt> - Agree to disagree. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you think comment section? </garnt>
<garnt> - Why did you have to say that? </garnt>
<connor> Now, we have to hear it. </connor>
<joey> Now this is gonna be a
shit show in the comments. </joey>
<connor> - What do you think comments section? </connor>
<connor> - Are you a Chad gamer or
a little baby boy Joey? </connor>
<connor> - Which philosophy do
you fuckin' side with? </connor>
<joey> - What I like about philosophy,
there's no correct answer. </joey>
<connor> - Except my answer. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you want to be the
Navy Seals dad like Connor </garnt>
<garnt> who just can't stand his
son losing at anything? </garnt>
<connor> - Or do you want to be a normal father? </connor>
<connor> Let us know in the comments. </connor>
<connor> - You just want to be
a normal loving father. </connor>
