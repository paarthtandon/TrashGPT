<SPEAKER_02> - Bu de bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ski di bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Recording audio? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we're not good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Something's wrong with us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go ahead Garnt, do the intro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (intro music plays) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Good evening mouth breathers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I am your host for today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (co-hosts laugh)
- Oh my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I am your host for
today nose breather Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And today are my fellow nose
breathers Connor, and Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as you can see, they
love my intro right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually did.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was like a me-you dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
- I know right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how can I make the most
Joey intro of all times? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like every convention of interest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Throw that out the window. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just make some shit up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So how are you boys been? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sweaty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sweaty.
- Moist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is still very hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've talked about summer already, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but it is still very hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Very moist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's still very. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This feels like a conversation
with my fucking dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, oh, I got to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to talk about the weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before we jump into a conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (co-host laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> All is well yeah, by the
way you're dying granddad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but how is the weather though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This feels like that warming us up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for the Trash Taste Episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I feel like when you're British, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first thing you want to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is just talk about the weather, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or just complain about the weather. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just part of British culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- It's I don't know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like everywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - because the weather is shit in the UK? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's a test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, oh, are we going to socialize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the normal capacity
of the British standards? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> When talk about British
people for the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, I'm good, I know what
I can talk about and do now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or are we getting super deep? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause if they come at me with
something like way left field, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, you're a weirdo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta think about what's
kind of coming next. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the only icebreaker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's acceptable in British culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If they're saying you're
having a nice day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm talking to a psychopath. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If they just asked me how the
weather is, I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can, I can engage in
a minimal conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh even that's a left field like intro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought we were going super like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh so the price of gold
recently is skyrocketing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you have to understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the sheer amount of skepticism
that British people have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like asking how your day
is, is like, is it good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you're asking if something's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and no it's not.
- It's like trick question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're British.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So inherently it's not good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you know asking how someone's day was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and expecting any other
response than, "oh, it's okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is, is you know reasonable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And when I say you start
off talking about the weather, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you never compliment the weather. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It could be the best they ever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your British people will
find something wrong with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, it's a bit breezy today innit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like fucking
25 degrees outside you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is very hot in
British terms by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now that I'm out there, it's
perfect temperature, but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How have you, what have you
guys been up to this past week? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Something's been on my mind, gentlemen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- I want to ask you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I was thinking
about this last night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was turning over my bed wondering, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- Just, oh geez. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do I have a weird opinion on this or not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So do you read fan mail? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honest answer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honest answer?
- Honest answer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You didn't have to say it like that Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like, those fucking fans! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, wait, wait, let me rephrase that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It depends. Okay.
(co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want to sound like an asshole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because a lot of fan mail I get is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you get really weird fan mail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we have GeeXPlus for a reason right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's to filter out the like the, uh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you talking like physical fan mail? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you talking like emails? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Both, both. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Well I read physical letters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You get physical letters? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well sometimes I do. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you get physical letters? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How do they know where to send it to? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, they just
send it to GeeXPlus I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh god.
- But like even like back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during like the convention
days and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's handwritten right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then of course I'm going to
take the time to read it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause you know, they
put some time into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Anyone can write up an email
in five seconds. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like, you know,
emails, it's different story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's more than like two
paragraphs, then I'll read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just to see what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I was thinking about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I remembered this whole thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that happened a long time ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with this YouTuber I knew. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was this whole stupid drama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, one of the
points that this guy proud, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prided himself on was the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he responded to every
single fan mail he got. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now, when you hear that as a viewer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you're probably thinking that's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what an amazing guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As a YouTuber when I hear that, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, he's a psychopath. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That guy's bad news. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's sounds so bad as a viewer I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But this is like, this is
honestly one of the biggest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah that's honest to God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is, like if you're a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that it depends
on how big he is. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you reach a point as
a YouTube where you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to reply to every comment and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be thankful to everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna read all the comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which like, obviously we're
thankful to our viewers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but you get past the point
where it becomes unmanageable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to respond to everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Which is why it's
like the thing of, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not saying that, oh,
you can't check them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can check them right?
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like people who are so proud </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the fact that they
keep up with so much of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, you know, you have to wonder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like that isn't healthy for anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keeping up with that amount of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, let's just be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, most of it's praise, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I feel like when someone
is so into hearing about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, "oh God, I love
reading all these letters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of people thanking me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like,
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're just a massive narcissist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At the end of the day
what you like reading </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is you like reading hundreds
and hundreds of letters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of people saying how amazing you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or how much they like your stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, I guess, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> self-confidence aside all right like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it gets to a point where it's like, Hmm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even when I got like
loads of physical letters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like there was only so many
I could read in the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I got like,
- Overwhelmed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I felt like I was doing a
disservice to the letters, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just reading them all in a sequence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now I'm, now I'm doing
what my human brain does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just spotting patterns. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm spotting patterns
between the letters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm, and I'm forming a baseline. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You start to get numb to it right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah you do, and I
don't like the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it kind of ruins fan mail for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you read it so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree with that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I was having this
thought and I'm like, I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was thinking about it and I'm like, huh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I've ever
seen YouTubers who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking read any of my fan mail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't read any of my fan
mail or anything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because people are scared to say it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I guarantee 90% of
the YouTubers out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't read their fan mail.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know it sounds bad.
- Exposed! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And this is one of those
topics that I'd love. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is why I like Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause we can talk about this. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we can kind of come
at it from an angle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where I can kind of explain
it in a way where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hope that I don't
come off as the asshole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it certainly
sounds like it. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it, I feel, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's definitely a topic that as a YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're kind of scared touch on right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because a lot of the people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I know this is so anecdotal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, I do see the line there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the connection there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I've met, I've met
a lot of YouTubers who, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, they've uh, few
of them are fallen off now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A few of them still do it, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you know, they, they
prided themselves on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One interacting with their fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and two, read all the fan mail
and read all the comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Interacted, how so? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well that's, okay because
that's a whole nother thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't trust YouTubers who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spend all their day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in their Discord interacting
with their community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's one of the
biggest red flags to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as a YouTuber that I don't
really wanna interact. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like, one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how'd you find the time to do this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you have to find the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically if your interacting
too much with your community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and reading fan mails and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then doing YouTube on top of that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that to me says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have no time to do
anything else in your life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I barely have enough time to
do anything else in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to cut this down a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to make it manageable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Because, when I
had my Discord in the start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, it can be a
very intoxicating feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to feel like, "oh wow,
everyone's here for me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at all these people
wanting to talk to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so popular. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never had this before, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you cut back a year or two before this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm the guy who can barely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get four people to turn
up to a fucking event. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you kind of get intoxicated on this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like almost narcissistic
tendency of the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you love the fact that
everyone wants to talk to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that everyone wants to comfort you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And again, it's, it's not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not trying to slate the
viewers or I'm trying to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's completely
different from my Discord. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, well this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a fucking clown in my Discord. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This private versus, even then. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even though your, your
Discord is private, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They still want your time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so that's a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a really difficult juggling act </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you have to separate yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a certain extent to be able to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, have a healthy
relationship with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know, I could
talk about this forever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like there's, there's
differences of audiences as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've got time don't worry.
(co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We do, we do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe we can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna stick on one topic for now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I will go into that because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a whole nother
thing between the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> between male audiences, female audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is kind of what
we touched on before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh God. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they have totally
different things, but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Going back to the whole Discord
and interacting and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah, there's, there's
two kinds of interacting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's reading fan mail and all that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where to me reading the
whole fan mail thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is a very one-sided. (giggles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you, thank you very much Ashley. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A one sided </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - For my Trash Taste coffee.
- Fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm trying to get in the
middle of something here Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 29.99 Plus shipping. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Get it now.
- Yeah at trashtastemugs.com </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'ma drink water, you
know while you promote. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go, go ahead Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Go ahead. Go ahead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] I'm sorry can I get that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Trash Taste mug? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 29.99 Plus shipping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I just sat there and I thought, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is so hard to bring up
talking about the fact that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't read fan mail and
not sound like an asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What got you onto this thought process? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did something happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I was just
thinking back and I had this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that moment of realization
you get in the movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've thought about this a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just remember this like I said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remembered this situation
with this YouTuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who I had kind of a weird interaction with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I didn't really like him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I always thought he was quite strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And one thing that he
did that was just bizarre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that he's one of those
YouTubers who made like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 500 parts of opening fan mail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And on one part, I
understand because I did this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because for a little
while I felt guilty that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were sending this stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they weren't getting to
see my reaction to their stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But also once you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> once I got three episodes into doing this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I realized, okay, well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's only so many different ways </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can react to these fan mail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Co-Hosts] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what I mean?
Like this, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some of these stories
that people would send you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are so deep and really
intense, you know, and not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not to take away from any of them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but some of them would
be really fucking deep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, very emotionally exhausting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think that it
especially feels weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like share that on video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Feels, one it feels weird
to share them on camera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also, you know, as
a YouTuber I'm thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when they wrote this story out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, what do they want from me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what did they expect when
they wrote this story? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like do they want a
response or something right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like what kind of
response that they want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And also, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it impractical for
me to write back now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> occasionally I'm saying this now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm probably gonna never do this again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because this is probably going to be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't want people
to take advantage of this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Occasionally when people did
send me like really touching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things to my email, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all very like emotional things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would reply and just be like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey man, keep your head up or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I didn't want to advertise
that I was doing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't want people to think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that if they sent me a sob story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I would reply being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey champ, pick yourself up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, here's a 10 bucks fuck off." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? But you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You didn't want to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sell yourself as the therapist right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. 'Cause you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when you start doing the fan
mail stuff more often than not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I find that it does come to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause that's just how it is. You know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people realize you respond, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people start taking advantage of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the biggest
difference between you and us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, at least me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when you were basically
building your audiences, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that your contents, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of it revolved
around fan interaction, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh like 80% of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like fan calls and fan mails
and like reading fan comments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And to me, I've like I dunno, how many, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how much fan mail you get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably get a lot less than
what you had to go through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I get a really deep
story or like a really long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> piece of email, a really
long email, that's when I do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm able to sit down and
read it because I rarely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> rarely get one of those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, "can you
review school days please?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've messaged studio
with letting them know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that you want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mikasa and Eren.
- Mikasa and Eren. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the kind of mail
I get most of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So to me it's like a nice break. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whenever I can see someone
who actually has, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> put effort into their fan
mail and that's that's to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I always end up reading it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it does still like
mean a lot to me that, hey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've done something for someone
that I've never met before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we'll probably never meet
that doesn't matter. You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean some of the shit just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got real fucked up after a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I was just reading
this shit for hours on end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it was just extremely
depressing, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because I want to help everyone out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who's going through shit like
that. But yeah, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just some of the,
some of the stuff is just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't help everybody. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of the stuff is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know where to begin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what do I even do to this? You know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like one time someone had sent
me a thing and it was this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really nice story about their dogs, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just give me the fucking thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You couldn't see off camera but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Ashley was just standing
with the coffees like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For like two minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ashley's like, ready to go.
- While I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh God, Connor's going to get on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really long story right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so I was like just give it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just give it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, there was
this, there was a story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember cause it was just so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way they wrote it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like some kind of
momentous thing, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Where it was just like, I
didn't know it was coming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so she talked about how the, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these two dogs were amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she's been doing a lot better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was genuine like a three
page letter and it was great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like all positive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "oh yeah, so I was doing
really bad in life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I got these new support dogs to help me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was amazing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I can't I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so morbid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At the end of this thing, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of this thing, that's going amazingly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "oh, and then my dogs died
after they got hit by a truck." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like, this
two thing of it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "and now it's not going
so well, but I'm trying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, what, what, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like emotionally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I was like the biggest
bungee jump. It was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like some kind
of Monte Python skit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You couldn't make this up. It was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if this was a comedy show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd have said the comedy
was impeccably timed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> This was so, and I remember it,
cause I was just like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, what happened? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That had us in the first half. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - What happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And you can't help but
laugh because you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is so fucked! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is so, and I felt so sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like what is happening? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, sometimes you just
have a moment in life where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't know how to react and you just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your first gut reaction is just to laugh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like, I had to
re-read it three times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, wait, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's just like a
nervous, like reaction right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where you're just like,
how do I react to this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just, I never had a
writing like that before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If this had been done in a book. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This would be like, award-winning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this caught me totally off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't even think it was going there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was not a single,
there was no like hint, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was no indicator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like some M Night Shyamalan shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was no, it was all great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, what happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus.
- What is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like someone had written, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was almost like she wrote
in the letter completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like three days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then waited, like two weeks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before she sent it and
then made an addendum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the end, just being like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and by the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a footnote. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah just being like PS, by the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - PS they're dead.
- PS, it's not good now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then this is also,
this is just terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to, it's horrible
to deal with that stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like, what. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What does that person
expect you to like react? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah and so, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know, not to take
anything away from her, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I do appreciate her sharing
that makes obviously you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very personal.
- Very emotional, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And in one hand, I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm also hand when I hear
about people who are reading </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tons and tons of these
letters and, and they love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, can you emotionally
handle all of this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you can, like, I have
to like, are you a psychopath? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, this is a, this is a lot, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine if you were speed
running therapy for some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get the sob story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then you got to get to help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they just, they leave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, this is horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I mean and I think it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's unfortunate that we
can't listen to everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I got into YouTube because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to like just find other people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna connect to people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I wanted to connect to people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to find people with
the same interests that I had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why, a lot of the friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of our close friends in England </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we have now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like people I met through YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or through being fans of my content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And through that, I kind of
like for, for the longest time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of prided myself of
like, you know, if you're a fan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come say hi, and maybe we can
be friends one day, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who knows? And that was, that
was when that was manageable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like some, some of my first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of my first fans are now like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of my closest friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> one of them is going to be
like one of those, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, some of them are
going to be at my wedding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Groomsmen, right.
- Yeah, yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's gone from that to now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I cannot, you know, even if I'm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if I'm sure there are a
lot of you guys watching out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there who I know I'm probably, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we could be pretty close friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're just not going to have
the opportunity for that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Most likely, most likely.
- Because like, to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there's one of you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because there's only one
of me and there's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hundreds of thousands
of you guys, and it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's an unfortunate fact
that I just had to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make peace with and just
be like, you know, this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is it's part of the job is managing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like my fan interaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just interacting
with the amount of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can physically and
humanly interact with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and get emotionally involved with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And I guess, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like that
massive difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> someone who has come to that
realization in their career </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and is able to manage it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And some people who are just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "nope, if you're a fan of me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not just a fan you're friend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can approach me at
any time," kind of thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But then they forget that the
larger they grow and the more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and more of those fans become
friends, quote unquote, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it gets to the point
where they're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just their entire life. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You end up with people
like what you were saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I mean, that could have been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Interact with their fans 24/7. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That could have been me you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are a lot of
YouTubers out there who have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Still do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Still or who I'd say of, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the cost of their
own channel, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have continued to do it because
a lot of them get really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen the so many YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who get so sucked into their Discord. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you know, this is why
I said it way, way back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, my number one piece of advice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is to not make a Discord server. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> A public Discord server. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why we haven't made
a Trash Taste Discord server. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even though people have asked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's my number
one piece of advice to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> any YouTuber, because it's,
it's a time sink, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> managing a Discord server. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily now I don't manage it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've gotten it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't go on there.
- Yeah me neither. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I post updates you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people understand it now, but you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember when I first
started stepping back from it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would get a lot of messages being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't believe you aren't active. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's so wrong, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is your Discord server. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You should be active. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, why, what would you want to do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You want me to sit here and message you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So the other 2 million
people can't have a video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you want to take
time away just so I can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can laugh at the meme you
sent me like kitten lord XD. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually had to
coach Sydney through this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because she actually, I think she had a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a public Discord and
you know, at the beginning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone wants to
interact with their fans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's great in the start. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's great, it's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone wants to interact with their fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much as they can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it got to the point
where Sydney thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that if she didn't do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then people would think
that she was ungrateful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the attention or for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for them supporting her channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, and
she grew to a point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she was waking up, just stressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> She was waking up and she was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just got so many notifications. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, mate me too, me too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah and it was like, she woke up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and for full like month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think she was just depressed
because she didn't know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to handle everyone trying to
get a piece of her attention. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, look,
you've got to, because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this was, this was back when, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this was back when
she started to, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of get a bit of, a bit
of momentum and so and I like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> luckily she had me to coach
her through it because I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally had like a perfect coach. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause I was just like, look, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've gotta just get
past this point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've just gotta realize
that it is part of the job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And part of the job is just
understanding that you can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give everyone attention.
I know you want to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it kills you to show
everyone how grateful you are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for their support and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's physically
impossible for one person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a certain size. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Like if someone meets
me in person and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if they want to speak to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll gladly speak to
you at any, we'll talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would rather that so much more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than a message through
the screen. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It literally doesn't mean anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're messaging through it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Discord, if you
don't know the person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know who you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Thanos over here, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly I think like the
best way to just have a casual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> conversation, is it, I
mean, you can't plan it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is unfortunate, but if
it's mostly conventions, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you see us at a party at
a convention or just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we look like we're just not
heading somewhere or like busy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> then we'll probably have time to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have like a quick chat or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd love to man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (group affirmation) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why I wanna go to conventions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The quick chats are
always the best I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - and sometimes you meet an
interesting character and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like, yeah, we should hang out later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know at like one of the parties </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we're going to or
something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had people where I'm like, yo come. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It'll be fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. But like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately that's just
not something you can plan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, we're going to
obviously going to find it creepy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they're going to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "okay, so this person can
be here, at this convention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's going to be
here, here, here, here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can say hello here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And hopefully," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like corkboard it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right hear me out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's gonna be here, so we have
to rendezvous right here." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like I've had a really
weird kind of like strange </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> evolution of like interactions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now that Trash Taste has started, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because obviously the
world hasn't opened up yet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've now met like a few
people post Trash Taste that has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like we've met in like
a normal social situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's just been like at a
friend's party or at like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of gathering, but they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "yeah, I watch Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the first thing they say is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "look, I know about the
para-social relationship thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, I'll just say it upfront. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I understand that there's
like a difference between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knowledge between what I know about you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what you know about
me." And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is actually really weird
because I think that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best way to handle it. Just,
just like acknowledging that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're an active viewer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they know more about
me than I do about them so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah just in meeting them
they're like, I might like you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I know you're not my friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like, I'm just like, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's close that gap then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you see the clip of
Felix talking about it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone asked out loud,
"do you know Connor?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "yeah I do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like "I watch Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's weird. I feel like I know them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know them at all." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - God that coming from Felix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My god! (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Felix was like "I feel weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like that my friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've never spoken to them." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would say that's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Felix is saying that, I
was like, that's the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the thing though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if Felix is saying that
then fucking everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is susceptible to it right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah so you can't, don't feel guilty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't feel guilty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The big boss man himself
feels it. It's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing I'm trying
to say is we don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how to handle it correctly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As much as you don't know
how to handle it correctly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're all fucking in this together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a very strange situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've all found ourselves in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, that's, that's why I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm also glad that we are quote
unquote like famous on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> internet because like, you
know, because like that's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if there's one group of people
who are fucking sociopath's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's fucking papparazzi, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause if you've seen any
interview or just any documentary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or any story following the paparazzi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're fucking nutcases. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fucking Anthony Padilla video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that still blows my mind to this day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like hearing just the
audacity of some of these guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just being like, yeah, I don't give a fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if the opportunity is there, I'll take it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because one thing I'm thankful for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that because we've grown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> up in an age where I think a
lot of our viewers are more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> aware of, you know, what
it's like and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> social boundaries and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we have places like
Trash Taste to talk about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but fucking celebrities
back in the day, they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they didn't have this,
you know, they were, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were basically put on
a pedestal and kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost looked at like a
commodity and you can do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you wanted to celebrity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can break all kinds
of social boundaries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was acceptable back in the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's why papparazzis
were able to do what the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the fuck they did right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just that like
weird stigma of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, you are famous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Therefore you are open to any criticism. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You are open to just getting
your entire private life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exposed by anyone at any time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you have no right to say because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the cost of being famous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it's complete bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember one time I saw a
clip of Toby Maguire trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like trying to just, just
go out of his driveway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just go wherever
he wanted to that day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he just got swarmed
by paparazzi right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so the paparazzi literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> were just in front of his car, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to look, like a
group of locusts, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Trying to like snap this
picture of Toby Maguire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he like moves out slowly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's just like trying
to politely say, "excuse me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you, can you guys get out of the way? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you guys get out of the way?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't go out of the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he moves an inch and he
goes, "excuse me, can you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just trying to get out of my driveway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you guys get out of my
driveway?" And they don't move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he, of course
like any human being, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he fucking gets angry and
he loses it and he goes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "dude move out of the fucking driveway! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just trying to get out!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the paparazzi's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "wow, what an asshole." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How up your own arse you need to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to have this kind of mentality right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Guaranteed the moment
he started screaming, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the paparazzi just
simultaneously started drooling, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, "that's a story right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's go!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why this clip
got posted out right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one respects the paparazzi anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it doesn't, it doesn't fucking matter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. In terms of like
the social hierarchy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe they're like below
fucking like dung beetles man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like honestly, zero respect for paparazzi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean people would rather
cockroaches in their apartment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than paparazzi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably, probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, 100% yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess, take that one
how you will, but yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, I mean, going
back earlier to the whole, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, giving attention,
I think, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I remember one thing
that people would say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they would like, they
would praise you if you would, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you would interact with
your viewers, it'd be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "wow, this is so refreshing. You know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> big YouTubers is don't
talk to their audience." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And at the time when you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you have like 50K subs
that probably gets to your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> head, what do you think? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I am, I'm doing great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm why can't these people
interact with their fans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So fun. This is great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is going amazingly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you realize all you
should realize shortly after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why that is a bad idea, because
then you have no free time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I remember specifically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then your content starts to deplete. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, I remember
I would spend like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at least two to three
hours a day on my Discord, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like answering messages, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keeping up with the
server, just doing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like two to three hours
a day on what? Like on what. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause the problem is it
slowly creeps up on you, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - At first it was like
15 minutes of your day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just get 15 minutes, 15
minutes where you feel happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, oh, people, people like me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people like people like
what I do. That's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like it slowly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like five minutes gets
added on like in a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you do content for
two years and suddenly you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wasting two hours of your days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have two hours just gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, you know, also, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone gets banned from the
server and if you're active on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the server, you definitely
get the complaint for the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reasoning. You know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one thing that I noticed when
I was on the server was that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every goddamn week someone
would come to you and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "my friend unjustly
got banned and this is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor's a dickhead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor's a piece of shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He banned my friend for no reason." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You check the log, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy who said like the
N word, like 10 times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what, what are you on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just words bro.
- What are you on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just words. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this how it feels to be YouTube? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When they take down a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, this is why I
feel sorry for YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is how they feel sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> someone uploads like a titty or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like, what do you mean bro? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor imitates angry YouTuber) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I can't believe YouTube
banned me, what an asshole." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and it's, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the Discord server starts its great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and when you have to actually
moderate a Discord server, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's where it gets hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you know that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you bring a
moderators, you know, some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I remember my
moderators sort of sometimes start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in fighting and I'm
like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just trying to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just trying to make a
server where I can thank my fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and now it's turned into a whole, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, House Of Cards-esque situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the is going on here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's just so many downsides to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just, it's such a,
it's such a complex situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and feeling if you haven't experienced it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so hard to think about
all the possibilities of stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that comes up because I didn't
think about any of this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And even when I was in the
middle of it, I didn't know what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what could go wrong, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey everyone, it's me, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just Joey, the
other boys are not here, </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> - Do you guys still read YouTube comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - First day Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, first day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of, I kind of
want to get the consensus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of the feeling from the viewers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I feel like the people
who watch on the first day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are the core audience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And those are the people I care about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hearing about the most, you
know, I want to know what my, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the people who watch
my video day one think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when the video starts doing really well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it goes outside of your audience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when you get really weird comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, like uh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The ones that turn into not English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so like my Rent-A-Boyfriend
video like blew up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I knew, I knew it was going to do well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's very good clickbait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you see that and like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I saw that and I'm just like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this is going to be a banger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if the video was me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if the video was me
just going to a Denny's and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just texting a guy and saying I rented it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure the video would have
done a million views anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because thumbnail and
the title is so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah well, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like I said, I knew it would. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So there's some of the
comments that were on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that were just like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the fuck are these? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, "Ew is he gay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is man gay?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is man gay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like and just weird stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, "I bet he smells nice"
and all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just, you just start to get like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the really strange comments coming out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I don't really give a
shit about them, but yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely day one, I check. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry, I went on a whole
explanation about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no yeah, like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> For me as well, day one is
kind of like the consensus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like, again, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the ones who are subscribed to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its the ones that's always
waiting for your video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, you know, usually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I also don't just look at
the top comments either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I always look at it from a new. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - New, newest yeah, you can't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't always look at the top comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because those are the ones, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's anything with
constructive criticism, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's going to be buried down somewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I want to, those are
the ones I want to find. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The most liked ones are usually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some kind of meme that
came out of the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or quote from the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or a quote from the
video and yeah, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We all, we all watched the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The problem is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that I actually don't
want to check the comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> half the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I don't want to
check my YouTube analytics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That's me too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally click on the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, don't,
don't show me the views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't show me the views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So to check the comments
on the YouTube app </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on the studio YouTube studio app. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The first thing that pops
up when you open this app </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is your views, how the video is doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the amount of money you're
earning and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to see that stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the elusive something out of 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've talked about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (group mumbling agreement) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't, I don't want to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> how my video is doing every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Counterintuitively I probably should care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, any expert in
analytics would tell you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you should be checking
it and studying it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been doing YouTube
for like five years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off pure gut feeling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think I'm doing all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, I think I
understand what's going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I don't, I don't
want to look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care how much
it's making. I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care how many
views it's getting. I just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to read the comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't check it that often
because I have to see that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I kind of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, it's just like, is it monetized? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Good. I don't need to see anything else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I'd say check every
two to three days now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just like once yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Cause I think I
checked on the first day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then that's just it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I just check, is this
are people enjoying this video? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I need to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I just kind of leave it at that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I remember before, when
I first started, you'd like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was a full fucking week. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I call it the honeymoon
period where you were just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were so proud of this
video and you just like kept </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> refreshing the comments and
you're just like, come on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there must be a new comment.
There must be new comment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I like that, like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that period was like a full-on
week for me before, when I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I released a video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the longer you
do YouTube, the lower, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the lower that honeymoon
period is until like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, it's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because if you're really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I'm really, really proud of a video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm still like checking
more comments than, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than like some other videos, for example. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was wondering like,
is it the same for you guys? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Or is it just like the
same for every video now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like how much do you guys
see YouTube as a job? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it just like a completely a job now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'd be lying if I
said its no longer a hobby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is no longer a hobby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's no longer a hobby at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean if it wasn't for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the job is what makes
me have to upload weekly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't upload weekly
if it was on my own back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I would do once a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I love like some videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I absolutely adore making, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, there's this one
video that has been in the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't talk about it yet,
but it's been in the works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of approvals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of, a lot of things
have had to have been done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get this video done.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I'm hoping that when it comes out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna be amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's been like a
passion project for a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And that, that's just like
saying that I would've done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah you know, regardless, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> even if it didn't make any money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if it wasn't my job, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I would've made that
like regardless like nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And so that's amazing when you get that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that only comes around I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> twice a year at most, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get like a truly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At most yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A truly passionate, really amazing idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And everything seems
to be kind of working. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, you get all
the approvals you want, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get all the, go aheads,
you get all the, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause you know, especially now it's, we, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we do a lot of filming
outside of our house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan need a lot of approval stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It takes a long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Before it was just kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how many hours can I put in on this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now it's become the case of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> can I get the right approval. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because sometimes you just
have to have a passion project </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like, I think I was me in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the Fate timeline I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause like how, when, when
did I first mention that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A year ago.
- Like over a year ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just got released
like a few weeks ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - is that a passion
project or a job? Sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that was a passion project. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm just like do really people are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do people really want to hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> someone explain Fate for 30 minutes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Answer, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like I had so much fun
filming that and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just a fun thing to work on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think everyone enjoyed it
except for the Fate community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason they
sort of got salty about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I mean like
you gotta, you gotta, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you gotta take, you gotta
take it with a grain of salt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes being an anime YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can very much piss off a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different anime fandoms
it's you know, it's to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's part of the job right
because I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like with you, you're more of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a personality with like who
sells himself on just, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a guy living in Japan
and I like anime. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas I think me and Joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have had our fair share
of experiences where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we maybe say our opinions
of an anime or maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we've gotten to a point where
we can have like an effect on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the community then sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes people can be
unhappy with what we say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unhappy is a, it's a very loose term. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm being very civil with
the words I use right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. I mean, I I'm, I'm
your guys' friend obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I understand, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you guys are coming from and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah sometimes I feel
like fucking hell man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This guy's being real harsh on you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of these comments
so much, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just made a video about Fate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Shut up bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Chill out, why you have to be so mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's why that's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be lying if I said like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't one of the big reasons
why I don't make videos on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like popular or big franchises
anymore because it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't matter if I'm
praising the shit out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't matter if I'm
saying an unpopular opinion or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever the fan base is
going to get off either way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just purely because of the
fact that I made a video on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I think, cause I
never really, I thought I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever I made videos about stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was always like the kind of ah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> BL communities and they're
always just really grateful that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone was making videos
about that at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's weird right? Cause like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I've also like slightly
stepped into that when I made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a video on Killing Stalking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was one of the most like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> praised by the community
videos I ever got, I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I though I was gonna get shat on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hand to God, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> BL fans are like the best fans ever, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They are so supportive
of anyone getting into BL </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in any capacity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll only give a shit
If you get shit wrong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just like, we're just glad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that someone's appreciating it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Because it's so niche. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And some of it is like amazing work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that just gets overlooked
because it's gay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I mean, you know, so it's amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, seeing some of
these communities, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are a lot of some
shounen communities </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that get very defensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The Fate one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, cause I remember
Garnt did this video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll talk about it cause Garnt
doesn't want to say anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but other people will be so
harsh to Garnt they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ah, Garnt made this video
about the Fate timeline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, oh something are wrong or, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh how dare he get, you
know, make this video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just terrible and
incorrect in so many ways. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like bro chill out man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think some of these
were the smaller YouTubers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they were getting
(group chattering) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like do you want
to make a video on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Go ahead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I think they have
and they were just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not as good as mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the point is that
you have to understand is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, if you're a Fate YouTuber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're a specific YouTuber
and you're going to be more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> focused on the oriented details of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're a more general
YouTuber who covers more, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more topics, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're covering a wide span of things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna be focused on entertainment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel Garnt's
video in a lot of ways </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was more entertainment based. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I watch Garnt
I'm not giving a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not watching it for Fate law. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want to watch something funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I wanted to see Fate
law I would go onto the Wiki. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I want something. I want something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just being real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want something funny. You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when I saw people, when
I saw people you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I'm just
defending my friend here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As we should. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Keep, keep going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is, this is, this is
the rare time where we, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where we've like got
each other's back I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - we got you homey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're not shitting
on each other for once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm feeling weird right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Connors defending me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's, what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw this and I wanted that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when you're gonna
hold your friend back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like no, no don't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna reply because I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bro, you're missing the
entire fucking point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not to make a video
that's correct about Fate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's make a video that's
entertaining about Fate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The point is that yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not going to be a
hundred percent correct. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it is fantastic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt's done a great job researching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The point is, is that
yeah, that might annoy you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that somebody tells it wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you've put in all this hard work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and your video is not
gonna get as many views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But by, by making a video about Fate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're giving an avenue for
more people to get into Fate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which, you know, when
someone big makes a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about something that you do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's great because you
get a kick down effect, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whether you like it or
not, you get that effect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, there's the Fate
people who made videos about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are gonna get views from that video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because guess what's gonna be
recommended on a Fate video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just very, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just another case of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just wanting to take
shots at the big guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I dunno, I've never
really had to deal with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm all right. But
I feel bad for you two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> cause for some reason you
guys are like punching bags </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for all the people, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean its, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's weird because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I obviously never intended this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think it's just because
we are seen as kind of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like pseudo critics or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I dunno, cause I don't see myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as anything of the sort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just see myself as like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one guy giving an opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I've said that so
many times with videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the moment you say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the reviewing and critic fanbase, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like, oh, he's
just trying to be a critic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just trying to be a reviewer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's trying to take out jobs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, no, I'm really not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just want to make a video on this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm passionate about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, like I think
there's, there's two things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in the anime
community because the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> community grew up from
being like a very niche, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> small community. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So sometimes like sometimes
I will make a video or I will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> title my video in a certain
way because I do it with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> assumption that the person
watching it knows nothing about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the topic I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the thing is because
anime fans were and still are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in niche communities, very, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very dedicated to whatever
niche or whatever fandom that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they are a fan of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They get, I wouldn't say very defensive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but at least like they are
very judgmental about what any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of content that gets made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially like where, I
mean, we talked about Fate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like especially shounen community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what it is
about shounen community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is, they are just so
competitive with one another. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] They are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because there's so many of them as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this day and age. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you say, you say
an opinion, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's just basically
impossible to have an opinion on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any, any singular shounen show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. I'm not, it's, it's,
it's especially difficult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially like if you just
make a tweet or something or if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you say I'm enjoying X more
than X or people, people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people will like take
those words and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck did he just say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No fucking way! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember I tweeted it
out ages ago saying like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what, after all
these different manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've read from like all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the popular stuff to like the niche stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no one thinks about at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm always going to go
back to shounen jump. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the shounen jump like
community got on my ass for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Be like I can't believe
you're discrediting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> shounen champion and
shounen Sunday and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally praised you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you want me to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What more do you want me to say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing I've noticed,
right, is that this is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason it's it's
for the most part only, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only contained in like
the shounen community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the shounen culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I let's look I'm the Isekai guy, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So let's say guys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I prefer ReZero over No Game No Life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Nobody bats an eye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nobody bats an eye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I say I prefer Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I say, I prefer a Demon
Slayer for fucks sake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I say, I prefer Demon Slayer over? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Demon Slayer, Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is such a controversial opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that his brain is literally stopping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm like, my brain
is like don't say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't say it!
- Stop, don't say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I say I prefer My Hero
Academia to Jujutsu Kaisen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone loses their mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, by the way, that was just a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was just a random quote
that I just generated that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's going to turn the internet on fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But of course, someone's
going to take that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> out of context and be like, I
can't believe Garnt said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I think cause nobody
respects my opinion. So. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's kind of whenever I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want people to respect me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want people to take
my opinion that seriously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whatever I say, no
one really bats an eye. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like oh well I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor's never really had a
good opinion so it's whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I want that at this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I get it that, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I appreciate- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably cause I've never
really criticized shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I just kind of say, I like it or I don't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never really gone in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's when you've criticized shows, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people get the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people start to probably in some aspects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> value your opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is up to them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I respect that. I
respect in a lot of ways, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at the same time, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there were some people
there's a difference between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> respecting and understanding
and opinion and taking that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into consideration and also
basing your entire life around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that person's opinions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, like even me, like I've, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've tried to talking about anime content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've tried to not be so negative
or like I've tried to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only focus on things that I do like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that I want to highlight. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's a big difference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because I didn't use to be that way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I used to like clown
on a lot of shows, but now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now I at least try to try to
just talk about things I like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but even, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if I've just make a quick
joke about something that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then that one line from a video
that had nothing to do with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that topic or that fandom,
that, that, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that one quote gets spread
around on Twitter and spread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> around everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And especially now that we stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're on Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there are people that can just
take one line out of context </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from a conversation that's
not even to do with the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm talking about and just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh Garnt thinks this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or Garnt thinks that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess it's just something
I've had to learn to deal with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as, as my content has evolved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I said the exact same things as you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could say the exact same things as you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and nobody will bat an eye, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the way you say it, it's
like, bro, shits going down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, CdawgVA said an opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one cares. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very strange yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gigguk says and opinion (loud gasp) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I sure must offended that
nobody gives a what I say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But on the other hand, I'm like, great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it means I don't have
to deal with this, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God, I wish I was you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think part of it just
comes with time as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because unfortunately the longer
you are on the platform or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the internet than the more quote unquote, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I hate calling them
haters because that just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just like people who
dislike you, the more, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more people who dislike
you will slowly build up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I remember, I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when I first started
my YouTube channel and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like the
first five years of content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most of the opinions I saw
of me were mostly positive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then there would be one comment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know had a negative opinion of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like one small community and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the longer you're on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more like the more negativity
that gets built up slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over time, just because one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your audience is getting bigger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And two, a lot of times when
you get a hater or when you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something, someone who
doesn't like your content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just going to stay that way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're just not going to give you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the chance or another opportunity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're not going to
watch your content anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that one opinion they have you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is going to remain that way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> throughout the rest of
your YouTube career. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think it's also a
thing with time as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I think a lot of big
YouTubers who've been on this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> platform for a long time have
had to deal with negativity, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> building up over time. And I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think there's no one that
epitomise is this more than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe Felix and I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never personally talked to the guy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but from what you've said about
what you've said to you at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how he deals with
it, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just seems like the most
mature way away. It's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just something you just
got to deal with. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Part of the job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you find that it's possibly
a reflection of the content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you make, you know, when you're
saying it's more than that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're new, you're more negative focused. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you find that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you tend to get a more
negative response from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you have, I mean, that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you have a controversial opinion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you will get controversial
comments as well. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like if you're always
saying like shows are trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or this is bad, do you find that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or did you find that the
viewers were more likely to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> negative about things?
Are you saying like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are they more positive now that
you've swapped to being more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> positive about shows? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Definitely. Definitely
like, like one, like I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause maybe that could
be it for the difference. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I mean, like, I, I, because I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason I changed my
content wasn't because of only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of that is because some
of the content creators that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to watch, and maybe I
watched back in the day, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of noticed that
man being, being negative, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just not very fun. And sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There are shows that I don't like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It gets more views though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It gets more views. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's the tough part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause you know, I remember
there was always like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fuck what was it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the, The Completionist
whatever. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't know if you've seen his channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He always does like these top
tens at the end of the year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> top 10 worst and top 10 best games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he would release
them like back-to-back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and always the top 10
worst would get more views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though they were like way
lesser known titles. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People just want to know
what the worst thing is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I mean Needle Drop does
the same thing every year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where its like the top 10
worst albums of the year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always did like twice the
number, of the top 10 best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And if, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like top 10 worst is
just better clickbait because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nobody really wants to
know the top 10 best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like people are less
interested in knowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the top 10 best is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They want to know what the trash is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's why I, when I try and be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I try and dunk on something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I try choose something
that's just unanimously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, exactly. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Which is why top 10 worst is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because normally if it's like
the worst of the worst, then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then people there's,
people won't bat an eye. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's there to be clowned on, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I can clown on xArm all I want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people will fucking love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's hilarious. I
mean, have you seen xArm? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I know you have Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's amazing, I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That was great. But like,
if you, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a controversial opinion
of a popular show or a popular </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing, it's going to get a lot of views. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I feel like in the long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But at what cost right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, in the long term, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it just, it just makes you seem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a cynical shit head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And did that just hates
everything. I just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not wrong.
- Even like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if you just make one
video about one popular show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but just shit on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people are going to
remember that for years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. I don't know why, but
people have such long memories. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You could, you could, you
could just make, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could spend five years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there an example that
you have in your head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> One video that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People to this day still think
I'm like the guy who hates, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sword Art Online, even
though I literally made what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two videos on it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> out of the thousands of
videos I've made in my career. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even though, even though
there are so many channels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can think of that have done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way more videos shitting
on Sword Art Online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yet I'm just known as the guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who's like, oh yeah, you
hate Sword Art Online, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'm also like all these other things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you really hate
Sword Art Online that much? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Or was it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or did you play it out for the camera? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I guess I'll say it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I played it out for the camera, for sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know you, I
know you fucking did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I thought that was
pretty fucking obvious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I made a Vegeta Review 69 video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like the parody
character I made back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. So it's like, obviously, and again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because back then when I was
a lot smaller and I was still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> building on my channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's what you
do when you're growing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what you have to do to grow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You think you have
to be this exaggerated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have to hate everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like, I remember
YouTube, YouTube, like reviews, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess went through this
phase where being negative was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the cool thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, it was like around
when I Hate Everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started popping up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah like, I Hate
Everything, Nostalgic Critic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Angry Video Game Nerd where it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Grade A Under A. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Grade A Under A. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just like being cynical
was like, was just cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, that was, that
was a cool thing to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was a dark period
in two years of YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was it 2014 to 16 I wanna say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or something like that? Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, then people, people,
I think the audience, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause I just felt like I
just got fucking bored of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm just like what, what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what what's what's cool about being angry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to be, I
don't want to be angry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me be happy, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow, what a controversial opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just want, I just want
to talk about things I like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want to, I don't want to, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it got to the point
where you just watched, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just watched content and
you could tell they were, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like playing up
the anger for the camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then they were like,
let's, let's just nitpick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just, let's just find
something that I'm just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can just like be angry
about and make jokes about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if I don't genuinely feel it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, Sword Art Online. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kidding. That's all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it was true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why I don't really
make those kinds of videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anymore either because after
a while I just realized like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's only so much you can
do and say with that kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> content after a while where
it just becomes like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> here's, here's X YouTuber getting
angry once again about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hundredth thing that he hates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, all right, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anything else you can offer
to the, to the website? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just going to stop
watching you, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like what are some of the best fan bases </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the anime fandom that you think of? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause we've talked about the worst, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trick question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trick question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They all are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I said, I like the BL one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> BL fans are chill as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, BL fans seem so welcoming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish more anime fandoms were like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think as well, like in a
lot of senses, I think the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the manga community, but like more so the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the manga community that
delves more into like the more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> niche titles I feel is a little
more welcoming. Cause like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that a lot of my content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is a lot more in that community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've realized that when
you mention a manga that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one else has heard of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but this one person knows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they're like, whoa, holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They fucking mentioned my favorite manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I want more people to read this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much like the BL community. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, I feel it's again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the niche communities. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel are definitely the most welcoming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The nicest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Although I will say,
I think the BL fandom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They just don't like
people who like Fujo Bei. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know people who like try and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> take advantage of the whole gay thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who don't actually give a shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about like supporting anything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> LGBTQ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously, if you're just, there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are a lot of people
and I swear out loud, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> TikTok as well, so many like people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who try and take advantage
of stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's about it. But I mean,
that's justified, I'd say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, no, I, I, I, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry, we went on a massive tangent then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I just fucked it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think we're talking about
passion projects before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah we were talking
about passion projects. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. To me like, yeah, go
going back to the Fate fandom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's it's really weird because
being like, being like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't like, it's so weird
saying you're a Fate fan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? Cause like you say,
you're a Fate fan and, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there are so many
different levels of Fate fans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like being a martial
artist. It's like, yo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you a first Dan black belt Fate fan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or are you, oh, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy's a fifth Dan
black belt Fate fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Holy fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but the problem is you're all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're all losing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your Fate fans right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So like you don't win it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So why it's like the biggest loser man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really weird seeing
this dichotomy, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because a lot of, a lot of Fate fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have always been very toxic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I, like I acknowledge
that it is the vocal minority, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that vocal minority is
very, very fucking vocal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there's such a dichotomy
between the normal Fate fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then just the Fate GO fans
who are just like the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> welcoming people in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, it's, it's like they, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause they want you to,
they want you to spend money, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so they feel less shame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the Fate GO fans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they already know they're degenerates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So just like we got
nothing to prove. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there's, let's
just like the, like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would say like it's,
it's less Fate fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Fate GO fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's Type Moon fans. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's, it's, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like seeing that toxicity
evolve over time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I remember back in the
day when I was just starting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be an anime fan and just
discovering Fate as a whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were being, they were being toxic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for completely different reasons than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they, than they, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess they are now because
before I remember there was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like, go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm talking about like
old boomer stuff now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember there was this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was this review on ANN
that was revealing Fate Zero. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And apparently this
guy, this guy who did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who wrote this review, got so much hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that he actually wrote like a blog post or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an article saying like, oh, what, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently I am watching Fate wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like people are giving him
because he watched Fate Zero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before reading the visual
novels or before like, or before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ain't nobody got time for that fuck off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I guess like now I'm
getting a lot of hate because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a lot of hardcore Type Moon fans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes it seem like I'm
making it harder to get people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into Fate because I'm memeing it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, I'm like, I'm memeing
up about how many series and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how all daunting it looks for a newcomer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but most of those
people are being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why is he making it seem complicated? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like fuck right off! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it is complicated! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know and I'm just like
okay, like, as a Fate fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that I don't think
it's that complicated, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you just like have some
self-awareness to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at this chart, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll look at this graph and
just see how's this going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> look for the average person,
you know, that's, that's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's, you can try to fight the good fight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a daunting franchise to get into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's just, that's
just something that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all perspective right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because again, like to the
fan, to the Fate fan base, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't look complicated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because they've literally
spent years of their life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Studying it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My definition of a complicated show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you need to watch or research
anything outside of the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the main, like twenty-five episode run. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's considered, I consider
a complicated show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you have to then go and
do additional research, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, but yeah, that's
the other thing, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally anything that requires you to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go off the website and
look at something else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to understand the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is categorized in my head
as a complicated story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I feel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because that's not self-contained </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't just watch the show and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand the Fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to look that's that's complicated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that most majority though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, most people don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a lot of shows don't
require you to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Think about every show
you do not, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to understand Seven Deadly Sins. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't need to go and
read the Wiki article page to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't even Jojo, which has, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, part, part six
is a very odd ending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you can just start seven. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You might be a little confused. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you kind of get what's happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, it's inherent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you can also enjoy the story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> without fully understanding
it though right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, if there's any
additional reading information, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's complicated flat out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't give a shit what you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is or isn't as complicated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you have to read something else, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's complicated because they
haven't been able to fit it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> into the goddamn run at the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And again the whole definition of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what a show is, you know,
how complicated a show is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel it's just completely
dependent on the person, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, I feel you're
speaking for the majority. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In that sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like you have to think
of when you're a Fate fan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> clearly you have something
that's gone wrong where you can, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you can invest this much
time into something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But a normal person will see
that and think that's absurd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I mean, it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like me as a Fate fan
commenting on what I see as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the, of the Fate community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, like how as, as like
the most hardcore Jojo fans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> how'd you feel about the Jojo fandom? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, I was going to say like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say what you will about Jojo fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obnoxious a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like I know many Jojo fans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can speak for about all of them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but who are extremely hyped from anyone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would anyone even gives us a
shot on Netflix or whatever? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't give a shit If you
read the manga, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't just get into Jojo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - For any means necessary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, It's like, I don't care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have to play the games. I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care if you have to
consume it through memes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just get into Jojo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like that is like
the numb, like Jojo fan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all they care about is get into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care how you do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just don't skip parts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're going to just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just watch it in order
man, just watch it in order. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just, just don't skip parts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Netflix has this brilliant thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they play it in order, just do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? I think that's it.
Like, I, I, I could be wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay, okay, wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Well there's also this thing where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Play the devil's advocate, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to say
to skip parts. I'm not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to do something
sacriligeous, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but like there's, there's,
there's a part of me though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes I just think a series
shouldn't get mainstream a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> series shouldn't get popular. You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there are some people who
are just like, for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jojo, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's, it's popular as hell now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. But like, part of me is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think Jojo should be
a mainstream series because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just way too weird. You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I like could, like sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you skip parts, it might
be easier to get into. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I just feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just not a series
that lends itself to being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the fucking Marvel franchise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? It's, it's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just too out there, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel like being
part of the Jojo fan and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beating a fellow Jojo fan
does like, there's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a connection there. You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you also like that
weird thing I like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, especially go- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they kiss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like especi- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you see an unsucked dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's one of my favorite images. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why it makes me laugh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the gif of the
Hulk running in the desert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's Jojo fans when
they see an unsucked cock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why, and
you know, and I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause Jojo for me has
just become full circle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when Jojo fans just want
a clown on themselves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being Jojo fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because its so, I don't know, I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are just some captions though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're going on another different tangent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There are just some captions
that just stick out in my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like some gif or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's one of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The other one is just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I love that its main stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just so fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, that's
why it is main stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Jojo, just
like, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how it was just so head
of its time, because like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was made way too early </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For meme culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - For meme culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, it's sort of like
predicted meme culture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not even predicted. It was
just made for meme culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I like now it's getting
popular because of the memes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? And I feel like you
meet a Jojo fan and you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you went through, I
know you go through part one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You are you a real one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You stuck through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You had faith, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You watched all 50 epi,
48 episodes of part three? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You believed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was bored in the middle two man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was bored too, but I sat through it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But we go through it together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We go through it together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think something that's
not often talked about Jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the fucking there's,
there is some boring parts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There is a lot of boring parts to Jojo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, its not a perfect show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've met a lot of people who have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fell at part one and
part three, like it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is a hard show to
watch at part, at times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Part three especially I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're rewarded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually thought, I actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually thought part one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was easier to get through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than some of part three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Unfortunately, you know,
I love part three to death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's brought us some
of the most iconic parts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know, as a Jojo fan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I recognize that part three is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially the anime is long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is not good at times
straight out it's I don't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some, some fights are
entertaining as much as I love the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Orangutan and then stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That, that fight was kind of boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like yeah.
- It ended really meh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think part three needed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like twice as long
as it needed to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ideas were less interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than what you saw in like
other parts I would say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure people disagree. I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just personally how I felt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like with Jojo fans are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jojo, that you only hear about
positive things about Jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because Jojo fans just want more people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get into the Jojo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The right way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Totally off topic
though, kind of on topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How'd you guys feel
about gate keeping then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gate keeping like shows? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, or just gate keeping fandoms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - In general? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - In general. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if its just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've become wiser with age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't really
give a shit anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think when I was like 18, 17, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I probably cared a bit more. I probably, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I definitely cared, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> back when I was making those
like negative shoulders. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now I'm just like, if
you want to get into a dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like just getting
into it. And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause at the end of the day
you can gatekeep all you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if people do come in and
find it and they don't end up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liking it, then it's whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's not, that's not gonna
make a difference for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's easier for
me to say now, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my wallet is dependent on
people getting into anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People get an anime. I'm like, come on in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> come watch some videos about
it. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, come over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You want to find more about
some Black Butler dude? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got, I got the right stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come on in bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you get some, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want some medication, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want some additional shots
you come to me, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now it's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause you know, odds are
that if you watch anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you might get into us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I feel like it's way easier
for us to be like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Come, come watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean, but I feel
again it's, as you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because we have matured a lot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've just realized like,
oh, it's kind of pointless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> At the end of the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But looking back when I was 16, 17, 15, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think at the time I was
probably defensive of it because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was, I was probably, this was
probably all I had, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that made me happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, when, when
you're, when you're 15, 16, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't really have
much to get happy about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And to me it was probably a thing of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want someone in
these normies getting into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's something
that I care so much about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm so knowledgeable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm, so the one that
understands this truly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well yeah, you meme about
it, but I also, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel for people who, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who tie a lot of their
self-worth to these shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I try and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I do talk about these
shows as much as I want to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to not discredit them for caring about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to kind of do them
justice, but also help, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> help understand that people
becoming into their show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not affecting them enjoying the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. Cause, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause I think the thing about
gatekeeping, gatekeeping is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I understand the
mentality of why people want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> gatekeep and why people
would do it. You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And in even some ways I
do even empathize with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just like, I think I've just
like grown past it because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like I remember
like back in the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're an anime fan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you met another anime fan
and there was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it was nuts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like just
this fucking connection. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just kiss right away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. You talk about sucking dick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like we were just skip
straight to fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Drop those pants right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like anal sex man.
Like fucking, like what. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally, especially. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, just no, just fucking no way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like that fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bite down on the pillow, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know that like
fucking Sonic and Mario GIF </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> anime fans when they made each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the early two thousands, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what he was like, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially in like the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where you don't really have many avenues </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to meet, anime fans, it was insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he was like, you
immediately became friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then like there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like so much
that you had in common </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with each other because you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just had never met another
person that was just that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just watched anime or even knew of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there was just like this
it's going to sound so cheesy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like a special
bond that you had with you'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought you had that like
just everyone outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just didn't have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like slowly as anime
got more and more and more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> popular, it just started
feeling less special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess. I didn't, you know,
that sounds really pretentious, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, it, it, it was
special to you because it felt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it felt like something that only you had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only a small group of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that you could connect with had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then as that medium grew, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you found more and more people
with that maybe you didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vibe with as much, or you
didn't connect with as much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're just like, well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this just isn't as special anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like most recently
the community that's felt this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most probably is the
fucking VTubing community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause my, my God, the
amount of gate keeping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen in the Vtube, Vtubing community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is like fucking insane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it started to blow up last year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, you're a Vtuber fan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Name every Vtuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, well remember when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like there's been like waves. Like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so I feel like first gen anime fans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people who had to somehow bootleg it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from Japan on a VHS tape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And the second gen is probably
your gen where you were able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to get some online, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was mainly through DVDs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sharing and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you were able to download some, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like I was like next gen, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is where like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my first experience was like espaniol sub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> part one out of three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That was like, that was like
the worst option for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I, I feel like, yeah, we, we, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're definitely seeing
that with VTubers now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it does make it more like
less special, but I feel that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, I forgot, what I was
going to fucking say, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had a point that I totally forgot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God, I'm fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean I was gonna say that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what the anime community
went through is basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what the gaming community went
through 30 Years ago, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, you start like
you go back in the eighties, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there were kids who were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, you play fucking video
games, you fucking weirdo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But then when you find that
one person who was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you like Sonic too, I like
Sonic as well oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's what, you know,
and then they kiss, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, and then as gaming got popular, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they saw Mario
and they were just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they were like oh my god! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in the nineties
and early two thousands, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when gaming got more and more
popular and then, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the school bully would also be like, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I played video games as
well. Did you know that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, and then, you know,
you would just, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then at that point
it would be like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe this isn't like a special
thing anymore because now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everybody is doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then at the same time,
that's like a good thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because now we've got so many more games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and so many more amazing
games that are just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> openly talked about with everybody. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, all those people
who are gate keeping, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like video games and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't really get anything out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If anything that was stopping
the advancement of something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the thing with the
thing that I understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having things feel less special.
But at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you got to realize that to
like kind of claim this kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> piece of media or kind
of fandom thing as yours, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just selfish at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But they didn't make it for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't give a shit about you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They made the show cause
they want to make money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't give a fuck about you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah exactly right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why are you having
some connection to this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I get it. You love the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, there is some
artistry behind it and whatnot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah, the end of the day, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not fucking special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the show doesn't belong to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I feel like it's almost
ignorant to believe that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have some ownership over
it because you, you care, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, like, even as
YouTubers, you know, you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you do see people who
are like I was here first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and as a YouTuber, I'm thinking,
I don't care who was first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean It's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I appreciate people
who have been watching me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the end of the day, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think you're any more important </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than someone who just came in. You know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only difference is is
that you were just at the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the YouTube algorithm at the
right time, the right place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, no one's searched
for no one typed in CDwagVA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's, you know, I, to claim
some ownership over that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you, they found you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the same way that the person who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subscribed to you yesterday
found you mostly likely right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm sure the people who
made X anime or made X movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel the same way where
it's like, I don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care how you found
us as long as you watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Feel like you were just
talking about a site then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So my, mind you were
like x anime, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, x anime is like, any, any anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like X videos? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - X Hamster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - X Hamster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't hear the word X on
a word and not just think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The whole Trash Taste set
is falling apart as we speak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do we want to take a break? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, let's take a break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's, let's take a break
while we, while we fix the set. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean,at the end of the day, Garnt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's hard to sit here and
be like gate keeping? Good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, I feel like it's
such a dated arguement and us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, hey guys, gate keeping, bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is like, shit gate keeping is ended. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yo gate keeping been real silenced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since they dropped that
episode of Trash Taste, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where's the response? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. You know, its like
what am I supposed to say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess it's a good discussion to have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I delve into
it, but I end of the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's quite hard to just be
like, yeah, gate keeping? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When has gate-keeping ever worked out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Never. Literally never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If things, if things get
popular, things just get popular. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sorry. That's just, that's
just the end all be all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's going to get, if it gets popular, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then unfortunately we have
no control over it. So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Might as well just live with it right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think a single fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> has any control over how
popular a show is going to get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially when they
didn't make it you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the only thing
that can kill a creation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is the creator, you know,
at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And even then its like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there like conspiracy
theorists, gate keepers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like people who like believe
in conspiracy theories? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do they like gate keep? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, like, they like hide? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like oh yeah? The millennium was fake? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How fake? Tell me about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? Oh, you're just a fake one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just saw it on the news, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Name every reptilian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they like, like gate keep
the intensity of the theory? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember when the anime fandom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> went through a phase with like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like a genuine discussion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about how to spot a fake anime fan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, do you remember this Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You, you must remember Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He, he remembers it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I made a video about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was like the third
or fourth video I ever made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was called, like how to spot a fake otaku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god what a throw back! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I'm just, I'm just calling it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> calling you out today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey's been real sweaty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've really like dated my content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I remember thinking like, damn! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just made some biting commentary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So wait, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How did you stop and spot a fake? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Geez. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like eight years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I feel like Joey
was that stereotypical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gate keeping anime fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah absolutely! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Im not even going to pretend
that I wasn't that guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because I was absolutely that guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But then again, I think a lot
of anitubers were back then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I feel that it was, again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was those kinds of
anitubers who got watched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like you've, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've read the room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty well as time has gone on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I feel like you've
understood what to change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you know, I became an
adult at the end of the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I realized, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all this shit about like
gate keeping and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> hating on a show that's popular </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to pose a controversial
opinion, that shits childish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a lot of energy man to
get anything about this stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm sure it would gatekeep
if I had the energy for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you know me in real life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like the least angry person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't get angry about shit very often. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I get angry
about dumb shit in life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really get angry about stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get angry about like, oh my,
my taxi is two minutes late. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get like fake, angry over it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want to get angry about stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm not actually angry
about stuff. I just wanna make. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want to like get angry
about something to go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be like, this pissed me off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not actually pissed off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you're just saying it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I just want to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno why I like doing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's just part of being British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I think you're just British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And everyone will know
that I'm not actually angry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't know why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like getting worked up
into like a funny way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know when you're actually angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you don't tell me you're angry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I actually get
angry. I'm like silent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah that's the silent anger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, he's actually angry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like I never get angry about stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I like or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I'm just like, oh, all right. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I mean, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's to me, it's
like, if I get angry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over someone's opinion
or something like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why like, I
fucking love Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm just like,
you have a shit opinion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about food or music or gaming or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We can just be fake angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why I love
discussing it because I love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discussing with anyone. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you can like,
when, when I call someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I say someone has
Trash Taste ha ha ha </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Trash Taste is fake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Trash Taste is fake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're not actually angry at each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I say someone has Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You can say it with the
knowledge that you don't actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean it. You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if someone actually
takes that seriously, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I can be like, good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I get angry, but
the emotion isn't there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But actually some of some
opinions you've said, if I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I'm actually pissed off, but like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not actually like upset. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I mean, you're
not going to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after the camera turns I give a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get a visceral
reaction where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to say something right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, the fact that you just
don't like the bidet thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> actually may be like
kind of angry that time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just like, imagine
like, you know, getting to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the angriest I've been all year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like I can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you've had this amazing opportunity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to have your ass sprayed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just pissed me off that
you didn't want to anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's totally different argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Uh, these are flashing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yes. Should we stop? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck is going on here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Being fake angry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Just be angry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember what
point we left off at. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Our cameras cut out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They rather, the SD cards were full so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We completely lost the
point that we were on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically when I'm angry, I'm not angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I'm angry, I might be angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I'm silent. I'm actually angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like going back to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cause I, like going back to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having haters that won't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give you a content another chance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you ever like
watched someone's content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said it wasn't for you,
and then for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you came back years later
and you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damn, okay, this content
is actually pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I've had a few options, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a few times where I'm been like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think it's also
because like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as you grow older, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the type of content you watch
is just going to be different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. So, you know, I've had
the opposite effect as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's very common to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to watch this YouTuber.
I grew up and then, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not so much for me anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So you kinda grow out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think like growing
into a channel as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is very much a thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, I think
that's more interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause like you grow out, you
grow out of a lot of channels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, a lot of, a lot
of content becomes dated, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, especially if
the creator doesn't evolve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But what I find more interesting
is that if you find a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> creator that you just think is
not for you and then you come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back years later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh 100%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you're just like, damn, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a, you're actually a cool guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you make cool content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, if like 10 years ago, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I was in my teens, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you would never catch
me watching like a Tom Scott </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> video or a, or a Mark Rober video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like now I feel like I love
those channels because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like super interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel now that I have
so much more of just a base </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> knowledge to be able to
appreciate content like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas, you know, again,
10 years ago I'd be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> give me the poopoo PP
jokes, where are those? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And those don't exist
on this channel. Boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm trying to think if
there is any YouTuber... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like the biggest example
for me was probably Felix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> especially when he like debuted
as like the Let's Play It </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the face of YouTube, I'm
just like, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who is this guy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who's this guy like
making like, you know, I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Screaming every video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Screaming every video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking doing, fucking
doing ear rapes, like every, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> every five seconds or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, this is
just not my kind of content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so it was so interesting
seeing his content evolve over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time and just being like, okay, he's not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's not even close to the
face of YouTube anymore, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least officially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And, and now, like, to
me, he like makes content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just started watching
him like years back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like after he had stopped
the Let's Play phase, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I can't remember how
long it took for him to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> change his content for being
like of the Let's Player guy to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just being like the I'm just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just a meme guy and I'm
just going to do what I want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because that content
appealled to me way more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was just really
interesting to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's a way cooler guy
than I ever thought he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I thought, and I thought this was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the kind of content that he made. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like during his Let's
Play era, like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was showing a, a lot
of himself, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because at the end of the day, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the best way for
Let's Players to grow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is to have that personality
that you can, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of attach to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like now that I know him personally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like that wasn't you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that was not Felix. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like you become a
successful YouTuber when you stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to be a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the real goals
to being good YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is to stop trying to be one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when you just embrace just yourself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And what you like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, like he, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he makes videos on like
philosophy from time to time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, even though I might not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> particularly have an interest in that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think there is something
that is very interesting about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> someone who just wants to talk
about something they like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And once you have that base
understanding of how to make a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> video entertaining, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can then apply that to
things that your audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably didn't know anything about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And kind of get them interested in it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or at least have them entertained
for four or five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My favorite video from him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to this day is still the one that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it came completely out of left field </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that he made a couple of years ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He just made this five minute video of him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know what you're about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just spilling his love over Blame. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Blame. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was that's oh my God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's my favorite Felix video as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it was so just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was nothing like he'd ever made before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like he made, you know, anime
content every now and then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But for him to like,
he wasn't even on camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just his voice and just
pictures of panels and him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just spilling his love over this very, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> very niche yet amazing manga series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, damn dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that's the most human
I've ever heard you being. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, like a little secret here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that video actually
inspired me to do more personal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos as well. It was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was that single video that
just came out left field. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, yo what,
what, Pewdie Pie is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where are the ear rapes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I think it was, it was that video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not only like got me
back into his content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also inspired me and
inspired me to change my own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> content to just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe I don't need to be
always be the ha ha funny guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I can make serious
content as well. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ha ha funny guy? Very ha ha. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't like, I think
the biggest curve ball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've like had recently was recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like got recommended a video of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Logan Paul's editor. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who went through his, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who basically broke down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how he edited some of
Logan Paul's newest videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was like, it was like a new, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I believe it's a new editor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That has been around for
the more recent content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he broke down what he did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during the editing phase and like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he broke down the story and narrative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how he made certain jokes work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, yo, this is he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy knows what he's doing. Holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's a really good editor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I watched some of
his more recent content and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously like separating the
man from the content he makes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just really good
content. I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like fucking blown away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I was enjoying a Logan Paul video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just genuinely thought
it was like good content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he doesn't upload that often
anymore because why would he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when he's making millions
of dollars boxing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whoever the fuck he's
going to box, but like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - God, I wanna box someone so bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just, just for the money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even give a shit about the sport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just, have you seen how
much money they're making? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but I, I agree though,
like, you know, again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there was always
a for the longest time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was always that stigma of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like, oh, Logan,
Paul video equals bad. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But again, like I feel Logan
Paul's one of those people who, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, to his credit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has kind of done a 180 on his content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And has really like showed that like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone can actually kind of mature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like make a better person
of themselves. And you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you might not be
exactly a fan of him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but you have to respect the
fact that he has changed his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> content in a lot of cases </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and for a lot of people for the better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And this is just me, like
purely as a content creator, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciating when someone
makes a good content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can tell when someone's
making good content and I can at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> least appreciate that, you know
what you do off the camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's something completely
fucking different, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah. I mean, like going
back to the boxing thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is there anyone you want to box? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry, you just mentioned that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, I need to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anyone, I should make
a tier list of YouTubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I could. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - YouTubers I could beat in a fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trash Taste boxing special. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's number one on the list, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's do it, let's do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone who can help me
get a lot of money from it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That'd be good. Dude, why
would anyone else do it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, they're all doing it for the money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll do it for the money.
The money seemed crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The money's like the money
is actually insane, but like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay. Like one thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing that I'm always
struggling with as a creator, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right. Is, is the kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the upload schedule that
you gave yourself. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately success
- LMAO upload schedule. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - LMAO. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - LMAO.
- What's that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me, it's like way
less than you guys. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you see a lot of YouTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go through this phase, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where they have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they have this very strict
upload schedule and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they get successful doing
something else on their YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then their upload, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you kind of noticed
that the upload schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for their main channel or
their original channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh so YouTubers get
successful doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of their own channel.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you ever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much personal attachment
do you have to your own channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you, would you ever
be scared if it dies? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Even though you're doing
well outside of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we have Trash
Taste now, which is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I mean, obviously I
don't like failing at anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm a competitive guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna win in every aspect of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to fail in something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If your YouTube channels dies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are you a successful YouTuber? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If your YouTube channel dies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but was once successful were you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> are you a successful YouTuber? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it depends
- Not anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's plenty of people who say- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you say you're a failed YouTuber? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's plenty of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are still succeeding
on other platforms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It depends how your channel dies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If you killed it with your
own volition and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because of something you did
then like, you know, maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, but I don't
buy the whole thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The algorithm fucked me over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck off.
- No, no, no, not like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If someone just said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're a really successful YouTuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and one day you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "you know what, I kinda
wanna do something else." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you're just like, "peace out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Then I think you can say
you're a successful YouTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you got canceled for some shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What if you had like a slow decline, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your videos weren't really improving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'd kind of stagnated, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> your channel kind of just fizzled out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Were you, are you a successful YouTuber? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think in that case
that you're a failed YouTuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone, not everyone will
peak eventually, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just a part of life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's just a part of the platform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a matter of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you think it's the right
time to end it, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause some people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or some people don't even end it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but they are you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're still living pretty comfortably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're still getting
decent enough views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- On what they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just not nearly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same level as what they
were doing in their peak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's your definition
of a successful YouTuber? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's success to you Connor? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Money, fame?
- Pyramid. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pyramid scheme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause there's so many YouTubers now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever happened to them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's one of those things where let's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very hard to tell someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to do the exact same thing they're doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for half the money.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, it's a mentally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a hard thing to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> regardless of how good the money still is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's very difficult to tell someone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, just accept, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're doing half as good
as you were last month." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Because that's something
that takes a toll on you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does.
- Because you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're capable of getting what you had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yet how do you, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause especially if it's like
more than just one person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If there's a team of you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's impossible to get the team </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone on the team to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, dude, let's just
keep doing what we're doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for half the money." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughs)
- You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its just the reality of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do the same thing for half the paycheck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause it's stuff like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a Yogscast or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when they were making like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking a billion dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something from Minecraft. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or GameGrumps.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you convince the
gang to stay together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when the money is going as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this, this sounds like
a prelude for Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if we start getting less views? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're getting 800K views an episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> See you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Trash Taste is done.
- We're done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's that Twitter page? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Where it's just like things
that have aged horribly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just to just see
this clip getting posted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like three years or something, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like in terms of that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it depends
on what you are doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if you, if you
have an insane schedule, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the likelihood is gonna be there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you're gonna be more likely to quit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If the money isn't as good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If the schedule is intense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We just turn up once a
week and just fucking talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't see any time soon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where this becomes a burden to my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Oh fuck, I've
gotta talk once a week." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Jesus Christ.
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've gotta talk to my best mates. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck?
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it worth my throat power?
- I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just trying to say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just in case people get fucking boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's always people like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> " What? They're mentioning
groups declining." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well again like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then taking that same, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hypothetical that you were saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's put that in the
case with Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Trash Taste, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, would you say-
- We gotta half the views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would you say that in like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know,
- I wouldn't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - However many years time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if we were getting half or a
quarter of the views, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanna talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't expecting a million views anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care if you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was prepared for like 100 to 50K. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We were prepared for 100K after a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- We've said this many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the end of the day, this is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it always has been a passion project. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just want to talk.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I've got a big mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna just talk with my friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I wanna have an outlet to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Whether that's narcissistic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can judge for yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno if I need to see
a psychiatrist about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But that was what it was for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was never a business venture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was always. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We never planned for this to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as successful as our main.
- Obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If not more successful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously if we can make good money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll make good money
and we'll do what we can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But obviously if it stops making money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not going to care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But because I have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have other things that I'm doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I never try and put
all my eggs in one basket. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in cases where there were channels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where people's whole
career was riding on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's hard to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I find it is hard to convince
people to stay on board when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the money is like one
third, one half, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I think in that case, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it does like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you do have to kind of
follow your passion right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you're not going to be happy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grinding out the same, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same content that you've been making. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that really shows if
you are passionate as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If it does, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if it does plummet for some reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah exactly.
- But also again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there has to be a question that has to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a question has to be answered there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "okay, if the views did half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something has gone wrong."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whether you like to admit it or not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something has gone wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's not always the algorithm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> On a freak accident you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> With the whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay I'm going back to Yogscast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it didn't even fucking know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yogscast is a show-
- What happened to Yogscast? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Yogscast is a channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that made Minecraft videos
and they didn't really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, you could blame the algorithm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were a big, big group. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You could blame the algorithm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah, there was a time when
the algorithm was changing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if one thing has been proven, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Minecraft has been everlasting on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And clearly what's needed to be done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was to change the content, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they didn't change the content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you know, time and time again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube has proven that
it is more often than not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not YouTube's fault. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes if you're an animator, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've been fucked over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But also animation channels
are still doing well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you have to change what you're doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's animation channels
that have done well because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they've adapted their kind of workflow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone wants to
demonize YouTube and they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they changed the algorithm and
it is what it is, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as YouTubers you're on borrowed time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always changing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You should have known better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you were getting into this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was always changing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You are building a
foundation on quicksand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You should have been
changing that foundation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you're building this tower.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Constantly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I get angry when
I see these YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who complained about their
YouTube video being demonetized. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> On Twitter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're throw a fuss that it's not being, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not getting the same views
and I wanna reply to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But we're mutuals and
we're supposed to be civil. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I wanna just slap them and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "listen, you know, what's going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't try and get your
fans to shout at YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They get enough shit you know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there are YouTubers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I won't name them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's a lot of them who still do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who constantly complain at YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It pisses me off because I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is not YouTubes fault. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is your fault.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the fact that you can't see that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or maybe you do see it and you don't care, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is really annoying.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yogscast was the channel that made, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I should go into that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was to talk about Yogscast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which made Minecraft videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and their channel started dying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they didn't really change it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's this over like
two or three years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they had plenty of
time to change it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And more often than not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there is a obvious factor
at play that went wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whatever that might
be, we don't do know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was that the end of the point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Aren't we gonna state the obvious point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just saying with Yogscast you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they just didn't change the content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause the way you ended, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there was an obvious
reason why it declined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You ended at. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you ended that sentence in a comma. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so obvious, it's so obvious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so obvious that I
don't need to state it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Name a channel, name a channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll tell you the reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so knowledgeable about YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ryan Higa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ryan Higa?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just doesn't upload anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> He just stopped uploading.
- Yeah that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every video that Ryan did
outside of the podcast did well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When he actually tried it did well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He just wanted to become
a Twitch streamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Congratulations Ryan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You succeeded in doing
what you wanted to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still think he's a successful YouTuber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's not pulling the numbers of his peak, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but to me that doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because everyone will reach a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they've reached their peak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I even, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I've reached the
peak that I can reach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making anime content right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To me there's just a cap of
just purely anime content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've tried for years
to break through that cap, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I just don't think the
audience is there at the moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For every 100 thousand YouTube channels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is one that'll get a breakout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That does well and blows up out of the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those channels that blow up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's maybe one in 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that understands what they need to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to change their content
and to keep evolving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To have an everlasting
presence on the platform. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, people like Michael Reeves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a few videos that blew up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he understood what he needed to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe he did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if he did, it
could have been sheer dumb luck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But he was making moves and
he was making the content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and upgrading the things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the places that needed to be upgraded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt maybe Michael Reeves
didn't feel like he'd blow up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when I watched Michael Reeves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where he did the whole fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when his whole branding, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was the laser pointer in the eye guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that was how he started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And he just blew up from there
and he kept riding the wave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and he kept doing what was right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and more often than not
the channels that do die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are ones that had massive
explosions in growth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's still what scares me actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because if you have massive growth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something is going, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you've kind of hit the nail
on the head in so many ways, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you probably don't understand why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this is just sheer luck to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the first instinct is to go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Keep doing the same thing,
- "I'll do that again." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because when you first do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you have a steady growth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think all of us have
had pretty steady growth, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> None of us have had months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where we've blown up insane amounts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You afford the cushion
to make the mistakes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of uploading repetitive content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realizing that's not the way to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You get to slowly make all these mistakes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it gives you kind of
like a very nice cushion of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can make these mistakes and
then I can learn from them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the buffer that you get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah
- Because to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest thing that
scares me when I see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like maybe an up and coming YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or maybe like a new YouTuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making content on the platform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is when they have one or
two videos that blow up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it's a pattern I
see where you have one or two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> videos that get millions
and millions of views. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the next video gets
like 20 K feels like I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that so many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mr. Beast, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mr. Beast blew up on some weird videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like counting tens or 100
thousand insane, 10,000 IQ bricks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he just kept
building on it. He never, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he never ever repeated
something for too long. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He repeated it a little
bit, which is fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can do that. I'm not
saying don't repeat ideas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He deviated.
- Yeah you evolve them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He made like a derivitation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of the content that would do well yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, so then he would, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he would do something
like watching Logan Paul </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyday bro for 10
hours or 24 hours. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So he took what was successful
about the one video. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was Jake Paul actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry, Jake, Paul. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wow. Fake YouTuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He took that. He took the
aspect that people liked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is watching something
for an absurd amount of time or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing something and then
applying it to something else and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it worked. And then he realized, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now I'm getting all this
success. How do I, then what's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's kind of the
viralocity here. What's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's enticing people.
It's just the insane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> absurd nature of what he's doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So then he decided I got to
spend a shit ton of money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like the next best step. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you can waste a ton of time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what goes hand-in-hand with wasting time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spending too much money, the
two sides of the same coin, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's the same thing. And it's genius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was just the master
of making content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was so ridiculous that
no one could emulate it. No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One, no one wanted to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one wanted to emulate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, watching Mr. Beast, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a master class in YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like watching Mr. Beast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like every time he makes
something new or makes new moves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something, it's like,
you know, you know, when, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you feel like you feel, you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you feel like that side
character in anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just like, okay, this
is the genius character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just merely the
side character in his story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I feel like
watching Mr. Beast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're the side character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that has to commentate every
move he's making, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I can't believe
he just did that move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What's that? I'll explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like when, when he just like fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opened a burger chain, I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's genius.
- You are fucking mad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that is like the most genius move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could ever see anyone doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause no one, no one's even
close, to his a genius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I don't know, like I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think part of it is just
experience because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mr. Beast went so many years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making so many different types of content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he blew up like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think like seven years
into his YouTube career. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So he's just has a lot of
experience under his belt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but there is just a natural genius </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to some of the stuff that he does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's just unmatched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> by every other content
creator right now. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And, and, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> God forbid, there are so many
channels out there right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are trying to do
something of similar taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to what Mr.Beast is doing to
varying levels of success. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we'd be lying if we
hadn't taken some kind of idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or concept from Mr.Beast
onto our own channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean he made spending
money a cool thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. That's why many of my
titles, theres money in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it just works. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think every YouTuber has
done at least one video where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they've tried to do something similar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to varying levels of success. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, I mean, you,
you often you see kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see content creators, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you see these sub content
creators come to the platform </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every so often where they just like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So ahead of the game that
they just like completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> revolutionized the content on
a platform like Casey Neistat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember when like every
vlogger tried to be Casey Neistat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he was just at when
he first started making the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vlogs that he did, which was
just like taking, taking a day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And instead of just making
like this Handycam vlog, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but just actually making it
kind of like a short film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was just like, that
was revolutionary for the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, nobody could touch
him for the longest time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you'd have to be insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do what he was doing
- Yeah, oh my god! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He only got like four hours of sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he had like a family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, this shit was insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the amount of shit
he was doing in a day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt exhausted watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he has like a factory full of cameras. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he went and then
he went home and edited it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, I, I would
rather shoot myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like honestly, his videos looked insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude just like daily
vloggers just in general, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are like insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Totally not surprised that he
got burned out and quit doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever seen the film limitless? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, like I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like if there's any
real life example of someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's discovered that
drug, it was Casey Neistat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> When he first got the flight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when he first started
blowing up Man. Cause my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's such an example of
someone who just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how are you finding this
many hours in the day, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are using a hundred
percent of your brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hundred percent of his brain yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've discovered the limitless drug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just I'm in so much respect to the dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like just Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he really set the bar high. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get exhausted thinking
about what he was doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't even do a 10th of what he does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. My God, like I've had
like these past three months, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have probably possibly been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most busiest three months of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's still like, it's
nothing compared to what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the that he went
through at his peak years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - For years as well.
- For years as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. He's also taking a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Let alone just like thinking
about doing what he's doing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? Like I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't don't have energy for that Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, okay, so like how long, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how long did it take you doing
work on YouTube before you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> realized man, it's a, it's
fucking tiring doing videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like, cause I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like every YouTuber goes
through the phase where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube making videos at
some point was just easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like, I'm getting,
I'm getting paid something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That is my hobby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's when you first make a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, I don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think I liked this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think I liked this video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think hate this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's when you start to become
like really perfectionist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about your videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like when you
starting off you again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you have the honeymoon period
of like everything you make is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like, oh, that's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's fun. Let's do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I enjoy that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, let's go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But then as you start to make
more content and as you start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to grow and you start to realize, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got to like up my quality in the content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all my quality of
the cameras or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's when you start to get
a little more self-reflective </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on your own content. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you start to think, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that video I made last
week that I was loving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Now that look at it could have
done a little better on that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe, maybe this next
video do a lot better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel that's the point
where you start to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> okay. Now this is like seriousness. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like a job now that it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of not only is my rent
and like my living on the line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for this, for the success of this video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But also like just my artistic
integrity of making content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now is kind of on the line. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Artistic integrity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not every YouTube can say
that same thing obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I don't, I
feel like I just make stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right but you know, but at
the same time you'd be lying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you said that you didn't
care about how your video looked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or how it was structured. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well of course not, I
love making a good video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I feel in a lot of ways, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like as much as you maybe don't
want to admit that is in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sense, artistic integrity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you want to make the best. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You want to make the
best shit you can make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. You want to make
sure you are proud of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or that you enjoy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just been my philosophy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why I've never like
paid too much attention to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the algorithm and stuff like that. Maybe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe seeing what kind
of content is doing well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the end of the day, I'd like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it sounds like such
generic advice or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's kind of true in
a sense where just good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good content is king at the
end of the day, there's some, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some videos that
will not perform as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the algorithm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But for the most part,
if you make good content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people are going to watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then at every so often you
get someone like Dhar Mann, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which just blows your mind
because you're just like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand.
- But that's the thing right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe my entire understanding
of this platform </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has just been warped, but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's the thing
right, at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think everyone is asking the question, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what is good content? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what the fuck does that even mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. Because like, to some
people that's Dhar Mann, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and to other people, it's a Gigguk video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we don't know what is good content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think Dhar Mann is. I
mean, you can't say it's bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's very well produced. It's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's just so absurd
and just the amount of views is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so absurd. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that's, what's just kind of crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's just insane to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the amount of views this man brings in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, I, I can, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's the
biggest thing. Cause he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he makes well-produced content
and it's, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just not correlational
to like kind of like the views </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that we're seeing on this platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - These videos are amazingly produced, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but the story is just fucking bizarre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like a child wrote
it it's really strange. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause everything else was amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Th these videos are shot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> better than like almost
any other YouTube video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've always found it fascinating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the kind of whole question of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is like a successful video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what is like a good
successful video, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because like, you know, if
you're talking about like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a good, is good content,
one that has quality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how do you explain the
fucking Chonk Chart video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that has 10 million views, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah that's like, that's got quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what you're
talking about, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like on, on a, on a
traditional sense. It's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's like, it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like report of the week. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, and the production
quality is terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it sucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's like, it's
amazing because it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's what made YouTube great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel that's like a big
question that like a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people who are starting
off YouTube ask, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you know, like
they go up to the YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's been on the platform for
a while and being like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're telling me that
in order to be successful, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to make good content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Explain that. What is good content? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, the content, good
content is anything that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, you've taken the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to consider every aspect of the content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You've, you consider audio, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you consider visuals like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you watch the report of
the week video. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The audio quality is
professional, but you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you can hear it. It sounds good enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not, it's an unpleasant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can watch it. It's good enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, he doesn't try
and egregiously click beta. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He doesn't chase trends. You know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like bad content to
me is someone who is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chasing trends for the sake of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The clickbait is just
disgustingly egregious, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're making X, thousands of dollars, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never considered upgrade
equipment, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff like that. You know, if you're, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're a full-time YouTuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're using like a USB mic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Bro they're like literally a hundred bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the audio quality
difference is insane. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Is no excuse in my mind. Other
than I don't want to learn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's too complicated.
It's not that difficult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's really not difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I normally notice that
the people who do trace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chase trends have like,
have like a set shelf life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They will get massive amounts of views </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like one or two years. At most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or, or you'll go to their channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> One video will have a million views. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One we'll have a hundred K.
And it's like, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's how you can tell, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's a channel where you're like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Probably not making the
most consistent stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or, the, your content, your, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your you're clearly just, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> appealing to a wider audience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't so much care about you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're only as worth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much as your worst performing video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Like if your, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if a video of that doesn't
get in the algorithm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't do well, but people
still show up and watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's how you can kind of tell, I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's your core fanbase. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like what, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the people who really would turn up then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's what if you
can pull in, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> X amount of views that is
like a healthy amount on your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worst performing video that says a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think if you are pulling
in a million views, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you pull in 50K, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think something's gone
horribly wrong there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're clearly you're doing
something that's not healthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or sustainable.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And sure. You can keep trending
tracing Chen chasing Chen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but not, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Chasing Chen, chasing chen? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Demon Slayer, Demons Slayer
- Chasing trends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then there's also
where you see YouTubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who start to do questionable things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because they get so
desperate for these views, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they start doing these
horrible video ideas, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like actual just like clickbait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - you know, some real
egregious stuff, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like where the
prank channels, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can look at this clear
examples where they were chasing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pranks so much that it became
to the point where, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was no longer a prank. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, yeah, they, they started, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would do stuff like pranks
in the hood where these like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> white guys would just go in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slap some black guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I've seen them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, they would just try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was, it was just like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to get shot challenge
or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck is this?
And then they would also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it got to the point where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single prank
channel was paying actors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there was like
kissing pregnant women prank. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just like, this
is just like, what is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, this is so beyond clickbait now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you have to get views, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to go into such
egregious territory, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and with the family channels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where they would just put their fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's my here's my child's
vasectomy for 10 million views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, it's like, what is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is not, this is not
something that should be YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Child's vasectomy. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know? I mean you joke, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But this is the, almost the extent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what these family channels would do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They would be like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> today my children are gonna
fight to see who's the strongest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 million last one to
survive, gets Burger King. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I joke but some these channels were doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> such egregious stuff to
their children that you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you may as well have put
that up for fucks sake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? Like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like when you chase
trends and you're the kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> person who is willing to put
morals aside to get the views </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is when you really see the
worst side of YouTube come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm not saying if you trace chends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're going to be doing some
horrible stuff on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it is, it is like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a tasteful way of doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is a, there is an
uncomfortable similarity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to the people who start
to chase trends who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sort of start to get to
the questionable area. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that, there's a kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a definitely a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a spectrum of distastefulness
as I like to call it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And you can tell when someone's on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no, cause like, for
me, like when I think what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I think about what kind
of content I want to make or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what, what, what good content is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just, I just think
back to that, like, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think back to that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like seed in Bakumon or
something where it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember like the editor of shounen jump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that series set. Like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't matter what you make
as long as it's interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that to me is like what
sticks out in my mind whenever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when, whenever anyone thinks, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the algorithm is,
whatever video you want to make, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just has to be interesting
for someone, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've seen the kind of like
toxic content in traditional </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> media, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like tabloids, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like you're ruining
someone's life to get content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know it's,
- Paparazzi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a thing as old as time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if someone wants it as someone
and someone's consuming it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone's going to make it
whether it's good or bad or not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is another question entirely, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like nobody respects TMZ, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but TMZ exists because it gets views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the same as on YouTube, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And these channels are gonna exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because people are gonna watch them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Naked Yoga exists on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Should it? I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's people are watching it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What'd you think of drama channels? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's what's cause I feel like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's, that's a can of worms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like there's such a
fine line with drama channels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from being like acceptable
to just pure cancer. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's it's, it's, it's such a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder who you're talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's such a, it's such a
like fine line to, to tread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think when it comes to drama channels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the right way to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's the wrong way to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like Scarce. Scarce is chilled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was about to say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think Scarce is a
drama channel done right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because he merely states the facts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- That's it like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's, I feel there
are too many drama channels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that think that they're
also commentary channels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I feel those are two
very different things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you can be a drama
channel that like Scarce, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who just states the facts
like this is what happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't want to hear their opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then there are people
who are like, here's the drama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Here's why you should be
on that person's side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's cancerous, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like just, just be like,
just say what happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just state the fact and let the audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make up their own mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think there's anything
wrong with that to be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's why I liked
The Right Opinion as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause at least like he, he does, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he does put his opinion in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like whenever he's breaking down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever drama or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's not the core of his video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's one of the core
of his video. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's breaking down what's happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he separates that
from his opinion is it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a clear divide and
that's kind of what I liked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he allows you to make up your
own minds, but then he also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, he, he also
puts in his own opinion, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as well as his own perspective.
I feel like that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's kind of the right
way to go about it. And, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, even, even
sometimes there's, might, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there might be drama
channels that do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they're also just toxic
personalities as well. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And again, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel it really does come
down to like the personality of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the presenter as well. Like if you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you sell yourself as this kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starting a mall, but
like toxic kind of guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who then also gives your opinion about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a certain piece of drama
that let's be real, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not fucking involved
with. You just saw it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like, oh, check, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> check out this fight
that's happening right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's let's root for one person, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's when it becomes toxic.
But if you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> here's, what's happening,
you've probably heard of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Here are the details
make up your own mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, it's like, I'm not involved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just the messenger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do it with, do it with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What you will then I think,
I think in a lot of ways, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's fine.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But again, it really
just depends on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how you present it and
how you present yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is why I can
never be a drama channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I would just like
overthink it so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I probably wouldn't
even make the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's so much drama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you keep up with it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly.
- Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's gotta be exhausting.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I, like half the,
like 99% of the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, one thing that like, we we've, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've talked about toxic anime fandoms, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think in general, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to like the other
communities and the other, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other things going on in other place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Anitube is like kind
of like chill and drama free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we've, we've had like our drama, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but compared to what we've seen elsewhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been like pretty tame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's pretty chilled man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It used to not be that chilled, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like it's really chilled now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like even when
it wasn't all that chill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like still way more
chill than other places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was way more contained. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like it wasn't like the
other communities where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people from other
communities would hear about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the thing is with
communities, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then drama is that it's, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much as people want to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless someone does
something really scandalous, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really fucked and that
transcends beyond the community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just so fucked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that even like normal people were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whoa, you know, that's,
that's a rare circumstance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But other than that, the drama
in the community is caused. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And in solely responsible, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as far as like the biggest
creators in the community, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if the biggest creators
making drama in a space, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then there's drama in that
space. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if we're anime fans
that we start doing something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's really fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We better watch ourselves then. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's true, you know if
there is, if we do something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of in the
anime community, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would be considered not
saying that we're so big to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drama, but like what, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the community is kind of almost
dictated at times by like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the biggest people in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that behavior is reflected downwards. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> If you get into shit and you
say a bunch of shit, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The community is going
to kind of mirror that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is sponsored by Honey. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> Searching for coupons. You

<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing else?
- Oh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn, what did you save money on Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I save money on pizza </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because pizza is expensive
as hell in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just how much did you save Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - About like 15, 20 bucks, which
is a lot considering again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like pizza in Japan is
so goddamn expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you just got a normally priced pizza? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got a normally priced pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thanks to Honey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When pizza is like a
luxury in this country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Thanks to Honey. So thank you, Honey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honey has found it's
over 17 million members </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over $2 billion in savings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - $2 billion! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not a real amount of money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's one second of Jeff Bezos' income. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you don't already have Honey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could be straight up

<SPEAKER_02> - Thanks. So honey, for

<SPEAKER_02> back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Circling way back earlier
on about passion projects. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Any passionate projects
you've been working on recently? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Other than the Fate one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess I don't, I kinda
don't want to talk about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like I talked about
the Fate video and people were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asking about me about
it for an entire year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like here, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you're working on a
passion project, it feels great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're just, you just
want to talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You want to get it out and then you forget </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have to make it as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's literally me with
the Oyasimi Punpun video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People have been asking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been writing that shit for years now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "when is it?
When is it coming out?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "don't fucking
rush the passion. Okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I probably recorded
was one of my favorite, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> one of my favorite videos the other day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just so fun
and it was very fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything about it was great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I filmed it, it should be out
by the time this is airing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hopefully if not, I guess it's a surprise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I filmed a video where
I worked at a gay bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was very fun. They
were just so welcoming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone was just so
chilled. It was a great time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I almost forgot I had camera's on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just having a great time reacting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and hanging out with
the boys. We would just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The lads.
- Yeah, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just, it was just so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And especially in Japan, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because people are very closed
off here and it was very much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just having a guy be like,
Hey, what's your Dick size? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, whoa.
- I'm glad you asked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's the way to break the ice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's something you don't
see in Japan especially. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had this in Japan. I
haven't had this level of uh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was he a Jojo fan?
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. Yes he was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did he see an unsucked dick? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was after I sing, I sang
(speaks foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> When I first sang that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So naturally they asked
me, what was my dick size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bet its huge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can imagine it has girth to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like an otaku gay
bar and it had kareoke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh nice. In Shinjuku?
- Yeah in Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So in the like gay district. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can just go in sing,
sing anime songs with the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the boys.
- Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds amazing. It was
such a fun bar, so welcoming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just great. And yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just had an amazing time and it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's one of the videos
where I didn't really think much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about it before I filmed
it, but I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is pretty one of the most
fun videos I've ever felt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the best feeling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just had drinks with
the boys. Yeah, literally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really weird actually
meeting anime fans here in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you talk to some of
them and it's almost like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> even less popular than
it is outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well its just so normalized here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause it's, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause sometimes you meet an anime fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you say you watch anime
as well. They get so excited. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I though I was the only one! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Oh my god, what's your favorite anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What'd you like watching?"
And, and it's, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's almost being
transported back like 10 years ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> except it's, its here in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's because you
know, in Japan, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't have a massive
social climate, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it isn't, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people aren't exactly
like social to one another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, especially otakus'. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and I think
having a solid icebreaker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you like anime,
you know, it makes any, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone comfortable who, who, if you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if it doesn't matter who you
are, if you both like anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can talk about something.
- Yeah yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like, I feel like
in Japan where again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> people aren't very socially outgoing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's it's such a good icebreaker
in a very comfortable one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I find that, especially
when you're a foreigner as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people feel a lot more
comfortable talking to you because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they feel like, oh, you
like the same things as me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> even though you have a different place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it definitely makes
them feel more comfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel it's especially as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because unlike in the West
where like the whole like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anime community and like
otaku thing is more of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> community-based thing. Even in real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Here in Japan, it's very much like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lone Wolf type of thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah people don't talk about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the true, like,
like hardcore otakus here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, for one don't
really go out and socialize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You won't meet them.
- You actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you won't, they won't be outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like being, like walking around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, I like this
thing, do you like it too? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, they're not going to be like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're going to stick it
to like two Chan. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And talk about that passion there. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously, but you know,
and I feel that's why like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in Japan, that's so
much more rare to come across </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because for one it's like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know about this whole
other side of the community </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because a lot of these otakus in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't really interact with
other people in that even within </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the same community, let alone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, across the fucking ocean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're here in Japan and you, you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you talk to a Japanese person and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if they're not an anime fan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like aware of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously of a lot of anime.
Cause we're here in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like you meet an actual
person to watch as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who watches anime. And it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm transported back to
like the early periods </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of when I got into anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I've never seen someone's face just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never seen a Japanese
person's face, light up so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you say you watch Jojo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or when you say you watch some other, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like some other anime that's
maybe not Ava or One Piece, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know? Cause those are like those, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the two mainstream anime here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that even like non anime fans
watch. And I, I guess like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just not what I
expected when I moved to Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I thought, I thought
at least like, I didn't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I only heard about, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the otaku culture from basically
from third-hand accounts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. I'd never actually
had experienced it myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I didn't know that
anime fans just are still, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> almost like underground here
in, in some, in some senses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. And that, that just
kind of like blew my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I mean, I feel
maybe within like the past, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like say 10, 20 years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like much like the West. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel it's become a little
bit more open and accepting and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, you know, you know,
like even in the West, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right kids 10, 20 years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would get bullied for watching anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now you get bullied
for not watching anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel in Japan, it's kind
of become the same thing now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> except still at the end of
the day, like the true like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hardcore or otakus are
still very much underground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think, I think
they're scared to come out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you said that they're
underground, but you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like every time you watched a documentary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> anything about Japan and otakus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you always saw the hardcore.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They'd be like, this is, this is Tanaka. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He spent $10,000 this year on love life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. But I think as well as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like just the term or
otaku in Japan is just so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more than someone who likes anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you have like train otakus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you have military otakus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just the types of fans
and like hardcore fans that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't really see outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw a hardcore America otaku, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh did you actually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - At my train station and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this guy was wearing a full,
what does it bald eagles? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What's it called? What's
the American eagle? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bald eagle.
- Bald eagle right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bald eagle shirt, a cowboy hat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a 10 gallon one. He had
the pins of America on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was wearing the bluest
denim jeans I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was wearing cowboy boots </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nice! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he was just Japanese
and like was wearing glasses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, this is just so bizarre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just at my train station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's some drip right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he was doing the, like
the fucking hands in belt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting for the train to come. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, what the fuck man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanted to be like Ko Nee
Chi Wa to him, I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is so bizarre. I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to know the background. I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want that guy to come on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I wanna know this dudes story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. It's just like,
cause like, especially like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, every now and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go to like a
train station in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially like, like the shinkansen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the bullet trains, you
sometimes see, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some train or otakus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah and they're
always taking pictures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're always taking pictures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with these like massive
like bird watching lenses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - People do that in the
UK though, as well as big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> big train spotting or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the planes and you'll
see them at the airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always find like that side
of the otaku fan base to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just so much more interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel that maybe it's because
I had known nothing about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also at the same time, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels so much more like
mysterious because you almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never see those kinds
of people interacting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even within the same community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but you also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you also see a lot more
shows made about our otakus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the traditional otakus,
I guess, for the anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause it's just like,
oh, look at this guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He spends 20 grand a month
on some P and G. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a lot easier to get it.
- It's a lot weirder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that they want to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these film cruisers want something weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really hard to just make fun of a guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who just likes trains.
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you know,
you say what you will, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but a lot of the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these documentaries that would
just would go into a dude's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> house and be like, wow, look
at him, look at the state. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's got all these anime figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're trying to make fun of it. Really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I, I, cause I feel like there's such a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such a big divide between
maybe like say anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the otaku Anime,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically like if, if you see if, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you see your series and
like Akihabara or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's probably going to be
looked down upon by a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people in Japan. Because I remember we, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we hung out with our friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a girlfriend and she was like a mad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a mad otaku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember talking to her
and she was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got bullied in school for liking anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You're Japanese? What,
how, how is this a thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I think it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so common that it's almost
cool to not like it and do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> something else. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. But I dunno like the whole, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When, when someone, all right, this is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a controversial take. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When someone is like severely
into something like a show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I was about to
describe myself there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, cause you know, you see these, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you see these things where
like they make their whole life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about something, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is me with Jojo innit?
- Yeah. It really is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw something, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I remember that I'm watching
the show one time and this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> woman had like, everything
in our life was Barbie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The
one living in LA right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The Japanese woman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's right. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, I've seen that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything she owned was
Barbie. And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is this like something that
like can happen to anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it something that like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He said, he, he ponders, while, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> his Jojo posters are in the background </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the Jojo statues. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen I love-
- And the $10000 Jojo merch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything he says is Jojo words. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the $10000 Jojo suit.- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, I love Jojo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I don't feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because when I see them talk
about their show, I don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't feel like they talk about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way I feel about Jojo.
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what, every one of those like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> obsessive collectors think as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Talk to Connor in 10 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here'a my Jojo toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This can be just taken out of context </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just clipped with me talking
about Jojo, I realize that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like when I see them,
there's almost like this, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this obsession that feels unhealthy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you could probably say that you could, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably accused me of being the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know, we're
not, we're not, I just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just liked the style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I like decorated my
office in a certain way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Outside of that none of my
rooms are Jojo, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or there's nothing else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you talking about like,
when someone's entire house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Their entire existence becomes
a collection of this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just wonder I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that something that
just happens to anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so.
- Or is it that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or is it something that maybe
something's happened to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you've had an experience or
maybe you've been raised in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> certain way and that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that makes you more receptive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to being obsessed with something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you think? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure both sides can happen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Psychiatrists,
Psychologists in the chat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can you let me know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think at the end of the
day, it's just about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how much do you like this
certain thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How much are you willing to sacrifice? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A part of me thinks there has
to be something where you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to be more susceptible
to addictive tendencies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I also think there's just
some people where for whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason in their life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's this one thing means
so much to them personally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe it came along at the right time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe it helped them through something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like they are so personally
attached to this thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not trying to bash it by
the way. I just want to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually discuss it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, I think that's the real reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like a lot of idol
fans fall into that category </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where, where, you know, they, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they want to support these
idols because they gave them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> something, you know?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I, I, I feel like
that's more likely, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there are a lot of
people who maybe have addictive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tendencies as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess because the whole
thing that sucks about talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with idol staff specifically
is that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> here in Japan, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was just some stuff that's fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you know, there was this one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean the idol industry in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's okay. Well, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so much predatory
shit that goes on in that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember if I've talked
about this on Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but was just one video on
YouTube done by some that I wish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> news agency was there. Some
not super mainstream one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they did like a documentary
with this British guy and he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just goes to idol stuff,
but not normal idol stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 13 year old idols in Japan and man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is an uncomfortable watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause it is like these dudes
go to these concerts with this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 13 year old girl. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's dancing and stuff.
And the guy goes around, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just ask these guys like,
"Hey, why do you like it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that the answers they
give are just really like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uncomfortable. If they don't say it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't say what you,
you know what I'm thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they don't really give
a good argument as to not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's actually, there's a
really good documentary I saw, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's on Netflix
called Tokyo Idols. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen that one.
- I watched that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. But that one wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I really liked that one
because I felt like it wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an insulting look into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actual like in-depth
look, but at the same time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was tryna give a, I
would say an unbiased look. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I think that was just interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it. I'd like you
watch it and you don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't really want to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't judge any of the
people there. It's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me, it was just fascinating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How, how someone ends up
in this situation where he, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, they spend
thousands and thousands of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, if you wanna give,
if you're a 40 year old man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you want to give thousands
of dollars to a 20 year old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> woman, that's fine by me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I have no qualms about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, you can do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That, that's your, that's your money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You do what you want with it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But like the one where it was
like 13, I was like, come on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come on. I mean, I
haven't seen that video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've sent you a link later.
It's just like, oh my God dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so obvious what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it's not a good look. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is one of those things
where it's like some idol guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> these guys are making so
much one of these idols </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> child idols. And it's like, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I mean like, even if
you don't mean it in that way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that everyone's thinking
like, it's, it doesn't help. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It really is not a good
look. I feel, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, especially living in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like Japan as a country, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than like any other country
that I've seen or been to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I understand the word otaku here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there are so many like
really obscure things that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people just get obsessed with.
And like it's, it's, it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no like definite pattern in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like we talked about anime otakus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's like the most, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd say the most broad
otaku there is in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause you meet, you meet
people who are obsessed with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like really strange things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's almost the most normal otaku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, it is right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so. Cause like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you look at my strange addiction, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at these lines,
Sandy eating our otakus, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the animals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why it comes to, I
try, it comes to my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I feel like somebody
who eats the stuffing in their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mattress, which is a
real thing, by the way I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I assumed I assumed TLC is a
hundred percent rock solid with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their journalism and this is an accurate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure some of the stuff on TLC staged, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably most of it. But you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people that do the weird
thing where they like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat only fries.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like that's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's gotta be some sort of
similarity to somebody who was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obsessed with a certain thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that dominates their whole life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a big difference
between an obsession </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and an addiction.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I feel, I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you are something is your identity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It is an addiction. In some senses, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like obsession,
addiction, the lines blurred. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you have an addiction to Jojo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is some intervention.
(co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it a, let's make it clear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it an addiction or an obsession? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, I am obsessed with the style of Jojo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not addicted to Jo, I don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds like denial. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Day by day. I don't think about Jojo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't do anything to do with Jojo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really, your actions says otherwise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can, I can not watch
Jojo. I don't have to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can quit anytime I like.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Listen. I don't suck every day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not looking for
the next unsucked cock. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where is it?
(co-hosts laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can , I don't think
about Jojo most days. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know this sounds like a meme! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
(Garnt guffaws) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This sounds like a meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think about it most days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just, I love the style. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love it in my room and the
suits of banging straight up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fire, you can't deny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But even if you don't like
Jojo, those suits of fire, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If the suit looked like shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't buy it, but it looks fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No it does. I'm not,
I'm not denying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not denying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now that being said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if I suddenly became just
everything about my life was Jojo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I only ever wore Jojo things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't stop talking about Jojo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And garnt I know what you're going to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was a phase in my life where I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did only talk about Jojo.
That was a short period. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I got into it, I'm not proud of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've changed for the better intervention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Garnt told me to stop. I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a changed man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If only every Jojo fan could be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But also at the same time,
I think I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I see these people who have
these very severe addictions or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something. And I think, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe something has gone
wrong. Maybe it hasn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the end of the
day, I don't really care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You, you seem happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not hurting
anyone. Do what you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's how I ultimately,
that's what it comes down to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I am just fascinated with
how one becomes addicted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that. Severely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? I'm
not trying to bash on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to make that clear.
I'm not trying to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, it's fucked up or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want to know the process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because its facinating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like because it's
not a super normal thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do because it's not
something that happens every day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What happens to make someone
super addicted to something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My strange addiction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Science explain! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, its always about
the strange addiction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not how it became my strange addiction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I wanna know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just think like, especially in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's part of the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why Japan is such a
goldmine for content, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just because kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like so many people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are so many are into so many niche things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because when you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when you make people have to
become so goddamn normal and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> assimilated in society,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyone is dying to do
anything different. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why we get so many,
these niche and crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, there's so many like
niche bars and places, which, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, some, some you've been through, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some are still out there
probably like we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Never to be found.
- Never to be found. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause their entire childhood, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their creativity is snuffed out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't get to be creative. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they become an adult and
they can make money and they can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> live that life. You know? Finally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's that epiphany moment I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah they can take control. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can be different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's part of like
the part of the interest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thing about living in Japan
is you walk down the street </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere and you just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you find this random place
and you're like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who made this? What like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Only in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - a lot of things are only in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Living here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you just become to have such
an appreciation for people here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really do. Just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't give a shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and love what they want
here because my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life is hard here. If you don't conform, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't do what
everyone else is doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're the one sticking out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so when I saw that,
that guy rocking all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was American attire. I
thought, man, the balls on this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man, thank God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thank God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He had a good pair of denim
jeans to contain those, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those giant balls, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keep rocked up to a Japanese
train station wearing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But that man did not give a
single fuck what people thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it makes you kind of happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause you were like this
man doesn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What anyone else thinks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My, my mind Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's funny. Cause every like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> since moving to Japan and living in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my standard for what's become
cool and bad-ass has just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> become so much so warped compared
to like when I was living </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what I was living elsewhere,
because I remember this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember this one time, it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like a busy street
in like Shinjuku. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were all just like standing
there waiting for the lights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to change. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then one guy I I'm walking
right behind this one guy and, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's walking towards his
massive crowds and like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lights are still red. Doesn't even flinch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Doesn't even stop just
walks and J and J walks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like what a bad-ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. The emotion, the emotion that I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is gonna be a
hundred percent accurate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you know, at the end
of Shawshank redemption, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when a Dufresne finally breaks
free. That's how it feels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Never a Japanese man. Doesn't
conform the son of a bitch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This son of a bitch crawled through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mile long pile of shit to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Goddamn! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like he saw the red
light that says not walks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he, it didn't, he
didn't even phase him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He said, this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He said, "fuck the system." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, fuck me, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a bad-ass. And I'm just like, my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my for bad-ass is so warped
living here because you see that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, and then I'm just
like, oh, it's just another guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the key to living in
Japan is to live in Japan and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> get all the good things
and not anyone off. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We're not saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To break the rules of Japan, do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do whatever the you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like as long as you're not
hurting anyone and you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> breaking any rules, do what you want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Japan is such a depressing place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you follow every single money rule, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't need to be following. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. But that's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And, and I feel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why Japan is one of
those few countries that does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> birth, some of the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the craziest looking and the
craziest acting and just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most like unique type of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you need to be like
that in order to feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're living sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it seems like it's
either one way or the other, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's such a, it's such an extreme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. Which is why like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I like Japan is
famous for having like very low </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> crime rates. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever you hear about a
crime being committed here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the most, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - it's a fucking crime! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the most fucked up,
demented I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like the other day it happened right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the Odakyu line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Those are the guy who like went on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like stabbed 10 people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause he was like, I
just wanted to I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like the women are happy. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want it to stop happy
women. I'm like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like just, just rob a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like hold up a corner
shop or something, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like someone like holding
up like a corner shop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Steal grandma's purse, you
know like something simple. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just so many people
who were like idolize Japan in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that way. And I think, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to be realistic about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I remember I socialized
with Chris and there was this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he was on Facebook reading
an article or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a post someone made
on Facebook. It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan has the least amount
of exams in the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, yeah, but
only for a specific age group. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they fuck them
to death with exams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They had already ruined their life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't get to do anything
other than examine study. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's like, oh great, great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They get to have one year where
they get to run around the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fields and have fun. And
then we fuck them today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the amount of pressure on
people to succeed in exams here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know anyone who went
to a cram school in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you kidding me? I
wouldn't even have cramps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure there is on I
don't know where it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know anyone
else who went into one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> At most people had like a private tutor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> once a week or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And even then it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "wow, you have a private tutor". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah like education
not good enough for you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like five days of school.
Not enough for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I say that as I went to Saturday school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of harsh
realities about Japan that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overlooked because we
want it to be this rosy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and beautiful place that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which it is.
- Which it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - In a lot of aspects it is yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like we're looking
where we're lucky enough to not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have to be part of the Japanese system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We avoid the probably
some of the worst aspects </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of working in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think we work in Japan in
the most comfortable way ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we're working right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can just sit on my ivory tower, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> looking down all these
peasants and telling them, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should stop doing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You should try working from home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you heard of that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Its the new hip thing with
the young people right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wasn't there a thing where
they wanted to get people to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> come back into work and
like a little bit of work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, please, God, no,
we want to keep teleworking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've discovered the
beauty that is teleworking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like if anyone was
going to love teleworking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it going to Japan. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like kind of like mind blowing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's taken this long for
them to adopt it honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you been on a Japanese Zoom call? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. If you've been on one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, whoa, where's the fun guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on, talk a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like no one said anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got on the call we were
there for like five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No one said anything because
they were waiting for one more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> person. We're all just standing
there with our cameras on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, ah, so the summer, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Am I in the right place? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, please, please I'm not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like please someone
talk about the weather. Just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just, just, just talk
about the weather please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's been basic as fuck but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just waiting
for my turn to go on a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game show or something like
everyone was just nervous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like no one said anything. And
then even then it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone would like, some
of them would say something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been on zoom calls with
like Americans in so much more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chill obviously. Cause
I'm picking out whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember there was one
call I had and there was five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of us and one person would say
something and they would just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wait like 30 seconds, like process it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they would be like, and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd be like, guys, this
is, this, isn't a courtroom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a fucking zoom call. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw, you know, they would in America, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would publish some of the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the Zoom court proceedings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I said, that was, that was more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> more jovial fun going on in
those then on these zoom calls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was having, I
would just stand there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean like jovial? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like more fun having more fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The judge is like guilty JK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - and just a few, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> few jokes cracked here
and there a few, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even the judge would be
like, how's the day going? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hi. Good, good, good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyway, this is far proceeding number. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anyway life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just thought I used the
weirdest thing that they was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like this weird understanding
that no one was allowed to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talk until everybody got on the zoom call, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but no early </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because its all about procedure here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If its not according to procedure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's just chaos and panic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, this is the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the most like
unfun Zoom call of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Not Zoom calls are fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not that expect them to be fun, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I didn't expect it to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm waiting for my hostage
person to tell my family about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how much they're going to ask for ransom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm waiting for the
godfather to enter the room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah It felt like something like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was some kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> spiritual ritual about to take place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a seance. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. Anyway, I think that's
a good place to wrap it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a good episode.
- what a good episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like how we talked
about toxic clickbaits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But as the title you probably
read was complete clickbait. </SPEAKER_03>
