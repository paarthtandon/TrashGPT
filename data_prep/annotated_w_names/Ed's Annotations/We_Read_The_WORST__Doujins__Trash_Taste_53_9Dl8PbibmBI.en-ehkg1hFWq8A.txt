<connor> - Welcome to the doujin
episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<garnt> - So what you're about to witness </garnt>
<garnt> is probably going to be an edited version, </garnt>
<garnt> or at least there's no doujins </garnt>
<garnt> that we can possibly show on screen </garnt>
<garnt> since a lot of the material
we are going to be covering </garnt>
<garnt> is going to be very explicit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, we're gonna be talking about it, </joey>
<joey> but you won't be able to see any of it. </joey>
<joey> So if you'd like to check it
out and also support the show, </joey>
<joey> then make sure to go over to our Patreon, </joey>
<joey> patreon.com/trashtaste </joey>
<connor> - Where you'll get to see
all the panels on screen </connor>
<connor> when we talk about them.
- [Joey] Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, if you wanna jack
off while watching Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> now you can.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But if not, then grab
yourself a drink and- </connor>
<garnt> - Or if you're just
doing it anyway, welcome. </garnt>
<garnt> - Welcome. You can just
jack off to us I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> but please don't. Please don't. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's get on with it. </joey>
<connor> (chill wave music begins) </connor>
<connor> - While you open the wine, Garnt, </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay.
- I will explain </garnt>
<connor> what we're doing today. </connor>
<garnt> - This is going to be a wine episode </garnt>
<connor> because we're going to need the
alcohol to get through this. </connor>
<connor> - I'm drinking pangkor juice.
- We've been drinking a while </connor>
<garnt> on Trash Taste 'cause I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> we've been filming earlier, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, essentially
I don't read doujins, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I've expressed before-
- No, no, you don't read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't read, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't read, full stop.
- At all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And preferably, I do not
like my porn to be reading. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> We can get into that. </connor>
<connor> So instead we decided the boys </connor>
<connor> have both recommended me
three doujins each to read, </connor>
<garnt> and a little bonus one.
- And then we are going </garnt>
<garnt> to end on a very special one </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm sure people are
going to be excited for- </garnt>
<joey> - So in total we're
gonna talk about seven? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we're gonna be
talking about seven doujins, </garnt>
<connor> or the doujinshis.
- Six doujins </connor>
<garnt> and a mess, "Metamorphosis."
(all laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> Which we'll get into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, and there's a
little special thing going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I don't know whose is which. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> So I've been recommended six- </joey>
<joey> - Do you have like no clue at all or? </joey>
<connor> - Like I think, some of them I know, </connor>
<connor> some of them I know. </connor>
<connor> - I thought some were pretty obvious. </connor>
<garnt> - Some are pretty obvious.
- Some was very, very obvious. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> Damn you needed two shots
of vodka there, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing)
Damn, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Some are very obvious. Some I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And throughout this, I
will be guessing as well </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> whose doujin was which recommendation. </connor>
<joey> - Well mostly, though, </joey>
<joey> mostly though, this show is
going to be just watching </joey>
<joey> me and Garnt just enjoying
Connor's reactions </joey>
<joey> to our recommendations. </joey>
<garnt> - And I assume you both read
each other's recommendations. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yes. </connor>
<garnt> - It's funny because we recommended </garnt>
<garnt> three doujinshis each, and
I remember giving the list </garnt>
<garnt> to Joey and Joey gave his list </garnt>
<garnt> and we were like, damn, we
both recommended doujins </garnt>
<garnt> that were like 200 pages long, at least. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were just like, "Connor, it's cool, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't need to read it all, </garnt>
<garnt> just read like three
chapters or something." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, until you get the
general gist of it, right? </joey>
<joey> But then Connor was like, "Bet." </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "First of all,
where do I even read doujins?" </connor>
<joey> I don't even know where you go. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I'm totally confused." </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there's lots of sites out there. </joey>
<joey> - And then I look for the sites, you know, </joey>
<joey> and it just gets to the
point where I'm just fighting </joey>
<joey> for my fucking life to get
the shit on full screen. </joey>
<connor> There's fucking pop-ups
every two fucking seconds. </connor>
<connor> I'm just trying to do my
homework and I gotta worry </connor>
<connor> about fucking hot single
ladies in my area. </connor>
<garnt> You know, like.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It's terrible. </connor>
<connor> - You'll get used to it, man, don't worry. </connor>
<garnt> - So, how long did it take
you to read everything? </garnt>
<connor> - I was under the impression
that doujins were like 30, </connor>
<joey> 40 pages. </joey>
<joey> - No, a lot of them are. That's the thing. </joey>
<joey> - I mean yeah- </joey>
<joey> - How did you guys manage
to find all of them </joey>
<joey> that were like 200 fucking pages? </joey>
<joey> - Because those are the best ones. </joey>
<joey> - Those are the best ones, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah, I remember you saying, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, you know, just stop at one chapter." </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> There was never any
breaks in these things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I couldn't just-
- What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They all had chapters. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Not that I saw when I was reading. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I don't know where </connor>
<connor> I was reading them. </connor>
<garnt> - When it says, at the end of the chapter, </garnt>
<connor> it says like "Ending" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah
- Or like, "To be continued." </connor>
<garnt> Or something like that.
- But I also feel like that, </garnt>
<joey> you know- </joey>
<joey> - Some of them literally have a whole page </joey>
<joey> that says "Chapter two." </joey>
<connor> - I did not see that,
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> but I read them all. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm gonna tell the
names of these doujins </joey>
<connor> which again, still mean nothing to me. </connor>
<connor> "Dorei Usagi To Anthony" </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<garnt> - White man butchers Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - "To Anthony."
- "To Anthony." </garnt>
<garnt> - What is it, Anthony? </garnt>
<connor> (both laughing)
Is that what it is? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> What is it, huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, go on, go
on, go on, what else? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Inma no Mikata!" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - "Succubi's Supporter." </connor>
<garnt> - So you're saying the Japanese name </garnt>
<joey> and then the translated name. </joey>
<joey> - Oh is that what this is, I thought- </joey>
<joey> - Some of them have English translations </joey>
<joey> of the Japanese name. </joey>
<connor> - "Juunengo No Jinsei Soudan." </connor>
<joey> (Joey speaks indistinctly) </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> "Life consultation after 10 years." </joey>
<joey> "Pisu Hame!" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Very interesting title. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> "Seikatsu Shuukan."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kyoushi To Seito To-
Teacher and Student." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I understand that one.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Yeah, so, I mean, I just went in order </garnt>
<garnt> of which one you gave me. </garnt>
<garnt> So I read them. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Okay.
- [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I read "Dorei Usagi To Anthony." </garnt>
<connor> When should I guess whose I think it is? </connor>
<connor> - Guess it right at the beginning. </connor>
<joey> - Why don't you guess it
right at the beginning? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think-
- It's a 50/50. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, I wrote down each one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think this was Joey's. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - You are correct.
- You are correct. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And I think because
there was like a loli </joey>
<connor> for like 10 seconds.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I saw the cover, and I'm just like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> "Connor's gonna immediately guess this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause the cover
looked like, fucking Shinobu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cover looked like this bitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I was like "This is Joey's!" </connor>
<connor> - This was the cover of the main girl. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like, she
emanates such Shinobu energy </garnt>
<garnt> that Connor's gonna
immediately guess this. </garnt>
<garnt> - The first thing I wrote was, </garnt>
<connor> "just from the cover, I think it's Joey." </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - This is literally going to be, </joey>
<joey> "If it's not a milf, it's
a loli," the episode. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - There were some, yeah. There was some. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Okay to be fair, this
one, I don't blame you. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> This one, I don't blame you. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - She wasn't a loli, she
just looked like Shinobu. </joey>
<connor> - Before we jump right into
it, what were your thoughts? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, what were your thoughts </connor>
<connor> going into just reading hentai? </connor>
<joey> Because this is like our unofficial sequel </joey>
<joey> to the hentai episode, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Go check that out if you haven't yet. </joey>
<joey> - It is exhausting reading porn. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Well, I'm sure
it is when you read. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, if you asked me to like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, if you're horny, you
wanna jack off to something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can do it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A 10 minute video or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you made me sit
through like a two hour JV </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I'm not horny, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I couldn't imagine like a
worse experience in my life. </connor>
<garnt> - Because how long were you collectively </garnt>
<joey> reading these doujins for? </joey>
<joey> - Like three to four hours. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing)
- Well that's because- </joey>
<garnt> - Back to back. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well it's because we
thought, right, we were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I saw the list and I was like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> all of these are like,
full on like, books. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I read them all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I was like, oh,
okay, so like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> a couple of chapters each,
max take like an hour. </joey>
<garnt> - He just needs to get an idea of each. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well there's only one of
them I didn't read fully. </connor>
<garnt> It was 'cause there was like, 2,800 pages. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was like, 500 pages, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was ridiculous, so I
gave up on the first one, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> but I mean, yeah, it was
just, it was exhausting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is really like, I've sat
through really bad movies </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> that I felt were less painful. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like it is just difficult. </connor>
<connor> I mean, reading doujins, I can see it. </connor>
<connor> You know, sometimes you see
something like, oh, that's hot. </connor>
<connor> And then I'm like, even if
I wanted to jack off here, </connor>
<connor> what am I supposed to do? </connor>
<connor> Do I just sit there and think
about what I'm looking at? </connor>
<garnt> Like that feels like I'm like de-evolving. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, at what point do I just do like </garnt>
<garnt> morse code masturbating? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, where I'm like,
"Oh dude, that's so hot. </garnt>
<garnt> "She's telling she's going
to fuck me in morse." </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't know, to
me, I like the movement. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not seeing enough movement, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not seeing enough movement. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - My eyes are not stimulated enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, I was reading this </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> and I just like, every time I
thought this was really hot, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "what would I do?" </connor>
<connor> - What would I do!
- What would I do! </connor>
<joey> - It's not continuing,
I have to continue it. </joey>
<joey> - My cock in my hand, I
don't know what to do. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like, "What do I do, dick in hand." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Stuck in the scene.
- What do I do? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What do I do? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not moving, it needs to move. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> When does it start moving?
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - This is the exact reaction I wanted. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even if I thought it was hot, I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some of them, you know, I will admit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of them I thought
were quite attractive. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I thought they were very well done. </connor>
<connor> And if they were in anime form, I'd nut. </connor>
<garnt> - It's weird because like,
some of these have had anime </garnt>
<garnt> adaptations, right?
- [Connor] I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, to me, like doujin, </garnt>
<garnt> the doujin version is always hotter </garnt>
<connor> than the anime version.
- I agree. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know what it is about hentai- </garnt>
<garnt> - Well I mean the drawings
are very more intense. </garnt>
<garnt> That's something I learned very quickly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I get like a way more intense feeling </garnt>
<garnt> from reading the doujins. </garnt>
<joey> No, no because than watching
the anime adaptation, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, no I agree. </joey>
<joey> - To me, it's a different
kind of art form, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause to me, like
reading doujins is like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> to me it's a really good
way to warm up, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Right, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because to me, like,
who really likes sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through a 20 minute hentai, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> That's-
(both laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I don't mind. I haven't
got time, you know? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, most of the time
I'm just like, whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but for some reason,
in stories in doujins, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> I'm like, "I'm listening, go on" </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - After you read it, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'm reading, I'm invested, go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - To me, reading doujins
is just getting the story, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, getting the context </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> and being able to get the
story without having to like, </garnt>
<garnt> just watch 20 minutes of
just boring buildup in porn. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's so much hotter when
you understand the context </joey>
<connor> behind the scene.
- It is, it is. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I speed run the story </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> most of the time anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like if it's like this,
you know what they're doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's, all right, yeah, go on. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Tap, tap, tap </joey>
<joey> ten seconds forward. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> I get it, he's your
brother, all right, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> In a laundry machine, oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Let's skip forward on that, okay. </connor>
<connor> I've got enough understanding
of the plot that I can go now. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - I can do it, I can enjoy it.
- So, did you like, </joey>
<joey> did you like input any of
the stories of any of them? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, no I did, I actually liked, </connor>
<joey> 'cause obviously when you're reading, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really hard to ignore the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't double tap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pretty, really frustrating. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - You couldn't skip the cut scenes. </connor>
<connor> - You're like, "what am I doing wrong?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like, this is
a fatal flaw of books, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't skip any of the story, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't skip any of the cut scenes. </garnt>
<connor> You can't just go
straight to the gameplay. </connor>
<connor> - As much as I tried, trust me. </connor>
<joey> - All right, so let's start
with the first one then. </joey>
<joey> - "Dorei Usagi to-" </joey>
<garnt> - Which is the first one
you wanna start with? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you wanna go in order? </garnt>
<connor> - I think we'll start with this one. </connor>
<joey> - "Dorei Usagi," right? </joey>
<connor> - So this is the one where,
this is a strange story. </connor>
<connor> And I admit that at
times it was quite hot, </connor>
<connor> but then it was also really weird. </connor>
<connor> Really, really weird. So I mean like. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] How so? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there's this girl, who's a ghost, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but she's then not a ghost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think she's taking
medicine to go invisible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then she's like sucking
him off in the class </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and no one can see him suck. No one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But she's invisible, but he's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So why is his dick invisible? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> This is gonna sound really strange. </connor>
<garnt> This was a very confusing plot. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, so if you care
about reading the doujins, </garnt>
<connor> we're gonna be spoiling it, I guess. </connor>
<connor> If you care about the plot. </connor>
<connor> - Spoilers. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing)
- Spoiler warning. </connor>
<garnt> - This was like, for every
like, in this one at least, </garnt>
<garnt> for every one moment that I
was like, "Oh, that's hot," </garnt>
<connor> it would literally do 10 other things </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, "What the fuck is this? </connor>
<garnt> What the fuck am I reading?" </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, 'cause after
you've read everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I only, like, I thought
you were just gonna read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> a few chapters of everything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> so I read a few chapters of Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when you said
you read everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> I went back to just completely
finished everything as well. </garnt>
<connor> Right?
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like there's just
a complete 180 at the end </connor>
<joey> as well, where it starts going
into this other backstory. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No, no, no,
no. No, no, no, no." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> That author tends to do that
with everything he writes. </joey>
<connor> - There was just like moments in there </connor>
<connor> where I had to write down, it was like, </connor>
<connor> I put, "This shit is mad incel." </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Isn't that most doujins? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's most doujins.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because there was this
moment where we're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> "Oh, these girls are wearing
skirts, they're such sluts." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "All right."
(both laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - These femoids.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, okay, geez. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - How dare they? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what I'm
getting myself into. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, look at the main character. </joey>
<garnt> He's just, he's like,
- [Connor] Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, I guess before we get into it. </joey>
<joey> Joey, do you want to explain
why you chose this one? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, why'd you choose this one? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so literally, okay I'll admit, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> this was the part where I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Fuck, I don't know what
to do for the third one." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I like everything by Akatsuki Myuuto </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who's like this artist. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So honestly, any one of his
could have been on this list. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> - But I figured like,
probably the least weird one </joey>
<joey> for Connor would be this one. </joey>
<joey> - The least weird one?
- The least weird one. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like this is
not the least weird one. </connor>
<connor> I mean, there's a few other ones. </connor>
<connor> I mean it's not that bad. </connor>
<joey> - No, the least weird out of his works. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean like the other two are ones </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> that I actually really enjoy.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That like immediately
came off the top of my head. </joey>
<connor> - You know, the one thing that
I wish they would just chill </connor>
<connor> out with on doujins is just
how fast shit escalates. </connor>
<connor> It goes from like, "uwu," to
like, gang bang in the showers </connor>
<joey> within like, four pages at times. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Hold on, hold on, hold on." </joey>
<joey> - There's no time to fuck around,
there's hundreds of pages. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, let this boy chill
her out a little bit, </joey>
<connor> let him play some video
games, you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck I just fucked,
you know, like, damn!" </connor>
<connor> - Well why? </connor>
<joey> I don't know why you're suggesting that </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're probably gonna skip over it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, but it's
just like, "Oh God, okay, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna- </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> oh God, we're fucking!" </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Give me a warning. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually had, like out of everyone, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> I had the most trouble
following this story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was really confusing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought it was like
a really simple story. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> And then like, the last
chapter here, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What is going on right now?" </garnt>
<connor> - Can you, 'cause I'm fucking stupid, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> can you explain the basic
premise of the story? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - From what I-
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which again, it's, from what
I understand, this guy was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, so again, I won't spoil the thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause you find out more earlier on, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but we'll start from the start. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You just kind of find this guy,
kind of like a normal incel, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of, I mean I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Basic hentai protagonist. </joey>
<garnt> - Basic hentai protagonist. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wants to get revenge on
all the women around him </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> and then a girl transfers into the school </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who then immediately
just starts, is a ghost, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> but starts fucking him. </connor>
<garnt> - So, only he can see her,
but no one else can see her. </garnt>
<joey> So she gives him glasses or something? </joey>
<joey> That, makes-
- That's right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah she gives him some glasses. </joey>
<joey> - That make all the clothes see-through. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that make all
the clothes see-through. </joey>
<joey> So he's just looking at
all these naked girls </joey>
<garnt> while being sucked off
by this invisible girl, </garnt>
<garnt> even though no girl can
see him being sucked off? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah and also this girl
immediately starts sucking him off </garnt>
<garnt> like, right away. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, I hate it when they do this, </garnt>
<garnt> when they refer to the characters, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> when they refer to themselves
in the third person to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Stop that, what is that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that what they did? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they did that
only in the first scene, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> and I was like, "Oh God, please tell me </joey>
<joey> this isn't a constant thing." </joey>
<connor> She's like calling herself her name, </connor>
<connor> which is Charlotte, I think. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And she's like "Charlotte
is happy," and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh for fuck's sake."
- Yeah, yeah she calls </connor>
<joey> herself third person, that's right. </joey>
<joey> Admittedly, it's been a while
since I've read this, but- </joey>
<garnt> - I was hoping you'd bring
more context into it. </garnt>
<joey> - But, okay, but I remember
the reason why I picked </joey>
<garnt> this one is because it
literally has every tag. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I enjoy about it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you get the best of, I
was about to say both worlds, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> every world, every multi-verse. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - It's a lot and so he
fucks the ghost, blow job </connor>
<connor> and apparently no one else can see. </connor>
<joey> - Even though he's like
clearly nutting at the table. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like this guy is literally nutting. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - He's like, ah!
- Are you telling me- </joey>
<connor> - And she's like, "Are you okay?" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like, as if no one
would notice that you're, </joey>
<joey> you know, come on, fuck off.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - To be honest, that scene
was fucking hilarious. </joey>
<joey> - It's hard to believe
that it's as attractive </joey>
<joey> 'cause there's no way I could
be like, "Oh, that's hot. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> That could be me," like no,
it could never, ever be me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not that I would ever
want a ghost sucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want a Casper sucking me off. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> But you know, it's kinda,
you know what I mean? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically like the first
chapter just kind of reminded me </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> of like some porn spinoff
of Bunny Girl Senpai, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Well, you know where he's in the library </connor>
<connor> and he sees Mai for the first time </connor>
<garnt> and no one else can see him. </garnt>
<garnt> This is basically just that, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - This is that if it was R rated. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I also, I know I've watched hentai, </garnt>
<garnt> so I know this shit exists, </garnt>
<connor> but there was one piece
of dialogue as well, </connor>
<connor> where, like the bully girls </connor>
<joey> who are like attractive or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Oh the gals, right?
- Yeah, the gals, </joey>
<joey> you know, they ask him for
money and that's so inexcusable </joey>
<connor> that in return he's gonna fuck them. </connor>
<connor> That's how he's gonna get back at them. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What the fuck is this logic?" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Like, "What am I-" </connor>
<connor> - It's incel logic, dude. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, I know.
- It's incel logic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "Bro she literally
asked you for a tenner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What do you mean, chill
out," like, come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I don't think it's that bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How dare you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah not bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Okay, now he become
horny Casper the ghost. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing)
He goes invisible. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh that's right, he goes invisible. </connor>
<garnt> - I was not following the story at all. </garnt>
<connor> - So then what happens
is, is that the girl, </connor>
<connor> this Charlotte ghost girl, then is like, </connor>
<garnt> "Well, don't worry homie, I got you," </garnt>
<garnt> and starts like drugging the
other people in the class </garnt>
<garnt> that make them horny. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah she does do that.
- And then he starts </garnt>
<garnt> fucking them and then she
introduces like new power-ups, </garnt>
<joey> this is like the fastest PS2 game. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying, man. </joey>
<joey> Like it's every time.
- And then he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Hold up, but now you can drug them </joey>
<joey> and then I'll give you
invisibility drugs." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, "But you
only got 30 minutes." </joey>
<joey> And then he starts fucking
like the whole school. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then they find out,
and then they don't care </joey>
<joey> and then they carry on fucking. </joey>
<connor> And then this just goes insanity, </connor>
<connor> and literally the whole
school is being fucked </connor>
<connor> by this one guy within like,
I'm literally 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> into the story and this
is what's going on. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I can't think.
What is happening? </connor>
<connor> Which girl is which? </connor>
<connor> I don't know which. They
all have the same hairstyle. </connor>
<connor> Wait a minute, is this girl Robin? </connor>
<connor> Wait, which one's the,
which one's the ghost? </connor>
<garnt> What is happening? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it was at this point where like, </garnt>
<joey> you know, when there's like
so many girls that all of them </joey>
<joey> just start blending in together, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah
- and you were just like, </joey>
<garnt> I don't even know who
you're fucking anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like, you know, and then where the fuck </connor>
<connor> did this Willy Wonka candy come from, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> where everyone's just fucking horny now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What does it come from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where's the backstory to that, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no backstory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then later on we
find out that the main girl </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> who he wanted to fuck the
whole time was some poor </joey>
<joey> homeless girl that he was
speaking to in the start? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the student council girl. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that he got made
fun of for talking to </joey>
<joey> and then the girl wishes
that they'd never met. </joey>
<joey> Or he wishes that he never? </joey>
<connor> And then his doll, his doll comes to life </connor>
<connor> and that's the one he's fucking,
and she brings the drugs. </connor>
<garnt> What is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what confused me. </garnt>
<garnt> It was that chapter where
the doll starts talking </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Have I
just skipped over a chapter?" </garnt>
<connor> - This is literally like
"Lord of the Rings," </connor>
<connor> when you miss like one page, you're like, </connor>
<garnt> "Hold up, did I just miss the whole, </garnt>
<garnt> did I miss the whole story?" </garnt>
<garnt> - You missed the whole
point of the story, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I need to go back 20 pages. </connor>
<connor> - It feels like I just
got a Shyamalan twist </connor>
<garnt> without having a Shyamalan movie. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every page is a Shyamalan twist. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - I can't keep up with it. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like what is going on? </connor>
<connor> But like, there'll be like two moments </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, that's hot. </connor>
<garnt> And then what is going on? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay, what I didn't understand </connor>
<connor> was, okay so, was the main girl just, </connor>
<garnt> was she wearing a wig the entire time? </garnt>
<connor> (overlapping laughter and chatter) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't understand.
- She's like a bald bitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> It's like, "My weave!" </connor>
<garnt> - He shows up at this
house and he's just like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> what's the girl's name again? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know.
- Charlotte, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Charlotte.
- He's just like, "Charlotte?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's a girl with black hair </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then Charlotte fucking runs away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and starts putting on a wig, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, no, wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - [Garnt] Am I following this correctly? </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait, what, I don't- </connor>
<garnt> - This was like the second
to last chapter, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I thought he was just
like, you know what, </connor>
<connor> I honestly got very
confused reading this one, </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna lie, there's multiple times, </connor>
<connor> I re-read this ending like four times </connor>
<connor> and I still didn't understand
what was happening. </connor>
<connor> And then like, they just
pull like, you know, </connor>
<connor> he literally, it's just the sheer, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> like, how it just
changes, like completely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It literally ends on like a gang bang, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the next panel it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could hear the Anohana
music playing inside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But really, there's a sad backstory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as to why he's fucking everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Oh, get the fuck
outta here, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I don't give a fuck. No one cares." </connor>
<joey> - Not gonna lie, I chose
this one because I knew </joey>
<joey> you guys would react like this. </joey>
<joey> Because it's so ridiculous
that I just love it. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, you know, that
shonen trope where like, </garnt>
<garnt> the villain gets defeated, </garnt>
<garnt> and then after the villain's defeated, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> you finally see his backstory? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like, that doesn't
belong in a hentai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] That's exactly, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't just fuck a girl </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just show her backstory </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> after she gets fucked, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I need this context
before the fucking happens. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, putting a backstory </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of a fight, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, why now, why now? </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> You couldn't have waited until afterwards? </joey>
<connor> - I'm not gonna lie, some
of these are blend, no. </connor>
<connor> It's blending into my head. </connor>
<connor> And it would just end.
How does this one end? </connor>
<garnt> - It ends with this random
fucking side story of someone- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - With the marriage? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With the marriage.
- I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What is happening?!"
- And I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> I didn't recognize any
of these characters. </garnt>
<garnt> - None of these characters look the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't even the
main fucking character. </garnt>
<connor> - But they just fuck, they
just fuck for some reason, </connor>
<connor> even though he just cheated
right before his like, </connor>
<connor> wedding day or some shit? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, oh yeah, he did. </connor>
<connor> - He like, cheats right
before his wedding day. </connor>
<connor> Like the whole story is like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> they're a fan club of him, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're a fan club of
the ghost that fucked, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the main protagonist, the incel guy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they make a fan club of
him in the side story. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> But I don't recognize
any of these characters. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then two of them
are getting married and- </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's not even the main girl either. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] No it's got
nothing to do with them. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a different girl. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then he cheats on
her, right before the day of </garnt>
<connor> and then there's a whole scene of, </connor>
<connor> "Does anyone object to the marriage?" </connor>
<connor> And they were like, "I do." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like this shit is insanity. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I didn't even know what to critique. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't regret raising this one. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - There's just so much shit
happening, that I'm like, </joey>
<joey> what do I even begin to critique? </joey>
<joey> Because there was just way
too much shit going on. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like someone, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he literally pulled up every
genre and he was like, bet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I'm gonna get every- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's exactly what he did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, is there a genre
where it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> shout at the wedding,
"no, stop the marriage?" </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Is that a tag? </connor>
<connor> That could be a tag. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah it probably is.
- Stop the marriage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Stop the count. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Stop the fucking count.
- Stop the marriage. </joey>
<joey> - My favorite hentai tag, stop the count. </joey>
<joey> - Stop the, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That is this tag, it's
just stop the count, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause he's fucked so many girls now </garnt>
<garnt> that I can't even count
how many girls he's fucked. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, to me, you know, </connor>
<connor> like I said on the hentai episode, </connor>
<joey> you know, there has to be
some kind of story in there </joey>
<joey> and there was moments- </joey>
<joey> - Oh now you care about story, huh? </joey>
<joey> - In hentai I do, yeah, I
need a little bit of story. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - This man.
- This is the only time when- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is why some of them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it might shock you that I enjoy later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, like, this one was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "What the fuck is happening?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a dumb ass story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Shit keeps getting weirder and weirder, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not in a funny way, like that one hentai </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where people start shooting
each other and there's dubstep. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> There's no dubsteps going
on with these panels. </joey>
<joey> Dubstep would've gone great </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> with some of these scenes, frankly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish there was a
built-in like dubstep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could have just gone onto YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and dubstepped as you read it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, this is the kind of, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's literally the kind
of doujin where I put on </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Skrillex in the background
and it'll be well paced, </connor>
<garnt> like Skrillex. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, like, reading this, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like my boner got
whiplash with the amount of shit </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> that was happening. </joey>
<garnt> - True, true, true. </garnt>
<joey> - You're just like- </joey>
<connor> - Your dick got a workout after that. </connor>
<connor> It's like, up, up, up, up. </connor>
<connor> - Every time you're like "I'm into this," </connor>
<connor> it's like, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like you start getting
into it, nope, new tag. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, well I guess I'll just,
nope, okay, new tag, okay? </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, okay,
what is the theme to this? </joey>
<joey> What was the author's vision? </joey>
<joey> - What was the vision?
- What was the vision? </joey>
<garnt> What was the author
trying to say with this? </garnt>
<joey> - This is literally,
what tags do you want? </joey>
<connor> Yes. </connor>
<garnt> This is what this is. </garnt>
<connor> - It's terrible, it's fucking terrible. </connor>
<garnt> - I know to me, it needed like, it needed, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, this is gonna sound
so fucking pretentious. </garnt>
<garnt> It needed something to
connect all the dots, right? </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, I honestly I'm gonna agree with you. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my fucking God, are we
agreeing on something, Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> My fucking God. </garnt>
<garnt> Trash Taste first. </garnt>
<connor> - This felt like, just 10
doujins that have been like, </connor>
<connor> let's just fucking ram them into one. </connor>
<connor> We got these sexy girls
that I don't wanna redraw </connor>
<garnt> in different ways, like,
shove 'em into one. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what this felt like? </connor>
<garnt> This felt like it was like, if the MCU </garnt>
<garnt> had one recurring character
in every movie, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But then it was just like, it
was one continuous narrative, </garnt>
<garnt> but because every movie genre
is so fucking different, </garnt>
<garnt> you just don't know what
the fuck's going on. </garnt>
<joey> You can't follow anything. </joey>
<joey> - It's like playing all
the MCU movies at once. </joey>
<connor> - I gave this one a, </connor>
<joey> I originally wrote down seven,
but I that can't be right. </joey>
<joey> I'll give it like a five really. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, we're doing scores as well? </connor>
<garnt> - I would have given it, </garnt>
<connor> personally I give it a five. </connor>
<connor> - Is this one got an anime adaptation, </connor>
<joey> like a hentai adaptation? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think so.
- I don't think so. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think anything by Akatsuki Myuuto </garnt>
<garnt> has gotten an anime. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, if this doesn't- </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even know the authors. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess, before we move on though, </garnt>
<garnt> what did you think of the art? </garnt>
<connor> - It's fine. It's pretty good. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> The art's pretty intense, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I feel like there's
a lot more fluids going on </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> in the doujins than the anime adaptations. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the art, it's pretty damn good. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I can't fault that, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah the art was good, the art was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think there
was any of these, doujins </garnt>
<garnt> where the art put me off except- </garnt>
<connor> I liked all of them actually. </connor>
<connor> I'd say all of them had their merits. </connor>
<garnt> - That's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like in his other
works, you said this one </garnt>
<garnt> was one of the least weird ones, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's so weird about his other works? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Well what happens in his other works, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you can remember.
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And Ashley, can you put on
the air conditioning right now? </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> 'Cause I'm getting a bit heated. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's getting hot in here.
- Literally and, </joey>
<garnt> like mentally and physically right now. </garnt>
<joey> - So there's another one. </joey>
<joey> When I was like thinking of
what the last one is, right, </joey>
<joey> I was like, all right, let me
go through my favorite artists </joey>
<joey> and see if there's one I can remember. </joey>
<joey> And then I got to his works. </joey>
<joey> And one of them I wanted
to recommend was one called </joey>
<joey> "Lingua Franca" which is also done by him. </joey>
<joey> And again, this is a while
since I've read this one. </joey>
<connor> But basic, over simplified
premise is guy and a girl </connor>
<connor> flying a plane across an island </connor>
<connor> and they crash land onto said island. </connor>
<connor> And that island has
this secret civilization </connor>
<connor> of all these like Amazon-esque
girls who live there. </connor>
<connor> - Is this a "Futurama" episode? </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the guy gets kidnapped
by that civilization </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's the first
male that they've seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like over 100 years.
- Is that literally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is literally-
- Death by Snu-Snu. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Yeah this is literally
the "Futurama" episode. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally Death by Snu-Snu. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - But then you find out
there's like this alien species </connor>
<connor> that has been controlling
that civilization </connor>
<connor> for the longest time. </connor>
<joey> - That's "Futurama." That's literally- </joey>
<joey> - Is it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's a robot controlling them. </joey>
<joey> - I do not remember that part of the- </joey>
<joey> - That Bender like, makes out with. </joey>
<connor> - I can't believe "Futurama"
ripped off Akatsuki Myuuto. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literally a Futurama episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - I can't believe "Futurama'
ripped them off like that. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> Cease and Desist incoming. </joey>
<connor> - I mean if you had to give this a rating, </connor>
<joey> what would you give it then? </joey>
<joey> Top of your head.
- Eight. </joey>
<joey> - Eight? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I'd say like six or seven. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Yeah, it's good but it's
not my favorite of his. </joey>
<garnt> - I think the best part
of this was the art. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The ending and the fact
that it ended, honestly. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - The ending just made me confused. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't like it when they put a one shot </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> with totally different
characters that's like 10 pages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That just confuses me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Wait, should I be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wait, what's going on?" </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Oh, the bonus content, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I hate it when they do that, </connor>
<connor> it confuses me to death. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's like the
bonus content you get </connor>
<garnt> from buying the full book. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right, right right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Rather than just
reading it in magazines. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'll give it a five. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like,
- That's a pass. </garnt>
<joey> - Huh?
- That's a pass. </joey>
<garnt> - I've seen like a lot of hentai like this </garnt>
<joey> where it's just like,
all right, let's just get </joey>
<joey> into the fucking as fast as possible. </joey>
<joey> What is the premise? </joey>
<joey> All right, premise done. </joey>
<joey> How many girls can this
fuck in one single sitting? </joey>
<joey> - Yes.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And that was just this
hentai. I mean, it was good. </joey>
<garnt> It was good, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - I'll admit, even
though I recommended it, </joey>
<joey> it's nothing special. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay.
- I just really liked the art. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're just grasping at straws? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, I just really like the artist, </garnt>
<garnt> and how fucking ridiculous and like, </garnt>
<garnt> just like, his passion
for just being like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> "Finna put every tag that I can." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I respect that.
- Into one. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> It's like, I respect it. </connor>
<connor> - I respect it. </connor>
<connor> - All right, what's the next one? </connor>
<connor> - "Inma No Mikata!" Succubi's Supporter. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yes, yes, yes. </joey>
<joey> Which one do you think this is? </joey>
<connor> - Whoever chose this
knew me well, I'd say. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - I think I have this as Joey here. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - It's mine. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay okay.
- Wait, you know what? </connor>
<connor> - This one, this one could
have gone either way. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you know what's funny </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> is that this is one of
three that I've read before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was gonna put it in
until Garnt sent me his list. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Dude, it's a classic. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like one of the top rated ones. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's one of the
most famous doujinshis </garnt>
<joey> like, long form doujinshis of all time. </joey>
<joey> - I see why. </joey>
<joey> - And for good fucking reason, like, it's- </joey>
<joey> - Art is great, story's great. </joey>
<garnt> - Art is great, story's
great, and just blow jobs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Very good, very good. </garnt>
<connor> - Like it will blow your fucking mind. </connor>
<connor> - So essentially how the story
starts is there's just a guy </connor>
<connor> who doesn't have a job
chilling on a bench. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Succubis come up to him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kind of like a hot
singles in your area ad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- But IRL. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just come up to him and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, do you want a job
helping us succubuses?" </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> And he's like, "Oh, I
don't know what that is, </garnt>
<garnt> but okay, sure." </garnt>
<garnt> - What's a succubus? </garnt>
<garnt> - To give a bit more context, </garnt>
<garnt> so this world has like
succubi, or succubus, </garnt>
<garnt> have integrated into the human society. </garnt>
<garnt> So like they're not this
mythical creature anymore. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> So like a lot of most of
the population of the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has some succubus blood in it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the science is that
the more succubus blood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's in a guy, the less
tasty their semen is. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Fluids are. </connor>
<connor> - Their fluids are. </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt, come on, we're on YouTube here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - Wake up gamers, because this video </joey>
<joey> is sponsored by GamerSupps. </joey>
<garnt> - As you all know, we've
officially partnered </garnt>
<garnt> with GamerSupps. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gamer!
- Why? </garnt>
<garnt> The powder tastes great,
it's cheaper and healthier </garnt>
<garnt> than other energy drinks
and mixes perfectly. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt, but in all honesty, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'm just here for the amazing
selection of Waifu Cups. </connor>
<garnt> - Look at all these beautiful Waifus. </garnt>
<connor> - Very gamers. </connor>
<joey> - That's how you know how gamer we are. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing)
My microphone just came off. </joey>
<joey> As I was saying, all of
the Waifu Cups you see here </joey>
<joey> are limited edition. </joey>
<joey> So you should get them quickly </joey>
<joey> if you think you're a true gamer girl. </joey>
<garnt> - These shirts and cups always sell out, </garnt>
<garnt> so if you want your
chance to get your Waifu, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to move fast. </garnt>
<connor> - What are you gamers waiting for? </connor>
<connor> Go and get your Waifu
Cups and support the show </connor>
<connor> by using coupon code TRASHTASTE. </connor>
<connor> Buy lots of stuff so we can
get our GamerSupps flavor </connor>
<connor> and comment what you
think it should be called. </connor>
<connor> I am being held at gunpoint,
but that's because I'm a gamer </connor>
<garnt> and I play games. </garnt>
<garnt> - Back to the show, gamers. </garnt>
<garnt> - And of course, our main
guy here is one of like, </garnt>
<joey> one of the 0.1% of the population left. </joey>
<joey> - That is just pure human. </joey>
<joey> - That is just pure human blood, right? </joey>
<joey> Pure, no succubus blood
in this family tree. </joey>
<joey> And of course the job he
is given is to basically </joey>
<joey> just like provide an
all you can eat buffet. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's the best way I can provide it. </joey>
<joey> - Of dick. </joey>
<joey> - One man buffet. </joey>
<garnt> - One man versus the world. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I liked this one. </connor>
<connor> It was very good, how can
you not like this one? </connor>
<joey> - This was one of the
like, least offensive ones. </joey>
<connor> - What guy wouldn't want this? </connor>
<joey> You literally, you're just
a piece of meat, you know? </joey>
<garnt> Let 'em just.
- Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> One thing that like,
'cause this artist I feel, </garnt>
<garnt> is probably like the
best artist when it comes </garnt>
<connor> to drawing blow job scenes. </connor>
<joey> I mean, this doujinshi in general </joey>
<joey> is just 90% blow job, right? </joey>
<joey> I think there's like one sex scene in it </joey>
<joey> and it lasts like, two,
three pages or something. </joey>
<joey> Its mostly- </joey>
<garnt> - It's mostly blow jobs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> So clearly we know what this artist likes. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like literally the blow
jobs you wish you were given, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> like, if I could give
this manga a summary, </connor>
<connor> it's pretty much that. </connor>
<connor> I mean, yeah. I mean, what
is not to like about this? </connor>
<connor> Like I said, like God tier
art, positions are fantastic. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fantastic stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, here's a question. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you think this would
translate well into a hentai? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, dude, if fucking
Pink Pineapple made this? </connor>
<connor> Hell yeah, dude I'm there. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, did this not get a hentai? </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, they got, "Stayed
at Home Succubus" got one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, that's right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The other one got it.
- The other one got it, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I don't know, like what I think </connor>
<garnt> wouldn't translate well is that
the fucking blow job scenes </garnt>
<garnt> are so intense. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't see it
translating well into hentai. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I might be able to
be done, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Maybe science will advance
and we'll get good technology </garnt>
<joey> to be able to emanate.
- Oh I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> Like it'd be like a 20 minute BJ scene. </joey>
<connor> - So yeah, they have this story where, </connor>
<connor> okay, they just started fucking him. </connor>
<connor> And then apparently his peepee
is so good that they're like, </connor>
<connor> "We made a website about your dick." </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, they made him
go viral, didn't they? </garnt>
<garnt> They made him go viral.
- They were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, by the way, we've
put your dick online. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't worry, by the way,
we haven't shown your face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We wouldn't do that."
- Yeah, yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - "But your dick's famous
now to all the other succubi </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> in the world." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then like, "Oh, okay,
there's more succubus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in this world, okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they hold an award
show, not an awards show, </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> it's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like an idol handshake.
- A handshake, yeah that's it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's an idol handshake
thing where you can come </garnt>
<connor> and instead of handshake an
idol, you can suck the dick. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing)
- Yeah, so these succubus, </garnt>
<garnt> they're like hundreds of succubus show up </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> to this handshaking event where- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The cock shaking event. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, where they pay an amount of money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get like five minutes
to milk the cow, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's the best way to describe it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Pretty much, pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - That was probably my favorite chapter. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, that was one
fucking intense chapter. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just 'cause normally I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'm not into like the
whole harem angle of it, </connor>
<connor> but it was so like the
concept was so overdone </connor>
<connor> and the art was so great. </connor>
<connor> And it was just,
- So hot. </connor>
<connor> - Some of the scenes
were so fucking intense </connor>
<garnt> that I'm just like, "Yo that's hot." </garnt>
<connor> All right, that's hot.
- That's hot. That's hot. </connor>
<joey> - That's very good, that's very good. </joey>
<joey> Very good stuff, I'm
just getting flashbacks. </joey>
<joey> - This is one where it's
like, if I'm suffering </joey>
<garnt> to like, you know, pick one for the job. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is like the comfort food. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, this is the comfort food, </garnt>
<joey> this is the one that I always go back to. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, the reason I picked
this one is because like, </garnt>
<garnt> out of every doujinshi,
if I were to pick one </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm introducing someone
to the world of doujinshi </garnt>
<garnt> and what it's like, then
this one's just like </garnt>
<garnt> an all-rounder in every category. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the- </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It don't miss. It don't miss. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the fucking
Naruto of Hentai, okay? </garnt>
<connor> It's the gateway drug, okay? </connor>
<connor> - It's the gateway to doujinshi. </connor>
<connor> (overlapping chatter and laughter) </connor>
<joey> - I mean yeah, because the content, </joey>
<joey> like the tags are so
inoffensive where it's like </joey>
<joey> it's not too weird where it's like, </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, I'm not really into that." </garnt>
<joey> Like everyone's into fucking BJs. </joey>
<garnt> - Like who doesn't love blow jobs, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Who wouldn't want three succubuses? </joey>
<joey> I mean that's, I mean, you know. </joey>
<joey> - This is such a "God I
wish that were me" doujin. </joey>
<connor> - And it's okay, right 'cause
it's succubuses, right? </connor>
<connor> So if you nut too early,
that's like great. </connor>
<connor> They like that, that's what they want. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> They want more of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No disappointment. Oh God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, what I liked
is that they gave context </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to you, you know, normally
like a hentai protagonist </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can orgasm like an
ungodly amount of times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I liked the fact
that they gave it a reason </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for him to be able to
orgasm that amount of times, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is just like if you feed on the- </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - They have pheromones or something. </connor>
<connor> - They have pheromones, and
if you feed on their spit </connor>
<joey> or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's always the saliva. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, if you swap body
fluids, then it's just </joey>
<joey> like this fucking mega aphrodisiac. </joey>
<joey> - And the semen is like an
aphrodisiac for succubi, right? </joey>
<joey> So it's like a twofer. </joey>
<joey> - The never ending cycle. </joey>
<joey> - The perfect system doesn't exist. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - In this story after they have
this whole handshaking event </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I like to call it, they
put his face online anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like, "Come guys,
look how amazing this guy is." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then suddenly a fucking
Sundari loli shows up </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> and I'm like, "What's all this?" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Why are you getting
in the way of my hentai? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I totally forgot about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I didn't know which
one of you did this, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> So that was what tilted it in the end. </connor>
<connor> (both laugh) </connor>
<joey> I was like "Fuck, fuck come on." </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, this bitch, I remember. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember first reading that. </garnt>
<garnt> And then she's like,
"Hello, I am the mother." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and then I was like, </connor>
<connor> it literally the headset meme of like, </connor>
<connor> taking the headset off like, </connor>
<connor> "Aw, you had it, you had it! </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Why did you introduce a fucking loli?? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> It was so good! </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because what was so
funny is that she's technically </garnt>
<garnt> a loli MILF, right? </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - The best of both worlds, everybody wins! </connor>
<connor> - Literally I wasn't
even wearing a headset, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> but I metaphorically pulled
one off for that meme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Fuck this shit!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just did the movement.
- Fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was so, bah, God, it
was so perfect, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I was enjoying life,
it was great, you know, </connor>
<joey> and then this happened. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> It just ruined it for me. </connor>
<connor> It was great, it was great. </connor>
<connor> - There's no pleasing, </connor>
<joey> even with the most inoffensive doujin, </joey>
<joey> there's no pleasing this man. </joey>
<joey> - I just didn't like, and she
got her whole own section. </joey>
<joey> I was like, no one else
got their own section. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Why do you get your own section? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But they do later on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at this point, no one
else had their own section </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at this point, why does the fucking loli </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who just showed up looking
like a fucking Bratz Doll, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> get to have a whole fucking 20 pages? </garnt>
<garnt> What's this? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want this. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, fucking speed running this shit, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get it over with. </garnt>
<garnt> Like when is anything else gonna happen? </garnt>
<garnt> And then luckily, luckily it saved itself. </garnt>
<connor> It brought out the big guns. </connor>
<garnt> - The next thing, the next chapter, right? </garnt>
<connor> - The next chapter, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And then suddenly they
introduced, they're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, by the way, there's
a union for succubuses," </connor>
<connor> because of course there is
and they have a headquarters. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, he gets shipped
off to like the fucking UN </garnt>
<garnt> or something, right? </garnt>
<connor> - The fucking UN of succubuses,
he gets shipped off. </connor>
<garnt> And then they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "by the way, succubuses
have been stopping wars </garnt>
<garnt> for generations because we
fuck people into submission. </garnt>
<connor> So no wars because everyone is
happy because we fuck them." </connor>
<connor> and it's like, "oh, okay. I
mean, I guess that makes sense." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Of course. </connor>
<garnt> - Gotta introduce some
world-building somewhere, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can't have wars if
you're fucking, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> Geez. And then yeah, I
really liked that woman. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> She was great, she was very attractive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I very much liked her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause she looks like a MILF. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hell yeah she does. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I thought she was right up my alley. </connor>
<joey> I was like, this is great. </joey>
<joey> - You do look like an office
lady tag kind of person. </joey>
<joey> - Oh absolutely. </joey>
<joey> Because she was also, you
know, she was also like, </joey>
<connor> "Ah, no, I don't want
it, I don't want it." </connor>
<connor> But then she did want it. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's what I like. </connor>
<garnt> - Out of context Connor. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no! </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, but it was
obvious the whole time </connor>
<garnt> that they were gonna fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're in a doujin here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wouldn't it have been
such a Shyamalan twist </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> where they introduce her and she's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I don't want it." </connor>
<joey> And it's like, "understandable." </joey>
<joey> - You know, I wanna watch a
porno where the plumber comes </joey>
<connor> and just fixes something
and then just leaves. </connor>
<connor> And then she just masturbates. </connor>
<connor> You know, I want that. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's very avant garde. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Subvert my expectations,
you know, give me something. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Throw me a curve ball, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - We're deconstructing porno now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but I mean, I think I wrote down, </connor>
<connor> I said, this would have
been a 10 out of 10 </connor>
<connor> if they didn't have
the fucking loli in it. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> The loli intrusion, as I called it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - The loli intrusion. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I wrote
the art as God tier. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Like pretty much everything was God tier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like fucking around
with eight out of 10, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, yeah, it was probably my favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> out of all of these, in
terms of, could I nut to it? </connor>
<connor> This was definitely the- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. That does not surprise me. </joey>
<connor> - Despite being just pictures,
I think I could manage. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I think if I scroll really fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first thing I did
when I looked at the list </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Garnt and mine is like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is gonna be Connor's favorite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is gonna be Connor's favorite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You guys know my tastes now. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> You know my tastes. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm like this man likes
vanilla, this is the most vanilla. </joey>
<joey> He's gonna like this one. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's not so
much vanilla as so much </joey>
<joey> as so it's just universally agreed. </joey>
<joey> - It's inoffensive, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That this is God tier doujin, right? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, 100%. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's one of the best doujins ever made, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some of the best art ever made. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> Hasn't yet gotten a hentai
adaptation, which I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> how has this not got a hentai adaptation? </garnt>
<connor> - I would appreciate
an adaptation to this. </connor>
<garnt> I mean maybe all the studios are scared. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, its like a VIP. They're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> we don't wanna fuck- </connor>
<garnt> - We don't wanna fuck this up, dude. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then Queen Bee
cracking their knuckles </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Dude if Queen Bee adapts
this, I would cry so hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - We need to take a shot at this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just comes from from behind the trees </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because, </garnt>
<garnt> what sucks about Queen
Bee is that when you, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like every Queen
Bee doujin that seems </garnt>
<joey> to get adapted is like,
a doujin I respect like, </joey>
<joey> close to this level, right? </joey>
<joey> It's a God tier doujin
that gets passed around and </joey>
<garnt> you're like, brilliant, this
looks fucking fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like when I, </garnt>
<garnt> when I see people in the
comments of these websites, </garnt>
<garnt> being like, "Oh God, it's Queen Bee." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, I don't even
know who this doujin is. </garnt>
<garnt> So I could have never
been disappointed anyway. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And frankly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even know who you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I literally don't even know who you are, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so like it's not a problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Some of them, I still manage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, Queen Bee does a
good enough job sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good enough job. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Right, and get the job done. </connor>
<connor> You know, the task can be complete. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, no, I mean, this is just great. </connor>
<connor> So I highly recommend if
you haven't read doujins, </connor>
<connor> go and read it. </connor>
<joey> - Wow, Connor recommending doujins. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow, what the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - What a world first. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I would
prefer Queen Bee did actually, </joey>
<joey> instead of what they do now? </joey>
<joey> I would prefer that if Queen
Bee animated their doujins </joey>
<joey> or animated their hentai
the same way that- </joey>
<joey> - Animated doujins are made? </joey>
<joey> - Kind of like a, what was that, </joey>
<joey> the yakuza husband one that got animated? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, "Way of the House Husband." </joey>
<joey> - "Way of the House Husband." </joey>
<connor> - Like slideshows? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not slideshows, but just
like an animated comic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would actually prefer that style over- </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Where they just copy each frame. </joey>
<joey> - Where they just copy each frame. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah true. </connor>
<connor> - Because to me like a motion
comic would give way more </connor>
<joey> of like an impact than
whatever the fuck Queen Bee do. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like please Queen Bee, please. </joey>
<garnt> I can handle that, just
give me a motion comic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Call me Queen Bee. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - How much you need, like 20 bucks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 20 Bucks, yeah.
- That's the whole budget. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Yeah, I mean, like I
wrote eight out of 10, </connor>
<connor> 'cause of loli but I
probably give it a nine. </connor>
<connor> It would have been a 10 out
of 10 if there was no loli. </connor>
<connor> Honestly I'm not joking, that's serious. </connor>
<garnt> That kind of took me out of it. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, whiplashing. </connor>
<garnt> - Would you be interested
in his other works then? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are they this good? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This one is really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Most of his work is
very blow job oriented. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> He's just a fucking blowjob.
- He sticks to a theme. </garnt>
<garnt> He sticks to a theme. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I always think, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> blow job is like the best visually part. </garnt>
<connor> Like the visually like sexual thing, </connor>
<connor> blow job is probably the
most attractive looking, </connor>
<connor> I think when done right. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a, what is it, a macaroon? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Those little fucking sweets? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know where I'm going with this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You always see those sweets, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you comparing
blow jobs to macaroons? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You look at a macaroon, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, "That looks amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> That looks fucking amazing,
I really, really want that." </garnt>
<garnt> And they never, ever, ever
taste as good as they look. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's how I feel about blow jobs. </garnt>
<connor> - Really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Really?
- Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, 'cause in fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - In hentai,
- I can feel the salt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In hentai, bro, they
make it look like fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wrestle Mania Smack Down",
whirlwind on the dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not like that in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Oh, shit, ah oh." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've been getting shit blow jobs then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It that what it's like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That's not what it's like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what it looks like
in the hentai at least. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's very aggressive, very aggressive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I mean, it's a lot of
work sometimes, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sometimes it's awkward
and you just realize </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're just standing there. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> You're just like, "Oh fuck,
it's awkward, isn't it?" </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, so much work, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like, sometimes, </connor>
<joey> sometimes like, what's
so great about blow job </joey>
<garnt> is that there's literally
no pressure to do anything, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you know. </garnt>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But sometimes I get
that moment where like, </connor>
<connor> I get distracted for one second
and I get taken out of it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Fuck, fuck I
gotta to do my taxes, fuck." </connor>
<connor> Now I gotta pretend like I'm still there, </connor>
<connor> I'm still in the zone. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- "Ah, ah!" </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> "Fuck! I really got to
file those taxes though. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Fuck, I really forgot about that. </connor>
<connor> Oh God, I can't do it now, can I? </connor>
<connor> That's gonna be really awkward
if I go and do those now." </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Babe, can you
hand me my laptop real quick? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> I'm just gotta file these taxes." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not interactive enough.
I'm joking, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, no it was good,
it was good, it was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right.
- All right, next one. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - It was the, I already
know who this one was. </joey>
<joey> This is fucking degenerate. </joey>
<joey> - Which one? </joey>
<joey> - "Juunengo no Jinsei Soudan," </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> "Life Consultation After 10 Years." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, be me guys, be me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You sit there, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I only know, right, I know one thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> All right, I know the word Oreimo </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> right, and I know it means incest. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I know Garnt likes
incest for some reason. </connor>
<connor> - I don't. </connor>
<garnt> Guys, as I said before,
Oreimo isn't an incest anime. </garnt>
<connor> - It's an anime with incest in it. </connor>
<connor> - It's just an anime with incest anime. </connor>
<garnt> This is very much an incest doujin. </garnt>
<connor> - I have not watched Oreimo. </connor>
<connor> I opened this thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't worry, you don't have to. </garnt>
<connor> - It's literally, I feel
like I understand the story </connor>
<connor> of the anime through this. </connor>
<connor> Which is very concerning
because, fuck, this is weird. </connor>
<joey> - Whatever you're thinking about </joey>
<joey> is probably what happened in Oreimo. </joey>
<connor> - There is so many things in
this anime that it made me </connor>
<connor> like, push my desk chair back
a little bit and go like, </connor>
<joey> "All right, all right." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because this one I
saw on the list, I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, I've never heard of
this one, I'll check it out." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking open it up,
just Oreimo fan fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, my one just,
because I read mine in Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so my one just said
"Juunengo no Jinsei Soudan" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Okay this
one sounds interesting." </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> First page is literally just like Kirino </connor>
<connor> with massive tits, I'm like. </connor>
<connor> (Joey inhales deeply) </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the biggest like, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (Joey sighs heavily) </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I knew this one. </connor>
<garnt> - You did this to fucking
troll, didn't you? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no.
- I know you fucking did. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - No, no, no.
- Don't tell me you like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is, to me, probably
the hottest like series Doujin </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever read. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Okay, because like, I
purposely avoided parodies. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, this I thought we, you know, I- </garnt>
<joey> - Because if that was the case, </joey>
<joey> I would've recommended
like, three of my favorites </joey>
<joey> are all parodies. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so this is like the only parody, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> like, parody doujin that is on the list. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I didn't know if we
were avoiding parodies or not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but I just wanted to talk
about this no matter what. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - We can do a parody
episode in the future. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, 'cause like most parody doujins, </connor>
<garnt> they last for like one chapter,
they last for like 20 pages. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like 10, 30 pages. </garnt>
<connor> - This one is an entire fucking story. </connor>
<joey> - It's like 220 pages. </joey>
<connor> - I felt like I was on like a fucking </connor>
<joey> like, "Big Brother" episode,
like where this was, </joey>
<joey> fuck, it never ended. It
just never fucking ended. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Not gonna lie, I-
- It just kept </joey>
<connor> getting fucking weirder and weirder. </connor>
<connor> - With this one, okay. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Admittedly, I don't like
Oreimo, like the show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I think Oreimo
doujins are hot as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] All right.
But here's the thing... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because all the characters are hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But here's the thing, all right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Here's the thing with this particular one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've read a lot of Oreimo doujins. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I've never read this one. </connor>
<connor> This one, I was like, okay. </connor>
<connor> First half I was like, "Okay, this got </connor>
<connor> kind of an interesting story." </connor>
<connor> Like you kind of get to see like, </connor>
<connor> the backstory of like
the actual characters. </connor>
<connor> - It gets real fucking weird. </connor>
<joey> - And then second half,
like she just like turns </joey>
<joey> into a yandere. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so can you walk
me through the story? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I had to pull up
the fucking Oreimo Wiki </joey>
<connor> to understand who the fuck everyone was. </connor>
<connor> - Cliff notes of Oreimo. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it doesn't
try and fucking ease you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into these characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> It's like, "You know Oreimo,
you're jacking off to Oreimo." </connor>
<garnt> - You know what you're reading. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, so to explain I
guess the basic premise </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> of Oreimo as well, </joey>
<joey> so Kirino and Kyousuke is the
main sibling pair rubberized. </joey>
<joey> And then all you need to know is also </joey>
<garnt> he has a childhood friend
who I don't even remember </garnt>
<garnt> her fucking name. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh the glasses girl, Mami? </garnt>
<connor> - The one who's the wife in this doujin. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not Mami, what the fuck's her name? </connor>
<connor> - Natsumi or something? </connor>
<joey> - I'll look it up. </joey>
<garnt> - Look it up, but basically
those are like all you need </garnt>
<garnt> to know about the
characters in this, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So in the ending of the original anime, </garnt>
<connor> Kirino confesses to Kyousuke,
which was like a 180 twist </connor>
<connor> from like everything that
was built up before, right? </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, they
have a few dates together </connor>
<connor> and then they decide... </connor>
<connor> - With his sister? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, with his
sister, which you know, </connor>
<joey> they're not blood related, so whatever. </joey>
<joey> - So it doesn't count, clearly. </joey>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - This is literally, they can't
keep getting away with this. </connor>
<connor> The know you, they're
like brother and sister, </connor>
<connor> not blood-related. Fuck, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, shut up, Connor. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shut up. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Look, you recommended
"Mothers know Breast" </connor>
<connor> that's literally a guy and his step-mom. </connor>
<connor> That's just incest with
an age gap, Connor. </connor>
<connor> - It's different, it's different. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no, no it's not. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - She wed into it, it's a different thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Legally, it's different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends, you know, if
it's like the stepbrother, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could be like maybe, maybe, but no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But this one's like, we're literally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're literally brother and
sister and this is literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like the fucking
card they slither in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> By the way, not blood related. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - God damn, what the fuck's her name? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just Google. Just Google. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But this was just fucking weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> So explain the story of this dude. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so I'll explain it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Manami, Manami.
- Manami. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, so this is like
kind of like a fan story </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> set 10 years after the- </connor>
<connor> - I got that, I understood that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 10 years, that's
why it's called 10 years </connor>
<connor> after the consultation or
something like that, all right? </connor>
<connor> So this is set 10 years
after the ending of the anime </connor>
<connor> where it has like a
slightly different ending. </connor>
<connor> So in this version, Kirino and Kyousuke </connor>
<connor> sleep with each other, right? </connor>
<connor> And their family finds out and Kirino </connor>
<connor> just gets fucking banished, right? </connor>
<connor> And they don't see each
other for 10 years. </connor>
<connor> - Understandable.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Understandable, banish
the fuck out of him. </connor>
<joey> - Parents doing what parents should do. </joey>
<connor> - Exile your kid if they
fuck your sister, I guess. </connor>
<garnt> - And so, I guess this is
set 10 years afterwards, </garnt>
<garnt> where she comes back and
they're both now married. </garnt>
<garnt> He has married his childhood friend, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like in the anime
her, like Manami is like, </garnt>
<garnt> she's built up as like
the plain girl, right? </garnt>
<garnt> She doesn't really have
any special features. </garnt>
<joey> - The girl that will probably never win. </joey>
<garnt> - The girl that was never on
the winning list to begin with. </garnt>
<garnt> But she's built up as just the plain girl. </garnt>
<garnt> She's the childhood friend, right? </garnt>
<connor> And in this version, she's the one </connor>
<connor> that he ended up marrying. </connor>
<connor> And Kirino has also
apparently, after 10 years, </connor>
<connor> married someone else as well. </connor>
<connor> And this is the first time
they've met after 10 years. </connor>
<connor> And they think, you know,
they're kind of like testing </connor>
<connor> the waters to see if
they still have feelings </connor>
<connor> for each other and it turns out- </connor>
<connor> - Spoilers, they do. </connor>
<garnt> - And it turns out they do, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who tests waters with
your brother and sister </garnt>
<connor> to see if you still
have feelings together? </connor>
<connor> That feels like a very dangerous game. </connor>
<connor> It's like Russian roulette. </connor>
<joey> - Welcome to the incest tag, bro. </joey>
<connor> Literally everything in this tag is that. </connor>
<joey> - What if I just like
put my dick in your hand? </joey>
<joey> Let's just see if I get hard. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a good test. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Okay.
- What if we just fucked? </garnt>
<joey> How weird would that be?
- Okay. </joey>
<connor> So, to explain my tastes, right? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> To explain what I, </garnt>
<garnt> like, why I thought this was like great, </garnt>
<garnt> because for one, most parody doujins, </garnt>
<garnt> they just like, it's the most
vanilla fucking storyline </garnt>
<garnt> like ever, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's just, here's these
two characters, they sex. </garnt>
<garnt> You are watching it
because it's the characters </garnt>
<garnt> you recognize. </garnt>
<garnt> But this, what I liked about this </garnt>
<garnt> is that it took the concept of Oreimo </garnt>
<garnt> and it like, built on it and like started </garnt>
<garnt> its own fucking storyline. </garnt>
<joey> - I do appreciate that element, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It was like, this was actually </garnt>
<garnt> a really story-heavy doujin. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, unfortunately,
I couldn't really </garnt>
<garnt> appreciate that 'cause I
didn't know fucking anything </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> about the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - I was just like, "This bitch crazy." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, yeah, no, I did like
the fact that it built </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> on the lore of the original
series that it was based off of. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But just it took like a fucking
depressing fucking turn. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it was fucking
depressing as shit, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Like Kirino turns yandere and
then like threatens Kyousuke </joey>
<joey> and then Manami gets like raped. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like this whole thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just kept getting weirder and weirder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So, be me. I don't know
anything about this, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know anything about this series. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All I know is that he got
banished for fucking his sister </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 10 years ago, and then they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> "Oh yeah, we're gonna meet again. " </connor>
<connor> Immediately fuck. </connor>
<connor> It's like, no fucking downtime. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> We just made eye contact, we fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, she's like, "I don't even
love my husband, I love you." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> And it's like, "Oh Jesus." </connor>
<joey> - Well, it's because they
both know what they want. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know, I know
- No words necessary. </joey>
<garnt> - And I guess like for me, if
I were to explain my tastes, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> what I find hot is like when
a taboo gets broken, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> It's like it's not the incest, okay? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I was about to say I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the one reason every person </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> who likes the incest tag says. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, like what I hate about </garnt>
<garnt> most incest fucking hentai or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like one girl says Onii chan, incest. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, get that
shit out of here, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a shit about that. </garnt>
<connor> - So you need the full
backstory of their brotherly </connor>
<garnt> and sister love to be
crushed in front of you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, it's not just
between like step siblings, </garnt>
<connor> step mother, step sons. </connor>
<garnt> Like I like, you know,
two coworkers who know </garnt>
<joey> they shouldn't get together,
they get together, that's hot. </joey>
<joey> Like a teacher, student relationship. </joey>
<joey> That's pretty fucking hot
as well, because it's- </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I understand those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, what I find
hot is like two characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who know they shouldn't get together, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> but they're too hot for each
other to be able to stop it. </joey>
<joey> And they do it even though
they know it's wrong. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know man, to
me, like breaking a taboo </joey>
<joey> is fucking hot. </joey>
<garnt> - I totally get that, I
think that's hot as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But then there's like, </garnt>
<joey> but then there's the scene
where she just goes loony. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> Like she's just loses her mind. </connor>
<joey> - For every moment I thought
maybe this could be hot, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> there's just something
happened where I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Goddamn it, this is
vile. Oh, it's so gross." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So there's this whole
bit where he's having sex </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> with the girl. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which girl? </garnt>
<garnt> - Uh, there's only two girls. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's only two girls, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The other girl, the
boring one, as you said. </garnt>
<garnt> - The wife.
- Manami. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and then she
pulls out just a strap-on, </connor>
<connor> for some reason. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It just comes out of nowhere. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> And it just felt like the DLC
being tacked on at the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like this is so rushed in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and half of like one second </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it was never mentioned again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was never shown again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She just had it with her. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> Like it was ready to go. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I love about that scene </joey>
<joey> with the fucking strap-on scene? </joey>
<joey> Where she like puts it into
the wife and she's like, </joey>
<joey> "It's too big." </joey>
<joey> And then she's like "This is the same size </joey>
<joey> as my big brother's." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Was he
never serious with you?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Oh my God, that's a burn." </joey>
<joey> She just got fucking burned. </joey>
<connor> - The moment, this is a moment that like, </connor>
<connor> really puzzled me the most, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> and I just didn't understand why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, you know, he fucks his
stepsister or whatever, sister, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and has this whole thing
and they have this thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he cheats on his wife
and they cheat on his wife. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they have this whole
weird scene where she fucks </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> his wife and stuff, I don't
really get why that's happening, </connor>
<connor> but at the end, she's like, </connor>
<connor> "By the way I told Mom
again that we fucked." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why did you need to-" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (overlapping chatter and laughter) </connor>
<connor> Why are you? </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, I completely
forgot about that. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just sitting there,
like, "Did you really need </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> to just tell your mom that
you fucked your brother again? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you trying to achieve here?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who does this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I read that and I was like,
"Well that was unnecessary." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - And I was like, "Well
this just went too far </connor>
<joey> because frankly, your mom is
probably just a very nice woman </joey>
<joey> who just got dragged into this." </joey>
<joey> - Let's be real, your mom
didn't need to know this. </joey>
<connor> - Your mom's getting to an older age. </connor>
<connor> You gotta let her live
her life peacefully, </connor>
<connor> knowing that you were a
good son and daughter. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - BT Dubs, mom, fucked my bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then just leaves. And then leaves! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Peace! </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - What's wrong with you? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> What is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why did you do this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just couldn't fathom it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you don't see
this in the, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> when you go on fucking, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> one of these porn websites. </connor>
<connor> Bang Bros or whatever,
and there's the whole mom </connor>
<connor> versus son-step. </connor>
<connor> - Mom versus son-step. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's not a whole scene
at the end where like, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> "Okay son, I'm gonna tell Dad now." </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna see that shit.
Don't include that shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I already feel
guilty enough for this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't include this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But clearly this was supposed
to be depressing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Yeah, it's meant to
be a depressing doujin. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Really? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, if it was
like scat porn the like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right, "Let's do 10 whole
pages where they clean it up." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, no, no let's not do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - The aftermath. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - They're just like,
get the cling film bags. </connor>
<connor> Get the bleach, we'll clean this place. </connor>
<connor> No, I don't wanna see this shit. </connor>
<connor> This felt totally unnecessary.
Why was this in the story? </connor>
<joey> Like you felt like you had to wrap it up? </joey>
<joey> How does this wrap it up in any way? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Well to be honest,
- You're making more problems. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be honest, like right
before that whole thing happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, right before
that whole thing ended, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head, I was like, "How
are they gonna end this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then...
- They do that! </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - And then that happened. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, "Well, I mean,
that's an ending, I guess." </joey>
<joey> That's not the correct answer, but. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, the ending was a bit weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Only that was a bit weird? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I mean like, the reason
I really like this doujin </garnt>
<garnt> was 'cause like the first two chapters, </garnt>
<connor> like when it started getting
a bit NTR-y I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Ah, you're kind of losing me here." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - They had us in the first half. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah they got us in the first half. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - It was because to me, </connor>
<connor> the first half was so fucking well done </connor>
<connor> that I'm just like, okay, I'm
always gonna remember this. </connor>
<connor> - The art was very good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean the art was good. </joey>
<garnt> To me it was the story that was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Art was good and the
way that they broke down </garnt>
<joey> the lore was really good. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it's so fucking rare
for me to find like, hentai </garnt>
<garnt> and doujinshi that I actually
give a shit about the story. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like most like, when
you think of like, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> most brother-sister, hentai,
it's the most like simple shit. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the sister
comes in, wakes up brother. </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, no, you're hard, I
guess I'll suck you off now." </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, like that's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Doujin over. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's exactly, I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> - That's literally every incest. </joey>
<joey> - Who gives a shit about that? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, cool. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, no, I've got a perfect thing. </joey>
<connor> I need spice with my hentai, okay? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing)
Surprise, surprise. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Incest.
- Surprise, surprise. </garnt>
<connor> - Incest is not spice.
Incest has never been spicy. </connor>
<garnt> It's illegal. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that's why it's
always fucking step-siblings </garnt>
<garnt> in Hentai, right? </garnt>
<joey> They never go the full fuck. </joey>
<joey> They never do the full monty, right? </joey>
<joey> Step-siblings, step-mother.
- You'd be surprised. </joey>
<garnt> You'd be surprised. </garnt>
<connor> - That not the shit I watch. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Joey's like, "I can name a few." </connor>
<joey> - I can name like, 10
off the top of my head. </joey>
<joey> - I'll tell you what, the
reason every hentai does it </joey>
<joey> is because it's like that disclaimer, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> that goes on like the beginning
of every YouTube video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like "This YouTube
video is fair use." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughs)
This video is protected </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> under fair use. These
siblings are not for, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Your Honor, these siblings
are simply step-siblings. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> It is not illegal. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're not blood related,
they are just drawings. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just in case you didn't
hear me the first time, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> this episode is sponsored by GamerSupps. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you buy anything yet? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why didn't you buying anything yet? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> But after you've bought your GamerSupps </connor>
<connor> which you've already
done because you watched </connor>
<connor> the first promotion and
already bought them. </connor>
<connor> That's right, yes you did. </connor>
<connor> But once it arrives at your door, </connor>
<connor> you'll notice that GamerSupps
is not chalky at all. </connor>
<joey> - And there's no chemical
aftertaste, did you know that? </joey>
<joey> You should, because you've
already bought GamerSupps. </joey>
<garnt> - You need GamerSupps. </garnt>
<connor> Get this shit into me! </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - GamerSupps is zero calories, zero carbs </joey>
<joey> and is non-glycemic, so it
doesn't touch your blood sugar, </joey>
<joey> making it diabetic and keto friendly. </joey>
<joey> No bullshit, just 100
milligrams of organic caffeine </joey>
<joey> from green coffee beans
and essential vitamins </joey>
<joey> to keep me focused
throughout my gaming period. </joey>
<connor> - God, I'm gaming so much right now. </connor>
<connor> Guys I have a recommendation. </connor>
<connor> Might I recommend the
newest flavor, Waifu candy </connor>
<connor> in my favorite new Waifu cup. </connor>
<garnt> - GamerSupps Waifu cups
for the perfect marriage </garnt>
<garnt> between weebs and gamers. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a terrible slogan,
we're not using that. </connor>
<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I am just playing devil's advocate </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's very easy
to make someone who says </connor>
<connor> "I like incest" look
bad, so it's very fun. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't know
why it's so surprising </garnt>
<garnt> when you're talking about, </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt "I love domestic
girlfriend" Gigguk, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - The man knows his tastes,
man. What can I say? </connor>
<connor> - I know my tastes. Okay, so. </connor>
<connor> - I respect that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because to me, like I said, </connor>
<connor> breaking taboo, that is my taste. </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately, it's so fucking
hard because 99% of hentai, </connor>
<joey> when it comes to like breaking taboo, </joey>
<garnt> are just like the most
depraved NTR shit you can find </garnt>
<joey> on like, God's green Earth.
- Why's that shit so nasty? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, I don't know.
- Why is there so much of it? </garnt>
<joey> - So many people are into it, man. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you know, you go
onto the hentai releases. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> And nowadays it's like 60 to
70% of it is just NTR garbage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - It's like, I can't nut to this. </connor>
<joey> Who's nutting to this? </joey>
<garnt> - The majority of Japan is
nutting to it, apparently. </garnt>
<garnt> - All I wanna fucking see is two people </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> who know they shouldn't be
together, but just, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like one fucking. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Cheeky little rule break. </connor>
<connor> - Having like a cheeky Nando's, </connor>
<connor> you know, have a cheeky little
blow job here and there, </connor>
<connor> you know, fucking have one or
two hot nights and then just. </connor>
<connor> - Mom doesn't need to know. </connor>
<connor> - And then just call it a day. </connor>
<garnt> Unfortunately, hentai takes this as </garnt>
<garnt> "Let's rip someone's life
into pieces while we do this." </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I wasn't
fond of with this one. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like, "I'm just gonna tell Mom." </garnt>
<connor> That part really fucked me up. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, "Why would you do that?" </garnt>
<garnt> - The part that made least
sense to me was just like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> Kirino is just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I've left now, I fixed their marriage." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, "In what way have you fixed </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> their fucking marriage?" </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - The matchmaker. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I fixed their marriage by literally </joey>
<joey> getting my brother to fuck
me all over his house. </joey>
<joey> Every part of his house. </joey>
<garnt> - We've had like a threesome </garnt>
<garnt> where we're just not gonna be
able to talk about for years. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna be able to look at my wife </garnt>
<garnt> in the eyes for like years to come, Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> Imagine if we have kids,
like what the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - I love how after that like, </joey>
<joey> fucking intense threesome
scene and like Kirino leaves, </joey>
<joey> there's just like this monologue
of Kyousuke being like, </joey>
<joey> "Manami and I talked it out,
we're mending our wounds." </joey>
<joey> I'm like,
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> "Oh it's that easy, is it?" </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> Shit, all right, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just be like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - It just be like, we just
talked it out, you know. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, "Babe, I know, I
kind of just fucked my sister </garnt>
<garnt> and fucked you at the same time, </garnt>
<joey> but I think, I think we can
work through this right?" </joey>
<joey> - Happy wife, happy life, right? </joey>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - She's like, "Yeah I'm glad. </garnt>
<connor> This is like never
happened before, right?" </connor>
<connor> Uh......
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> "Looney Toons" ending. </connor>
<connor> (Connor hums) </connor>
<joey> - "This is just a phase, right?" </joey>
<connor> Yeah, it's just a phase, yeah, totally. </connor>
<joey> - She's like, "This just
happened one time, right?" </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> The DNA test results have come in. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like, when you
see cheating in hentai, </connor>
<garnt> normally it's like the
person who's cheating </garnt>
<garnt> against this fucking faceless dude </garnt>
<garnt> that you don't see, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's like a face. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not a fan of it,
the character having </garnt>
<connor> an active part in the
story, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's the
difference between cheating </connor>
<connor> and NTR, you know? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like even fucking Kirino's
husband comes back at this, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> even though he's like a
faceless fucking guy, and just </connor>
<connor> - [Both] beats the shit out of Kyousuke. </connor>
<joey> - Like where did that come from? </joey>
<joey> - I love that. </joey>
<garnt> - And he was just like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love the ending scene too, </garnt>
<joey> because he gets absolutely
the shit kicked out of him </joey>
<joey> and Kyousuke's just like, "worth it." </joey>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - He's like, "I'm still
protecting Kirino." </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, "What is going on here?" </connor>
<connor> - How did you think that that would go? </connor>
<connor> How did you know that would go? </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, the reason this
is one of my favorite series, </garnt>
<garnt> like parody doujins of all time </garnt>
<joey> is 'cause of the first two chapters. </joey>
<joey> The first two chapters, 10 out 10 hot. </joey>
<joey> - Hot as fuck </joey>
<garnt> - That is my exact taste. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not gonna lie, one thing
that really did put me off, </connor>
<connor> I did make a note of this. </connor>
<connor> Why is she being like,
"he get me pregnant?" </connor>
<connor> but then be like, "Oh no." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> That was really fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> Can we admit that that's kind of weird? </connor>
<connor> Cheating with your stepbrother
is really pushing it </connor>
<connor> in what I can accept to be
like "Oh hehe, it's hot." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> But then being like, she's
like, "Make me pregnant." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Literally the first time
she meets and I'm like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> "What am I supposed to think?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What am I supposed to
think hearing this shit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I supposed to be like,
yeah that's hot, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Impregnate your sister, that'll show them. </connor>
<garnt> That'll show everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think this is, you saying this now, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> I think this just shows that
I've just been so desensitized. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've literally just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (overlapping chatter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I feel like
that's just the fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just the default in
a lot of hentai, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's always one panel in every hentai </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> where it's just like, "make me pregnant," </connor>
<connor> or "I'm going to become pregnant." </connor>
<connor> - I am trying to be supportive
of my friend's taste here </connor>
<connor> and I'm reading this, you know </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> and I wanna be like good
for Garnt, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then like, it's literally, again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the amount of times I'm gonna reference </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> the fucking headset meme
where he rips it off. </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to get into this </connor>
<connor> and she's like, "make me pregnant," </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Fuck, fuck. Why, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I think it's just because
sometimes your taste </garnt>
<garnt> or like my taste is like so specific </garnt>
<garnt> that it's kinda like,
I'm willing to look over </garnt>
<garnt> some of like the weirder
shit or the weirder aspects </garnt>
<garnt> of some hentai if there's
like this aspect that has done </garnt>
<garnt> like ridiculously,
ridiculously, well, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - You sound like someone
who's like desperately digging </connor>
<connor> for good hentai after you've had it all. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, "I'm missing something." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need to feel something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll forgive, I'll forgive
the weird fucking shit </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> just for a crumb of good blowjob art. </joey>
<connor> - If it scratches that one tiny itch, </connor>
<joey> that's all I need, that's all I need. </joey>
<connor> - This was fucking weird. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> I did give this one to three out of 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, there was very
few moments where I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> this is hot and there's so
many moments where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Fucking hell, fuck." </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't even smoke
and I wanted a smoke break </connor>
<garnt> after this. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is a doujin to
read and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I need a fucking smoke right now." </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't even smoke and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck, I need a cigarette." </garnt>
<garnt> Just like, fucking look out my window </garnt>
<garnt> and just be like, "Fuck." </garnt>
<connor> - The thousand yard stare. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel like that's, to me, </connor>
<connor> that's what makes a great doujin. </connor>
<joey> Like if it can fucking
affect you in some way, </joey>
<joey> then that means at least- </joey>
<joey> - If it changes your life. </joey>
<joey> - At least it's doing
something right, right? </joey>
<garnt> It's making you feel something, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My dick's so numb, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'm just waiting for something to happen. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't matter what, disgust, anything, </connor>
<joey> I'll make it work, like anything. </joey>
<joey> - My dick is numb but my heart aches. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Three out of 10. </joey>
<connor> What are you gonna give this one, Joey? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I
weirdly enjoyed this one. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, fuck yes. </connor>
<joey> Oh my god. </joey>
<connor> - This is why we need a me on this podcast </connor>
<connor> to balance out the fucking
degeneracy we have over here. </connor>
<garnt> - This is how I know Joey is a brother. </garnt>
<joey> - I weirdly enjoyed this. </joey>
<joey> I give this that's probably
seven or an eight, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Goddamn it.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Story's spicy, man. </joey>
<garnt> It's a spicy ass story. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, this is not spice. </garnt>
<connor> Literally, the word
spice went out the window </connor>
<garnt> when he told her fucking mom. </garnt>
<garnt> That was when I was like,
"This is not spicy." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like the last fucking panel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You should've already nutted by then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't give a shit about. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I don't wanna- </garnt>
<connor> - He told his mom. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I don't wanna get post nut clarity </connor>
<connor> and then also find out
afterwards he told the mom </connor>
<connor> and it's like the biggest
whiplash of post nut clarity. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd be like, "Oh God, oh, Jesus." </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - That's not spice. </joey>
<joey> That's like a Carolina Reaper to the eye. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God, Garnt what would you
rate this one out of 10 then </joey>
<joey> for you personally? </joey>
<connor> - Nine. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - The good parts were so
good that I'm just like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> to me, it's the most like
the most unique, dope, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like parody doujin I've read so far </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of building on
a premise and being able </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> to like take this premise in an anime </garnt>
<garnt> and just make a hot situation out of this. </garnt>
<joey> - The dildo burn did it for me. </joey>
<garnt> Like that was hilarious.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That was fucking hilarious. </joey>
<connor> - I respectfully disagree. </connor>
<garnt> - All right.
- Moving on. </garnt>
<garnt> - The next one was "Pisu Hame." </garnt>
<connor> What does that mean in
Japanese, "Pisu Hame?" </connor>
<joey> - Hame means to fuck and Pisu is peace. </joey>
<joey> - Peace fuck? </joey>
<connor> - Peace fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Fair enough. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So the premise of this
one was a strange one. </joey>
<connor> There was like, I guess. </connor>
<joey> - Whose do you think it is, first of all? </joey>
<connor> - Yours.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I thought it was yours. </joey>
<joey> This seemed very much like a you thing. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I also really, really
liked the plot to this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really enjoyed the plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love this plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's a very good plot. </garnt>
<garnt> - The plot was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, first of all, I did read, </garnt>
<connor> I was very, very confused because it came </connor>
<connor> with like a prequel. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's like the
YouTube hook, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Where you have like a few
pages to hook in the reader. </garnt>
<connor> - Where it was just like a bunch of girls </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> who had been taking
photos of who were naked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was very confused. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then when I started reading it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I almost forgot for a second
that I was reading a doujin </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I thought I was about
to get some kind of sick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking epic doujin about Kendo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kendo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kendo fighting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It very quickly became not that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just for a second, I totally forgot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I was reading porn and that I was- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just was like a regular manga? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I totally escaped into a regular manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You have this little, the
chad woman who is this amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Kendo player, very
attractive, very beautiful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And like the simp guy,
who's like this very tiny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> very wimpy looking character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then for some reason
during the story, she's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh please, can you
help me with something?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And obviously the wimpy character's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yes, of course I'll help you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they go to the office
and there's the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who's in charge of the Kendo club </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's engaged to the hot girl. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To the girl, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is he a student? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if that's clear.
- Yeah, he's a student. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - But he's literally built
like a motherfucking whale </connor>
<connor> on steroids, like this man is absolute. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's like nine feet tall. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - That's generous, he's
like 15 feet tall, muscular. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's like, "This is my fiancee. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> By the way, I need you to
take photos of all the women </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> at the school." </joey>
<joey> - All the graduates, right? </joey>
<joey> - All the graduates, naked,
lewd, being fucked, anything. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there's just
so many quotes in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just very funny to me 'cause, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> and then he's like, "Oh, is that a..." </connor>
<connor> The little wimpy character's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, is it okay that we take
sexual photos of the girls?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Oh yes, all
the girls have given </connor>
<connor> their consent to this." </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Literally the X to doubt, X to doubt. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Yeah, because of the
long standing tradition </connor>
<joey> in the school, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's a long standing tradition, </joey>
<connor> not like this is like
some YouTuber cancel bait. </connor>
<connor> How is this- </connor>
<garnt> - This is a tweet longer
waiting to blow up, man. </garnt>
<connor> - How does this become a long set? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna know that
backstory. Who started this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How did it everyone just come-? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - This is like CW grooming. </garnt>
<connor> - How did everyone give consent? </connor>
<garnt> I feel like this needs
to be like a signed form </garnt>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<garnt> - I agree with that, I
really want to know more </garnt>
<garnt> of the story. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> There must be an iron
clad contract to this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Release waivers out the ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You sign by blood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There were so many funny- </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> "They have given their okay to
this," that's what they say. </connor>
<garnt> - What I appreciate about this doujin </garnt>
<garnt> is that I always appreciate
a doujin when it takes </garnt>
<garnt> more than 20 pages to get
to the fucking, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I appreciate that a lot about this. </connor>
<connor> I literally experienced two
hours of just the worst shit. </connor>
<garnt> I've read the Oreimo one before this, </garnt>
<connor> I was begging for something
that wasn't fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> So this was a breath of fresh air. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the difference
between a parody doujin </connor>
<connor> and an actual doujin
is that parody doujins, </connor>
<connor> if you're a fan of the show
- [Connor] You skip the plot. </connor>
<connor> - or the series, you can skip the context </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you know the context, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can build on top of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like the real challenge
with just a plain doujin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that-
- Original stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Original you know, original
tankoban or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is that they need to
build up your investment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into the story by itself
with no pre-investment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to any franchise or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And normally that takes a long time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I can appreciate it.
It went like 40 pages, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it went like a whole chapter, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Almost, yeah.
- With no fucking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just like </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> (Garnt clapping)
respect, respect. </garnt>
<garnt> - Restraint, I appreciate it. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - One thing I really liked
about this one is that like </garnt>
<garnt> the whole, I guess point is that like, </garnt>
<connor> obviously he's gonna fuck the main girl, </connor>
<connor> but they hold off on
it for so goddamn long. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I appreciate that. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, so did you read this whole thing? </connor>
<joey> - No, I read about nearly two stories. </joey>
<joey> - Two chapters. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's the first
chapter was like 150 pages. </joey>
<connor> - No, it wasn't. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like six parts to this. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you're thinking of the 500 page one, </garnt>
<garnt> those are 16 chapters put together. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, when I looked in the
websites, it's six stories </connor>
<joey> or whatever.
- [Garnt] Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - So, I mean, I read up until like- </joey>
<joey> - How many pages?
- Which girl did you get to? </joey>
<garnt> Which one was the last one? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think he actually fucked the girl. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, you got further than me then. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is like, I think
it's like 200 pages in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but then there's still
like 400 more after that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I had didn't understand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I was still like, all
right, this story is pretty hot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because the whole premise
is that he has to then go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's recruited this. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - He's doing his job.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This wimpy kid is recruited
to take all the naked </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> and lewd photos, you know,
and if he has to help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to get the photos done, he does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he just starts fucking everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As you do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I appreciate the hustle, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I was like, "You know what, good for him." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause this is, you're not. </connor>
<joey> - He was scared at first, </joey>
<joey> but then he gets more and more confident. </joey>
<connor> - You know, ticked all the boxes. </connor>
<connor> It was like consensual, attractive,
kid coming into his own. </connor>
<connor> Getting pussy. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Good for him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was rooting for him. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - It's a coming of age story. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and you know, I
thought it was very attractive </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> that she was watching the whole time, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> giving moral support.
Who doesn't want that? </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I love the scene where
she just like comes around, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> grabs his dick, and is
like, "You've got this." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - It's like IRL Twitch chat
with fucking, you know? </connor>
<connor> Its like Pog, go in! </connor>
<connor> Pog, take the photo! </connor>
<connor> (Connor exclaims in Japanese) </connor>
<joey> You know, just good fun. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, this was just good. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm surprised you liked this one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm surprised you like this one as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - This didn't seem, </joey>
<joey> okay because this one- </joey>
<connor> - I like the long game. </connor>
<joey> I liked that they were
reserved with a lot of things. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause this one is one
of my favorites doujins </joey>
<joey> of all time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The art style threw me
off a little bit and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - It's unique, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> - But then I got into it. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "You know what, I
fuck with it. I fuck with it." </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's exactly how I felt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then, you know, because
obviously you can't just have </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> the gimmick of, he goes to
take picture, he fucks them. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause that would get old. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> So then they started introducing
like these fucking battles. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I liked as well. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- When I'm just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I was like, "This is
so fucking dope that </connor>
<connor> I'm here for it." </connor>
<connor> - The betting battles right? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - So they would bet on something. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> So the first bet is that he
has to choose what he thinks </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> is her favorite volumes
of her like lewd outfits. </connor>
<joey> Am I correct?
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> So she's like a gravure model
who does like sexual stuff. </connor>
<connor> And she's like, pick two
things that I consider </connor>
<joey> my best works and he's like, easy game. </joey>
<joey> - And then if you pick
them, I'll fuck you. </joey>
<garnt> - I was already a super-fan anyway. </garnt>
<joey> - And he's like, "If
you lose, you throw out </joey>
<joey> all of your porn. If you
win, you get to fuck me." </joey>
<joey> - And he gets to fuck
her, so congratulations. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there's-
- Spoiler alert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's another one where
they did like wishbone breaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, with the grass. </joey>
<joey> That's like a really old Japanese game. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and then he wins this
20 foot Kendo man is like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> "He's so powerful, he's
won two betting games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This kid's good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "We need more photos." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He literally guessed doujins
and then played wishbone, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> a luck game, what do you- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "He might get all the photos this year," </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> implying that some of them
don't want their photos taken, </joey>
<joey> which is like, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, that's a little weird
but I'll forgive it." </joey>
<joey> But it was- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Go, go, go. </connor>
<connor> Some of the later chapters,
it does become like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I thought, you know what, fair enough. </joey>
<joey> I see the vision, I
appreciate the execution. </joey>
<connor> All around, good fun for the family. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] What I love about- </garnt>
<connor> - Cheers. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, cheers. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Cheers to that. </connor>
<garnt> - Cheers to that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cheers to consensual for
the most part, I think. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't get far enough. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sad you didn't make
it to like pretty much </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> like the finale or like the ending plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The ending, because there's like a whole, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like three chapters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sell me on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's three chapters
where the wimpy kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> the main character fights
the student council </joey>
<joey> brick shit house in a wrestling match. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I knew that they
were building up to it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's very obvious that that was gonna be </connor>
<connor> the final showdown. </connor>
<connor> - And while that's
happening, all of the girls </connor>
<joey> that he's fucked are
getting like gang banged </joey>
<joey> by the entire school. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "If you wanna stop this, </joey>
<joey> beat me in a wrestling match." </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, "what?" </joey>
<garnt> - You know like after reading
all of Joey's recommendations, </garnt>
<garnt> I like figured out Joey's tastes. </garnt>
<connor> He recommends a doujin.
If there's a panel on it </connor>
<connor> with more than like
eight tits in one panel, </connor>
<connor> that's a Joey.
- [Connor] True. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a Joey doujin. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah you're right. </connor>
<connor> - I'm mad that you're right. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - The more the merrier. </connor>
<garnt> - But like what I love about
a story in a doujin like this </garnt>
<garnt> is when like, they introduced
the one winning girl </garnt>
<garnt> at the beginning show. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean she was the hottest. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, 100%, she's the hottest. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know how like doujin
artists, they just know. </connor>
<garnt> They know I'm gonna make
this girl the hottest. </garnt>
<connor> - There's something
about a supporting girl </connor>
<connor> that you can't help but root for. </connor>
<connor> You're like, she is just helping,
she's just doing her part. </connor>
<garnt> Fuck it, literally. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's like they
must have like a talent </connor>
<joey> to be able to like, make
a girl that you know </joey>
<joey> is like just radiates
best girl energy, right? </joey>
<joey> Like they just radiate best girl energy </joey>
<joey> and everyone just unanimously
agrees that this is best girl. </joey>
<joey> And every girl is just
like the losing girl. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, Shiwasu No
Okina who's the artist, </joey>
<joey> he's like fucking amazing at that </joey>
<joey> 'cause all of these other ones, </joey>
<joey> he always introduces this
like, beginning girl. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And whether she gets
fucked in the beginning </joey>
<joey> or right at the end, she always ends up </joey>
<joey> being the best girl. </joey>
<connor> - Because throwback to the hentai episode, </connor>
<garnt> the one thing that I did
like about that one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that you picked, even though
I didn't particularly- </garnt>
<garnt> - Which one? </garnt>
<garnt> - The one that was like
the Eto era Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the one. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - I least liked the fact
that they took three episodes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to build that shit up before
they fucked, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like it when they tease you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you know, you can
go on fucking Pornhub </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can skip two minutes in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're already at the fucking meat of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like it when they make
you wait for it sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like you making me
feel like these characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are worth it, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause when they immediately
put that pants down </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> and he's fucking two other women, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "I'm not
invested. You've lost me. </connor>
<connor> It's a no from me." </connor>
<garnt> - I like being able to wait to
see the best girl, you know. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm impatient, but I'm patient. </connor>
<connor> - I'm also impatient. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I'm just like, "Let's
just skip to episode five </connor>
<connor> and let's just see, okay." </connor>
<garnt> But like, I feel like
the best times is like, </garnt>
<garnt> when you know there's a
reason to turn the next page. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a reason to like
watch the next episode. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's like "Metal Gear Solid," </garnt>
<connor> the best is yet to come. </connor>
<joey> - I don't consider the plumber
turning up a riveting story </joey>
<joey> worth me turning the fucking page. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I'm invested in
what part of the house </joey>
<connor> is he gonna fix? </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit, is it there? </connor>
<joey> Which kind of clog is it? </joey>
<joey> I'm fucking hyped to
see which kind of clog. </joey>
<joey> Is it a grease? </joey>
<joey> - I wanna see all the
size wrenches he has. </joey>
<joey> - Is it a grease clog
or a toilet paper clog? </joey>
<joey> Can't wait, you know? </joey>
<joey> I mean, I think that's the
one thing that at least </joey>
<joey> I can appreciate about the doujin, </joey>
<joey> is that you can kind of almost, </joey>
<joey> if there's a story, you can
kind of read it in your own pace </joey>
<joey> and you can get the feel
for it that you want. </joey>
<joey> I can respect that. </joey>
<connor> I wish that I could read it </connor>
<connor> and then the moment the fucking starts, </connor>
<connor> I'm like turn on the hentai version. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, this one actually
does have a hentai version. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I was about to
say this one does have </joey>
<garnt> an hentai adaptation. </garnt>
<connor> - You say that, is it bad? </connor>
<connor> It sounds bad. </connor>
<connor> - It's Queen Bee. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I'm gonna watch it. </connor>
<garnt> - All right, I'm actually
curious about your opinion. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor speaking indistinctly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm actually curious about your opinion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now that you're gonna
go from like a doujin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to an adaptation of that
doujin that you enjoyed. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Because there's another
one by Shiwasu No Okina </joey>
<joey> that I was debating on
whether to recommend </joey>
<joey> called Nudist Beach, which is- </joey>
<connor> - I love the Nudist Beach,
the hentai, it's great. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, that's the same guy. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I like that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And doujin version is
like one of my favorites </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and also Cahu's favorite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we like bonded over that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like I was like, "Do I recommend it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> But like Pisu Hame just has a better story </joey>
<joey> in my opinion. </joey>
<connor> - I like that story a lot. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, I know you love stories. </joey>
<connor> - With Nudist Beach, when
I watched that originally, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "You know what?" </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> You know when you watch
something and you just know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is popular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just watching, I'm
like, I know this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know anything about
hentai or doujin community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what the fuck they get up to. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> But I watched that and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I bet this is famous as fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> Just from watching this I'm
like, "This shit is too good." </garnt>
<connor> - Who adapted Nudist Beach again? </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - No, it wasn't, it was
good adaption though. </connor>
<connor> - Was it? </connor>
<connor> I thought it was Queen Bee. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I swear, I watched
that and it was good. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think it was Queen Bee. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<garnt> - I swear it was a good
adaptation, I swear it was. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Let's see. Let's see. </garnt>
<joey> - But I gave this one. </joey>
<connor> What did I give this one? </connor>
<connor> I gave this one a nine out of 10. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - Genuinely, I dig the story. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, that's really surprised me, </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you would hate this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Cheers to that. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cheers to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Cheers, cheers to that. </joey>
<connor> - Look at us, look at us, look at us. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Recommending each other porn. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - We are two for four, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Two for four. </joey>
<connor> - Two for four right now. </connor>
<joey> - We're slowly converting him.
We're slowly converting him. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I'm not gonna say I'm
gonna go home and read this shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or it's my preferred. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - But if you're gonna
sit here and force me </connor>
<garnt> to read this shit, I'll sit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, here's a question then. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you had just experienced
this through the hentai, </garnt>
<garnt> would you have watched through the story? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, for sure, for sure. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Really? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, most hentai,
I watch their story. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Really? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's like 19
minutes, it's not a big ask. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the most
un-Connor thing I've heard </garnt>
<garnt> in the history of this podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, do you know when you, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if you do this, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I gotta ask. </garnt>
<garnt> When you're doing your
business or something. </garnt>
<connor> If you finish your business </connor>
<connor> and there's like six minutes
left, do you just save it </connor>
<garnt> for another time, the rest six minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> or do you just keep watching
and see what else happens? </garnt>
<garnt> - Save it.
- I save it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, me too, me too. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - My man. </connor>
<connor> - My man. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, this was so good </connor>
<connor> that I don't wanna spoil the rest. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Goddamn Connor, I've
never connected to you </connor>
<connor> on such like a spiritual level before </connor>
<connor> until you just said that moment. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - It takes restraint, but
I'm like, "You know what, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could skip ahead and find
the best part, but no." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, this is fresh
content for next time. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Connor, I agree. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit, Garnt agrees with me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you don't wanna spoil. </connor>
<connor> You get so limited. </connor>
<connor> You know, I've realized with
hentai, it is literally like, </connor>
<connor> you know, it's like mining
for diamonds in Minecraft, </connor>
<connor> you just don't get it. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I'm saying,
that's what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> - You don't get the good shit. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like when you find a good shit. </garnt>
<garnt> When you find one of the good shit, </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta save that shit, man. </garnt>
<connor> - There's like 10 hentai
that I can probably, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I can be like, you know what,
these are probably my favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I can revisit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like they never come around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause we have so much goddamn NTR. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fucking, it's awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And the moment we don't get
NTR, as much as you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can work with Queen
Bee, but I don't like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where every single non-NTR is Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, honestly.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is happening here, can
we not do this for 10 seconds? </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - 'Cause just imagine me when I go onto </joey>
<joey> just like regular hentai website. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> And I see Pisu Hame
episode one, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "My time has come. My favorite hentai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has finally been adapted." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When did they come out,
when did they come out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The doujin or the hentai? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - The hentai. </garnt>
<garnt> - A couple years ago. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was quite old.
- It's quite recent. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I wonder I'm like,
is Japan just ahead on porn? </connor>
<joey> Like, are they speed running it? </joey>
<joey> It is this where all porn is gonna go to </joey>
<joey> where everyone in the
world is gonna be NTR fans? </joey>
<joey> - God, I don't know, I
really fucking hope not. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I feel like they're
like five stages ahead </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> of like fucked up shit
than the rest of the world. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean it's because
of Japan just accepts </garnt>
<connor> any kind of fucked up hentai, right? </connor>
<connor> - Is this where the
world is going towards? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Are we just all gonna be NTR fans? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Are we just all gonna
be NTR fans in 20 years? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's the thing, there's
obviously someone out there </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> watching NTR. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of people. </connor>
<connor> - [All] A lot of people. </connor>
<garnt> - I actually know someone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sydney. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, there you go, point taken. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - You see the thing is that it is like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally just
proved your own point. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - NTR sometimes is attractive. </connor>
<garnt> You know, I will admit
there are one or two </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm like, you know what, they had me </garnt>
<garnt> in the first half. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's not all bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which ones? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - But, I can't off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There've been one or two
where I'm like, you know what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is good" but then
I'm like, "Ah, it's NTR. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Not gonna do it, not gonna do it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I'm like, you know
what, like does vanilla </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really have to die? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I feel like vanilla </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the minority of hentai that we get now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very rare where you just get a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they like each other, there's no cheating, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> there's no sibling rivalry. </connor>
<joey> Oh my God, what? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's because in the context </joey>
<connor> - I do that.
- of Japanese. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I think it's because in the
context of Japanese audiences </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> to read it, it's like,
"Why would I read this </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> when I could just have it myself?" </joey>
<joey> - 'X' to doubt on that one. </joey>
<garnt> - But like with your
vanilla thing, do you count, </garnt>
<garnt> for example, step siblings
or step parents, step mother, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever if there's no other
complications other than them, </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason just being
step siblings or stepmother. </garnt>
<connor> Is that vanilla to you? </connor>
<garnt> - I'd say yeah, probably. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, I mean-
- That's pretty vanilla, </connor>
<connor> I mean that's probably the most vanilla </connor>
<garnt> you can get nowadays. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean-
- Or like childhood friend </garnt>
<connor> or something, right? </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing is, it's
it makes it even rarer, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, literally, you
go on any porn website now, </garnt>
<garnt> but is literally all step-mom everything. </garnt>
<joey> Everything is step. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you sure, or is that
just the shit you look up? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - No, no, no, I kid you
not, you go on this shit </connor>
<connor> and all the most viewed
shit, it's all step mom. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "What is happening?" </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> (overlapping chatter) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm here for it, but like
when did this happen? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I don't know when it happened, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You see it too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Meilyne, can you search up some </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> of the most searched terms on Pornhub? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, 'cause I guarantee,
I think step-mom's. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> (Meilyne speaks indistinctly)
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Okay, Ashley, Ashley, Ashley, you do it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Ashley do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> Like I think it's either
top three or top five, </garnt>
<garnt> because step-mom is up there. </garnt>
<connor> - What happened? </connor>
<connor> Because I swear like five, six years ago, </connor>
<connor> lesbian porn was always number one. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yes. </connor>
<connor> - It was never dethroned,
and then all of a sudden </connor>
<connor> out of nowhere in like
the space of two years, </connor>
<connor> all the fucked up shit goes to the top. </connor>
<connor> What happened in those two? </connor>
<connor> Is this coronavirus where people are like, </connor>
<joey> "I guess NTR is pretty good, huh?" </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm looking up the most
popular tags for doujins </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> right now and would you believe that milf </connor>
<connor> is in the top 20? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I hope so, I hope so. </connor>
<connor> - But do you know what's
directly on top of that? </connor>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<connor> - Incest. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's concerning. </connor>
<connor> No, this is not a celebratory moment. </connor>
<garnt> - I will take my crown right now. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, but then you know what? </joey>
<connor> - Fellow degenerates rise up. </connor>
<garnt> Degenerates rise up. </garnt>
<joey> - Man, there are some like, </joey>
<joey> oh my God, number 10 is shotacon. </joey>
<garnt> - Ashley, you're literally
looking on Pornhub? </garnt>
<connor> Just search top.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- Just search top </connor>
<joey> Pornhub searches.
- You don't gotta open up </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Pornhub.
- Your boss is sitting </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> right next to you and you're on Pornhub. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] For the record,
she told me to do it. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Meilyne, Meilyne what are you doing? </garnt>
<garnt> Stop corrupting Ashley like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Wait, what if
the most searched terms </garnt>
<connor> are like in the top- </connor>
<connor> - It's literally, they do a survey. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they do a survey.
- They do a survey. </connor>
<garnt> - They literally do a survey and like a- </garnt>
<connor> - Speaking of shotacon, should
we get onto the next one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, sure, let's go on to the next one. </connor>
<garnt> - Seikatsu Shuukan. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, wait, wait. </joey>
<connor> - [Ashley] Do you wanna know that 2019, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> number one was amateur,
number two was alien. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Those were the search terms. </connor>
<connor> Search terms, search terms. </connor>
<connor> There, there. That's
what you're going for. </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] Search terms, Japanese. </connor>
<garnt> - Hey!
- Japanese number one? </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Number two is
hentai, number three is lesbian. </joey>
<joey> Number four is milf. </joey>
<garnt> - Hentai is above lesbian now? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<connor> What's number five? </connor>
<connor> - That's like, although- </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] Number five is... </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Milf. </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] Korean.
- [Meilyne] Oh, it's Korean. </connor>
<connor> - I swear it's like nearly
like, you go on these websites, </connor>
<connor> it is like Russia driving
half of this shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Where's stepmom? </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Seven. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Stepmom and milf though. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> Stepmom and milf are
normally very like closely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But also if you look at it,
the amount of people in Russia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that watch hentai is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Hentai is massive
in Russia, it's insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck, I need to move to Russia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Putin's like put "Mother Knows
Best" on my 90 inch OLED TV </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> while I jerk off on my
Italian leather couch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or my polar bear rug. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, the next one
is "Seikatsu Shuukan." </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm near certain Garnt
recommended this one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing)
- Are you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not gonna lie, I'ma
say it right now, boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - I liked the hentai version to this one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the hentai version
is fucking ridiculous, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because, dude, you
can't, the animation alone. </joey>
<joey> If you-
- God tier. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] In the hentai version of this </joey>
<joey> it is so goddamn good.
- [Joey] God tier. </joey>
<joey> - And I was so confused
when I opened this doujin </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was like, what is
this story in the start? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the shit story.
Get to the story I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, the good one.
- The good story. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause the first story is just like. </joey>
<joey> - So, this is like a
collection of stories. </joey>
<joey> - Is it two stories? </joey>
<joey> - It's like two or three stories in there. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, so there's two stories in this. </connor>
<connor> It's "Seikatsu Shuukan" and I think it's, </connor>
<connor> so the first part is like a teacher </connor>
<connor> who fucks their student
story and like this teacher </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> is not very charismatic,
very creepy, very rapey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, you get interested this girl </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and she's a little concerned, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She's like, "Why are all
the guys looking at my big, </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> you know, big-" </garnt>
<garnt> - Big badonkas.
- Badonkas. </garnt>
<joey> - And this teacher's like,
"Oh, don't worry about it. </joey>
<joey> I'll help you, I'll help
you get used to them </joey>
<joey> because if you don't
care about it anymore, </joey>
<joey> no one's gonna look at them" and I'm like. </joey>
<connor> - Genius logic. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, "Ah, okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so he's like, "Oh yeah,
just take your bra off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of me so you can get more used </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to showing them off." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Oh God, all
right, it's one of these." </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> 'Cause it's just like,
it's really rapey and like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you did recommend, </joey>
<joey> the next one we'll talk about is Tujuan. </joey>
<joey> I think that's done much more tastefully </joey>
<joey> than this Wan Shou. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not a fan of this Wan Shou at all. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the Wan Shou I didn't
really want you to care about. </joey>
<joey> - But the Wan Shou was like
a 100 pages long though. </joey>
<connor> - It was long, because it's like, </connor>
<connor> and this is the thing
that I hate about hentai </connor>
<connor> but this happens all the goddamn time. </connor>
<connor> Let me see it. </connor>
<connor> So one trope that I really
am not fond of in hentai </connor>
<connor> is where the girl is like,
"No, oh my God, please don't." </connor>
<connor> And they're clearly being
sexually assaulted really. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then suddenly, they start
doing it and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh wait, I like this now." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "I don't
think that's how it works." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why haven't you bought GamerSupps yet? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> What is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you not know that this episode </garnt>
<joey> was sponsored by GamerSupps? </joey>
<joey> - We've said it three times now </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> and you haven't bought GamerSupps yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - The coupon code is
TRASHTASTE, what are you doing? </garnt>
<garnt> - We're not wearing
the shirts for nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fool me once, shame on me. </garnt>
<garnt> Fool me twice, shame on you. </garnt>
<garnt> Fool me three times, I don't
even know who to blame anymore. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> Did we not convinced you enough? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are we not gamer enough for you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you not tried their
newest flavor, Waifu candy? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> It's delicious, what's
wrong with you guys? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, come on, look at these Waifus. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at all these beautiful Waifus </garnt>
<garnt> that you can choose from to
get your gamer juice from. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on gamers! </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Meilyne] And they have free samples. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - They have free samples.
- They have free samples. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Thanks Meilyne.
- Thank you. </connor>
<connor> - Guys, I know you haven't
clicked the link yet </connor>
<connor> and that's fine, it's fine. </connor>
<connor> No, I'm not angry, I'm not angry </connor>
<connor> but maybe this will entice you. </connor>
<connor> Joey, tell them what it is. </connor>
<joey> - Okay.
(all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Did you know the first 5,000
people to click the link, </joey>
<joey> add the samples to their cart,
and checkout with code "Free" </joey>
<joey> will get free samples
delivered to them, no bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - That is the last chance. </connor>
<connor> This is your last chance,
I'm telling you, now. </connor>
<connor> - What am I, your mom? </connor>
<connor> Go buy GamerSupps. </connor>
<garnt> - Your mum would love these cups. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> They're great.
- I'm not angry, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just disappointed if you
don't click the link right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - Click the link in
description down below. </garnt>
<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<connor> - Generally, did not
enjoy this teacher fellow. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought he was a little bit rapey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Little unpleasant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And like I said in the hentai episode, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not really fond of that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> To me, it's just like, "Aah, oh, okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna teach you </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> how to be more comfortable
with your boobs." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Are you really? </connor>
<garnt> Are you sure about that?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you say like the name of the doujin, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I'll tell you
the name of the doujin </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is "Abstinence Club," at least
the first story arc, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is, it's obviously
nothing about abstinence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs)
I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's no abstinence to be found here. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - It's quite the opposite. </joey>
<garnt> - These are not good Christian girls, </garnt>
<garnt> that's not what we're talking about here. </garnt>
<connor> - And there's two things that personally, </connor>
<connor> I'm not really fond of or
I'm like, "Oh, whatever" </connor>
<connor> that come up in this doujin. </connor>
<connor> First one being that apparently
dick can just convert </connor>
<connor> your feelings entirely
and that you can just </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly love it once it's inside of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> I'm like, "Pretty sure that's
not how it works, whatever." </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's gotta be pretty fucking
good dick for you to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - You'd be surprised about how many times </joey>
<joey> that crops up in hentai. </joey>
<connor> - It's literally every
single fucking hentai. </connor>
<joey> - I know, where it's just
like, "Aha, you don't want it? </joey>
<joey> Well, you obviously haven't
had the giga-chad dick yet, </joey>
<connor> let me introduce you." </connor>
<garnt> - Say that after you feel my dick. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so fucking dumb, I hate it so much. </garnt>
<garnt> And then also they have
that whole fucking trope of, </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason, this happens
a lot in hentai as well </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> where the girl is having
sex with the teacher </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because of course she is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And outside, there's
another student who happens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to catch wind of this going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And naturally, instead of
being like, "Oh God, oh my God" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and running away and telling friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> she's like, "I think I
should start nutting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I should start
masturbating right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right now outside." </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - It's the optimal time to nut. </joey>
<joey> - Either winter or summer in Japan, </joey>
<joey> which are both wildly
uncomfortable seasons </joey>
<joey> to be doing this outside, by the way. </joey>
<connor> So this is just a terrible
experience overall </connor>
<connor> and I did not enjoy
this first story at all, </connor>
<connor> I thought was shit. </connor>
<connor> And I was really confused, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, I really liked the
anime version of this, </connor>
<connor> I thought it was really hot." </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't even remember that
this had an anime adaptation </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like I had to like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'd remember if you'd seen it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, exactly 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "This name kind of rings a bell." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, same, same, same. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - So I look at the anime and
than I look at the doujin </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, "These
aren't the same fucking story." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hold up a minute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I literally thought
I had made a mistake, </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> and I'm like, I was just like- </garnt>
<joey> - They adapted the better
half into an anime. </joey>
<joey> - Smart man, smart man. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Thankfully. Thankfully. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the first half is
every other fucking doujin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that exists and every hentai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "All right,
whatever, the fucking teacher </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> abused his power, yada, yada,
yada, whatever. Whatever." </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - We'll get to it. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, let's let's get to
the part you wanna talk about. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, you know-
- Let's get to the good part. </garnt>
<connor> - The anime adaptation
of this one, I have seen. </connor>
<connor> I enjoy it thoroughly. I think it's great. </connor>
<garnt> The animation, very good. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> Because the boy isn't actually a shotacon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> makes it in my head, I'm like, free pass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like it's free real estate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because he transforms
temporarily, so it's- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - I'm willing to bend the rules. </connor>
<garnt> - This is like if I
close my eyes and forget </garnt>
<connor> it's Connor's voice
coming out, I'm just like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, is Joey fucking talking right now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like a me argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Are you okay with shotacons, Connor? </connor>
<garnt> Is that what you're saying? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I have watched, I don't
know what the other famous one </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> is that always comes up
with like the big, big milfs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the tiny, tiny kids that I do not. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - The Yokai one?
- I fucking hate that one. </joey>
<joey> That one is fucking disgusting. </joey>
<joey> And I accidentally watched it
and I thought, "Oh God, oh!" </joey>
<joey> You know what I'm on about, </joey>
<joey> if you've seen it, it's
this vile shotacon. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the eight foot milf right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's fucking disgusting. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like fucking
watching "Attack on Titan," </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, POV: the fucking
colossal titan fucks you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I don't wanna
watch this, I don't want this. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I was just like, this
doujin disappointed me </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> so fucking much, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> And the hentai also disappoints me </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you know why? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know what the worst, </garnt>
<garnt> you know the only thing
worse thing than a loli? </garnt>
<garnt> A shotacon. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree though. I agree. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the thing, with loli- </garnt>
<connor> - They're equal in my hate. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like, no, no,
they're not equal to me </connor>
<connor> 'cause with loli hentai, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I was never gonna jack off
to you anyway. It's whatever. </connor>
<connor> I can just skip over this." </connor>
<connor> The one reason why it's so fucking hard </connor>
<joey> to find milf hentai is because
90% of them are shotacon. </joey>
<joey> And the thing is, most of them
have like the fucking hottest </joey>
<joey> milf, like perfectly crafted
milf from God, right? </joey>
<joey> - Perfectly crafted milf. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think there's that many. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I think you're over
exaggerating a little bit. </connor>
<garnt> - That's what it feels like to me. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a fair few, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, "All right,
I'm in this, I'm invested. </connor>
<garnt> I'm ready for this hentai." </garnt>
<garnt> And then the fucking shota
comes out and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You were this close to
greatness, we had it! </garnt>
<connor> And then you lost it!" </connor>
<garnt> - They had us in the first half. </garnt>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You know, I can
understand the frustration. </connor>
<connor> But I think this is an exception. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - You know, if I had read
the doujin and thought, </connor>
<connor> "So what, so what?" </connor>
<joey> Another like B-tier. </joey>
<joey> But you watch the anime
version, you're like, </joey>
<joey> "This has a place." </joey>
<joey> - S-tier.
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, "Okay, now we're
talking, now we're talking." </connor>
<joey> - This is such a one, like,
this is such a Shyamalan twist </joey>
<garnt> for me 'cause I thought you
were gonna hate this one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now, how can I- </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought you were gonna hate this one. </garnt>
<joey> - How? </joey>
<joey> When you watch the animation
of this one, how can- </joey>
<joey> - Because it has a loli and a shota in it. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, the loli one, I
thought it was, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I really liked the redhead girl. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the redhead girl's hot. </joey>
<joey> - Red headed girl. </joey>
<joey> - I was just like, red
headed girl is fucking hot. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shota, why, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like if you have
the fucking Mona Lisa </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> and you just decide to
fucking piss on it, you know? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you ever see something
that happens in porn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it like hits something
where you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> "Oh, I didn't know I was into
that, but that's very nice." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I
like, search for everyday. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Try to fill that craving every day. </joey>
<joey> - There was a scene in it
where she like gives a hand job </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> at the dinner table and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why that was very
attractive, but I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, I'm into that.
- The redhead girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm into that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "You've
sold me, I wanna invest. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> How do I invest in this? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Put my money in the stocks." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Stonks.
- Put my money in this stock. </connor>
<connor> - To the moon.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Like that kind of shit,
I'm like, "I'm here for it." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, I know it's
terrible, just like my body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My mind's telling me no, but my body, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, literally that. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> It's like, I know this is fucked </joey>
<joey> and I'm always very, very hard on you guys </joey>
<joey> for this kind of shit. </joey>
<joey> So I feel like it's very critical of me. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I'm
just happy we found out </joey>
<joey> that you have a new favorite fetish, </joey>
<joey> which is cheeky hand job under the table. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, cheeky hand
job at the family table. </connor>
<connor> What's a better genre? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I like danger in mine. </connor>
<joey> - You like a bit of spice, would you say? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, I like danger, not spice. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want Garnt's spice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want Garnt's
spice anywhere near me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's me, that's me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like danger. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I like the fact that anyone could walk in, </connor>
<connor> I like that kind of shit. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </connor>
<garnt> - I like that kind of stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - He likes having a danger
wank, that's what he does. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Danger wank. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not out here in the
fucking, the taxi wanking. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'm not saying that, but a
little bit of, not spice, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> a little bit of danger, I didn't say it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A little bit of danger adds
a little something to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Danger Wank" is gonna be my next album. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But also every single, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again, like my love for like
this thing is purely based </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> on the art. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not even a doujin
thing at this point. </garnt>
<connor> The doujin was mid when I was reading it. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, okay, so review it. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause you are talking
about the animation, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause the animation is so goddamn good. </garnt>
<garnt> Pink pineapple like, "finna
bring my A game to this one" </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason. </garnt>
<connor> - I completely agree, watching
the animation of this, </connor>
<connor> the animation for hentai
standards is fucking godly. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - What happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to know what happened.
Why is this so good? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - This is also like a fuck,
I'm surprised that no one </connor>
<garnt> recommended this on our
hentai episode, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's just that famous. </garnt>
<joey> - I was going to, but then
I thought he would hate it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I like this one, I like this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> "I don't know if Connor's
into shota or not." </joey>
<joey> - No, I'm not, most of
it I absolutely despise. </joey>
<joey> This is probably the only one
where I'm like, "that's hot." </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this is the only one
I've ever seen that I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I think this is good." </connor>
<connor> - That's really surprising. </connor>
<joey> I'm learning a lot
about you today, Connor. </joey>
<connor> - What can I say? </connor>
<connor> I'm willing to bend my morals. </connor>
<joey> - All right, so just purely
just based on the doujin, </joey>
<joey> out of 10. </joey>
<joey> - Like a six, five.
- Six. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like the first story
really ruined it for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The first story was so basic,
so bland, so insulting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> None of the characters were hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> The teacher was fucking, just
not even remotely attractive. </connor>
<connor> I was not into the
teacher character at all. </connor>
<connor> And we'll get into the
next teacher character. </connor>
<garnt> - What I'm getting out of this is like, </garnt>
<garnt> what if like fucking Ufotable animated </garnt>
<connor> some loli hentai? </connor>
<garnt> Would Connor enjoy it because
the animation's that good? </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Listen, in the other
episode, I was saying </garnt>
<connor> I like my hentai animation
bad because sometimes </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I should- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, you did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I completely forgot about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because sometimes I feel
like it serves the story better </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> to have like bad
animation 'cause sometimes </connor>
<connor> the fucking isn't that great and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "You know, that's fine." </joey>
<joey> - We are talking to the one
and only fan of Milky, right? </joey>
<connor> - But for this, this is
one of them where I'm like </connor>
<connor> the animation is so goddamn
good where it feels like </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> this is better than most anime
we've been getting recently, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, "What am I supposed to do?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> How can I hate on this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is just so goddamn good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not saying I want all
hentai to be like this </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> because God knows we'd get
50 NTRs animated like this. </connor>
<connor> And my mind can't take
that, that would be 50 NTRs. </connor>
<garnt> - Unfortunately, the NTRs are like some </garnt>
<connor> of the best animated. </connor>
<connor> - They are.
- Yeah, they are. </connor>
<garnt> - They always are. I
fucking hate it, I hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like they draw this ugly bastard </garnt>
<garnt> with the detail of a Mona Lisa. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, why would you do this? </connor>
<connor> What is wrong with you? </connor>
<connor> How is the staff okay doing this? </connor>
<connor> Like, I just don't get it, but it's fine. </connor>
<connor> - It's like they're just
playing nut chicken, right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's just like, are
you willing to nut to this? </connor>
<garnt> Are you willing to nut to this animation? </garnt>
<connor> - We can't always have a masterpiece. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> I've accepted that not
everything can be a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, literally. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> The animation, watch it, it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, this is good,
I like the animation. </garnt>
<garnt> The story was kind of
shit, but the animation </garnt>
<garnt> very much saves the story. </garnt>
<garnt> - We just reviewed the hentai
not the doujin, by the way. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - Essentially, I mean, I genuinely, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I got to the second hard, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "seen it, skipped it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I already know exactly what happens. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> I went through to make sure. </garnt>
<connor> It was like one for one the same as well. </connor>
<connor> So I was like whatever. </connor>
<garnt> - Was there a reason why
you suggested this doujin? </garnt>
<joey> - It's just the first one I
thought of when I thought like, </joey>
<joey> you know, all the girls are hot. </joey>
<joey> Like it's just an interesting premise. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Again, this is another
one where it's like, </connor>
<connor> as long as you're okay
with the whole shota thing, </connor>
<connor> it's very inoffensive. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's a very big ask. </connor>
<joey> - Just get over the shota, it's fine. </joey>
<joey> Just pretend you're the
shota, it's all right. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, is it one
of those things, like, </connor>
<connor> is it 'cause I'm a guy
where I can forgive it </connor>
<connor> a little less, is that why? </connor>
<connor> - What'd you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Like with the shota in this case, </connor>
<connor> am I making an exception 'cause I'm a guy </connor>
<connor> and I could be like, you
know, he was an adult </connor>
<connor> in the start of this thing. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but if he was like a full on kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If he was genuinely a kid,
I don't think I could enjoy. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I mean this is like a
very deep conversation </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> that I don't feel we have time
to explore on this podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] We don't, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Maybe at a later date. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe on a future podcast. </connor>
<connor> - This is definitely one of
those things where I'm like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate letting the exception like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate letting them be
like the Uno reverse card, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of save it, but
for this one, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Ah, it kind of does though for me." </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> Like he acts like an
adult, he is an adult. </joey>
<connor> All right, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> All right, I'll let it slide. </connor>
<garnt> - Like the thing that
turns me off originally </garnt>
<garnt> was that he didn't know
that he wasn't a shota. </garnt>
<garnt> The girls didn't know that
he wasn't a shota either. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did think it was weird
when I first watched it </garnt>
<garnt> and they're just suddenly
into him now that he's a kid. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause all the
girls are into shotas. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm like, there's a few
things we need to unpack here. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's kind of like when
you have the siblings fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but then they be like, but
they are step siblings. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, no, no, because there was- </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - This video is under fair
use, I'm not under copyright. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no because there was
no moment where she was like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna ruin your life,
I'm gonna impregnate you." </connor>
<connor> "Impregnate me, ruin my marriage." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> There was none of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's pretty fucking hard to deal with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want marriages being ruined </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while I'm trying to have a wank. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Like you know what I mean? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> That's not what I wanna deal with. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> Let's get on to the last one. </garnt>
<joey> Oh, the second last one. </joey>
<joey> - All right, second last one. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is "Kyoushi To Seito
To," "Teacher and Student." </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So this one's obviously
Garnt's 'cause the last one's- </joey>
<joey> - This one's mine. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I had this
down as Garnt's, actually. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, perfect. </joey>
<joey> - Which I, again, like, I'm shocked I got </joey>
<connor> some of these wrong 'cause I thought </connor>
<connor> I would get them all right. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I was shocked
you got them wrong too. </joey>
<joey> I thought it would've been fairly obvious. </joey>
<connor> - I thought it was fairly obvious. </connor>
<connor> - It was just because me
and Garnt had a conversation </connor>
<connor> the other day where Garnt
mentioned the word shota </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "This has gotta be Garnt." </connor>
<connor> - He said the word. </connor>
<connor> - He literally said he word
shota to me like a week ago, </connor>
<connor> it must be Garnt. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> He's trying to fucking inception my ass. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I mean this one was weird </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> because I thought the premise was really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quite attractive, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was quite hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then suddenly things
just started happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm like, "Ooh, ooh, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know about this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, let me explain the premise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So a teacher who works at
the school is broke, I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Very broke. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Very broke and she has a job. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Very broke. </joey>
<connor> - Full time teaching which- </connor>
<joey> - Obviously isn't paying the dough. </joey>
<connor> - Seems like everyone
else is managing fine. </connor>
<connor> So her genius solution
is to ask one of the kids </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> whose dad owns an apartment complex. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he's a rich kid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - To just stay in his house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so he says no, because
he's a very responsible </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> chad child and says no,
he says no to this woman. </connor>
<connor> No, you're my teacher, you can't stay </connor>
<connor> at my fucking apartment,
why the fuck would you? </connor>
<connor> So she turns up at his door, naturally. </connor>
<connor> - As you do. </connor>
<connor> - As you do when you've been rejected, </connor>
<connor> just fucking turn up at that door. </connor>
<connor> This is already extremely
wildly inappropriate </connor>
<connor> for HR standards and
should invite yourself in </connor>
<connor> and then she just starts living with him. </connor>
<joey> And mad props to the kid, pushes her away </joey>
<joey> and says no like 10 times. </joey>
<joey> That has to be rewarded. </joey>
<joey> Claps to you chad, king shit. </joey>
<joey> But it's a doujin, you
could only last so long. </joey>
<joey> But the fact that he
said no a bunch of times, </joey>
<joey> I respect that. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> He's respecting the HR
standards of the workplace. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> And frankly for a kid, very professional. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> I noted "I'm calling HR. How
did this woman get this job?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what I did write down
because she's essentially </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just trying to fuck this guy constantly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just wondering like,
"How did she get this job? </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> What's going on here? </connor>
<joey> What's going on here?" </joey>
<joey> - She probably did a sneaky
hand job under the table. </joey>
<joey> - Did she try to fuck the guy? </joey>
<garnt> From what I remember- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no.
- She definitely did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did she? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, she literally grabbed his dick out </garnt>
<garnt> and started sucking it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, the was the first time around. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, that was the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was the first time around. </garnt>
<garnt> - Before that, even before
she even came to his house, </garnt>
<connor> she's like, "Do you wanna touch my boobs? </connor>
<connor> I'll let you do it if I
get to stay in your house." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like- </joey>
<connor> - No, but she said like jokingly, right? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause she's like supposed
to be like ahaha, hehe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's a fucking teacher,
she can't say that shit </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> jokingly to the student. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a doujin bro.
- It's a doujin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, can I have a beer, Ashley? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, can you get me a beer as well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - From the fridge, I need
a beer for this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't talk about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Can't talk about this
shit without drinking. </connor>
<connor> Are you kidding? </connor>
<connor> We've run out of wine. </connor>
<connor> - All right, so to explain why I guess, </connor>
<connor> to give context to why I chose this, </connor>
<joey> this is one of my favorite doujin artists. </joey>
<joey> It's an artist called Fuga and I don't- </joey>
<joey> - I fucking love Fuga. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I didn't know
how well known he was, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> but this man is to me,
the king of vanilla. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like this man's like, his art is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would say like about average,
maybe bit above average. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's average. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's about average, but like
why I love his work so much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that his like stories and characters </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> are so fucking good where
there are some points </garnt>
<garnt> where I feel like I'm not
even reading a doujin, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just reading a romance
manga with sex scenes in it. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I wanna agree with
you so bad, I want to. </connor>
<connor> But there was so many
moments where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Nah, bro, this ain't it." </connor>
<connor> - Is it the incest? </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course it's incest! </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - The incest side story, right? </joey>
<connor> - So, let me explain the story
first and I'll build up to, </connor>
<connor> you're probably wondering why
is there incest in this story? </connor>
<connor> Connor didn't even mention incest. </connor>
<connor> Why is there incest in the story? </connor>
<connor> Great question, I'll answer why
there's incest in the story. </connor>
<connor> So in this story, like I said, </connor>
<connor> you know, she moves into his apartment. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> For some reason, he doesn't kick her out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or try to get his dad to kick her out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He lets her live in there
and they both explain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to each other they're frustrated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they haven't been able to jack off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they're both
always around each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so her solution is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Well great, I'll just make you nut." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> As any good teacher would, apparently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they start fucking and
then it becomes a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, it's very honestly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I will admit it's quite
attractive up to this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's done very tastefully
considering the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it would be very
illegal and very concerning </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> in real life. </garnt>
<garnt> In doujin form, very tasteful. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought it was done
really well, I was on board. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would say the reason
for that is because like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a good like 40 to 50 pages </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before there's this first sex scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like-
- It's done well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's done well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, you hear this
premise and you think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, I've seen doujins like this before, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> they fuck in like the third,
fourth page or something. </connor>
<connor> No, there is like- </connor>
<connor> - It was tasteful, it was tasteful. </connor>
<connor> - There is 40 full pages
of characterization. </connor>
<garnt> And that's the thing, that's
why I love this doujin artist </garnt>
<garnt> is because he gives a shit
about characterization. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll say that there was, </connor>
<connor> he definitely took the time and
again, like I'm saying like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, obviously in real
life, the shit is fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's doujin, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You set the kind of disbelief apart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it was done pretty well. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I'd say up to this point,
it's done really well. </connor>
<connor> What were you gonna say? </connor>
<joey> - No, I was just gonna say,
I fucking love this one. </joey>
<connor> - I don't, again, like I was honestly, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I was so into this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, this reminds me of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> an early '90s Shonen Jump rom-com. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it does, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - With like the art
and like how it's paced </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> and like the characterization. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, I fucking love this, dude. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not just here to hate, you know? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I agree, it was hot, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Up until this point, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> they're hitting every mark, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> They've done this about
as tastefully as you can. </garnt>
<garnt> A little weird at parts. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it chapter three? </garnt>
<connor> - It might've been chapter three. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So first of all, right,
we get this whole like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> when the whole reason why they fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is 'cause there's a rumor
going around the school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that she's dating a teacher
and the teacher is like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like the vice-principal, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - The vice principal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the vice principal was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, we're dating, kid. Get over it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he doesn't know they're fucking yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was like, "No, no,
no, he turned up at a hotel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he tried to come
onto me. We didn't fuck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, all right,
respect. Respect. I get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then out of nowhere
like a fucking Randy Orton </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> slithering in, his sister
comes into the play </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and is like, "By the way, I love him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna fucking him now," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they start fucking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "What is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Where did this come from? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why?" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> It's like the incest was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Allow me to introduce myself." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, why did this- </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - No, it wasn't, allow
me to introduce myself, </joey>
<garnt> it came in like the Kool-Aid man. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just like, "Bah!"
- [Connor] Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Incest! </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Like to this day- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Out of nowhere, they just
start fucking his sister </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then she leaves and it's
never brought up again. Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Well no, no, to- </garnt>
<connor> - Justify it to me. Justify the incest. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, I'm not justifying- </garnt>
<connor> - Why do you like incest so much? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I fucking hated the
incest in this one, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - My God, what the fuck was that? </garnt>
<garnt> - The reason I fucking love this one, </garnt>
<garnt> teacher, student relationship </garnt>
<garnt> done fucking tastefully as fuck. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, chapter three, like she
doesn't fuck the main guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> For some reason like,
there is just this like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of his classmates
comes in and is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I've run away from home." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - That was weird too. </garnt>
<joey> - My sister's harassing me,
all right, like that one. </joey>
<garnt> - To correct what Connor
said, the sister doesn't fuck </garnt>
<garnt> the main guy. It's just
these two side characters </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> who's the brother, sister
who just randomly fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for no fucking reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why it's there either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not the main character?
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the main character's friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It looks so much like him. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's the main character but less chad. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, like the main
character's friends shows up </garnt>
<connor> and he says, "I've run away from home." </connor>
<connor> And then he finds out. </connor>
<connor> - Your sister fucked me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, "My sister's been harassing me." </connor>
<garnt> And then so- </garnt>
<connor> - This is even more concerning </connor>
<connor> 'cause it has absolutely
nothing to do with the plot. </connor>
<garnt> - The main story, right. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what I'm saying, it's
just like a fucking T-bone. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - So his friend finds out
that the teacher and student </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are living together and he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, okay, that's fine, whatever." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the sister
comes along and was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> the sister comes to the
teacher and is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Do you know where my little brother is? </garnt>
<garnt> I heard he went to your place." </garnt>
<garnt> Or something along those lines. </garnt>
<garnt> And so the sister comes in and she's like, </garnt>
<connor> "This is mine. He is mine." </connor>
<joey> And then she- </joey>
<joey> - And she's like, "I don't
even know who he is." </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't know who you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then the little brother starts like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then she starts fucking
sucking his dick or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in front of the teacher and
the teacher's just there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She's like, "All right,
you guys, you do you." </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - The teacher's just like
fucking Mike Wazowski's face. </garnt>
<garnt> She's like-
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is why I was like,
"What the fuck was that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I was literally
into this. Headset meme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, why do they do this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like every time you get
into it, a random side story </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> comes up that has
absolutely fucking nothing </connor>
<joey> to do with the story and it's shit. </joey>
<joey> - I thought that side story
was fucking hilarious. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it takes you out of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Yeah, but in the wrong way. It was shit! </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I mean, it was so out of place </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the rest of the doujin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's only one chapter. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - It's only one chapter. </joey>
<joey> It's a side story that I don't know </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> why the side story's in here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Put it at the end, put it at the end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't ruin the flow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it literally had
no effects on the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they don't call back to
the characters at fucking all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I don't know why
this side story is in here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But the point is, like the reason this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of my favorites is
that the relationship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between the student and the teacher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like handled so well.
- Wholesome as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just like, you
can never read a Fuga doujin </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> and just not come out just like
with a warm, fuzzy feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree with that.
- What, what, what? </garnt>
<joey> - I agree with that. </joey>
<garnt> - What are you laughing at Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you laughing Connor? </garnt>
<connor> - Because there's a few. </connor>
<connor> I gotta stop you right there. </connor>
<connor> I will stop you right there. </connor>
<connor> There is one moment where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I don't know about that one, chief." </connor>
<connor> Where she's like, "Guys,
I have an announcement </connor>
<connor> to the school. I've been
fucking one of the students." </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, "I don't
think that's a good idea. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> Really don't think this is a good idea." </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, it's completely
in character though, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> Like they've built her up as just someone </garnt>
<garnt> who just doesn't give a fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but I'm thinking,
I'm sitting here like, </connor>
<garnt> "All right, all right." </garnt>
<garnt> - She did it for love. </garnt>
<connor> - I respect it. I respect it. I do, I do. </connor>
<connor> But think about your career a little bit. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, she doesn't care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not employed. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> You've literally just admitted
to a criminal offense, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure, like
in front of everyone. </connor>
<joey> - No dude, she was just like,
"I love this guy so much, </joey>
<joey> I'm willing to quit my job." </joey>
<connor> - "Your honor, it was love." </connor>
<connor> "All right, you've been
sentenced to 10 years in jail. </connor>
<connor> Get out of here." </connor>
<connor> - That's why it's wholesome as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Wholesome as fuck? </connor>
<joey> - She sacrificed her
career to declare her love. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like-
- Exactly. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just like, this is
a doujin, I don't care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't care about the
legal ramifications. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She obviously didn't get any. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> The point is that like, it
was building up to a point. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, I will admit, the
ending was somewhat sweet. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I will admit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A part of me was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Did you really have to
announce it to the school? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Was this really necessary?" </joey>
<joey> Could you not have just quit? </joey>
<connor> - That's the dramatic scene. </connor>
<joey> - It's not like the Shrek fucking wedding. </joey>
<joey> You don't have to be like, "Lord Farquaad, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> you cannot marry her
because I'm going to marry." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't need that, it
really doesn't add anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You could have just been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know what, I'll see you after school. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> Graduate and we'll fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> That could have been the end. </garnt>
<connor> - But that's boring. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Is it though? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean it was dramatic. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - It's the drama, you need the drama. </joey>
<joey> - You need the drama, you
need the spice, motherfucker. </joey>
<joey> - That's the POG moment where you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Ooh, I can't believe she just said that." </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like when he confessed to her
and she just went, "I know." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, "Oh, shit son,
she did not just say that." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, she'd
literally been fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> riding this boy's dick for 10 months, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> of course she likes her.
That's how this shit goes. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - But that's what I
loved about this doujin, </joey>
<garnt> is that it reads like a '90s rom-com, </garnt>
<garnt> because there's so many moments
like that in '90s rom-coms </garnt>
<joey> that I've read where I'm just
like, "I mean, of course." </joey>
<joey> Like, "Of course you would do that." </joey>
<garnt> - I was so fucking invested </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> in these characters' relationship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more so than like any
other doujin I've read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Apart from his other works, </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> I mean, the only reason I
really chose this was of course, </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt, teacher-student relationship. </garnt>
<garnt> Of course, I'm gonna fucking love that. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you know, as
taboo as it is in real life, </connor>
<connor> it's very attractive in fictional works. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I don't think about
the legal ramifications </connor>
<joey> when I read doujins. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes I do. </connor>
<connor> I'm sitting there and
I'm like, "Fuck dude, </connor>
<connor> like how many years am
I getting for this?" </connor>
<garnt> - Like this isn't even his
like most highly rated works. </garnt>
<connor> There's like one which I would say </connor>
<garnt> is like the "Tsuredure
Children" of hentai. </garnt>
<connor> If you remember "Tsuredure Children," </connor>
<garnt> it's like an anime that
focuses on different couples </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like getting together
and it's wholesome as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> And his work is basically like that </garnt>
<garnt> but just with the fucking included, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You get the same kind of
character development, </garnt>
<garnt> you get the same kind of
care in the characterization </garnt>
<garnt> as you would in any other fucking manga. </garnt>
<connor> - I would say there's
big props to making me </connor>
<joey> actually give a about the story </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> despite the weird side story. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Again, I really wanna know
what the thought process was. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd love to have been
in the board meeting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I wish I was there. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I thought that was fucking hilarious. </connor>
<joey> - I was, but it also took me out of it. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, halfway
through reading this chapter, </joey>
<joey> I was like, I know this is
gonna have no ramifications </joey>
<joey> on the story, but it's
just hilarious to read. </joey>
<garnt> - I was just like, 'cause I
knew when I recommended this </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> that it was that scene that
was gonna get brought up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course it is, how could I not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I knew it was just gonna be that moment </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> where it's just like,
"Garnt, is this your man?" </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "This is not
my man, this is not my man." </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] This is literally your man. </connor>
<garnt> - Come get your mans. Come get your mans. </garnt>
<connor> - All I'm saying, all right,
is that two out of three </connor>
<connor> have incest, Garnt. What's up with that? </connor>
<joey> What's up with that? </joey>
<joey> You know, I mean, whatever. </joey>
<joey> - He likes it, man. Leave the man alone. </joey>
<connor> - This is good. I like it
'cause I get to be the judge, </connor>
<garnt> jury, and executioner here </garnt>
<garnt> and I didn't have to share my taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - You didn't have to show your taste? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't have any taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - We roasted you enough
in the hentai episode. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, I put "Mother
Knows Breast" up, come on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been roasted enough for a lifetime. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I stand by my words. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I mean this was- </joey>
<joey> - Out of 10? </joey>
<joey> - What did I give it out of 10? </joey>
<joey> Let me see what I gave it. </joey>
<joey> Seven out of 10. </joey>
<joey> - Not bad.
- Not that bad. </joey>
<joey> - I thought the good moments
were very, very good. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> The story was pretty damn good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Few moments where I thought,
"Ah, you know, whatever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And a few moments where I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "All right, a little too much keenness </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from this lady in the start." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, "There's no way.
Why are you into this kid? </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Is there any reason why? </connor>
<connor> Is it purely that-" </connor>
<garnt> - I don't even think she
was into the kid at first. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because-
- She's just joshing around. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What kind of woman josh around? </connor>
<connor> Hehe, gonna fuck around and
live in your apartment, bruh. </connor>
<joey> - She's like early 20s.
She doesn't give a fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Like the reason that there
was like, they used the cat </garnt>
<garnt> analogy so much was because
she would just basically </garnt>
<garnt> was a stray cat. </garnt>
<joey> That was like the analogy. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] I get it, I get it. </joey>
<joey> - Right, when I'm just like,
she doesn't give a fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Again, good story though. </garnt>
<joey> - It was the first time
where I read a doujin </joey>
<joey> and I looked at like a
character and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "You're not even hot,
you're just cute as fuck." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, honestly, the
reason this is my favorite </garnt>
<joey> of his works is because I fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Like you got the cutest
fucking personality. </joey>
<joey> - I fucking feel the teacher's, </joey>
<joey> like, I love the fucking teacher, man. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think she's cute as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, she is cute as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - The fang. The fucking fang. I was like. </joey>
<garnt> - The fangs?
- Bro, that does it for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Seven out of 10.
(all laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, but what's most
important is this final one. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - [Connor] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's neither Garnt or my recommendation, </garnt>
<garnt> or rather it's both of
our recommendations. </garnt>
<joey> - It's both our recommendation. </joey>
<joey> - They just wanted to scar me. </joey>
<garnt> - We were never going
to do a doujin episode </garnt>
<garnt> without talking about "Metamorphosis." </garnt>
<joey> - One of the most legendary
doujins out there. </joey>
<joey> - Okay and Connor's never read it. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, before we start,
I got something to say. </garnt>
<garnt> I have a confession to make, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Go on. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh no, what are you gonna say, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> Fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - I have, before this,
never read "Metamorphosis." </garnt>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Metamorphosis" has been
my "Full Metal Alchemist." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All it took was an
episode to make you do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Congratulations, you did it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just needed. </garnt>
<garnt> - It takes 10 fucking minutes
to read, it's not long. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not 10 fucking minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a 20, 30 minute read. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, but it was the one where </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, people have
talked about it so much </joey>
<joey> that I had just been putting it off. </joey>
<joey> So it was that one hentai
where I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> "I will read 'Metamorphosis'
when I am ready to read </garnt>
<connor> 'Metamorphosis.'" </connor>
<connor> - I will say, for all
I've heard about this, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I almost expected it to be
more fucked up than it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you feel that way? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was pretty fucked up.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But because of the reputation it had, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I expected it to be- </connor>
<connor> - You over-hyped yourself. </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was gonna
be even worse than it was. </connor>
<garnt> - So did you just hype up the
fucked up-ness in your head? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, you know, I mean, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been an anime fan for a long time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You hear about this constantly.
It's referenced constantly. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> It's been that one fucked
up thing, you know and I- </connor>
<joey> - It's fucked up for a vanilla audience. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've watched the final
season of "Game of Thrones." </connor>
<connor> I know true disappointment, </connor>
<garnt> and this is kind of what
it felt like a little bit. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, this is fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't get me wrong, it's very fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I almost expected something worse, </garnt>
<connor> like I almost expected like
absolutely horrific shit. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's because
you already put your foot </joey>
<connor> in the doujin and like hentai world. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, I mean, I know. </connor>
<connor> - This is like Grade A fucked
up for someone who's like, </connor>
<joey> never stepped foot into that, right? </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I've seen S-tier fucked up </connor>
<connor> and this is A-tier fucked up. </connor>
<connor> Like it's very fucked up
and very uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> Maybe it's just more accessible. </connor>
<connor> I'm not really sure why this
one has gotten a notoriety. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's because this was one of, </joey>
<joey> I think this was just that
one doujin that really </joey>
<joey> just got around, I guess,
for whatever reason it is. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like. </joey>
<joey> - Should we explain the premise? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, why don't you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Metamorphosis" is
- Why don't you explain? </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - A very, very well-known doujin. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - About a girl who, you know,
she's not the prettiest girl </garnt>
<connor> out there and then she gets
a makeover and then suddenly- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Literally takes off her glasses. </connor>
<connor> Takes off her glasses,
puts on a bit of makeup, </connor>
<joey> - Becomes hot. </joey>
<connor> - Becomes hot and then guys
are suddenly attracted. </connor>
<connor> - You have seen this
beginning panel somewhere. </connor>
<connor> If you're in the anime community, </connor>
<garnt> - You've always seen it.
- You've seen this somewhere. </garnt>
<connor> - It's iconic as fuck, even
I know what this panel is </connor>
<garnt> and then I didn't know
any of the other panel, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> which is, this is the before
and this is the after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Completely different character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then this character is just shocked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that guys are now paying attention to her </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that they wanna fuck her. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so she starts fucking these guys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it gets really derailed really fast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it's a big yikes of a read. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, how do I explain it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, here's, okay. Let me just, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I put some notes down while I was reading. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Seems normal so far. Not
fond of how his dad reacted </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> to her makeup, of her dad
reacting to her makeup. </joey>
<joey> - What scene was that? </joey>
<joey> - Makeover, makeover, not gonna lie. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- Chapter three. </garnt>
<connor> - So she gets a make-over and
the father's like, "Oh, okay." </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I was like, "I don't like that." </connor>
<garnt> - You won't believe what happens next. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, I do not like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I do not like that look he gave. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> This does not mean good things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And unfortunately, I was correct. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Top 10 foreshadowing moments. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Literally, WatchMojo, you can take this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from "The Top 10 Foreshadowing
Moments in Anime." </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> Yeah, so, you know, a kind of sleazy dude </garnt>
<connor> kind of uses her for sex, you know, </connor>
<connor> and then gives her drugs. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think the biggest
aspect of the story, </garnt>
<garnt> which I've never seen in
any other doujinshi before </garnt>
<garnt> was the drug angle, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was pretty
uncomfortable, not gonna lie. </connor>
<connor> It was pretty uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, where he was like, </connor>
<garnt> so she puts on makeup,
she has her makeover </garnt>
<garnt> and then she finds this douche bag guy </garnt>
<garnt> who basically gives her a drug and- </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind of like a Mandy
rip off kind of thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, and basically
she experiences the best sex </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> of her, or just one of the
best experiences of her life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally the first time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's a virgin then and she just becomes </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> kind of a nymphomaniac, right? </joey>
<joey> Where she just- </joey>
<joey> - And a drug addict. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well, a sex addict and
a drug addict at this point, </joey>
<joey> right, where she's addicted to the sex </joey>
<joey> and she's addicted to the drugs, </joey>
<joey> and she's addicted to the sex and drugs. </joey>
<garnt> And then this, it just kind
of spirals down from there. </garnt>
<garnt> It is like, it is a downward
curve from like chapter one. </garnt>
<connor> - But you almost feel like </connor>
<connor> when the character is
like this disconnected </connor>
<connor> and like barely gives you
any signs of wanting to, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, like it
feels so forced at times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this decline of mental
state where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, you're just
doing the fucking best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of depression hits at
this point or something." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, it's literally,
you're just trying to get, </connor>
<connor> I feel like they're just making things bad </connor>
<connor> for the sake of it. </connor>
<connor> Like a lot of the time
I was like, "I guess." </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Like there was a moment
in it where I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno, 'x' to doubt
on that one where like- </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - Which point, which point? </garnt>
<garnt> - So, it was in the school,
where during the story, </garnt>
<garnt> they know that she went to a hotel. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I suppose I should back up. </garnt>
<garnt> So she has this boyfriend
who's kind of a scumbag, </garnt>
<garnt> gives her drugs and then
she kind of wants money. </garnt>
<garnt> So she starts fucking an
old guy who gives her money. </garnt>
<garnt> A little disturbing and
the sex scene is really- </garnt>
<connor> - Ugly bastard tag. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally, really, it's
not an uncomfortable- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's quite uncomfortable,
what am I saying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's very uncomfortable.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't mean to say "not uncomfortable." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's very uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then for some reason,
one of the students finds out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that she went to this place. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So naturally, all of the
boys together decide, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Well, let's all get blow jobs from her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what me and the boys do at school." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like-
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - First of all, never gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But also that was the
part where I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Ah, I feel like this is kind of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ah, this is a little extra." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was where I was like, "I
get it. It's very depressing." </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> But I was like, "This feels
really forced," this part. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you're making
this sad for the sake of it. </connor>
<connor> Do you agree with that whole school part? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "This is a bit of a stretch." </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's just like a trope </joey>
<connor> that I've seen in so many doujins. </connor>
<connor> - And they all start
fucking her and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Name one school kid that minds
showing his dick to anyone, </connor>
<joey> let alone fucking someone
in front of his friend." </joey>
<joey> - You'd be surprised in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, man. I don't know, man. </connor>
<connor> - This is a culture that is grown up </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> on just seeing each other's
dicks in the Onsen, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Yeah, just probably another
day in the office, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - That doesn't mean they wanna
fuck the same fucking girl </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> in front of each other. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's such a stretch that I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> "Ah, I feel like they're just doing this </connor>
<connor> for the sake of it." </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you say it's a stretch, </connor>
<connor> but again, it's like such a
trope that you see in doujins </connor>
<connor> where it's like-
- Yeah, yeah, I guess so. </connor>
<joey> - It happens all the time,
it's not even like surprising. </joey>
<joey> - But I guess when it's used in a way, </joey>
<connor> it's like, feel sorrow for
this girl, feel like sadness. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "No, I mean." </connor>
<joey> - I mean that wasn't even
the part where I felt sadness </joey>
<garnt> at all, it was,
- Oh God, I mean. </garnt>
<joey> - It was after that. </joey>
<joey> - Like, what I would say is, </joey>
<joey> this is like the "Requiem
for a Dream" of hentai. </joey>
<garnt> And I didn't think I would
say that in like a sentence, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a thing, it is a thing, this is. </garnt>
<connor> - So, after she sleeps with
this old guy for money, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> after she gets blackmailed by
the other kids in her school </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to have sex with them and
do all this other stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is really horrifying,
it's not portrayed very well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is portrayed very horrifyingly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Her dad wants a piece of the action. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now this is where I'm
like, "For fuck's sake." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is just like, this is
like, literally the saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "My day can't get any worse." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> This is literally it, so I'm like, God. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> What do I even say about this thing? </connor>
<connor> This is so fucked up that
I'm like, "Oh my God," </connor>
<connor> like "What, why?" </connor>
<connor> And then she fucks, the dad
fucks her and it goes on. </connor>
<connor> And the mum blames her
and I'm like, "Really?" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Really, like you were married
to this man for how long </connor>
<connor> and you think it's your daughter's fault? </connor>
<connor> Come on, come the fuck on. No way. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I bet 99% of wives would
be like, "Men you're out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't care what happened, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't care who tempted
who, you're fucking out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You are the problem, you
should fucking know better." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, that's where I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Hmm, all right, okay.
Okay, maybe, maybe." </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> I'm like, "ah." </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe, I'll see where this goes. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know about this move, chief. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, could you
see a world where the mum </connor>
<connor> would be like, "I blame you,
daughter, for fucking dad." </connor>
<connor> - I mean, fuck, I don't know, man. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> I don't know anyone who's
been in that situation. </connor>
<joey> How the fuck am I supposed to know? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> You never know, there might
be, who the fuck knows? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you think there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is just fucking weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This one was fucking weird, uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'm like, I get why it's got a reputation, </connor>
<joey> but I was just like, "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, it is absolutely fucked up </joey>
<joey> and it's one of those doujins
where it's not supposed </joey>
<joey> to be enjoyed in the conventional
way of enjoying a doujin. </joey>
<garnt> - You know some sick fuck did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'ma fucking say it, I think
this doujin's a masterpiece. </garnt>
<joey> - Thank you, thank you. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was just like-
- What is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - I have not-
- No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not because I thought it was hot, </garnt>
<joey> - I raised this boy. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This is just like, "I
google every depressing thing </connor>
<connor> that could happen in life.
I put it in a doujin." </connor>
<connor> How is that a masterpiece? </connor>
<garnt> - I have never been so
engrossed in a doujin before </garnt>
<connor> where, like I was turning every page. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh fuck off, fuck off!
- I was just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I was thinking,
(Joey clapping) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You are chatting out of your ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Where is this doujin gonna go next? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm 100% serious when I was just like. </garnt>
<connor> - I literally saw it from like, </connor>
<connor> the moment she met this guy, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I bet just fucked up after
fucked up shit is gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> The moment he gave her drugs, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I know where this is going. </connor>
<connor> This is just kind of-" </connor>
<joey> - It has the greatest shonen
battle of all time, dude. </joey>
<connor> Who is going to win? </connor>
<connor> - Woman versus drugs, fuck! </connor>
<connor> - One innocent girl or one spiky boy. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - No, because like I tried to come, </joey>
<joey> I feel like you came in with
like a lot of preconceived </joey>
<garnt> notions where you're just
like, "This is fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm ready for this." </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, if this was a movie
or a TV show or anything, </connor>
<connor> this would be like, just like bait tier. </connor>
<connor> This is just baiting. </connor>
<garnt> This is just so lazy in
terms of how little they try </garnt>
<garnt> to sell this as like a
realistic journey that I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, we've had movies
about stuff like this </garnt>
<garnt> that are fucked up that have
done this so much better </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm like- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially "Requiem
for a Dream" like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just because this is an
doujin format and it's literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only one that's like,
"How about we be depressing?" </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> You know, it's like, I
don't want to give it </garnt>
<garnt> props for that 'cause like- </garnt>
<connor> - I give it props for that. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's a bit more than that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I think it's a little more. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I'm being a little too harsh, </garnt>
<connor> but I feel like this has been
done before in other places. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I feel like
"Metamorphosis" has like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> well now it has to battle with it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like the meme doujin, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's like people don't judge it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on its own merits anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People judge it being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Ha ha, I've seen this
been memed everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> as like the big thing that
people recommend to people </connor>
<connor> to like fuck them up and stuff like that." </connor>
<connor> And it's like one thing
that's like, I don't like </connor>
<joey> is that people in like
the hentai community </joey>
<joey> or what I've seen, people are just like, </joey>
<joey> "I've seen more fucked up shit than this. </joey>
<connor> I've seen worse things than this." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Of course you have, </connor>
<connor> I too watch 'Euphoria.' </connor>
<connor> I too have seen some
of the shit that Sydney </connor>
<connor> has recommended and fucking reviewed." </connor>
<connor> Like, I've seen the fucked up shit. </connor>
<connor> - I've seen his deadly
collection of hentai. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know, I did go in. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, a part of me obviously
went into this thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was gonna be the most
fucked up thing I've ever seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my life 'cause I was recommending it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it wasn't that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then the other hand, I'm like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's almost trying too hard
to make me feel sadness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for this character that
I don't really feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they built her up that well. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Like, honestly, personally. </connor>
<connor> - I thought they built her up really well. </connor>
<connor> - It was so short and sweet and it's like, </connor>
<connor> I guess, it felt very
one dimensional to me. </connor>
<connor> I felt like there wasn't
enough depth to the character. </connor>
<connor> And then the moment shit
started going wrong. </connor>
<garnt> - Look at us, depth to the
character in a doujin episode. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, listen, listen.
- Look at us, look at us. </connor>
<connor> - If you want me to give
a shit about this story, </connor>
<connor> you sit here and say it's a masterpiece. </connor>
<connor> I'ma sit back and be like,
"Listen, fine I'll talk </connor>
<connor> about the characters
for one goddamn minute." </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - The moment started going wrong for her, </connor>
<connor> all character development
went out the fucking window. </connor>
<connor> There was like nothing
was added or introduced. </connor>
<connor> It was like, all right. </connor>
<connor> It's like an Apple event. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "We've seen the iPhone, </connor>
<connor> we've seen being taken advantage of. </connor>
<connor> Let me introduce being taken
advantage of by your father." </connor>
<connor> And it was like,
(Connor clapping) </connor>
<connor> That's what I felt like. </connor>
<connor> I felt like I was being condescended to </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> in terms of the shit that was coming up. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Okay, because I would
feel like the thing </garnt>
<garnt> that I also want to mention is that, </garnt>
<garnt> goddamn, Shindo L knows how
to draw a good sex scene. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> My fucking God, that's the
thing that's missing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's the man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like, okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think fucking chapter
one awoke something in me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, you remember
talking about like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that new thing where
you're just like, "Ooh." </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Wait, what is the new thing? </connor>
<connor> Tell me.
- The new fetish. </connor>
<connor> - The new fetish is
just like this girl who, </connor>
<connor> like I've never read a doujin
where like, this sex scene </connor>
<connor> is like this intense. I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - Was that like with the drugs and shit? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah where-
- In the Karaoke room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, where they introduced the drugs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just like enhanced
their experience to a point </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> where it was just like nothing that </garnt>
<garnt> you can ever experience on this Earth. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know why I didn't
enjoy that scene that much. </connor>
<connor> I'm not really sure why. </connor>
<joey> - No, that scene single-handedly
awoke that for me as well. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just like, why didn't it? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just like, me reading that scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like fucking
heavy breathing cats. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Oh, oh God." </connor>
<connor> - Fogging up your PC monitor. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Horny grip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ, for a second I like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> understood Meilyne for like a second. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And now that's fucking
saying something, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I didn't know I could feel this way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then like chapter three
hit and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think like my fucking penis shriveled up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it just inverted
back into my body, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> (Joey and Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It was just like such
a whiplash of emotions </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm just like, it went
from like, "Oh, that's hot." </garnt>
<connor> to just like, "What
the fuck am I reading?" </connor>
<garnt> - Have you seen that fucking like, </garnt>
<connor> there's a thing in the UK
where they would go and, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a TV show, they go and visit tribes? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And there's this one clip,
it's one of my favorite clips. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's where the guys
like, there's a ceremony </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> where they invert their penises </joey>
<joey> and they invert this dude's
penis and he immediately faints. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I imagine that's what happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what happened to Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> His penis inverts. He just fucking, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> at his PC monitor and Sydney's
like, "What happened, Garnt?" </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> "I was reading 'Metamorphosis.'" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Understandable.
- Understandable. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Here's some Powerade. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, honestly, 'cause
I feel like the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between me and you was just
like, at a point I was into it </garnt>
<garnt> and then I was just like, "Okay,
I am not into it anymore." </garnt>
<connor> But I was like, I was invested in it. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe that's why it was strong for you, </connor>
<connor> because it was like, you
were into it at one point. </connor>
<joey> And then it's like,
(Connor claps) </joey>
<joey> slaps you on the back of
the head, it's like, stop. </joey>
<joey> - It's the whiplash of emotion, yes. </joey>
<connor> - Stop it, that was a
really good clap by the way. </connor>
<joey> - Like, oh my God. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Like even during like some
of the later chapters, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't say it, don't say it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because like his art
is fucking amazing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> I don't know how he draws his
sex scenes to be this intense, </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm just like, "I'm feeling emotions </garnt>
<garnt> that I've never felt before in my life." </garnt>
<connor> - I was reading this praying, </connor>
<connor> "I wanna go back to the succubus one." </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I really wanted to just open it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I gotta ask, what do y'all think </joey>
<joey> about the final chapter? </joey>
<joey> - Fucked up. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing)
- Fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - Because I think, I almost
think now, hearing your guys' </joey>
<joey> thoughts on it is that
this manga works amazingly, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> or doujin works amazingly,
if you get invested </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really heavily in the first
part and the first sex scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because then it like, like I said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it hits you in the back of the head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, "No, don't be horny." </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's bad. Horny bad. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it like, gave me
such a mess of emotions, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I know I shouldn't be horny right now. </garnt>
<garnt> This is fucking depressing as shit. </garnt>
<garnt> This is fucked up," you know? </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't like the guy at
all and I think that's why, </connor>
<garnt> like I couldn't. This guy was a fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I didn't like the guy at all. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no you're not
supposed to like the guy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but to me, it's
like, the whole hotness </connor>
<connor> of the sex is the duo dynamic. </connor>
<garnt> - Look, okay, someone
who is that depressed </garnt>
<garnt> shouldn't be making those
kinds of facial expressions. </garnt>
<garnt> You can fucking frame some
of the facial expressions. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean by that, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, honestly-
- Let's unpack that a little. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's jump right into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Let's talk about the art of that. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's gonna need another drink. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's talk about the
art of the ahegao, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not fond of it, you know. </connor>
<garnt> I've been oversaturized to it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you've been oversaturized to it. </connor>
<connor> - I think we all have.
- We all have, right? </connor>
<connor> But like his, like ahegao
faces are some of the most </connor>
<joey> unique fucking ahegao faces I've ever seen </joey>
<garnt> in all of hentai. </garnt>
<joey> - It's Asanagi and Shindo L. </joey>
<connor> - I'm a man of the church though, </connor>
<connor> that's not enough to
make me quiver, you know? </connor>
<garnt> I don't see that. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> My will's not compromised by
such ill-thought ideas of sex. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I'm sorry Connor, that
this art piece was so good </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> that it made me question. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> It made me question it for a second. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was just like,
"No, I'm back to it. </garnt>
<connor> This is awful, this is depraved." </connor>
<garnt> - God just fucking
imagine the fucking name </garnt>
<connor> of the clip for this fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> Garnt thought fucking "Metamorphosis" </connor>
<connor> was the fucking Mona Lisa
of doujins or some shit. </connor>
<joey> - I personally think it's
the Mona Lisa of doujins. </joey>
<garnt> - No.
- Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> The reason why like I
was so engrossed in it </garnt>
<garnt> is because it was such like. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - You love incest and there's incest in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at some point, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> So clearly that's why you like it. </connor>
<garnt> - It was such a fucking mess of emotions, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was like an
emotional up and down, like- </garnt>
<connor> - It was just down from the start. </connor>
<connor> I knew the moment she was like,
"I can't make good friends." </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh no, that's-" </joey>
<joey> - The only other time
- That's gonna lead </joey>
<connor> to bad decisions.
- I felt that depressed </connor>
<garnt> reading something was "Oyasumi Punpun." </garnt>
<garnt> - And also, okay so- </garnt>
<garnt> - I've not read "Oyasumi Punpun." </garnt>
<joey> - This is the "Oyasumi Punpun" of doujin. </joey>
<connor> - I also wanna put it into
perspective that I just read </connor>
<connor> like three and a half
hours of porn before this. </connor>
<connor> So reading this last was not
a good way to end my day. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was already quite
done with reading porn. </connor>
<connor> And then, you have to bear in mind, </connor>
<connor> there was probably no
way I was gonna find any, </connor>
<connor> even if it was the hottest. </connor>
<joey> - That's what you get
for doing your homework </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> the day before it's due. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was given the thing the day before. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I was given this two days ago. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, I think
that also didn't help, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause there was no way
I was ever gonna find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> any of these things attractive
'cause I was pretty much, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, I was pretty
done with reading porn. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - [Joey] You've read. </joey>
<joey> - I've read so much. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] You did you
year's quota of reading. </joey>
<joey> - I literally read like, what I think </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> is like a normal person's
like month worth of porn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in one day, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was pretty exhausted and
the fact that this came up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I just saw right
through it right away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I knew exactly what they were
gonna do right from the start </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was just like, you know, it's fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I see what you're trying to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're trying to make me sad
and I don't appreciate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Frankly.
- I want a happy ending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not done well, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The whole, like the moment
that her dad looked at her, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'm like, "I see what
you're doing here, buddy </connor>
<garnt> and I'm not a fan." </garnt>
<connor> - Your next line is... </connor>
<connor> - I actually,
- I'm not a fan. </connor>
<connor> - We keep talking about the dad, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think the dad is the
worst part of the doujin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] It's definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it was just like,
for me reading the dad episode </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> was just like, let's just
throw in something fucked up. </garnt>
<connor> - It is literally, I would
rather eat my own toenails </connor>
<connor> than read them again. </connor>
<garnt> - But like what, like it
was after the dad doujin, </garnt>
<garnt> the dad chapter part when I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yo, this is really
engrossing as a story." </garnt>
<connor> - I knew it was going there. </connor>
<connor> The moment he gave her a drug, I'm like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> "He's literally gonna sell her later on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and use drugs for it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so obvious it was going there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so when they went there, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was not even surprised. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> The dad thing caught me off guard. </garnt>
<garnt> I had a feeling it might happen </garnt>
<garnt> and then when it did happen,
I'm like, for fuck sake. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Goddamn it. Goddamn it. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like to me, it was just like, </garnt>
<connor> it was just the feeling
of just being like, </connor>
<connor> "This is the most depraved shit. </connor>
<connor> I shouldn't feel horny at
all with this situation." </connor>
<connor> - Are people jacking off to this? </connor>
<connor> - I don't think so. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, probably someone is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably someone.
- Vsauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the thing is, it
was that emotion juxtaposed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between how amazing the sex scenes were. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> 'Cause like, out of context. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'X' to doubt on this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Out of context, out of context. </garnt>
<garnt> - No I don't think the sex
scenes were all that good. </garnt>
<garnt> - The art was fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Half of it was fucking ugly bastards. </garnt>
<garnt> How am I supposed to get behind that shit? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it wasn't all ugly bastards. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't all ugly bastards. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so it was, we
had two very big scenes </garnt>
<garnt> with older men. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And it was very gross because- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there were six chapters and two, </garnt>
<connor> maybe three of them were ugly bastards. </connor>
<connor> - Which frankly, one is too many. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing)
for me, personally. </garnt>
<garnt> So the fact that I read this
shit and I thought it's bad </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> enough she's fucking some
random dude for money </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who is literally the ugliest man on earth, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then next it's like fucking Smash Bros </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> introducing a new
fighter, her fucking dad, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> into this fucked up story already, </joey>
<joey> which is already depressing
as fuck because everyone </joey>
<joey> in the fucking school has had a go at her. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, that shit alone, </joey>
<joey> I was like, you know what? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, sure Japanese kids are fucked up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like, this is too much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This would never happen. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> No way in any school would
this ever happen, ever. </connor>
<joey> - Well, it's interesting
because like, I interviewed </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> Shindo L a couple of years
ago and we talked about this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I want us to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what inspired "Metamorphosis?" </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> And he said that, because he was born </connor>
<connor> and raised in New York. </connor>
<connor> So he was like, "I heard
and saw so many stories </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> that were similar to this." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And he was like, "I
wanted to bring light to it </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> 'cause otherwise no one
fucking talks about it." </joey>
<connor> - I bet this shit has
happened like, separately. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> Like all of these individual things </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - No, no, absolutely.
- Have definitely happened. </joey>
<joey> - This isn't based off real life. </joey>
<joey> - No, I know, I know, but
the fact that like you string </joey>
<connor> these all together to a
point where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I suspend my disbelief and I'm
like, "Yeah, I don't know." </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's not supposed to be realistic, </joey>
<connor> but it's supposed to be...
- Yeah, I know, I know. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically, I think, in my opinion, </connor>
<joey> it was, Shindo L being like,
"Look, this shit happens." </joey>
<connor> - But like, I think about
movies that fucked me up, </connor>
<connor> and I think "That could be
me. I can make that mistake. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> I could be in that situation." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this one, I was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well yeah, 'cause you're not a chick. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - But even then, like, I feel
like it was trying too hard. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the most
fantastical element of it </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> was how much he enjoyed the sex. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel, that was
the big difference between. </garnt>
<connor> - That was also an uncomfortable part </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm like, "Is this is
good, is it what she wants?" </connor>
<connor> I don't know.
- Well that's the one. </connor>
<joey> - That's the most interesting element. </joey>
<joey> - That to me is what like, drew me in, </joey>
<garnt> was like the fact that she
enjoyed the sex so much, </garnt>
<connor> which I know is like unrealistic. </connor>
<garnt> - But with her dad? </garnt>
<connor> Vsauce music, what? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, that's the point, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where it's just like, it's
such like a mess of emotions </garnt>
<joey> that it's just like,
you have no grounding. </joey>
<joey> - It questions your
morality the entire time. </joey>
<joey> - There's like no grounding
on this kind of situation </joey>
<garnt> 'cause personally, I don't know anyone </garnt>
<garnt> who's fucked their dads. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing)
- I'm glad, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - I personally know of four
people who have done it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I kind of wanna keep
it that way, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's just me. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if that's a hot take, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I hope that that never happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to any-fucking-body, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Connor] It's fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucked.
- But I mean, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the point, is it's fucked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fiction, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like the thing that
drew me in was that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just these fucked up situations </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> juxtaposed between sex scenes
that she obviously really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> enjoyed at the time, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, "Yo,
this is like really weird, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is like a weird car crash
of different fucking things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I shouldn't be feeling right now" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I'm just like, I
don't know how to like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm still like processing it now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's like the only time. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> The reason I call this a masterpiece </joey>
<joey> is that it's the only time
I've felt this emotion </joey>
<joey> that I'm trying to
describe right now, right? </joey>
<joey> Normally, you get depressed.
Normally, you get horny. </joey>
<joey> You don't talk about
depression boner, do you? </joey>
<joey> Like that does that just
doesn't happen, right? </joey>
<joey> But "Metamorphosis" is just
these two fucking things </joey>
<joey> that shouldn't coexist together, </joey>
<joey> - Coexisting together. </joey>
<joey> - They're coexisting together. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like what? </joey>
<garnt> - And that's why I think
it's brilliant as well. </garnt>
<joey> It's because he took such
a fucking risk with this. </joey>
<garnt> Where he was like, this
could have easily just been </garnt>
<joey> like a weird thing that no
one would have picked up </joey>
<garnt> and then just like brushed under </garnt>
<garnt> all of the "Oh, okay,
that's fucking weird, </garnt>
<garnt> let's not talk about that" pile of doujins </garnt>
<garnt> that are out there, but
there was just again, </garnt>
<joey> he just presented it in a
way where it was just like, </joey>
<joey> you came for the horny, </joey>
<joey> but you're gonna stay for the depression, </joey>
<joey> whether you like it or not. </joey>
<joey> And like, I don't know any other doujin </joey>
<joey> that's managed to do that
and managed to make me stay </joey>
<joey> the entire time until the end. </joey>
<connor> - You ever seen the Shia
LaBeouf movie "Nymphomaniac?" </connor>
<joey> - No, I haven't. </joey>
<joey> That's like the three
hour long one, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, there's two parts to it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt like that was a
really uncomfortable depiction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a woman who's addicted to sex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt like that was
really somewhat well done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought that's an interesting movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a very hard watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, really? </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - It's very long. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's very uncomfortable. </connor>
<joey> - It's that fucking like,
really avant garde director. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it is.
- What's his name? </connor>
<connor> - It's one of those
things where it's like, </connor>
<connor> it really reminds you, like,
you think you're cool with sex </connor>
<joey> until you see it in
really uncomfortable ways </joey>
<joey> and you're like, ah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's the Lars Von Trier
movie, that's right. </joey>
<joey> - I kind of have weird thoughts about, </joey>
<connor> 'cause it really makes you be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you're comfortable sex? </connor>
<connor> Bet." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like, you know. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Having experienced that
kind of weird shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like going into
this, I'm like, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can kind of buy why she's into it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but also I feel like it's been done better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in different places almost. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Not saying that movie did
it better essentially, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like I've seen it
done in a way where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I think this is done slightly
more realistic to the point </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, I
believe it. I believe it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right. But it's hard to like, </joey>
<joey> I get it, how like, you know,
movies like "Nymphomaniac" </joey>
<garnt> probably did this whole thing
better, but at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> "Nymphomaniac" has the upside
of being more realistic </garnt>
<garnt> by using real actors. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] That's true, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, we shouldn't have,
like, the biggest thing- </garnt>
<connor> - It's hard to, for me personally </connor>
<connor> who's never read doujins
to see this and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Damn that's fucking,
that's art, man, that's..." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I get it,
- This is deep, this is deep, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a tall hurdle, we get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, we literally just
chucked you in the deep end </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> and just like try to see
it's like tried to see </garnt>
<connor> if you could pull your way out. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, it's like
I'm not used to this genre. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't think anyone is. </garnt>
<garnt> - All these kinds of tropes in here. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's this girl
who I'm supposed to believe </garnt>
<joey> is this kind of well done character. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, yeah, I
don't believe it, man. </joey>
<joey> Personally, at least. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, at least you gave it a go. </joey>
<joey> At least you can now say
you read "Metamorphosis." </joey>
<joey> - I've read it. I'm not
proud of that fact, Joey. </joey>
<joey> I wanna undo the reading that I've done. </joey>
<joey> - So what would you give it out of 10? </joey>
<connor> - In terms of what? </connor>
<joey> - In terms of just like
how you felt about it. </joey>
<joey> - Four.
- Four? </joey>
<connor> - It's an interesting read. </connor>
<garnt> - And what will you give it? </garnt>
<garnt> - 10. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck off! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - What does Sydney think of it? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know what Sydney thinks of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - You should ask her
what she thinks of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Frankly, I'm afraid to ask. </garnt>
<connor> - She'll be like, "It's the hottest shit. </connor>
<connor> That scene where the dad fucks?" </connor>
<connor> - The chapter with the dad? </connor>
<connor> - "Yo, I nutted." </connor>
<connor> - I have heard too many
things that have worried me </connor>
<garnt> in the past few months
with my relationship, </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm kind of afraid to
ask her opinion of like, </garnt>
<garnt> any hentai I right now. </garnt>
<connor> - So I guess we'll leave
it at that then, huh? </connor>
<connor> Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I appreciate
you guys introducing me </joey>
<connor> to the wonderful world of </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (overlapping chatter and laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - So has this experience
changed your perspective at all? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I mean, I still
have my preferred methods. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> - I got my systems in place. </connor>
<joey> - But would you ever,
in your like, off time, </joey>
<connor> go back to like try another doujin? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah if I was recommended a doujin </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> that was highly praised,
I would go and read it. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> I mean, it's not too difficult, </garnt>
<garnt> but hopefully it's not too long. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I would say the biggest
appeal about reading doujins </garnt>
<garnt> or highly rated doujinshi is like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you've talked about
finding that one hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's fucking like the diamond
in the pool of shit, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so much choice with doujinshi </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> because there's obviously so much, right? </joey>
<joey> - Infinite amount of tags. </joey>
<joey> - There's way more choice
than there is for hentai. </joey>
<garnt> And you can find way more doujins
that are like specifically </garnt>
<connor> garnered to your choice.
- I believe it, I believe it. </connor>
<connor> I just really enjoy voice acting so much. </connor>
<garnt> And especially in that manner, </garnt>
<connor> I really enjoy what it adds to it. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it helps sell
my believability on it. </connor>
<garnt> - To me, the best tag you
can possibly get is plot. </garnt>
<garnt> Plot is the best spice. </garnt>
<joey> - Isn't it tragic that it
has to be a tag though? </joey>
<joey> It's not a given that everything has plot. </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't want plot in mine. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some are like, no, no, no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want the plumber turning up today. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I don't want the pizza
man delivering a pizza. </connor>
<connor> - The fact that we're
talking about the plumber </connor>
<garnt> and the pizza man just shows
how fucking devoid of plot </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> every fucking porno is that we've gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this kind of mentality
where it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yo, plot's kind of hot," you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Knowing the context of
why people are fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> that's kind of hot, you know? </connor>
<connor> Is that such a hot take? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Me not being a fucking monkey
and just scratching my nuts </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> to people fucking, you know? </connor>
<connor> Great, fantastic. You know? </connor>
<connor> Wow. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] My God. </joey>
<joey> Well, I'm just glad,
Connor, that we managed </joey>
<joey> to finally do this episode. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we've been talking
about doing this episode </joey>
<joey> for quite a while now. </joey>
<joey> We were like, two out
of three love doujin. </joey>
<joey> Monkey man over here doesn't wanna read. </joey>
<connor> - I feel at this point we
should just make it like a bi- </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> is it bi-yearly, bi-yearly? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Garnt] Bi-yearly. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Is that twice a year? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - A doujin and hentai episode. </connor>
<connor> - This is like about six months
after the hentai episode. </connor>
<connor> We'll do another hentai
episode in six months. </connor>
<joey> - My God, it's already been six months? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, right?
- [Connor] My God. </connor>
<connor> God we just talk so
fucking much, don't we? </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I can't believe.
- Honestly, this has been </garnt>
<garnt> such a fucking episode. </garnt>
<joey> It's such a fucking fun episode to film. </joey>
<joey> - A fucking episode. It
has been a fucking episode. </joey>
<connor> - This has been a fucking
episode. That's what it's been. </connor>
<joey> - You know, the succubus one, </joey>
<connor> I'm praying gets a Pink Pineapple. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, so out of the
seven, what's your favorite? </joey>
<connor> - Can I rank them in order? </connor>
<joey> - Sure. </joey>
<joey> - All right, "Metamorphosis," zero. </joey>
<connor> "Metamorphosis" is the worst one. </connor>
<joey> - At least favorite to most favorite. </joey>
<connor> - So "Metamorphosis."
- All right, okay. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> So "Metamorphosis" is
by far the worst one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Very close, second last place. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The fucking Oreimo one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fuck that one. Fuck that one! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So that's what, Garnt
in the bottom so far? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will say that probably after that is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ooh, ah, it's gotta be the first one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Dorei Usagi." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that one I wasn't too fond of. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> And then third, I guess, is, </connor>
<connor> this is difficult. "Seikatsu." </connor>
<joey> - "Seikatsu Shuukan." </joey>
<joey> - "Seikatsu Shuukan." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Shota. </joey>
<joey> - The shota one, yeah.
- Fourth, </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll give it to the sensei one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey And Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fifth, I'll give it to "Pisu Hame." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And first place I give to succubus. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Wow, that's- </garnt>
<connor> - So two of yours are my favorite. </connor>
<connor> - That's pretty balanced, then. </connor>
<garnt> - That's pretty balanced actually, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> That's not bad. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you recommended succubus one, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, yeah, I'd say-
- "Pisu Hame" is my one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'd say you both gave
me, you know, I was shocked. </joey>
<joey> I was expecting worse from you. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> I was expecting loli
orc gang bangs from Joey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and from you Garnt, I was
expecting the whole family </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> fucking each other, frankly. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we could have
recommended that to you but like. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Next time, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - We got pretty close with
the Oreimo one, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The whole family came
out for fun with that one. </connor>
<connor> Fuck me. </connor>
<joey> - And you haven't finished "Pisu Hame," </joey>
<garnt> so I'm just gonna leave it at that. </garnt>
<garnt> - The thing is we can
only recommend three. </garnt>
<joey> So like when you're choosing
three doujinshi that's like, </joey>
<joey> a fucking hard choice. </joey>
<joey> It's like choosing between your children. </joey>
<connor> I was just like, I
wanted to recommend like </connor>
<connor> one of the top tier milf ones, </connor>
<connor> but I'm just like,
there's not enough space. </connor>
<connor> - Next time, you can
recommend me like one good one </connor>
<connor> and two ones that you
know I'll fucking hate. </connor>
<connor> That'll be fun. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, you know what you can do? </joey>
<joey> Give us a list of tags
and we'll find you some. </joey>
<joey> - Milf, milf, milf milf,
step-mom, step-mom, step-mom </joey>
<connor> - Step-mom, milf, "Mother Knows Breast." </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's likely I don't like incest, </garnt>
<connor> but-
- But- </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd like to tell you boys
that I'm gonna go here, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'm gonna go home today a
changed man, reading doujins, </connor>
<connor> but I'm not.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm definitely not. </connor>
<joey> - Next one is the aruga episode. </joey>
<connor> So, we gotta recommend
him some aruga episodes. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, 'cause they're like 10 hours long. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> I can't do that. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - No they're like a hundred hours long. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - What I wanna do for
the next episode is like </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> the adult manhwa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's a good one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a genre I've been getting into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And honestly,
- Yeah same, same. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - I think adult manhwa, story-wise, </joey>
<joey> is even better than some doujinshis. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we can recommend
Connor some adult manhwa. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like Connor would
very much be into adult manhwa. </garnt>
<garnt> - Corrupting me slowly.
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I'm a man of the Lord,
I've never been corrupted </connor>
