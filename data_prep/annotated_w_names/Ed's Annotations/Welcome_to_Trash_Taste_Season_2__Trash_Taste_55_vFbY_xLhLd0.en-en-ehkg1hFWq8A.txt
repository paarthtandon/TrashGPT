<connor> - What do you want for Christmas? </connor>
<connor> You could have five pounds or
a Bible. (cash register dings) </connor>
<connor> The first person chose the five pounds. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> The second person asked
for the five pounds. </connor>
<connor> The third person, they chose the Bible. </connor>
<connor> And when they opened the Bible up, </connor>
<connor> there was 10 pounds in it.
(cash register dinging) </connor>
<garnt> - This is the story that gets
people to discover Christ. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "Oh, Lord!"
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> (mellow music) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to "Trash
Taste" season two guys. </garnt>
<garnt> Woo!
- Yay! </garnt>
<garnt> - Look at this, new sets. Hello. </garnt>
<joey> - You like?
- Yes, hello and- </joey>
<joey> - You don't get a say,
that's our set from now on. </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, welcome back to
"Trash Taste" season two. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today, Garnt, </garnt>
<garnt> and joining me, once again, are the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> I say this, because we've had </garnt>
<connor> like a three week break or something. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. It's longer than that. </connor>
<connor> - It's like five week break. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Is it five? </connor>
<connor> - We haven't recorded a
podcast in like five weeks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you guys have had the privilege of </connor>
<connor> seeing our faces every week, </connor>
<garnt> but we have not talked on camera </garnt>
<joey> for a good three, five weeks or so, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I think it's five weeks. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's-
- How long's it been, Meilyne? </joey>
<joey> - It must be at least- </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Since like May 23rd. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a month.
- Yeah so it's at least </joey>
<joey> four weeks, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, about a month. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's taken a long
time to build the set, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot longer than I thought
it was going to take. </garnt>
<garnt> You guys have seen like the kind of like </garnt>
<joey> rough progression of it from, </joey>
<joey> hopefully, the "Trash Taste" vlogs </joey>
<joey> and also the sneak preview
of the sponsorship segments- </joey>
<joey> (Connor and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Connor] Oh, right, right. </joey>
<garnt> - Where it's just like a bare
white wall. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, oh wow, great
upgrade these boys are having. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I think everything's
changed except for the TV, </connor>
<garnt> the mics and this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - But we're gonna change the
figures as well at some point. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah the figures are
eventually gonna be changed </connor>
<connor> when we can film our figure special. </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately. Japan's
just about opening up. </connor>
<garnt> So maybe we'll be able to film that soon. </garnt>
<joey> - But we figured, what's
one thing that'll make us </joey>
<connor> really let people know
that we're based in Japan? </connor>
<connor> Let's grab some Japanese screens. (laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) That's the
most Japanese you can get. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Oh, are you Japanese? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you live in Japan? </connor>
<connor> - It's okay, we have a-
- Show me a screen. </connor>
<connor> - Japanese guy on it. </connor>
<connor> So, it's not cultural appropriation. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. Exactly. </connor>
<joey> - I allowed it. (laughs) </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - We asked Joey. We were like- (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Joey, Joey- </joey>
<joey> - I was like, did you ask me permission? </joey>
<garnt> - Joey, is this cultural appropriation? </garnt>
<joey> - No.
- I don't know. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - It's fine. It's fine. </joey>
<garnt> - The kimono episode. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I gave you the J pass,
it's all right. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, good. Good. Good. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<connor> - The J word pass. </connor>
<connor> - Why do they absorb light
so damn well? (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I know. </joey>
<joey> There's a reason why so
many YouTubers use it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> And I finally understand - </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Why it's in so many sets. So, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Hopefully you guys like our brand new set. </joey>
<connor> - We've got new cameras. </connor>
<garnt> - We just kind of like, got new lights, </garnt>
<garnt> we've kind of upgraded
every single aspect- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Behind the scenes, as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So hopefully it looks clearer to you. </garnt>
<garnt> Please don't stare at my pores because </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) I saw
them on our new cameras. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, this kind
of makes me uncomfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right.
- 4K pores. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now I understand why </garnt>
<joey> movies stars wear makeup on camera. </joey>
<garnt> - God, do I have to start
like fucking moisturizing </garnt>
<connor> and taking care of my face now. </connor>
<garnt> - I already don't like
how I look in 4K, frankly. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't. </connor>
<joey> - There's a certain Evian water spray </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
that you might have to </connor>
<joey> borrow from Meilyne if
you want some nice skin. </joey>
<connor> - I do miss the 720p days, webcam, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - When your face was just
so blurred and smooth. </joey>
<garnt> My god. </garnt>
<joey> - You could see every
fucking pixel on your face. </joey>
<garnt> - Does Aki make you take
care of your skin, face? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know-
- I do skincare routine now. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you? </garnt>
<garnt> - I do, now.
- Who got you into it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Um. What happened
was, when I was doing 4K </garnt>
<connor> and I was doing streams, </connor>
<connor> people were commenting
on my skin a lot more. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, so it is the upgrade to 4K. </garnt>
<connor> - And then, yeah, literally
the upgrade to 4K made- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, fuck, everyone's gonna be commenting </connor>
<connor> on our skin now, I swear. </connor>
<garnt> - So then I asked a friend, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, I know you're really into skincare." </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously a girl. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were, I was like
"Hey, you know stuff, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tell me which stuff to use."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were like, "Say no more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got like 500 Korean products." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, "Wait, so there's an order?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I have to do like six things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- But sometimes I forget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's really long. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I have to put like a face mask on. </connor>
<connor> And then I use that for like 15 minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck that. </connor>
<connor> - Take that off </connor>
<connor> and then put like three
different lotions on. </connor>
<joey> - There's a reason why I grow out a beard. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's to hide my pores. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I have really, really bad bags though </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> and I think that's just very unlucky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I use like an anti-bag serum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I swear it just makes my eyes- </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Anti-bag serum? </garnt>
<connor> - It makes my eyes just go
like this, bro, I'm like </connor>
<connor> (Connor breathes heavily)
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I've got really bad bags as well. </garnt>
<garnt> It's genetic, as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, sometimes I
have a good night's sleep. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> Great night's sleep. I
go on camera and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Garnt, are you getting enough sleep? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's going on there?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god, every fucking time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> Mom, Dad, why'd you have
to give me these genes? </garnt>
<joey> - The bags under the eyes is a symbol </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> of how hard the grind for YouTube is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) That's
what I tell my audience. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> I'm like, "I'm on the grind, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm an entrepreneur. </garnt>
<joey> - Sleepless nights, as you can see. </joey>
<joey> - No, when I do have sleepless nights, </joey>
<joey> then I look like a fucking zombie. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs)
And then people are just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, this is a fucking
necromancer right here." </joey>
<garnt> But even on my best days, I
still have really bad bags. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I just imagine,
the people who are like, </connor>
<joey> "Connor, you have bags."
I'm like fuck off. </joey>
<joey> Like you don't have bags. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Right? </joey>
<joey> Like you have the most perfect eyes. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you really want me to be perfect? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to be perfect. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want to have
to deal with that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm barely tryna keep my
skincare routine in check. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm barely doing anything. </garnt>
<connor> I don't even know if it's doing anything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. That's what I, </connor>
<connor> I've tried doing a skincare routine. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I stuck on it for a month. </connor>
<connor> And, I'll be honest, </connor>
<garnt> didn't notice a difference at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Or didn't feel too much of a, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe felt like a bit of a difference, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't know if it
was like a placebo or not. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like there are
a lot of businesses made </connor>
<connor> for our insecurities.
You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - No shit. </connor>
<connor> - And so, Meilyne came to me,
our producer, you all know, </connor>
<connor> and was like, "Hey Connor,
do you wanna go to this salon </connor>
<garnt> that my friend owns in Japan?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where they do skincare stuff?" </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then, so I have, like I said before, </garnt>
<garnt> I have hemophilia. </garnt>
<garnt> So I can't have anything
internal bleeding happen to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Generally, I think most
people don't want that too. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - That's normally like a big
no-no. (laughs) (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> But I literally can't have
anything that even risks it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And so this, one
of the skincare things </connor>
<connor> was like "May cause internal bleeding" </connor>
<garnt> and I'm like, "Hold up." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> What skincare going on
here is internal bleeding? </garnt>
<garnt> - How does something maybe
cause internal bleeding. </garnt>
<garnt> - So the first time I
was like "No, no, no"- </garnt>
<connor> - May cause organ failure
but you'll look great. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the first time I was
like, "No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> I'm not doing that."
- Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then afterwards they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You should try it. It's
not really that bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> It's just the whole medical
thing of it might, you know?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, "All right,
fine." Fuck it, I guess what- </garnt>
<connor> - You did it?
- Yeah, I did it. </connor>
<connor> So what it was, it was like electrocution. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like plasma. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As Meilyne laughs, 'cause she's
like, "It's wrong, Connor." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Basically.
- [Meilyne] Plasma shower. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was called a plasma shower, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> which isn't very comforting. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like-
- Right? </connor>
<connor> - The most horrible punk band- </connor>
<garnt> - Right, so.
- I've ever heard. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds like an old, </garnt>
<joey> from a League of Legends
character or something like that. </joey>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It's literally like an
electric rod or something </connor>
<connor> that touches your face. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I think it like strips your skin. </connor>
<connor> I don't really know what it's doing, </connor>
<connor> but when it would touch
me in certain places, </connor>
<connor> my face would go like, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> a fuckin' twitch. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- And I could smell- </connor>
<connor> - It's literally like the
frogs experiment, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. It smelt like
burning. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "What is this?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you just get tricked into
doing electroshock therapy? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think they burned my face </garnt>
<connor> and I paid a hundred bucks for it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they did something
else, which was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like a vacuum and fluid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it felt really fuckin' weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they were doing it on my face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It was going in my ear cavities. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Ugh. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, how much is skincare worth it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - At this point I was
like, I don't think this, </connor>
<connor> however good my face looks, I
don't think it's worth this. </connor>
<joey> - Dude. I used to have
horrible acne in high school. </joey>
<joey> So compared to then, I'm taking
this, I don't give a shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Who didn't? Who didn't have
horrible acne in high school? </garnt>
<joey> - But I had like, mine was so bad that, </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> did you ever use Proactiv? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, kinda- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like that really famous, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anti-acne thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - That says that if you have acne, </garnt>
<connor> just use that for like a month. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You'll be completely clear. </joey>
<connor> - I did use it. Didn't do shit. </connor>
<joey> - It didn't do shit for me.
- Yeah, yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I was like, it didn't do
shit, so then my parents </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> were like, "All right. I
found a stronger option." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And just tried the stronger options, </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> nothing fuckin' worked. So I
had to go to the dermatologist </garnt>
<garnt> and literally take drugs for it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did it work? </garnt>
<garnt> - It worked, it worked. I
mean, now my face is clear now. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm just like, compared to
that, I'll take these pores. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Fuck I had horrible
acne. I just dealt with it. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- And then I was just like- </connor>
<garnt> - What do you mean you just dealt? </garnt>
<connor> Oh, you just let it happen. </connor>
<garnt> - Just left it, yeah.
- Oh, really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I also, I think
working at McDonalds didn't help. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> - The deep fat fryer, I swear, dude, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> that shit turned my pepperoni
face into like McGigan. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, McDonalds' kitchens-
- Oh my god. </joey>
<connor> - Are like 95% oil humidity, right? </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> - That kicked it into overdrive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know when it
went, but early YouTube, </connor>
<connor> you can see I had like fucktons of spots. </connor>
<joey> - Right.
- Luckily- </joey>
<joey> - You weren't that spotty
when I met you though. </joey>
<connor> - No, dude. When you watch
this episode go live, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure Moudan's found a picture </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> of me looking like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like a puss fuckin' machine. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think you were that
spotty when I met you either. </garnt>
<connor> - I met you when I was like 21 though. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - So I think, by then,
it started calming down. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But yeah, when I was
like 19, it was really bad. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm glad I started a YouTube </joey>
<connor> after all of my acne went away. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause God, I can't imagine.
- I was fat and I had acne. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause the thing about
skincare routine, you know, </connor>
<connor> 'cause we all care about optimization </connor>
<connor> and all that kind of shit, right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
- [Connor] I do. I do. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's just something
about going my entire life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taking five minutes to
get ready in the morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then adding a skincare
routine on top of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you quadrupling
that time in the morning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not even quadrupling, you
add like an extra half an hour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to an hour sometimes, per morning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> is it worth this time effort
that I'm putting into? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it making a difference? I dunno. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the the other reason why </connor>
<connor> I wanted short hair for a long time, </connor>
<connor> just 'cause I was just like, dude, </connor>
<connor> it's like one wipe of the towel </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> your hair's dry. </connor>
<garnt> That shit feels so good. </garnt>
<joey> When you get a clean, like a
hair cut and it's quite short </joey>
<connor> and you just, whoosh, dry hair. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You're like, all right, I'm ready. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's why I
decided to get rid of </connor>
<connor> my really, really long hair </connor>
<connor> that I had at the
beginning of "Trash Taste". </connor>
<connor> 'Cause some mornings I'll
wake up and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Why is my hair still damp?" </connor>
<connor> (all laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> From the night before.
That doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, now I just have the
bristle. Like five seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Your hair moisture should
never be part of your routine </garnt>
<garnt> that you have to like
put in and be aware of. </garnt>
<connor> - Mm. </connor>
<garnt> - Because that's when I know
I need to get a haircut, </garnt>
<garnt> when I started noticing
that my hair's still wet </garnt>
<garnt> when I want to do something else. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, well I guess
it's time to get a haircut. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's getting way too
much effort to like gel and dry. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I have a huge respect for </garnt>
<garnt> anyone who has long hair and
has to deal with that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know, how long did
you have your long hair for? </garnt>
<joey> - Way too long. I think I
had it for like six months. </joey>
<garnt> Maybe.
- Six months? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. It probably went
down to maybe around here. </joey>
<garnt> - That was during the
"Trash Taste" days, as well. </garnt>
<joey> - [all] Early "Trash Taste" days. </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah, once I cut it, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "God, why did I ever have that hair?" </garnt>
<garnt> It was so horrible to manage it, </garnt>
<garnt> especially 'cause I had
it in summer as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it was just like a
fucking sauna on my head </garnt>
<garnt> and I fucking hated it, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck.
- Never again, never again. </garnt>
<garnt> People miss it, people are like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh I want the Jesus hair back." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, no you don't." </connor>
<joey> - Fuck off, bro.
- No, you don't. </joey>
<joey> It's disgusting. </joey>
<garnt> - How did you guys
figure out, kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> when's the first time you figured out </garnt>
<garnt> what kind of haircut you wanted? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I went through like
my entire life as a kid- </connor>
<connor> - Have they seen your haircut? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just
kind of like didn't know. </connor>
<joey> Obviously. Put up the picture. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know how to take care of my hair. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] The Sasuke haircut?
- [Garnt] Is it obvious? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it obvious? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How the fuck did you
style that shit, man? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was, you know what, the reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I styled my hair like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because it was the hairstyle that took </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the least amount of effort to style. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck off. No- </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - Because when my hair was that short, </garnt>
<garnt> like my hair is just, </garnt>
<garnt> my hair just naturally
spikes up when it's short. </garnt>
<garnt> So all I need to do, is get
a bit of gel, put it in. </garnt>
<garnt> Whoop, whoop, whoop. And it's done. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the whoop, whoop, whoop? (laughs) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I don't know! </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That's the sound of the
gel mixing with the hair- </joey>
<joey> - Whoop, whoop.
- It makes like a whoop- </joey>
<joey> - If you did, you would've
blown up way earlier </joey>
<connor> if you did a how Gigguk
styles his hair video. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> I'm sayin', you'd have blown
up like a year earlier. </joey>
<joey> - How to get a Sasuke
haircut in three seconds. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It wouldn't have been worth it, 'cause- </joey>
<connor> - How to get hair that doesn't exist. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - It wouldn't have been worth it because </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> it would have been a one
minute video. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Couldn't get the 10
minute ad revenue from that. </joey>
<joey> - Step one, gel. Step
two, whoop, whoop, whoop. </joey>
<joey> - You could have a 10
million view short right now </joey>
<connor> if you did that. Upload
it to Gigguk, right now. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe I'll make a TikTok. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, no. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> Don't do that. </connor>
<connor> - YouTube short. YouTube short. </connor>
<joey> - Have you ever thought
about starting a TikTok? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - No. I'm already burned
out with all the shit I do. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I can't do TikTok. </connor>
<joey> - I have respect for people
who start TikToks now </joey>
<joey> and do content creation and
all that shit on the side. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like I barely have enough time </joey>
<garnt> to fuckin' upload on my main channel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. As a kid, I thought
like, old people, parents, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> they just don't know how
to use the new technology, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> new social media. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And as I've grown older, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've realized that's not the case at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just, we just don't have
the time to get into them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or learn how they work.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's just the end-all, be-all. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> Your parents could probably
use everything you use. </garnt>
<garnt> They just don't have the time or energy </garnt>
<connor> to get into something new. </connor>
<connor> And they'd just rather stick </connor>
<connor> with something comfortable, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Right. I think I did
open TikTok one time. </garnt>
<connor> And I was gonna make a video on it, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> like actually using it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I got like five
minutes in and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What the fuck is editing?"
I was so confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "I don't like
this. I'm not used to this. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I'm scared of this." </connor>
<joey> Maybe that's how boomers feel. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Ahh, what is this?" </joey>
<joey> - Unfamiliar territory. Delete. </joey>
<joey> - I mean I could, I'm sure
I could have learned it </joey>
<connor> if I spared the time, but I
was just like, "Oh, fuck this." </connor>
<joey> - Is it worth it? </joey>
<joey> - Cause it took me this
long to just learn fucking </joey>
<joey> YouTube and Twitter. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's like, I feel TikTok's adding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so many extra layers. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which I appreciate when
there's a good TikTok meme. </joey>
<joey> Because a lot of TikTok I see is shit, </joey>
<joey> but when you see a good TikTok meme </joey>
<joey> there's nothing that compares
to the fucking levels of, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't even explain it. </joey>
<joey> There's so many levels of just
meme and internet culture, </joey>
<garnt> condensed into such a
short period of time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've probably seen
some of the funniest shit </garnt>
<garnt> come from TikTok.
- Oh, 100% </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was this one, I
don't know if you saw it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was about, this guy was
doing a TikTok with his, </garnt>
<garnt> he was introducing his girlfriend. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Star Wars Day one! </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey And Garnt] Oh, yeah! </garnt>
<joey> - Today's my birthday </joey>
<joey> and I'm going to introduce
to you my girlfriend. </joey>
<joey> And then it's literally like
the whole hostage situation. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> So good. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then they just add,
an extra layer just keeps </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> getting added, every time. </joey>
<joey> And it just goes so far beyond
what you thought it would </joey>
<joey> that I just think it was fucking genius. </joey>
<joey> - Oh it's genius, so good. </joey>
<joey> - When TikTok's like that,
I fucking love TikTok. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Everything else, I'm an absolute boomer </joey>
<joey> when it comes to TikTok. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause what I will say is
that, the content algorithm </joey>
<joey> on TikTok seems to be so
far beyond other platforms, </joey>
<garnt> where it's so easy to find
content that suits your tastes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whereas, I don't know,
with YouTube now, it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube seems to be going
through a transition period, </garnt>
<garnt> where it doesn't really know
what it wants to recommend you. </garnt>
<garnt> Should it recommend you
shorts or long videos? </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't know any more </garnt>
<garnt> because the internet is
kind of switching around. </garnt>
<joey> - It's also 'cause YouTube's
just tryna compete with </joey>
<garnt> literally every other
social media out there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So when they added like the whole </garnt>
<connor> Instagram Stories replica as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know what
those were fuckin' called. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - They were like. There was that. </garnt>
<joey> And then the Community posts
is literally just Twitter. </joey>
<garnt> - Remember when stories were just Snapchat </garnt>
<garnt> and then Instagram had Stories </garnt>
<connor> and then Twitter had stories, </connor>
<connor> then YouTube has stories. </connor>
<connor> - Everything has stories now. </connor>
<garnt> - Everything has stories. </garnt>
<joey> - I hate the stories on
Twitter. I hate them. </joey>
<joey> - The Fleets, you mean? </joey>
<joey> - The Fleets.
- The Fleets. </joey>
<connor> I fucking think they're so garbage. </connor>
<joey> - I used it once and I was
like, "All right, I hate it." </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> I'm never using that again. </connor>
<connor> - I never look at my friends' ones. </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never post any. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, get that shit outta here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - It's taking up real estate
on my app. I don't want it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's another
shitpost I could be seeing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's that amount of space
that's covered up by Fleets. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like, do I really
need my tweets to delete? </connor>
<connor> I'm not really that into it. </connor>
<connor> I don't think they need to be deleted. </connor>
<connor> Just save it for- </connor>
<joey> - I already have old tweets </joey>
<connor> delete automatically
from my thing, anyway so. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It makes it completely obsolete. </joey>
<connor> - Who wants them to be
deleted in 24 hours? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause no one's looking at it anyway. </connor>
<connor> If it was a tweet that
got deleted in 24 hours, </connor>
<joey> I could kind of understand
what that would be useful for. </joey>
<joey> Like if I'm posting, I'm
going live on my Twitch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Delete it in six hours. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That makes sense. </connor>
<connor> Why is it in a completely
different section, I don't wanna- </connor>
<connor> - I don't. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Have you seen the
Twitter live streams as well? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, yeah. And then also
Twitter just copied Clubhouse </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> with essentially the whole app </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just put it in Twitter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I think it actually suits more, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> but I don't use it. </connor>
<joey> - Is that what that is? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I keep getting
notifications of like </joey>
<garnt> certain artists I follow being like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Starting a Space or something. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they're starting a Space. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just, </connor>
<connor> I think it's just, again I don't use it. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, "What the fuck is this?" </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. I hate it because </connor>
<connor> I didn't know what it was. </connor>
<connor> And some people who I like, </connor>
<connor> I'm a big lurker online, right? </connor>
<joey> And some people are who I
was following started this, </joey>
<joey> you know, Space thing. </joey>
<joey> I joined it and it was like,
"Gigguk has joined the room." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Fuck!". </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Get that shit, no,
they don't need to know. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate that. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Yeah, it's horrible. No
lurking for you. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I just, I don't know
if I'm the boomer here, </connor>
<connor> when I just don't like some
of the new features they add, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't figure out if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just being unreceptive
to the new thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or it's actually terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I don't know anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - 'Cause sometimes things- </garnt>
<connor> - Is it me that changed
or is it the children? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Because sometimes it
turns out to be really good </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> and I like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> But then it's just not integrated
well enough in the start </connor>
<connor> and I'm not really into it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember I was like that </connor>
<connor> with Instagram Stories, as well, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> when it first started. I
was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Deletes in 24 hours? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck's the point
of this? (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> And now I'm just like, all right, </connor>
<connor> finna upload to my story, let's go. </connor>
<connor> - Now I think Stories
are better than posts. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, now I think Stories are great. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, maybe, I don't know, </joey>
<connor> maybe I'm just a fucking
boomer, I don't know, whatever. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's probably the boomer kind of- </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably a boomer. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's probably a 24
year old boomer thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - What can I say? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, you know how we, we're
officially boomers now </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> because we've held a press event. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's how we know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we have. With
actual, probably, boomers </connor>
<connor> that have been on the same stage as us. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I feel bad calling them boomers. </connor>
<connor> They're like really
important people. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's like legitimate government people. </joey>
<joey> - Oh! </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, fucking hell! </joey>
<joey> - Fuck! Okay. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. We say boomers, but
actual official, like political, </joey>
<garnt> important people have
been on the stage, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, you can just tell, I mean, </joey>
<connor> if you guys went on to the FCCJ channel, </connor>
<connor> which a lot of you guys did, </connor>
<connor> I think we had like
4,000 people watching us, </connor>
<joey> when normally I think they have like six. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. A lot of the comments
were really confused. </connor>
<joey> They were like, "What is this?" </joey>
<garnt> "Can somebody explain what happened?" </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we were also
really confused as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so I guess we can
explain what happened. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. What is the FCCJ, Connor? </joey>
<connor> - The Foreign Correspondents
Club of Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Correct.
- Yes. </connor>
<joey> - Which I believe is just
essentially the foreign press. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like an organization </joey>
<joey> for the foreign press in Japan. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And a guy reached out to us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who was the interviewer. Called Fred. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, "Hey guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm writing an article
about YouTubers in Japan." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Foreign Youtubers, talking
about, like depicting Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> And I thought, to be fair,
that's a pretty good article. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I mean, I feel like
most of the younger generation </connor>
<connor> are probably getting a lot of
the information about Japan </connor>
<connor> from us or Chris or you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I know I got way more of
it from that than the guides, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> because most of the guides are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, you should check out the
Kiyomizu-Dero Temple in Kyoto </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then go," you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's super generic, but no, </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> I want to see someone do
something really fuckin' unique. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, he asked us a
question about, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> travel guides, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I just, when he
asked me that question, </garnt>
<garnt> I just thought, who reads
travel guides anymore? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no.
- Boomers. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Nah. You say that,
but even my parents now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They've gone, they were
like, "Oh, I've watched </connor>
<connor> this fellow called Abroad in Japan." </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "Oh, fuck off." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> Oh god, of course you have. </connor>
<connor> - Damn it.
- Of course you have. </connor>
<connor> And even a lot of these travel guides </connor>
<connor> cite people like Abroad in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Which is really funny now. </garnt>
<garnt> Now it's just, instead of
actually finding their own shit, </garnt>
<connor> like "Chris found this
really fuckin' cool thing. </connor>
<connor> Go check it out."
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Japan YouTuber Chris Broad. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But, anyway, so he reached out to us </connor>
<connor> and he showed us the article
and it looked really legit. </connor>
<connor> And it was gonna be in Number 1 Shimbun- </connor>
<connor> - Ichiban Shimbun, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's called.
- Yeah. A news- </garnt>
<connor> - Which is a paper here in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And, as we all know,
we all need, we need a bit more </connor>
<garnt> official backing, 'cause
two of us here are verified </garnt>
<connor> on Twitter.
- Fuck off. </connor>
<connor> - And one isn't. </connor>
<garnt> And the reason I got verified is because </garnt>
<garnt> I had submitted the articles
that were written about me </garnt>
<garnt> and the interviews that I've done. </garnt>
<garnt> But, obviously, someone
here hadn't had any articles </garnt>
<garnt> written about him yet. </garnt>
<joey> - But now we've got an article
about "Trash Taste", so. </joey>
<connor> - I have articles, I
just didn't submit them. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I submitted my Wikipedia, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> which wasn't good enough
for Twitter verification. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, because, what was it? </garnt>
<garnt> The day that you found out
you guys had a Wikipedia, </garnt>
<joey> you uploaded pictures for each other. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. We uploaded pictures. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> - We spent literally like half
an hour of this "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> recording-
- Because- </connor>
<garnt> just trying to update these guys' Wikis. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, somebody had
made a Wikipedia page. </connor>
<garnt> And it's very meticulous. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was very grateful
for it, but I was like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> why didn't they upload a picture? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like this is very
easy. Just upload a picture. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then it got removed
anyway because we- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was like, "They're
legitimate looking pictures." </joey>
<connor> - They're our pictures. What do you mean? </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean we added
each other's pictures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then like less than 12
hours later it was gone. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laughing)
And I'm like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Fuck the system. </connor>
<joey> - How do you get a picture
on Twitter, Instagram, </joey>
<joey> Wikipedia? Fuck. </joey>
<connor> - And yeah, so they reached out to us. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Hey, do
you wanna come and give a, </connor>
<joey> record a pseudo-podcast
on this YouTube channel. </joey>
<joey> - And we checked it out, and
we were like, "Wow." (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's like, some heavy
topics on this channel. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think the week he sent it </connor>
<joey> it was something like
"LGBT rights in Japan". </joey>
<joey> I'm like, well that's
pretty serious stuff. </joey>
<garnt> And then you want us to
come on and just clown </garnt>
<connor> and then ask us about pizza fucking crust? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> But I was like- </garnt>
<garnt> - You can tell that the
"Trash Taste" viewers </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> had invaded the chat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we were having this
very official press conference </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> and then I get asked about
pizza crusts and anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, literally the first question. </joey>
<joey> It was like "All right we
got some questions from the </joey>
<joey> audience right now. </joey>
<joey> And the first question here is </joey>
<joey> "Garnt, what do you think
about pizza crust?"" (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I just find it funny how just
utterly unprepared they were </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> for the amount of questions
there were gonna be sent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I remember, the
person running it just came up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a huge stack of questions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> And the interviewer looked
at this, being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is more questions than
I've ever seen in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> What is going on right now?" </garnt>
<joey> - It was like 20 pieces of paper. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Just like, here's the questions. </connor>
<joey> And the guy's like, "What?" </joey>
<connor> - The fuck? What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> It was quiet fun though, I mean it was- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- A cool experience. </connor>
<joey> - And we were like, I
remember the guy was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, it's on an official thing,
FCCJ is a professional thing </garnt>
<garnt> that does a lot of press
conferences and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> But you guys can just come casually. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, you know, we're
just gonna do it casually, </garnt>
<joey> like you guys do on the podcast. </joey>
<joey> And we were like, "We're wearing suits." </joey>
<joey> - Bet. Bet.
- Bet. </joey>
<garnt> We're wearin' the suits. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah, I mean, there was that
wall of the previous people </garnt>
<garnt> that had done FCCJ press conferences, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they've only started
live broadcasting them recently. </garnt>
<joey> If I understand correctly. </joey>
<joey> But they've been doing them
for like years and years. </joey>
<joey> Most of them have been private. </joey>
<joey> And we saw the Dalai Lama on there. I saw- </joey>
<joey> - Hayao Miyazaki was there. </joey>
<joey> - Hayao Miyazaki. Did I
see Trump on there as well? </joey>
<joey> - Trump. Donald Trump.
- Trump was there. </joey>
<joey> A very young Trump was there. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> Like, fuckin'- </connor>
<connor> - You said the President
of Thailand had done it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the ex Prime Minister of Thailand, </connor>
<connor> I didn't know this, 'cause
I saw a picture there </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "He looks kinda familiar." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Where
do I recognize him from?" </connor>
<connor> So I snap it, send the picture
to my mom and she was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh that's the ex Prime
Minister of Thailand." </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus.
- So I'm just like, "Fuckin'"- </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - So, only the important people frankly. </connor>
<garnt> - "Fuckin' brilliant".
What's going on 'ere? </garnt>
<garnt> - And then, imagine that wall </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the literal
front of the FCCJ building </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is this giant billboard that says like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Tonight on FCCJ: "Trash Taste"". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was so fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we should not
belong on this billboard. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I think, as well, </connor>
<connor> the journalist Fred, was like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> "I want it just to be like a
normal "Trash Taste" episode." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "I don't
think we can do a normal"- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not-
- No. No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not how it works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think we can just
turn up here and just do a </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> normal "Trash", I think I'm
gonna have to be polite." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Was he expecting us
to rock up and be like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oi, dickhead. What's going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I saw a lot of
the comments be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is the most calmest and most polite </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever seen the boys." </garnt>
<garnt> Well, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> If you'd seen the stage that we were on </garnt>
<garnt> you'd probably act the
same as well, honestly. </garnt>
<joey> - If you knew who was on
this stage before us then you </joey>
<joey> would probably act like that as well. </joey>
<connor> - (laughs) I saw a comment
that really made me laugh </connor>
<connor> and it was like, "The water
man's doing God's work. </connor>
<connor> Not a glass empty for a single second." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I was so awkward, as well. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we were just
sittin' there and this guy </connor>
<connor> just creeps over with water, </connor>
<connor> like bent over and I'm like,
"Oh, I feel so bad for him." </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "I don't need water." </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] I was like, "Why
are you topping me up? </connor>
<connor> I'm basically full." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Also, Joey, why did you
have to go to the toilet </connor>
<connor> mid-sentence?
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> You couldn't have waited
until you finished speaking? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was hilarious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I deadass was holding onto
that shit for dear life </joey>
<connor> for like- </connor>
<connor> - You could have done it before
you started the sentence. </connor>
<connor> - For like thirty minutes.
- After you </connor>
<connor> started the sentence. </connor>
<connor> - No, I was like, "I'm gonna
go for as long as I can." </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think about an hour into
it, 'cause it was a two hour, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think, live thing.
- Yeah, it was two hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - About an hour and 10 in,
I was like, "I'm gonna die." </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - My bladder is about to explode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why not before you- </garnt>
<garnt> - But I can hold on, it's like 50 minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> if I just concentrate on
talking and just listening, </garnt>
<garnt> I can get through it.
(Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - And, I got, I forgot what,
what question did I get? </joey>
<joey> - You were actually getting asked </joey>
<garnt> a serious question about Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you were in the
middle of a serious question, </connor>
<connor> and you were just like, "Da-da-da-da. </connor>
<connor> Sorry can I go to the toilet?" </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> Didn't even finish your, you just went. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Joey, what the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I literally got mental whiplash. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I was like, "Oh, this
is Joey being prim and proper </garnt>
<garnt> and professional." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) Then out of
nowhere, he just busts out the, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can I go to the toilet?" </garnt>
<joey> - You can hear the very
moment my heart just snaps, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like "You have to go." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just like, "I'm
gonna cut this sentence short. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> I have to fucking go, otherwise
I'm about to piss onstage </garnt>
<joey> in front of 4000 people." </joey>
<garnt> - I'll be honest, when you
asked to go the toilet, </garnt>
<garnt> I looked at you and I'm
just like, "Should I do it?" </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> "Should I do it?"
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "No. No. Hold! Hold! Hold!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, I looked
at you guys and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> "I can't be the only one
who's busting for a piss." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<joey> - Like Garnt should be dying right now. </joey>
<joey> - I was dying, inside. </joey>
<garnt> My leg was like going
at fuckin' sonic speed. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> It was just like, "Come on. Come on." </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I was like,
"Water boy, if you come near me </joey>
<garnt> one more time and fill up that glass. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to kill you. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> I have stopped drinking water
for the past 30 minutes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause if I drink one more sip of water, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I am going to explode. </connor>
<connor> Stop filling up my glass." </connor>
<joey> - You could've just been like,
"Can you hand me the bottle? </joey>
<connor> Could you hand me?
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> Just give me the bottle boss man." </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I just drink it and then
slowly bring the glass down. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - "This is gonna be a
really weird question. </joey>
<connor> But can you get under the table?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah. I couldn't man. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> I was like, "Do I just ask the question </joey>
<joey> or do I piss onstage?" </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> "Imma ask the question." </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs)
Fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> - He said, he was like,
"Yeah this is the first time </garnt>
<garnt> it's ever happened in
the history of the FCCJ" </garnt>
<garnt> or something, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, "Bullshit!" </garnt>
<joey> There's gotta be another
Asian person who has a bladder </joey>
<joey> just as small as mine. </joey>
<connor> - Sure. Surely there's
someone else out there </connor>
<garnt> has a small bladder like us. </garnt>
<garnt> - I take his word for it, Joey. </garnt>
<connor> I think you made a, you
ruined a press conference. </connor>
<joey> - Or I made history. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> By being the only person- </connor>
<connor> - There's a lot of people
who've made history </connor>
<connor> and it's not this. </connor>
<garnt> - A lot of people have
made history on the FCCJ </garnt>
<joey> but no one's ever taken a piss
break in the middle of one. </joey>
<garnt> - I gotta ask. What did you
guys write in the guest book? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I remember, so we had
to sign a guest book, right? </joey>
<joey> So every guest who's been
on there has to sign it </joey>
<joey> and write some kind of
message or something. </joey>
<joey> And we had some really like
deep, important messages. </joey>
<joey> You know, some talking about some very </joey>
<connor> hot political topics right now. </connor>
<connor> Some people, I think one message
I saw said something like, </connor>
<connor> "We must listen to the
voice of the people. </connor>
<connor> The people will not go unheard. </connor>
<connor> And there's only so long that </connor>
<connor> we can stop listening to them." </connor>
<connor> Or something along those lines. </connor>
<garnt> And then I turn the page
and it's just my message </garnt>
<garnt> being like, "(speaks in foreign
language) Gigguk, 2021." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least you came up
with a kind of funny one. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> I saw that and I was
like, "I can't top that." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? What did you write? </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I think I wrote something
like "I like anime. Yes I do." </joey>
<joey> Or something. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - What?
- Only the biggest of brains. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that the same thought
process you went through </garnt>
<joey> when you came up with The Anime Man? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah, literally. </connor>
<joey> - Mr. Worldwide.
- I like anime. </joey>
<garnt> I like anime. Yes I do.
- I like Anime. Yes I do. </garnt>
<joey> Joey "The Anime Man" Bizinger, 2021. </joey>
<connor> - I just put, "I don't
know what I'm doing here." </connor>
<connor> It's literally all I wrote. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's probably the most honest. </connor>
<connor> - That's probably the most honest one </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "I don't know
what I'm doing here. Connor." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Connor. Not even your
full name. Just Connor. </connor>
<connor> - No, just Connor. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "I don't know
what I'm doing here." </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah, but it was a great experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> It was super weird to be
on something that official. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't even think our
fans knew how official it was </garnt>
<garnt> when they were watching. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, we didn't even
say anything about it </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> until ten minutes before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We were like, "Should we
tweet out that we're doing it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's being live-streamed. We may as well." </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - And now it's the most
viewed video on their channel, </garnt>
<connor> as well.
- Ayy. Let's go. </connor>
<garnt> - I think, probably by the
time this video is live, </garnt>
<connor> it has well over a half 1,000,000 views. </connor>
<connor> - I think so, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's pretty-
- Which is pretty insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it was basically just
like a "Trash Taste" episode </garnt>
<joey> but just polite.
- Polite. </joey>
<joey> - Polite.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - The gentlemen. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did like all the
memes which were like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh damn. POG to the new studio set." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Damn. That's where all the budget went. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's where all the budget went. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it wasn't a "Trash Taste" episode, </garnt>
<connor> it was the Garbage Taste episode. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I remember, I saw their
camera and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Weak. What a weak
camera." One camera angle? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
- One camera angle. </connor>
<connor> - What is this, a SONY
hand-held? What is this? </connor>
<garnt> Come on, get a real one. </garnt>
<connor> - Manual zoom-in. What is this? </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Where's the
lights? Where's the lights here? </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> Come on." Look at this.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - They were like, "This floor
has a restaurant in it." </connor>
<joey> You guys can afford a restaurant,
but not a good camera? </joey>
<joey> Seriously? Come on. Come on. Come on. </joey>
<connor> I'm kidding. I'm kidding,
it was very nice. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we were really
honored to be invited on that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we realized much, I think
it kinda set in much later. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, I think
we actually did something </joey>
<joey> pretty cool and legit." </joey>
<connor> - No, I think it's, I don't
know how many YouTubers </connor>
<connor> can say they've </connor>
<connor> done something like that.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - I think we did a good job. </connor>
<connor> We didn't embarrass ourselves too much. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. I'd say so. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say we were, I mean, we
were way more reserved than </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> on our usual fuckin'
monkey-mode podcast, whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, yeah, it was a great experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And one of the things we've been doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in between building the sets, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Among many other things.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - What else have you guys been up to? </garnt>
<connor> - Nothing.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> Building this office has
taken so goddamn long. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's taken a while. </joey>
<connor> - You guys will get the full scope of it </connor>
<joey> in the "After Dark" vlog, which I think, </joey>
<joey> by the time this goes up might be up? </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe.
- Maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> We still haven't finished
the "After Dark" set yet. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, we still gotta
build that too, fuck. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're still building the
"After Dark" set but we, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> for the first time
ever, I think we're just </connor>
<connor> one week behind our actual
"Trash Taste" episodes, </connor>
<connor> which is the closest we've gone </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> from actually catching up to our backlog. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - I think we've only been like this </joey>
<joey> at the very beginning of
"Trash Taste", by the way. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> "Trash Taste" episode one, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, literally, so. </joey>
<connor> - Well no, actually, I
think, I can't remember, </connor>
<connor> but I know we always have a buffer </connor>
<garnt> and this is definitely the
closest we've ever gotten </garnt>
<garnt> to losing that buffer,
but I mean, the reason </garnt>
<garnt> why we have a buffer anyway
is so that if we miss a week </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> or we need to do something,
it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we don't really talk
about current events </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - And our audience gets
that whenever we do </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> talk about current events. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's very, very outdated
by the time it comes out. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - Like three weeks later.
- Yeah, true, true. </joey>
<connor> So, E3? I'm joking.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, hi. Didn't see you there. Hi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's me, Monke, from "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I'll be doing the ad reads
for today's episodes. </connor>
<connor> And this first one is from
a personal favorite of mine. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> ExpressVPN! </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Watching Netflix while
not using ExpressVPN </connor>
<connor> is like paying for a gym membership </connor>
<connor> and only using the treadmill. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a waste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ExpressVPN does a big brain move </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and lets you change your
location to anywhere in the world </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> so that your internet thinks
you're in another country. </connor>
<connor> And it has over 100 servers in
multiple different countries. </connor>
<connor> If you're like me and want to watch </connor>
<connor> other countries' content,
ExpressVPN is perfect for you. </connor>
<connor> I miss the BBC. </connor>
<connor> Don't take that out of context. </connor>
<connor> And I just want to watch
my home TV programming </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> but sadly you can only watch it in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> But thanks to ExpressVPN, </connor>
<connor> that's no longer a problem anymore. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And I barely notice that it's always on </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> and it's super easy to use. </connor>
<connor> It just takes one click </connor>
<connor> and you're connected to a server. </connor>
<connor> And it's seamless. </connor>
<connor> And it works on my phone, tablet, </connor>
<connor> fridge probably, and my PC. </connor>
<connor> And don't forget that it encrypts </connor>
<connor> all of your data carefully. So
what are you doin'? You know? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> You're paying full price </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for all these streaming content websites </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can't get the full library. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't forget to use our link down below, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> expressvpn.com/trashtaste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you shall receive three
months extra for free, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> using ExpressVPN. </connor>
<connor> So don't forget to use our
link, expressvpn.com/trashtaste, </connor>
<connor> to get three months
for free of ExpressVPN. </connor>
<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you had yet another
crazy taxi experience, </garnt>
<garnt> didn't you, Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> - I did, I did. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'll send a, oh I wish I
could send you the picture, </connor>
<connor> of the route I took, </connor>
<garnt> but I'll do a fake drawing of it for this. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause if I show you actually the route, </connor>
<connor> you'll know where, ah. </connor>
<garnt> - You'll know where
our studio is. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Kinda just doxing where we live. </garnt>
<garnt> - You'll know where our studio
is and where I go to school. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) So I'm not gonna do that. </connor>
<connor> But, essentially, this guy
took what should have been </connor>
<connor> a ten minute journey
and did it 45 minutes. </connor>
<connor> So, what's up with that? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> But, I mean. This is the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> So, what happened was is that, </connor>
<connor> this wasn't a miscommunication
fault or anything, </connor>
<connor> because I didn't tell him where to go. </connor>
<connor> The app tells him where to go. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was using a
ride sharing app, right? </connor>
<connor> So, literally when he
picks me up, he has to say, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, okay. This is where I pick him up. </connor>
<connor> This is where I'm going." </connor>
<connor> And then, when he says he's picked me up, </connor>
<connor> it will tell him, on
the thing, where to go. </connor>
<connor> And I got in the car and I saw </connor>
<connor> where it was telling him
to turn and do all that </connor>
<connor> and it was where I'd told him to go. </connor>
<connor> And, for some reason, this
guy just, he ignored the turn. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Okay. Whatever." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> He probably knows a better route, right?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe he knows, 'cause
he was like 80 or 90. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Very, very, very old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "He knows the
streets better than the maps, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so then he misses the next turning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, "All
right. Okay. All right." </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> Misses the next turning. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Okay, this
is getting a little weird." </connor>
<connor> - Must be some local route. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm like. And then
he misses another turning. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> And this is getting to the point
where I'm like, "All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This man is just straight
up going the wrong way." </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> So I ask him, in terrible
Japanese, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Where are you going?" </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> And he said somewhere in Roppongi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is totally not where I was going. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh." </joey>
<joey> - Literally the opposite. </joey>
<joey> - The opposite way of where I was going. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "No, no,
no. Don't go that way. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Go the other way." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he was like, "What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> What? Where do you wanna go?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I told him.
- "I can't hear you, what?" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I told him where I wanted
to go and he was like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> And I show him the app and he was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, let me put my glasses on." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "You're driving
without your glasses on?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> You can't read this and you're driving? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "They do this every time." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time I, (grunts). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This annoys me to death
about Taxi drivers here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time I show them
on my phone where to go, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> they have to put glasses on. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "If you can't read." </joey>
<joey> - Why are you driving? </joey>
<connor> - Why are you driving
without these glasses on? </connor>
<connor> What is this, blurs? Or is this like Ozu? </connor>
<connor> Tryna like? What are you doing? </connor>
<joey> - And no wonder you can't see
the fuckin' navigation system. </joey>
<joey> - So, yeah. He completely
goes the wrong way </joey>
<joey> and I eventually get to figure out, </joey>
<joey> to explain to him where I wanna go. </joey>
<joey> And it was just 'cause
there was some weird thing </joey>
<joey> with the address that I put in, </joey>
<joey> where it wasn't quite what I said it was. </joey>
<joey> But even though the address in
the thing was still correct. </joey>
<connor> But I had to then reconfirm to him </connor>
<connor> that I was going to the place
where it told him to go. </connor>
<connor> Which is like, why do you even ask me? </connor>
<connor> Don't talk me. Just take
me where I wanna go. </connor>
<connor> - Are you sure you wanna go
to the place you specified? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what I don't get.
I told you where I wanna go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Maybe you can confirm?"
and I said, "Yes." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What? What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm losing my mind, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the thing is racking
up to be pretty expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> 'Cause this is like a 45 minute journey. </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty fuckin' expensive.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially in Tokyo, as well. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you know, the
journey I was gonna take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just 10 minutes and
it was supposed to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 10, 15 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Not a big deal. </connor>
<connor> It turned into like a 45, $50 ride. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Hold the fuck up." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> And also, after I eventually
told him where to go, </connor>
<connor> I was pretty stressed
out, I was like, "Argh." </connor>
<connor> And I was trying to watch YouTube videos </connor>
<connor> and I was looking at my phone </connor>
<connor> and then suddenly, the
guys just emergency stops. </connor>
<connor> So, my fuckin' bag goes flying, </connor>
<connor> my water bottle goes flying. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yo, what the fuck?" </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is like the best bit! (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - (laughs) And yeah. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Listen, I don't
if you're going for the </connor>
<connor> worst taxi speedrun any% here. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) I don't
know what you're tryna do. </joey>
<joey> You are literally fucking
everything up here." </joey>
<joey> - He's deadass like a "GTA" player. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. He nearly crashed the taxi. </joey>
<joey> And it was unfortunate
'cause I couldn't see </joey>
<joey> if it was his fault or not. </joey>
<connor> It looked like it wasn't his fault. </connor>
<connor> So I didn't blame him that. </connor>
<connor> But it was also just kind of annoying. </connor>
<garnt> - Man's just out here
playing "Crazy Taxi". </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah he was literally
playing "Crazy Taxi", bro. </garnt>
<connor> And then, immediately, okay, </connor>
<connor> after this, as well, I think
because he was panicked, </connor>
<connor> because he'd taken me wildly off route, </connor>
<connor> he'd nearly crashed the car. </connor>
<joey> - He wildly fucked up. </joey>
<connor> - He pretty much fucked up everything </connor>
<connor> a taxi driver could fuck up. </connor>
<connor> So he started speeding </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get me to where I needed to go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I did not feel comfortable
with this man speeding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after he just nearly
crashed the fuckin' taxi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) So I was like,
I asked him, I asked him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Can you go a little," in Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> "Can you go a little slower?" </connor>
<connor> And then he panically
turned his full head around. </connor>
<connor> "No, no, no, no, no, no." </connor>
<connor> - Hold on, I gotta put my glasses on </connor>
<joey> to check the speedometer. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Normally, I normally am
fully accepting of the, </joey>
<joey> that kind of turn. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, yeah. Okay, got you, got you". </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> He was like, "Wait, what did you say?" </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "No, no, no." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> He's going like 80 on a 50 road. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Stop. No, no, no." </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna say anything,
I'm not gonna say anything. </connor>
<connor> And then, I was like, "This
is the worst fucking taxi ride </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> of my goddamn life." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, every taxi driver
in Japan has their full </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> company information and name
and everything on the thing. </connor>
<connor> So I took a picture of
it and my phone has the, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> in Japan every phone has to make a noise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you take a picture, it shutters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There is a ch-ch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So my phone did that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I think he heard it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So anyway, he finally
got to me where I was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One piece. I had to check myself
when I got out of the car. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Am I alive? Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And as I was getting out, he
slowly pulls his wallet out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> And I'm like, "Are you tryna bribe me?" </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> To not complain. </connor>
<connor> - Is that even legal?
- I don't know if it's legal. </connor>
<garnt> - Probably not legal.
- Probably not. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably not. I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> He didn't tell me, "Don't say anything." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he was tryna pay the difference, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of what he went over. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> 'Cause it worked out to be
around what he went over. </garnt>
<garnt> So the fee should've been like $15. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like 40. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he gave me like 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Fine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what, I don't want
to complain to your company. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> (Joey laughs) I don't
want to have to do that. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I wanted to get my
money back from the company, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, "This
is fuckin' terrible." </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if that's me being a Karen. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I just think that I don't
want to get ripped off </connor>
<connor> and I was like- </connor>
<connor> - No. I mean- </connor>
<connor> - I don't think it's a Karen to be like, </connor>
<connor> "I almost died. Can I have money back?" </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I, dude, I hate, I do not, </joey>
<connor> I will never ever complain
about someone who is doing a job </connor>
<connor> where you don't make much money. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm just like, I don't feel like- </connor>
<garnt> - No, I get it. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think you get
paid enough to warrant </connor>
<connor> you losing some money. </connor>
<connor> You know, if I have problems
at fast food places, </connor>
<garnt> I'll never, I'll just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You know what? It wasn't
great. I'll keep it to myself." </garnt>
<garnt> I'll deal with it. </garnt>
<joey> I might leave not a great review. </joey>
<connor> But I won't be super harsh. </connor>
<joey> - You're not gonna be like,
"Where's the manager?" </joey>
<garnt> - That's the British way to do things. </garnt>
<joey> - I just, again I don't
want to make someone's life </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> more difficult than it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life is fuckin' hard enough as it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> But, there is a certain
point where I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You have done such an awful
job where I think it's okay </garnt>
<garnt> for me to want my money back." </garnt>
<garnt> - Well yeah, of course. Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like taxi's understandable. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause your life is in their
hands, as well. (coughs) </connor>
<connor> - And literally, everything was terrible. </connor>
<connor> So I was just gonna complain to the, </connor>
<connor> not to his company first, I
was gonna complain to the app, </connor>
<garnt> to see if I, 'cause the
app can normally just, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he'll still get paid, I believe, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they'll just refund me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is what I wanted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because fuck the
multi-conglomerate company. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - But instead, he just took out
the middle-man and was like, </joey>
<joey> "Here."
- Yeah, instead </joey>
<joey> he paid me 30 bucks. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, "Sure."
So I gave him five stars. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - He's like, "I don't speak any English. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> But you speak this language, right?" </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
- Yeah, I think so. </connor>
<connor> - "You know what I'm sayin'.
You know what I'm sayin'." </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "You know
what? The man's hustling. </connor>
<garnt> All right. Fine. Fine. Fine." </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - Literally bribed a five
star Uber review from you. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- I was like, "You know what? </connor>
<connor> The man knew he fucked up big time </connor>
<connor> and he wanted to try and fix it. </connor>
<connor> I respect it. I'm down." </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna go through this. </connor>
<connor> You don't wanna go through this. </connor>
<joey> Let's just walk away from this happening. </joey>
<joey> - You don't speak Japanese, </joey>
<joey> but you speak the ones and zeroes. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Well, 'cause all I wanted
was the difference back. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - I'm happy to pay the taxi fee. </connor>
<joey> I just don't wanna be
charged like 30, $40 extra </joey>
<joey> when I don't need to be. </joey>
<garnt> I'm not like a fuckin', </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not a cheap guy.
- I get that. </garnt>
<connor> - I just don't wanna be ripped off. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like taxi drivers
here are very aware of that. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> Because most people in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially in the service industry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are fuckin' super nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - They don't rip you off.
They don't rip you off. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - They do not rip you off
at all, 'cause I remember, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had to take a pretty long
taxi that went via the highway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but there was really bad
traffic there on that day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, it took like, I think
like 20 minutes longer than </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> they journey shoulda taken. </connor>
<connor> And the taxi driver, he
told me that he was gonna </connor>
<connor> stop the meter early because he feels bad </connor>
<connor> that they were stuck
in traffic for so long. </connor>
<connor> Even though they went via the highway. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just like, "Damn, man that's"- </connor>
<connor> - That's not even his fault. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's not even your fault. </connor>
<garnt> You're a real one, man. You're a real one. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, when you taxi,
you're just gamble, man. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause maybe the highways are congested, </garnt>
<garnt> that's the risk you take. </garnt>
<connor> - That's just part of the risk. </connor>
<garnt> And I feel like just
taxi drivers, or anyone, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so weird to me that
you can't tip people here. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause out of every country
that I've lived in and been to, </garnt>
<garnt> the one country I've wanted
to tip people the most </garnt>
<garnt> is here in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just, it feels bad </garnt>
<garnt> because I've gotten some of
the best service I ever have </garnt>
<garnt> anywhere in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> And I can't pay them a bit
more to show my appreciation. </garnt>
<joey> - I think the only service
in Japan that you can </joey>
<garnt> actually tip people is Uber Eats. </garnt>
<joey> But that's just because
it's integrated in the app. </joey>
<connor> - But that's just 'cause it's Uber. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah Uber Eats is Uber, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Uber Eats, which is an
international company, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I always tip if it's raining. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I always do, yeah. 100%. 100%. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel so bad for them when I order food </joey>
<joey> when it's raining. </joey>
<connor> They turn up at the door
fuckin' soaked. I'm like. </connor>
<garnt> - Especially when it's
typhoon season as well. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> You're just like, "Damn, man." </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, "$3 okay?" </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - "$3 for your troubles, sir." </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. It's just, oh fuck. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> It was such an awful
experience, it was just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I felt so bad, 'cause I was in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was tryna optimize
it, so I ordered food, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like lunch, to arrive at the studio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> For when I was gonna get
there and then I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> "Joey, can you get my Uber Eats?" </joey>
<connor> - No, 'cause I was waiting at the studio </connor>
<connor> and Connor was like, "Yeah
I'm 10 minutes away." </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "Cool." </joey>
<joey> I'll see him very soon then. </joey>
<joey> Like 30 minutes pass, and
I'm like, "Where is he?" </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I saw that on the message stream. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I wasn't there
at the studio that day. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Why
is Connor telling Joey </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> to get his food?"
- Can you get my food? </connor>
<connor> - This white boy getting
more privileged every day. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - "Joey, I don't wanna deal
with the Uber Eats man, </connor>
<connor> please get my." </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - "I can't speak Japanese,
can you get my food for me?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You're the (speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> Joey, so you can do it." </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ, man. Fuck. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I'm always
scared, man, to get on taxis. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's like, again, in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 85% of the time, they're
over the age of 70. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> And I just don't know what to expect. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes they're the
most pristine, proper, </garnt>
<garnt> fuckin' Batman's assistant
levels of amazing driving. </garnt>
<garnt> But then, sometimes you get
people like that, right? </garnt>
<joey> Where it's like, you shouldn't
be behind a steering wheel. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I had a guy one time. </connor>
<connor> I got in the car. Started
speaking fluent English to me. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Wow." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
- Really? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "Wow." He's like, "Are you
comfortable with the AC?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "What?
What did you just say?" </connor>
<connor> - In like a really velvety voice? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> The man sounded like PSY,
from "Gangnam Style". </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was he old? </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Nah. No, he looked like 30. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Wow. Wow. Wow." </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Well that's like an extra
star point, right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you doin' being a taxi driver? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I was so confused. </connor>
<garnt> I was just so caught off-guard by it. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Yeah. Yeah. It's
great. It's great. Wow. Wow." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause normally they don't
ask you anything in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally if someone's
below the age of 60, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> you rarely see someone below
the age of 60 be a taxi driver, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> especially here in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh. I'll just give you a life hack </connor>
<connor> for if you ever come
to Japan and use taxis. </connor>
<connor> They're only ever gonna
ask you two things. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> Where you're going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And do you want to use the highway? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that'll always be the second question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just say yes. Just always say yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't say no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so once you've told them
where you're going, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> Even if you don't understand </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck they're saying, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So once they've figured
out where you're going, </garnt>
<garnt> about like five minutes into your drive, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> they'll turn around and ask you something. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> And just say yes.
(Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause they're gonna ask
you about the highway. </connor>
<connor> - That's just a Japan
life hack, in general. </connor>
<connor> If I don't understand what
someone's saying, I just say, </connor>
<connor> (speaks in foreign language). </connor>
<garnt> (Joey speaks in foreign language) </garnt>
<garnt> - Just say, (speaks in foreign language). </garnt>
<garnt> You'll remember this. If you
come to Japan, remember this. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> He's gonna ask you
something two minutes in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five minutes into the taxi drive. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> He's gonna be in the middle
of driving. Just say yes. </connor>
<connor> He's asking if you
wanna go on the highway. </connor>
<connor> Just say yes. </connor>
<garnt> - Someone probably could've
asked me if I could be </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> like an accomplice in a murder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I've said yes to it, in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Probably don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I've just said yes to everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The only time I know, I
actually have to pay attention, </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> is when there's like, "What,
are you sure about that? </garnt>
<joey> Did you know, did you just </joey>
<joey> press agree on terms and conditions? </joey>
<joey> Do you know what you just agreed to?" </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - And they do like a
fuckin' "Millionaire" thing, </garnt>
<garnt> they're like, "Final answer?" </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) "Final answer?
Are you sure it's a yes?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Oh, oh, oh,
can you repeat that?" Oh shit. </connor>
<garnt> And then even when they repeat that, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Yeah?" </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause on the signs in
Japan, on the highways, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> it just says "Expressway". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I just assumed, they
call it expressway too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's not called expressway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - They call it, what is it?
(speaks in foreign language) </joey>
<connor> (Joey, Connor and Garnt
speak in foreign language) </connor>
<connor> (Joey speaks in foreign language) </connor>
<connor> (Connor speaks in foreign language) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. That's what I said. </connor>
<connor> - Which is direct translation
for "High, fast road." </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Ah, well.
- So there you go. </joey>
<connor> - But I was also told that
they understand "highway". </connor>
<connor> But I was confused, so
I never said "Highway", </connor>
<connor> 'cause it always says "Expressway." </connor>
<connor> So I never said highway. </connor>
<connor> But they'll understand if you say highway. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, highway, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Second life hack. </garnt>
<garnt> If you don't know a Japanese word, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> say it in (speaks in foreign
language), then- (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, really.
- And then- </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - It'll feel racist, but it's not. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so if you don't
know, if you can't read </garnt>
<garnt> (speaks in foreign
language), just say it in the </garnt>
<garnt> most racist Japanese
accent you can think of </garnt>
<garnt> and they will maybe
understand you, sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah dude, sometimes,
when I'm streaming in it </garnt>
<garnt> and I have to say a word
like that, people Pepe laugh, </garnt>
<connor> "Connor just said it a funny accent." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "No. That-
- That's literally </connor>
<connor> how they say it.
- They won't understand </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> unless I do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I love how all these
people, yeah, because </joey>
<joey> everyday words have just become </joey>
<garnt> more and more English now, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause say, like "Spicy",
right? Do you want spicy food? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "No, the
Japanese word for it is </garnt>
<garnt> (speaks in foreign language)." </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] I've always said that. </connor>
<connor> - You can also just say spicy. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. Oh, you can?
- Oh, you can? </connor>
<connor> - Well, I like that. I didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> - And it's the exact same thing. </connor>
<connor> - Didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> - Like "sexy"? It's just "sexy." </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> "Milk"? It's just "milk." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I learnt, what was it? </garnt>
<garnt> A recent Japanese word, oh cafe. </garnt>
<joey> Which is like (speaks in foreign language) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, (speaks in foreign language). </garnt>
<garnt> - (speaks in foreign language)
is the proper Japanese word. </garnt>
<joey> Or you can just say coffee.
- But everyone just says </joey>
<connor> cafe here. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause your grandma will say </joey>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> My grandma will say (speaks
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but everyone else will just say coffee. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Everything's becoming English, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I've realized, actually, </garnt>
<garnt> in the place that I am now, </garnt>
<garnt> it's more easier just
to say yes to everything </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't fully understand it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember me and Connor
had another taxi experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no! This guy fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which was-
- drove me up the wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which was on my birthday night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So after we hung out we
went back to Meilyne's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and we went back to my house pretty late. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we all live in the same area </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so me and Connor got a taxi back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we were, this was at like 5:00 AM, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were very drunk and very tired </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so, Connor orders a taxi via DiDi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is kinda like Uber. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> So the address is already
in the taxi, right? </connor>
<connor> - Again, he knows where we're going. </connor>
<connor> - He knows where we're going. </connor>
<garnt> - It literally tells
him a pinpoint location </garnt>
<garnt> where to go and how to get there. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So we get in the taxi and he asks us, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, where do you want to go?" </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't know that he
already had the address </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause he did already have the address </garnt>
<garnt> and it was in his system, </garnt>
<garnt> so I tell him, "Please go
to this address," right? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I think you said
the station near our house </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> and I think that's when he got confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause then now he's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now he's like, "Wait is it
the station or the address?" </garnt>
<garnt> And bear in mind, they're literally </garnt>
<joey> two minutes away from each other, </joey>
<joey> so I'm like, "Just go there
and it'll be all right, buddy." </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> Both of the addresses are
in the exact same place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just go there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I think then he
started getting really like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like, "Wait, which one though?" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> And then every five minutes,
this man would turn around </connor>
<connor> and ask, "Which one are going?" </connor>
<connor> Like, "Here? Here? Here?" </connor>
<garnt> And we were like, "Yes. Yes." </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was trying to explain to him, </garnt>
<garnt> "It's near the station. </garnt>
<garnt> It's near the station." Right, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And he's just like, "But
it's a different address, </garnt>
<garnt> Where do you want me to go?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Just go to the," </garnt>
<joey> my Japanese wasn't good enough to say </joey>
<joey> "Go to this exact address." </joey>
<garnt> I was just like, "Just go near the station </garnt>
<joey> and we'll direct you." </joey>
<garnt> And he was like, (heavy breathing) </garnt>
<joey> "Am I going the right way? Am I?" (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Do these taxi drivers
not have freedom of choice? </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<joey> - It's literally the same road. </joey>
<connor> It's not even remotely far. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's like a computer
tryna run two programs </joey>
<garnt> at the same time. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "Which one do I
open first? I don't know." </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally gave, he was like an AI </garnt>
<joey> and I just gave him a logic bomb. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> That's how he acted and I was just like, </joey>
<joey> and I just thought to myself, </joey>
<joey> this is not on the taxi driver, </joey>
<connor> 'cause obviously it was
just a language barrier, </connor>
<connor> but I just thought to myself, </connor>
<connor> "I should've just said
(speaks in foreign language)." </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) I should've just said yes. </connor>
<garnt> And just said, "Yes,
please go to the address." </garnt>
<connor> - You didn't use the life hack, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Also, we did say (speaks
in foreign language) </garnt>
<connor> like seven times in a row. </connor>
<connor> And then he still did keep
asking and I was like- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah because he probably asked, </joey>
<joey> "Do you want to go the station?" </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> You're like (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Or did you want to go to the house?" </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> (speaks in foreign language) </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> It's like, (heavy breathing)
"Which one though?" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - We used the life hack, but. </garnt>
<garnt> - But also, everything we said to him, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> he was clearly, he was quite old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and his hearing was clearly not great, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> 'cause everything we said
we had to repeat but louder. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> And I feel like some things
we said pretty fuckin' loud. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> He didn't understand. And
I was like, "I'm done." </connor>
<joey> - Or maybe that was just your, </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe in your guys'
drunk mind you were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it reality it was like, (gibberish). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was very, very sober at this point </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> 'cause I was just tryna sleep. </connor>
<connor> And he kept waking us up, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm fightin' for my life </connor>
<garnt> just to get five minutes
of sleep here, buddy." </garnt>
<connor> - Sydney was sitting next to me. </connor>
<garnt> She doesn't remember any of it. </garnt>
<garnt> She was passed the fuck out. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my god. This is like,
Sydney kept making it worse. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause Sydney was drunk and kept going </connor>
<connor> (speaks in foreign
language), saying things. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> And we were like, "Sydney
shut up. Literally shut up. </connor>
<connor> You're confusing the man." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) I completely forgot. </connor>
<connor> - She literally kept making it worse. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I was literally about to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Garnt, tell her to shut,
get Sydney to shut up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swear to God." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause she was clearly not even awake </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> and she'd be like, (speaks
in foreign language). </connor>
<connor> And we're like, "We're not
even there. Not even there." </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> She would say like, "Oh, here's fine." </connor>
<connor> Or like, "Keep going." </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> And we're like nowhere near. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she'd be like, "Here's fine." </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> No. Sydney, Sydney,
Sydney. Please. Please. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) She was dream
Japanese talking in her sleep. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, it was,
I was like, "No! No!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I found it impressive, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> 'cause it was like she
was speaking Japanese </connor>
<connor> that was off enough that it made no sense </connor>
<garnt> in the context that we were in. </garnt>
<garnt> But it made enough sense that </garnt>
<garnt> someone would say it in a
taxi, right? So. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - All the correct things
you would say in a taxi. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember, I'd keep
going like, "Sydney, no. </joey>
<connor> Please. Please, Sydney.
Please stop. Sydney, stop." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but we eventually
got home after what, </garnt>
<joey> it felt like, two hours. </joey>
<joey> - So wait, did he drop
you off at the station </joey>
<connor> or you house?
- Yeah he did, he did. </connor>
<connor> He dropped us off at the station. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, okay, okay.
- I was just like, </joey>
<joey> - He finally came up with it. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even want to try
to direct him to my house. </joey>
<joey> Just stop. Just let me
out. Let me out, bro. </joey>
<garnt> - Fair enough.
- Let me out. </garnt>
<garnt> Get me out of here. </garnt>
<connor> I can't stand this.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I mean, that's
part of the reason why </connor>
<connor> we're looking to move, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Have we talked about how
we are looking to move? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause we've-
- Yeah you've talked about </joey>
<garnt> moving, right?
- I've moved already, </garnt>
<connor> yeah, a month ago now, at this rate. </connor>
<connor> - I'm currently in the process of, </connor>
<connor> I've applied for a
place, just hoping I get, </connor>
<connor> I mean, I find out this week,
so just praying I get it. </connor>
<garnt> - I think doing the whole
moving process again </garnt>
<garnt> has reminded me how much
of a nightmare it was </garnt>
<garnt> the first time, to get a place here. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just didn't
realize, or I'd forgotten, </garnt>
<garnt> because I had everything set up. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I'm going through the
process again, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Damn, it was a nightmare." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'd completely forgotten about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's equal parts exciting
and equal parts just dread. </joey>
<connor> - So far, it's not been too bad. </connor>
<connor> It's been really annoying being rejected </connor>
<connor> for really petty reasons. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's been quite annoying. </connor>
<connor> But that's, I feel like
I'm so used to that now, </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, "I'm not
the right nationality? </connor>
<connor> All right, cool. See ya."
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> Fist bump. "Later, dude." </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm kinda used to it but, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, how many places
have you been rejected from </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> so far, just one, right? </joey>
<connor> - Ah, two, two, two.
- Oh, two. </connor>
<connor> - But some of them were not rejections </connor>
<joey> 'cause I didn't apply but
some of them were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh no, no. No foreigners." </joey>
<joey> - Ah, just straight up? </joey>
<joey> - So is that like a
rejection? Do you count that? </joey>
<connor> - No, that's a rejection, I'd say. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause that's like, I feel like- </garnt>
<connor> - That's like 10, 15 then, right? </connor>
<connor> - Half of them are gone. </connor>
<connor> Half of the whole Japanese housing market </connor>
<connor> is just unavailable to me. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd say it's like even more than half. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if you have the money
to pay for this house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just can't get it, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> for whatever reason </joey>
<garnt> - I think we talked about this. </garnt>
<connor> - We've talked about
this a lot. Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Episode two or something,
where were talking about how </connor>
<joey> it's fuckin' impossible for
foreigners to rent in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - It's also, I feel like this
happens everywhere though, </connor>
<connor> you have to kind of like
decide what's important to you </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> and you have to make sacrifices
depending on, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if you have unlimited
budget, there's not gonna be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you wanna get a house in certain areas, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> it's just not possible in Central Tokyo. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. I mean, unless you're actually </joey>
<garnt> buying the property, you
don't have to do that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - The thing is, when I'm
looking at houses now, </garnt>
<garnt> the first question I ask is, </garnt>
<garnt> "Has anyone else applied for this yet?" </garnt>
<connor> And if the answer's yes, I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Well, that's pretty
much my chances gone." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Soa didn't tell me this,
but if someone asks to apply, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> the odds of you getting it are super low. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's normally just
first come, first served. </connor>
<connor> And if the person before you is Japanese, </connor>
<connor> they're probably not gonna get rejected </connor>
<connor> unless they're like super sketch. </connor>
<garnt> So if, yeah, like you said,
they took me to see places </garnt>
<garnt> and half of them would
already been applied for </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "What am I doing here?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> What, so you can and of
course, the two places- </connor>
<joey> - Check out this place
you probably won't get. </joey>
<connor> - So the first place they took
me to visit was five houses </connor>
<connor> and the two that I really, really liked, </connor>
<connor> of course, were the two
that had applications. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Great. So
now I've fallen in love </connor>
<connor> with two places and I
can't fuckin' have them." </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) It's like a literal cock-tease. </joey>
<connor> - It is! It is. </connor>
<connor> - So now you've shown
me what my standards are </connor>
<garnt> and you've taken them away from me. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, "This is what you could have </connor>
<connor> if you had a Japanese passport." </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - And so then, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, well I don't like the other three, </garnt>
<garnt> and so can we find new ones?" </garnt>
<garnt> We found new ones,
didn't like any of them. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Well this sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause now I don't like any
of these fucking things." </garnt>
<garnt> And eventually, found a
few that I kinda liked </garnt>
<connor> and I've applied for
one, that I quite like. </connor>
<connor> Maybe neighbors might be
an issue, we'll find out, </connor>
<connor> but I'm just gonna soundproof the room </connor>
<connor> before I move anything in. </connor>
<connor> - Well again, that's a sacrifice
you have to take, really. </connor>
<connor> It's pretty fuckin' hard.
I mean, I think the one- </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna have neighbors, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> The one sacrifice I took with my place is </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just slightly kind of out of the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially when you go into Tokyo. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> But everything else is, fuckin' love it. </connor>
<joey> - It's a great house.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I'm just
planning to put soundproof panels </connor>
<connor> on the wall, and I'm just gonna
put that on the side walls </connor>
<garnt> and the roof and the carpet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you got your first
noise complaint, didn't you? </garnt>
<connor> - I did get a noise complaint, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - After all this time. </connor>
<connor> - I know. I was definitely
pushing, to be fair. </connor>
<joey> I think 'cause when I first moved in, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't even walk at
full speed around the house. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'd heard how careful I had to be. </joey>
<connor> And then I realized,
oh, nothing's happening. </connor>
<joey> Oh, so I start walking normally, you know? </joey>
<joey> - So you kept testing the limit. </joey>
<garnt> - Slowly keep pushing that. </garnt>
<connor> - And then the "Apex" stream
starts getting later and later. </connor>
<joey> - The "Apex" at 2:00 AM streams did the, </joey>
<joey> pushed it over the limit. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what it was that did it. </connor>
<connor> Because when I go the complaint, </connor>
<connor> I hadn't done any late night streams </connor>
<connor> that I would say were loud. </connor>
<connor> I'd only done one and it
was a very, very quiet one. </connor>
<connor> I know it was, 'cause
I was actually talking. </connor>
<connor> I wonder what did it, 'cause
there was some where I was </connor>
<connor> full-on shouting at 2:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't get it. So I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we go a noise
complaint at our place. </joey>
<connor> But a week-
- It was the speedrun. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but a week after the
actual event that had happened. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just like, "Why am I
getting the complaint now, </connor>
<connor> after a week?" </connor>
<connor> - I think 'cause it goes to the agency </connor>
<connor> and then the agency tells you, right? </connor>
<joey> - But the agency has my
number on speed dial. </joey>
<connor> So they could easily have just
called me the next morning </connor>
<connor> and been like, "Ah were
you loud last night?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they could have been
like, "We've got a snitch, bro. </connor>
<connor> It's kinda cringe." </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </joey>
<joey> - No, no, because I
was so confused, right. </joey>
<connor> - "We got you, bro. Don't worry about it" </connor>
<joey> - No, legit, I was like, "Who said it?" </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> "Who?" I was literally like
Liam Neeson from "Taken". </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Who sent you?" </connor>
<joey> - Well, they won't tell you. </joey>
<connor> I understand, privacy reasons. </connor>
<connor> But also, I'd like to know so that </connor>
<connor> I can kind of maybe put
some stuff on that wall. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right. 'Cause
if I know who it is, </joey>
<connor> at least tell me, 'cause they
didn't even tell if it was </connor>
<connor> someone from the same building. </connor>
<connor> - "Tell me who's a little bitch </connor>
<connor> so I can soundproof that sound." </connor>
<connor> - No, because if I knew it was, say, </connor>
<connor> the neighbors downstairs,
then I could be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, okay. Maybe I should do
some padding on the floor." </garnt>
<garnt> Or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Get a thick-ass carpet.
- Or a thick-ass carpet </garnt>
<garnt> or something to avoid it. </garnt>
<connor> Or if it's people across the
road, well then it's like, </connor>
<connor> well I can't do fucking
anything about that. </connor>
<connor> So, I guess. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - Meilyne, just say hi.
- Meilyne, what is this, </joey>
<joey> the FCCJ?
- Go on, go on, go on Meilyne. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> You've gotta be water- </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - Gotta shake his (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - Water boy. </connor>
<connor> If I knew who the
neighbor was then I could </connor>
<joey> take precautions and work so
that I don't have to do it. </joey>
<connor> - I always understand that
if it was me complaining </connor>
<connor> I probably wouldn't want
to be named but also, </connor>
<connor> you could maybe- </connor>
<joey> - I don't need to know
the specific person. </joey>
<connor> I just need to know is
it a neighbor below me? </connor>
<connor> Is it someone across the road? </connor>
<joey> Is it in this building? I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I guess they're worried
that you might go to him </joey>
<joey> and be like, "Yo. Open the fuck, </joey>
<connor> why you complaining, little bitch? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) Why you
complaining? Why you such a-" </connor>
<connor> - "Say it to my face, motherfucker!" </connor>
<connor> - But then also, you could be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey man, can I ask you when
you need me to be quiet?" </connor>
<garnt> You know, is there stuff goin, 'cause </garnt>
<garnt> if my neighbors, dude, they can shout </garnt>
<garnt> all they fuckin' want. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> But if I was, if I had a kid or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> then maybe I'd be like, "Hey,
keep it down after 10:00. </joey>
<connor> Shout in the day. I don't give a fuck." </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem,
'cause if that was me, </connor>
<connor> and I was getting noise complaints </connor>
<connor> from, say, someone from upstairs, </connor>
<connor> I'd just fucking go up
to them and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, I'm not gonna snitch
on you or something, </connor>
<connor> can we just talk it
out so that we can come </connor>
<connor> to some kind of mutual agreement?" </connor>
<garnt> But, in Japan, no one fuckin' does that. </garnt>
<connor> They're just like, "Ring,
ring. Help me please." </connor>
<connor> - But I asked, I asked,
like "What can they do? </connor>
<connor> What can they do with this complaint? </connor>
<joey> What happens?" </joey>
<joey> They were like. </joey>
<joey> - They can technically get you evicted, </joey>
<garnt> if they tried really freaking hard. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially if you're a foreigner. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I mean, from my last place, </garnt>
<connor> that woman downstairs tried to do that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "How-" </connor>
<joey> - Until I (speaks in foreign
language) her. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "How fuckin'
hard to do they have to try </joey>
<joey> to get me evicted, then?" </joey>
<joey> Is it like, "How much effort
do they have to go through?" </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think they said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "A lot of work and it
probably wouldn't happen." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm just like, "Well.
I'm not that bad." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not shouting all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I have turned my volume
down during streams. </joey>
<joey> - At least you're not doing
construction at like 2:00 AM. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't think they'll
kick you out or anything. </joey>
<joey> - Just fuckin' get the
drill out, you know? </joey>
<connor> - Like "Shawshank"-
- Who's gonna complain now? </connor>
<connor> (imitates drilling) </connor>
<connor> - "Shawshank Redemption" in this shit, </connor>
<connor> waiting for the lightening to strike. </connor>
<connor> (imitates hammering) </connor>
<connor> But, I think I've done like, </connor>
<connor> they clearly don't care during the day, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I've done voice
lines during the day </joey>
<joey> where I'm full on screaming. </joey>
<joey> Like full on. </joey>
<joey> No they don't care during
the day. It's only at night. </joey>
<joey> - I bet some neighbors
do care during the day. </joey>
<joey> They're like-
- I mean, I think- </joey>
<joey> - The pompous neighbors,
they're like, "Oh, god, </joey>
<garnt> I'm uncomfortable at 2:00 PM." </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe on the week-
- "YouTuber? What is that? </connor>
<connor> Voice actor? </connor>
<connor> God, I just thought someone
was getting murdered up there." </connor>
<garnt> - The agent, who was finding
me my apartment was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I watched your YouTube." </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't tell her my YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> But they had to know my company. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. Of course.
- Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so I think she just
went on the company's site, </garnt>
<joey> saw my name, she watched
my YouTube videos." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, God." </joey>
<joey> - You just got "Are You YouTuber"-ed. </joey>
<connor> - "Are You YouTuber?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like, "Oh, cool.
Which one did you watch?" </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "Oh I
watched you drinking alcohol." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, with
Chris, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God." </connor>
<connor> - Of all the videos.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - What a terrible introduction to me. </joey>
<joey> - This is what I do for a
job. I get sloshed on camera. </joey>
<garnt> - Gonna think I'm a serial- </garnt>
<garnt> - So this was, you filmed
this in your house? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> She was like, "So do you film
all the videos in your house?" </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Ahhh."
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "It's very
rarely. It's very rarely." </connor>
<garnt> - I got a studio, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, I film a lot
outside. Rarely film indoors. </garnt>
<joey> You know, honestly, I'm
barely talking, frankly. </joey>
<joey> - No, that's how I got my place. </joey>
<connor> I literally had to tell the
people who I was applying it to, </connor>
<connor> they were like- </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't tell them anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause they, the
person who owns my place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watched my YouTube, 'cause
they had to know as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> 'cause I was applying under my company. </connor>
<connor> So they were like, "So are all
your videos filmed inside?" </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "No, no, no.
Most of these are outside." </connor>
<joey> And they were like, "Okay. Okay. Okay." </joey>
<connor> - To be fair, I never record
past like, 5, 6:00 PM. </connor>
<garnt> It's just streams. </garnt>
<connor> Which again, I mean, it's
not much better, but. </connor>
<connor> - I remember, you said before, in London, </connor>
<garnt> you used to record like 2:00 AM or 3:00AM. </garnt>
<connor> - My neighbors didn't give a fuck though. </connor>
<connor> But, then again, they
were blasting "Peppa Pig" </connor>
<connor> through the wall at 2:00
AM, so I don't really. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
- "Pepper Pig". </garnt>
<connor> - What kid is watching
"Peppa Pig" at 2:00 AM? </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "Mom, put on the
episode. This one's a banger. </connor>
<joey> Turn it up, Mom, turn it up."
- Turn it up. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know if it's like-
- It's my favorite OP. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't if it was 'cause I
was in a kinda not great area </connor>
<connor> of London, I don't if there's like </connor>
<connor> a mutual understanding of like </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> "No complaints. No police. No police." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because my neighbors had like
10 people living in a house </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> that had like two bedrooms. </connor>
<connor> So I dunno know how much
police they wanted over there. </connor>
<connor> That's why, I'm pretty sure,
they never ever said anything. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause one time, multiple times actually, </connor>
<connor> I opened the door to
get a package from them </connor>
<connor> and it looked like, you know, </connor>
<connor> just like so many fucking
people were living in there. </connor>
<connor> It was crazy. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Ooh. See ya." </connor>
<connor> It was very weird. </connor>
<garnt> So, I think that's why
they never complained. </garnt>
<connor> And also, the walls are
thicker. That's what I- </connor>
<garnt> - Have you ever had a neighbor from hell? </garnt>
<garnt> Or like a bad neighbor? </garnt>
<garnt> Japan aside? </garnt>
<connor> - In England?
- No. I've been pretty good. </connor>
<connor> I think you did, you
mentioned in on "Trash Taste". </connor>
<connor> - Did I?
- The really loud sex, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, not that. That
was actually a fine- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that was pleasurable? (laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a fine- </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I enjoyed hearing their
sex through the wall. </connor>
<connor> - That was a fine neighbor. </connor>
<connor> - That's my homie, right there. (laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - We high fived. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - We had a mutual understanding. </connor>
<connor> They could have sex in the next room </connor>
<connor> and I could record
podcasts whenever I want </connor>
<joey> and be a YouTuber.
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> It was great. They didn't complain at all. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't complain, in turn. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - But did you have a neighbor from hell? </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Yeah, I did actually. </connor>
<connor> - I never do, fingers crossed. </connor>
<connor> _ Yeah, it was the actually the place </connor>
<connor> I had moved to after that. </connor>
<connor> So it was actually the first
place I moved into with Sydney. </connor>
<connor> And we just had this guy living above us. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And we didn't know this when we moved in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we moved into this house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was basically like a HMO, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so a house of multi-occupancy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like basically a
house that has been like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cut up. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - It's been cut up to have
several people living in it </connor>
<connor> So the walls, we didn't realize </connor>
<connor> how thin the walls were, right? </connor>
<connor> And we had a guy living above us that, </connor>
<joey> he was old, he was an older gentleman, </joey>
<joey> and definitely had few
screws loose, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he said that he used
to work for the police, right? </joey>
<joey> And he would bring this up constantly </joey>
<joey> because in this house that we were in, </joey>
<joey> they had heavy fire doors, right? </joey>
<joey> So we'd have to really be super careful </joey>
<joey> when we were closing the doors. </joey>
<joey> There's letting the doors go, </joey>
<joey> but there's also like, </joey>
<joey> because these doors were so heavy, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you'd just have to yank it in. </joey>
<joey> And sometimes that yank
was just a little bit </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> too much power behind it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it would just make a loudish noise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so this guy living above us, he was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the beginning he tried
to be a nice neighbor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we tried to be nice neighbors as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we soon came to realize that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this guy had massive anger issues. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one day he could be the nicest guy ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the next day he would just blow up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the smallest reasons
and we were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo, we kinda don't feel safe." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time we'd maybe shut
the door a bit too loudly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at first he'd tell us, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Be like, "Please shut
the door a bit quieter." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we're like, "Sorry. That was our bad." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We knew about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so we'd be extra, extra careful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, you know, when you
go in and out your house </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> pretty often, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And sometimes you just yank it a bit loud, </garnt>
<garnt> a bit more harder than you would, sorry, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you yank it a bit
harder than you intended to. </garnt>
<garnt> So one time, he told
us to be careful, fine. </garnt>
<garnt> Nothing happened for a month. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, at around 7:00
PM, I just yanked it </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "Oh, shit.
That was a bit loud." </garnt>
<garnt> Literally comes downstairs, fuckin' </garnt>
<garnt> (heavy footsteps thumping) </garnt>
<garnt> "What the fuck did I tell you?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - He literally full on fucking screamed, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Yo, what the fuck is going on?" </garnt>
<garnt> And from that moment on, </garnt>
<garnt> keep in mind this was a
month after the last time </garnt>
<garnt> I'd accidentally shut it a bit too loudly. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Yo, Sydney,
I'm thinking we're living </garnt>
<garnt> below a crazy guy here." </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, at 7:00 PM, who gives a fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it was 7:00 PM, as well. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't even in the dead of night. </garnt>
<joey> - "What the fuck did I tell
you a month ago?" (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Jesus. </joey>
<garnt> - And so, I don't do the Japanese thing, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> I go up to him and knock
on his door and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> "Yo, bro, let's talk it out. Come on. </joey>
<joey> Let's come to an understanding here." </joey>
<garnt> And so we talk it out and he's
very polite and very calm. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - Well, fuck.
- That's how they get you man. </garnt>
<connor> - He's very calm about it, right? </connor>
<connor> And we're just like, "Look. Look, mate. </connor>
<connor> This is the first place we've moved to, </connor>
<connor> with my new girlfriend." </connor>
<connor> And he was saying </connor>
<connor> just, "Sometimes walls are
very thin, so just keep in mind </connor>
<connor> that I'm right below you." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "No, I totally get it. </connor>
<connor> After 10:00 PM, that's
when we're super quiet. </connor>
<connor> We'd normally go to sleep, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I gotta work the next day as well. </connor>
<connor> But you know, sometimes we're
not even talking at a loud </connor>
<connor> kind of volume or whatever, so
as long as you can understand </connor>
<joey> that we are a couple and we talk, </joey>
<joey> as people do when someone
else's in the house, </joey>
<joey> then we'll try to keep
it down at late hours." </joey>
<joey> Cool. </joey>
<joey> And so I go back downstairs, </joey>
<joey> literally a week later. </joey>
<joey> Not even closing the door this time. </joey>
<joey> I'm literally just having a
normal volumed conversation </joey>
<joey> with Sydney and instead of shouting, </joey>
<joey> he starts walking around really loudly. </joey>
<joey> Starts smashing down </joey>
<joey> on the floor.
(footsteps thundering) </joey>
<garnt> Like this, right? </garnt>
<garnt> We're like, "What the fuck is going on?" </garnt>
<joey> Me and Sydney, we're like,
"What the fuck is going on?" </joey>
<joey> So I go back upstairs and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Is everything okay? </joey>
<joey> Are you having a stroke, a heart attack? </joey>
<joey> What's going on?" </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Look. </joey>
<joey> You're being fucking loud </joey>
<joey> and I just wanted to
teach you a lesson, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> This is what you get for speaking loudly." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "What
the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this has literally
scarred me for life, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I was living in fear that this guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was gonna do something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause over time, 'cause we lived here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a year and a half, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and obviously our relationship
deteriorated. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As it would when I've
felt in fucking danger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> living in my own house
and Sydney felt in danger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> living in our house, as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so it got to the point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some days we'd just be talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he'd just randomly start banging </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on his fridge doors or his cupboard doors, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> making a lot of noise when he thought that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were making a lot of noise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we were just talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and having a normal
conversation most of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And eventually it went from
the, the relationship went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from me trying to talk it out with him, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to being like, "Dude, what
the fuck is your issue?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "Bra, I
used to work in the police. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't fuck with me, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I wanted, I'd call them over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd get all my mates,
I'd get the boys over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'd get you out. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> Just say the word. </joey>
<joey> Just don't fuck with me." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "Fuck. </joey>
<joey> Sydney, we gotta move
out as soon as possible." </joey>
<joey> This was one of the big
reasons why we moved out </joey>
<joey> and so on the last night
where we moved out, </joey>
<joey> Sydney was already gone
'cause she had gone back home </joey>
<joey> to America, so it was just
me and a mate talking. </joey>
<joey> And so it was me and a mate talking </joey>
<joey> and we were watching a movie, </joey>
<joey> so we weren't even talking, </joey>
<joey> it was just the volume of
the TV at that point, right? </joey>
<joey> And we get this bang on
the fuckin' door, right? </joey>
<joey> And this guy starts screaming, full volume </joey>
<joey> in my face, right? </joey>
<joey> He's just like, "I know
you're about to fucking leave. </joey>
<joey> And I'm fuckin', I'm glad
you're about to fuckin' leave </joey>
<joey> but I need to give you one last
piece of my mind. Fuck you. </joey>
<joey> You've been the worst fucking
neighbor of my entire life." </joey>
<joey> - Jesus.
- And then he starts going off </joey>
<joey> about how he's part of the police again. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Bro, calm the fuck down." </joey>
<joey> At this point, this is
probably the most pissed off </joey>
<joey> I've been in my life. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Dude."
- Monkman went out the window. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. I'm just
like, "Dude, back the fuck off." </joey>
<joey> And then he looks at me, right? </joey>
<garnt> He looks at me straight in the eye. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, "Go on. Have
a swipe. Have a swipe." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) "Go on. Go on."
- Jesus. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I knew he wanted
me to throw a punch </joey>
<joey> so he had a reason to call the police. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> - And I straight up tell him, </joey>
<joey> I straight up look him
in the eye and tell him </joey>
<joey> "Dude, you don't know who
you're dealing with here. </joey>
<connor> I was a fuckin' monk,
I'm not gonna punch you." </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I'm fuckin'
zen right now, dude. </connor>
<connor> You can try as hard as you
like, I'm not gonna punch you." </connor>
<connor> And he gets closer and he's
like, "Go on. It's easy. Go on." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Dude, just back
the fuck off now please. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna re-enter my home,
please just fuck off." </connor>
<garnt> - He's so sad. What a sad guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that was the last I heard of him. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was my neighbor from hell. </garnt>
<garnt> I really hope that no one ever
goes through that because- </garnt>
<joey> - How did you, how did you stay in there </joey>
<joey> for a year and a half, dude? </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause our contract.
- Oh, yeah, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally, it was hell
because anytime that we wanted, </garnt>
<garnt> and we hated being in
that house, eventually. </garnt>
<garnt> After about six months to a year, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> we just stayed at my parents
house as much as we could. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then eventually we just
straight up just moved back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to our parents' house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it was like a fuckin'
hell living in that house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's kinda why I never want to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why I hate apartment sharing now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that one experience
has taught me just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just want my own space. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> I want no one to, </joey>
<joey> like a noise complaint
actually triggers me now, </joey>
<joey> so I'm just like, "Ohh. Fuck that." </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, dude. I don't fuckin'
blame you after that. </garnt>
<joey> Jesus Christ. </joey>
<garnt> - And yeah, I'd completely
forgotten about that </garnt>
<garnt> until we started talking about neighbors. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, there you go.
- Wow. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - Digging up old traumas.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> Only on "Trash Taste". </joey>
<connor> - Wow, what an asshole. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right? What a cunt. Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure he's happy.
I'm sure he's happy. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm sure he's happy now.
- I'm sure, yeah I'm sure </garnt>
<joey> he's happy now. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I think the early
signs were there because- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sure that he won't
get a neighbor who's </garnt>
<garnt> better than you, anyway.
- Yeah, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sure he's probably
dealing with people who are- </connor>
<garnt> - Yean, no, 'cause there were
early signs that were there. </garnt>
<garnt> Because he was telling me
about the dude that lived </garnt>
<garnt> in that place before was
also a "young person" as well </garnt>
<garnt> and he would not stop complaining </garnt>
<garnt> about how much noise he made </garnt>
<garnt> and how loudly he shut the door. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "I mean, I've
shut the door. It's loud. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's not like fuckin'
shake the house loud." </garnt>
<connor> - I'd probably just get to
the point where I'd just start </connor>
<garnt> making noise to piss him off. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> He can swing and smack
on my door all day, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got the SONY WX thingies, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I'm noise-canceled, bro.
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<joey> - It's what noise-canceling
headphones were made for. </joey>
<connor> - Sure, what are you gonna
do, break into my house? </connor>
<joey> Fuck off. </joey>
<joey> - What's this apartment
made out of, paper? </joey>
<garnt> - I think so, man. I dunno. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause what, in the UK, what is it, like </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> 10:00 PM is the official time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you're not allowed to make noise? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, so right before 10:00 PM, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd probably just blast music non-stop </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> and then when 10:00 PM hits, turn it off. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And then rinse and repeat. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, what's the worst they can do? </garnt>
<connor> Because I was just trying
to be a nice neighbor. </connor>
<connor> - If it's before a certain time, </connor>
<joey> and I think the noise pollution
is below a certain decibel, </joey>
<joey> I think they can't do anything. </joey>
<joey> They actually, I don't
think they can do anything. </joey>
<joey> - Like legally, they can't do anything. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think so. </joey>
<garnt> I could be wrong on that.
I don't think they can. </garnt>
<connor> As long as it's within
a reasonable amount. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's just the arsehole
tax that you pay them? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Okay. Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Well you can just start
ignoring him, right? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) Maybe
he'll take a swing at you. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe. Maybe, you know
what I shoulda done, </garnt>
<garnt> just gotten some nice
noise-canceling headphones. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you should've bro. </connor>
<connor> I mean, just, if he knocks
on the door, who cares, bro? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
Sleep through it. </connor>
<connor> What's he gonna do? Break down your door? </connor>
<joey> Like nah, bro.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Just Kool-Aid Man's
here, "You're too loud!" </joey>
<joey> - And then you can call
the police. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> You can see his friends. If he has any. </garnt>
<joey> - I can see the boys, I can see the boys. </joey>
<joey> - If he actually has any. </joey>
<garnt> - That he's talking about, right? </garnt>
<joey> - This your mans? This
your mans, right here? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - People who brag about
that kinda stuff normally </joey>
<connor> don't have as strong ties
as they make it out to be. </connor>
<joey> - No, they don't, no. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I mean, I feel like he was an ex-cop </joey>
<joey> for a reason, right? </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) He's not a current cop. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I've never really
had bad housemates, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> I've just had housemates
that didn't pay bills. </garnt>
<connor> But there's ways of being
able to get them to pay bills. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think that's why- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I would argue a housemate </joey>
<garnt> that doesn't pay the bill
is a bad housemate. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I would argue that as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Would you? I'd rather, </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> because, right, what we
would, what I would do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was in charge of the internet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was the only one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause these guys, I
mean they were my age, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they didn't, they weren't very- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Knowledgeable? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - About like, yeah, about </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> technology and internet stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And they didn't realize
that if you had the password </joey>
<joey> to the internet you could log in </joey>
<joey> and turn off the internet
to certain devices. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Did you know you could do that? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So you can just type in the, what is it? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Whatever the numbers are,
the 19, whatever 182, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you can log in.
- The IP address? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the IP address, you'd log into it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you could just turn off
devices, so I would just, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> if they didn't pay me,
I would just turn off </connor>
<connor> all their internet for all their devices. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - And then I would-
- That's literally </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> the equivalent of your mom
taking your Switch away </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> 'cause you didn't do your chores. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Until you do your chores. </connor>
<joey> No more playtime for you." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then they would be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, Connor, I've got an assignment." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Why didn't you pay me?" </connor>
<connor> "Pay me and I'll put your
internet back on." And you- </connor>
<garnt> - That's a power move, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, yeah, 'cause I'm like,
"They're not gonna pay me." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause they were being
assholes, so I was like, "Well." </garnt>
<garnt> - No, rightfully deserved, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - "You haven't paid for
me like half a month now, </garnt>
<garnt> we're all students, I don't have money." </garnt>
<garnt> This is, you know, I'm paying
a bill for four people, </garnt>
<connor> you can't pay me like 10 quid, come on? </connor>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's why I
hated being in charge of, </garnt>
<garnt> when you're in university,
were you the guy, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm guessing you were the guy </garnt>
<garnt> in charge of paying the rent, then? </garnt>
<garnt> Or was it just- </garnt>
<connor> - Ah, so the rent was
actually done separately. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> But the bills were done through me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was only in the second
house that I had a problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The last house, there
was only three of us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they were all really chill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they all paid, whenever I asked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the house before that,
they just never paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> 'Cause they were just
spending it all on weed. </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughs) As they do. As they do. </garnt>
<garnt> - As they do.
- Yeah, yeah, so I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Well, I mean, all right, well fuck." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause you always have
one housemate in uni that just </garnt>
<garnt> was never there and
never paid for anything </garnt>
<garnt> and you'd have to fucking
hire a private investigator </garnt>
<garnt> or something to get this guy's money </garnt>
<connor> or get the money from that guy. </connor>
<connor> - It was weird, man, 'cause
one of my housemates, </connor>
<joey> he was like, what, how old
are you in second year? </joey>
<joey> Like 20? Barely 20, 19? </joey>
<joey> - 21, maybe, 20, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - He had a, his girlfriend was pregnant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he had the baby, and
it was just all so surreal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I'm here, barely
have my life in order </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this man just brings his
fuckin' child into the room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, and then I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What goin' on, this is so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I don't like this."
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And then I felt bad
asking for internet money. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Hey, by the way,
can you pay the bills?" </connor>
<joey> - "I know you have to
feed your kid, but, ah." </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, "I'm sure you
can go a week without weed, </connor>
<connor> just pay me, bro. </connor>
<connor> And give your kid some
Starburst or something, </connor>
<connor> I don't know."
(all laugh) </connor>
<connor> "Just pay me, I don't know." </connor>
<joey> - "I've got some top ramen left over, </joey>
<connor> you can give it to your baby."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> And also, I think his girlfriend </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> basically lived at our house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, "Should
she be paying some bills? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know?" </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - I mean, to be fair-
- Is it weird? </joey>
<joey> - You should, but.
- I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm not gonna ask but I think you should </joey>
<joey> just pay me on time. </joey>
<joey> And we've got no problem. </joey>
<connor> I don't give a shit." </connor>
<connor> So annoying, </connor>
<joey> 'cause it just wouldn't
get done, unless I did it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - We wouldn't have internet. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Well, I want internet. </joey>
<connor> So I'm gonna do it.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna set it up. </connor>
<connor> Oh, and inadvertently
it's in my name, fuck." </connor>
<joey> - Well maybe it was better though, </joey>
<joey> that it was inadvertently
in your name, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, well 'cause then I
canceled it all, I did it. </connor>
<connor> And all that. </connor>
<connor> And I think one time they didn't pay me, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> for the last month, and because they left, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just straight up refused to pay me. </SPEAKER_04>

<garnt> Mack Weldon, reinventing men's basics. </garnt>
<garnt> Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> We just went for a pee break. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> As I was saying, right before we left, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> that house, the one where
they didn't pay the bills, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they actually owed us, I
think it was something like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 80 pounds in the end, in overdue bills. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And because we'd all left the house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't hound them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I messaged them on Facebook </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they wouldn't send it to
us. And so, I had to pay it </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> and it was actually me and my friend, </connor>
<connor> we were the only ones who paid bills </connor>
<connor> and we were really, </connor>
<connor> we were really close and
I still hang out with him, </connor>
<connor> still message him sometimes. </connor>
<connor> Really good friends with him. </connor>
<connor> And we both basically paid all our bills </connor>
<connor> and sorted it all out </connor>
<connor> and yeah, so we had to then
pay the bills for two months, </connor>
<connor> for the other guys who didn't pay. </connor>
<connor> We were really annoyed about it </connor>
<joey> 'cause we were trying to get them to pay </joey>
<joey> and they weren't paying us. </joey>
<joey> And then, I felt like some
cosmic justice was given because- </joey>
<joey> - The gods smiled down on you. </joey>
<joey> - The gods were like, "Hold up, Connor." </joey>
<joey> So it turns out, right, we'd
actually overpaid our bills </joey>
<joey> and then we got a rebate, </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> so they'd actually given us money back, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which was actually more
than what we actually owed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we ended up, given like 50 pounds back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And my friend was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Should we give it
equally between us all?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Do you think they
would have done the same?" </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Let's just split it 50-50." </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, "How about, fuck 'em." </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - It's 25 quid. Let's just keep it. </joey>
<joey> Let's just go to the
pub. 'Cause fuck this. </joey>
<connor> - Hell yeah, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - They weren't gonna pay us. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I bet if you messaged
them, they would've replied </garnt>
<connor> at the speed of light. </connor>
<connor> - Probs.
- They'd have been like, </connor>
<garnt> "Here's my PayPal, by the way." </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - "Oh hi, I'm just gonna send you money." </connor>
<connor> "Oh, yo. No worries. No
worries, come at me, fam." </connor>
<connor> - Pub? Pub? Pub? </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I do feel a
little bit bad about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even before we record, I'm
like "Can I tell this story?" </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - Oh, fuck that, dude.
- "It's like me, </joey>
<joey> am I stealing here?"
- I would've done </joey>
<connor> the exact same thing. </connor>
<garnt> - They would've done the exact same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - They would've done the exact same thing. </garnt>
<connor> I wouldn't have been sorry about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Especially if they
didn't pay you, as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, they literally
wouldn't reply to our messages </garnt>
<garnt> about paying us back.
- Ah, fuck that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I felt bad, but I was also like, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I'd just would never
ever steal, but I was like- </connor>
<joey> - If they're not gonna follow the rules, </joey>
<connor> then why should you
follow the rules, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, I agree. </connor>
<joey> - I feel it's fair. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like
going through rent drama </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> or some kind of like
bills drama in university </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just like a rite of passage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like everyone's
had at least one person </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> that they've been living with
(Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> who has just been like the
most difficult dickhead </joey>
<garnt> to fuckin' get any kind of money out of. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> I just feel bad 'cause I feel
like I'm better than that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right.
- I don't do this. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> I wake up in a cold sweat, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What's that the statute of
limitations of stealing?" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (all laughs) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I don't know, 'cause even
though it's a small amount, </connor>
<connor> as well, I felt bad, but I was like, </connor>
<connor> "You know what? No. Fuck them." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> But also, it's literally like that </garnt>
<garnt> good kid does one bad thing and is like, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, shit. Is the police gonna come?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh)
You know what I mean? (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - That's called karma, man. </joey>
<joey> - That's why, </joey>
<connor> litters once, </connor>
<connor> "Oh shit. Am I going to prison?" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, I just never
did that, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it was very, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> it was very validating
but it was also like, </joey>
<connor> "Fuck. Am I gonna go to jail?" (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "What's the limit to stealing </connor>
<connor> before the cops get
called on me?" (laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like one week and I'm good, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I'm free? I'm free? </connor>
<joey> - Have you ever stolen anything? </joey>
<joey> - No, no. Never. Never. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Even as a kid.
- Even like- </connor>
<garnt> - "Hello, this is "Trash
Taste" criminal records." </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, me neither. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, guys what's the most
illegal thing you've done? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, me neither. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, okay. </garnt>
<connor> You know how, in the UK
you can get, what was it? </connor>
<connor> There's like bakeries in the store </connor>
<connor> and you have to tell, on
the thing, what you got? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I think one time I got a, </connor>
<connor> like four croissants and </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> I clicked what I thought was four, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went through and then I came, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went to the till and I paid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Turned out, boys, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> I chose the wrong croissants,
right? On the machine. </joey>
<joey> - Big sad. </joey>
<joey> - And it was actually
cheaper than what it was. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, damn. </joey>
<joey> - And I felt-
- You absolute criminal scum- </joey>
<joey> - I know, right? </joey>
<joey> I know, I know, so I left the store. </joey>
<joey> I got about like ten
seconds out of the store </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> and I looked at the
receipt and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This is not, this is not the." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I actually got I
think the chocolate ones, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, "This is
not the chocolate ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is 20p extra."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I went back and I was like, "Hi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do I need to change,
like pay the difference?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the guy was like, "I don't care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like 20, I don't think they care." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) And
I was like, "Are you sure? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't mind paying. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> I feel bad that I walked
out with 20 pence, </joey>
<joey> the wrong, uh, you're not
gonna call the cops, right?" </joey>
<joey> But he was like, "Dude
it's, what, no one cares." </joey>
<joey> - I've had that before, I did the, </joey>
<joey> you know when you're really, really young </joey>
<garnt> and you do the accidental stealing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, true, true. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> - The completely unaware stealing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I did that once, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I was like fuckin' I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five or six years old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and in Australia there's
like newspaper stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where people go to buy
newspapers, magazines </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and usually at the front cashier, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's all these really
small, cheap candies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and chocolates and stuff like that </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> that kids can buy and whatnot. </connor>
<garnt> And I specifically remember
there was one time I went, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I think my dad had to </connor>
<connor> go buy a newspaper or something, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> back when he was still buying newspapers. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> And I picked out a candy. </connor>
<connor> I think it was like 10 cents or 20 cents </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Dad, can I have this?" </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Bugger off,
son. You're not having that." </connor>
<connor> And "We got sweets at home." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I remember, I don't
know why, but that day, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess I was in a pissed
off mood or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember being really
angry that he didn't buy me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this 10, 20 cent fuckin'
pissy little candy, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember just being like, "Ah, man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just clenching my fists, being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> "Goddamn it. Why? Goddamn
it father, why can't you"- </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna steal right now. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no. I was like-
- I'm about to steal. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - No, I was just like, "God damn it." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> Just clenching my fists really hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we walk out and
we're walking to the car </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> and I'm still pissed
off, clenching my fists </connor>
<connor> and then I kinda look
down at one of my fists </connor>
<connor> and I open my hand and- </connor>
<connor> - I've done that before.
- The candy's in my hand. </connor>
<joey> And I was just like,
slowly put it in my pocket. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<connor> - How did that get here? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I was like,
"Something feels weird </joey>
<connor> in my clenched fist."
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, at that
moment, it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuckin' "Detroit: Become
Human" choice just popped up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, "Do I put this in my pocket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or do I come out clean?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> And I was just like, put it in my pocket. </joey>
<joey> "Imma save this for later." </joey>
<connor> - You know what I did try
and do one time and it. </connor>
<connor> Okay, so, you know how like corner stores, </connor>
<garnt> they don't really have the super, </garnt>
<garnt> ultra-advanced labeling,
price labeling thing? </garnt>
<garnt> They just kinda have those
little cheap plastic, </garnt>
<connor> paper stickers on the,
like the orange ones? </connor>
<connor> They would put like a pound or 50 pence, </connor>
<connor> and one time I thought, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I just had a giga-brain thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna swap 'em. I'm
gonna swap the labels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I really want this
thing but I don't have enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I had like one pound
and it was one pound fifty, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Imma change the label." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> And I was like, (deep breathing), </connor>
<connor> heart was fuckin' racing going
up to the stand, to the till, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Fuck. Fuck.
Play it cool. Play it cool. </connor>
<connor> Play it cool." </connor>
<connor> And he's scanning 'em and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> and then, as he's
scanning them I realized. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Wait, he's just scanned it. </connor>
<connor> And it doesn't fucking
matter what the label says </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's a fucking barcode." </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> And he was like, "Oh, that's
got the wrong label on it." </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "Oh, does it? Does it? </connor>
<joey> Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck." </joey>
<joey> - "Wow, I never noticed, thank
you for pointing that out." </joey>
<connor> - Meanwhile, my heart is like
(imitates heart pounding). </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Oh, shit." (deep breathing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the worst
thing I've ever done is </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> you know when, in England,
you know when they introduced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the self-service machines, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is the closest thing
I think England's gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> to a trust system, right? </joey>
<joey> And on top of this, England,
within our lifetime, </joey>
<joey> England has added a plastic bag tax. </joey>
<joey> Which wasn't always there.
- No. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - Normally you could
take as many plastic bags </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> as you wanted. </connor>
<connor> Normally you could take as many
plastic bags as you wanted. </connor>
<connor> But I think, how many years ago? </connor>
<connor> Where they introduced the
5p tax in order to take </connor>
<joey> a plastic bag.
- Oh, like five years ago? </joey>
<joey> - Five, six years ago, I'd say. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like five, six years ago </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> and I remember this one time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was in a Tesco's or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I had like, I didn't
have my card on me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I just had gone out of the house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I just had change in my pocket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I came up to the till
and it was self-service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it went up to the exact
change of my shopping, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I hadn't bought the
plastic bag yet. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> So I was just like, "Do
I put everything back?" </garnt>
<connor> - Nah, bro, if I was
working there, I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "Bro, good on you for having
the perfect amount. Take it." </connor>
<connor> - So I was just like, "Do
I put everything back, </connor>
<connor> run back home, which is
only five minutes away </connor>
<garnt> and come back with a tenner
or my card or something </garnt>
<connor> to just buy this? </connor>
<garnt> Or do I just press the "I
have paid for one bag"? </garnt>
<garnt> No, no, do I just press
the "Zero bag" option? </garnt>
<garnt> And I look around, I start
like fuckin' sweating, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm just like,
"I'm a good Asian boy. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never broken the law in my life." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, (inhales deeply)
check the security camera. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> Check the store clerk. Time fuckin' stops. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Fuckin' put the hood up,
baseball cap on. I'm ready. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you know when you've
felt like you've got a fuckin' </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> spotlight on you? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> "All right." </garnt>
<garnt> And then I just fuckin' leg it out. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - How dare he steal a 5 pence bag? </joey>
<joey> - And now that's on camera, so yes. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my god.
- I'm a criminal, guys. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolutely criminal, Gigguk. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, to be fair, with that one, </joey>
<joey> I think I'd paid by card a bunch </joey>
<joey> and I'd forgotten to put the plastic bag </joey>
<connor> and they're literally right there. </connor>
<connor> And I'd paid by card and I had
no cash on me and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I am not getting my
card out for 5 pence." </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, of course.
- So I just take one. </connor>
<connor> They didn't give a fuck.
They never gave a fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here Garnt's sweating and I'm
just next to him taking one. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - No because I'm pretty sure,
I've accidentally pressed </connor>
<connor> zero bags when I've taken one
or two bags so many times. </connor>
<connor> (Connor inhales sharply) </connor>
<garnt> It's-
- No, Garnt. Say it isn't so! </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the conscious
choice, you know? (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's that I consciously made that choice. </joey>
<joey> - It's the confident press of the button. </joey>
<connor> - That's the difference
between manslaughter </connor>
<connor> and murder, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - No, I think that's why
the trust system works- </garnt>
<connor> - It's conscious manslaughter. (laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's why the
trust system works so well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here in Japan, 'cause I
don't know if we've mentioned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how they ID for alcohol
here, in konbinis right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is, they never ask for ID </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> if you're buying alcohol
here in a supermarket </joey>
<joey> or a konbini here. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause what happens is you take the beer </joey>
<joey> or whatever alcohol you want, </joey>
<joey> the clerk scans it and
then there's this button </joey>
<joey> that you have to press in Japan
that says, "I am over 18." </joey>
<joey> - Now-
- 20. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's over 20. </joey>
<joey> - Sorry, sorry, yeah it's over 20. </joey>
<joey> Now, in England, this wouldn't work. </joey>
<joey> Any fuckin' kid would come in and say, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I'm over the age of drinking." </joey>
<joey> Fuck, I remember, how
many kids had fake IDs </joey>
<joey> and just went fuckin' clubbing </joey>
<joey> back when I was underage, as well. </joey>
<garnt> But here in Japan, I can imagine
just like this Japanese kid </garnt>
<garnt> just coming up and being like,
"I'm gonna cheat the system. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna do what's
called a pro gamer move." </garnt>
<garnt> Gets up to the cashier and he just tries </garnt>
<garnt> to press the button and is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "No. Can't do it. I can't do it." </garnt>
<garnt> - "I'm a child. I'm a child. I'm sorry." </garnt>
<garnt> - That is literally the equivalent of </garnt>
<garnt> going onto a porn website
and when it says like, </garnt>
<joey> "You must be 18 years or
over," to enter the website. </joey>
<joey> And a Japanese kid being
like (sighs) "Shit." </joey>
<garnt> - Like a Japanese kid is just
like, "Officer, arrest me now. </garnt>
<garnt> I've had bad thoughts." </garnt>
<joey> - "I pressed yes. I was curious." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs)
"Take me away." </joey>
<joey> - A Japanese kid's like, "Shit." </joey>
<connor> Turn on an anime. Full porn. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> Turns on TV. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's so pointless. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, as well, in
Japan, they have just </connor>
<joey> vending machines with beer. </joey>
<connor> Vending machines with cigarettes. </connor>
<joey> - I'd completely forgotten about that. </joey>
<connor> - Just on the street. </connor>
<connor> All right. Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not until recently
that the vending machines </garnt>
<garnt> that sell cigarettes finally
started to implement- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah you have to have a card, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like a card system to ID it because- </garnt>
<garnt> - But the alcohol ones don't. </garnt>
<joey> - No the alcohol ones
don't. (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - So a 14 year old will
be like, "What's Asahi?" </joey>
<joey> and then they just fuckin'
order and realize it's beer. </joey>
<connor> And there you go. </connor>
<connor> - There's definitely kids doing that. </connor>
<joey> 100%.
- 100% </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> I did that. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - I would too.
- But yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But yeah, first time I was
working up in the ski fields, </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like 16 and outside
of where I was staying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a vending machine
that was selling beer. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I was like, "Oh sweet, I
don't have to trek all the way </connor>
<joey> to the other side of
the road at the konbini, </joey>
<connor> I can just fuckin' go here." </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure the police don't
give a shit if you not show ID, </joey>
<garnt> unless you're literally drunk as fuck </garnt>
<garnt> in the middle of the street or something. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - That's going very far.
- Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - They've got better things
to do. Like complain. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Complain about stepping too loud. </connor>
<connor> - ID a (speaks foreign
language) or something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, ID a (speaks foreign language). </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - But me being the
(speaks foreign language) </connor>
<connor> in the snow fields, I was like. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Bro, you fuckin'- </connor>
<joey> - They just come around the corner </joey>
<joey> and just bust me on the spot. </joey>
<connor> - This man fucking cracks it open, </connor>
<joey> the "Solid Snake" music starts playing. </joey>
<connor> Dun-dun-dun.
(Joey squeals) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey imitates siren) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The (speaks foreign
language) opened a beer! </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> Oh my god. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you guys ever stolen
your parents' credit cards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for anything when you were kids? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - No, no, no.
- No. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - My mom would find out
so fucking fast, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My mom checks her credit
card like daily, for like, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> there is absolutely no
way I could get away- </joey>
<joey> - Dude, I didn't even
know where my parents'- </joey>
<joey> - I never even wanted to.
- Credit card was. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> - To me, money wasn't a
system where you could, </joey>
<joey> I never viewed it as a system
where you could game it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> I always thought of it as, I get money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I spend the money that I get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I could earn money through things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was, I never even conceived, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not saying this 'cause
I think I'm like a good, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I'm a good boy, I literally
never even conceived of the fact </connor>
<connor> that I could take money. </connor>
<connor> - That's not even a good boy thing. </connor>
<joey> That's just a boy thing. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I just.
- That should be common sense. </connor>
<connor> - I just assumed the only way
I could get it was through </connor>
<joey> doing the tasks that I was allotted. </joey>
<garnt> Maybe 'cause I played video games too much </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought task equals reward. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - I genuinely never even considered, </garnt>
<garnt> so I hear about these kids who steal their </garnt>
<joey> parents' credit cards. </joey>
<joey> How is this so fuckin' normalized? </joey>
<connor> To me, it was never even an option. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Of like stealing my parents money. </connor>
<connor> - In my, when I hear that, I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, you're like a nine
year old, 10 year old, </joey>
<garnt> who just happened to get
their mom's credit card. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, how did you find that?" </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause if I was a nine
year old and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Man I really wanna like throw
a Super Chat at this Vtuber." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna think like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Where's my mom's credit card?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna start thinking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "All right. Let's start the simulation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where could my mom's credit
card possibly be in this house?" </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> "Solid Snake" music starts playing. </connor>
<joey> I wouldn't even think about that, right? </joey>
<connor> - I would rather, I'd have more luck </connor>
<connor> trying to trick my parents
by convincing them." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think I probably have done
that before more than I have- </connor>
<joey> - "Mom, you don't understand.
They're my favorite Vtuber." </joey>
<joey> - Well, because if they, </joey>
<joey> they're the ones that put the details in </joey>
<connor> and they don't like it,
I'm like, "Well you did it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> You put it in. You
listened to my bullshit." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You let me do it." (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm too big-brained. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kids, you're amateurs. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> 10 year olds nowadays
are too lazy, you know? </connor>
<connor> I should make guides on how to- </connor>
<garnt> - You gotta fuckin' "Inception"
the idea into your parents. </garnt>
<connor> - More kids need to be like Derren Brown, </connor>
<garnt> the fuckin' big brain convincing. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Don't steal. Convince other
people to steal for you. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> That's what you should do. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> Isn't this like proxy
bullying or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> The whole thing, oh my god, that was like, </joey>
<joey> "Don't bully. Get someone
else to bully for you." </joey>
<garnt> - It's like social engineering. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it's so above me, as well. </garnt>
<connor> I think I was just such a
straight edge kid, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think even-
- Same, to be honest. </connor>
<connor> - Even when I was a kid,
I remember the first time </connor>
<connor> I'd ever gotten anything
from this thing called </connor>
<connor> the tooth fairy. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> Now, I'd heard about this
thing called the tooth fairy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from all my kids, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> From my friends at school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All your kids? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so not from all my kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> From all my fellow kids at school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were saying, "Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If your teeth come out,
you put it on your pillow. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> You get a bit of money." </joey>
<joey> Someone once got pounds. Maybe two pounds. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Damn. </joey>
<joey> That's a business
opportunity right there." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I was the wrong
kid to tell that to. </connor>
<joey> - Just going around
stealing people's teeth. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Damn." </joey>
<joey> So I remember the first
time I had one of my tooth </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> knocked out, I was so fuckin' excited. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "My time has come. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Finally, the tooth fairy will visit me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I go to sleep that day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what do I find under my pillow? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Five fucking pounds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - I'm just like, "Holy shit! </joey>
<joey> I'm fuckin' rolling in it, man." </joey>
<joey> But also, I was a good kid, right? </joey>
<joey> So I knew my parents
weren't that well off. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, "Mom, you know what I got? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> I got five pounds. But you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need it. Treat
yourself Mom." (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Aww.
- Wow! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't realize at the time,
I found out two years later, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just gave the five
pounds my mom gave to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back to my mom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, "Mom! I can't believe </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> I've been swindled like this." (laughs) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - She probably thinks,
she's probably never been- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Money laundering at its finest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> is there any prouder moment as a parent </joey>
<joey> than if you kid did that? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<connor> - That's literally like the
whole Bible tales that you hear. </connor>
<joey> - You literally Good
Samaritan-ed that shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember they
came into school and </connor>
<connor> they did this presentation one time. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause, our school wasn't
like a Christian school </connor>
<connor> or anything, but we did
pray three times a day </connor>
<connor> and then every single story
had to be fuckin' Bible story. </connor>
<connor> So I thought that was
kinda sus, but anyway. </connor>
<connor> I remember this one story they told out, </connor>
<connor> just stuck out in my mind and
I hated this story so much. </connor>
<connor> I thought this was the
dumbest fucking story. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) Okay. </connor>
<connor> - They'd be like, "What
do you want for Christmas? </connor>
<connor> You could have five pounds or a Bible." </connor>
<connor> And then it was like, "Everyone, </connor>
<connor> the first person chose the five pounds. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They got given the five
pounds and they were happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The second person asked
for the five pounds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they got the five pounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they didn't want the Bible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The third person, they chose the Bible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And when they opened the Bible up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was 10 pounds in it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "What is
the moral of this story? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even when I was a kid, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Are you trying to tell me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that every Bible has a tenner in it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I'm gonna go around and look." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there was no tenners. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> And I'm like, "Wait,
so what is the moral?" </connor>
<connor> Genuinely, now? </connor>
<connor> What is the moral of this story? </connor>
<connor> Even 10 year old me was
like, "This is dumb." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is really dumb." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - It's like that's not how it was- </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they're tryna be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> "Choosing knowledge over money is more," </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Wait, wait,
wait. Hold up. Hold up." </connor>
<connor> - Is more valuable.
- I'm like, "Hold up. </connor>
<connor> Hold up. Price of the
bible's like three pound. </connor>
<joey> So wait, hold up? What are you?" </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "We can't guarantee
there's always gonna be </joey>
<connor> money in the Bible." </connor>
<joey> You know?
- So technically, </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> if I get the Bible, I take the
tenner and I sell the bible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for three pounds-
- Exactly, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's 13 pounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I was just like, "This is dumb. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> This is a dumb, dumb. Shame on you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You could've, you're so lazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> I know I'm a kid, but this is so." </garnt>
<garnt> And this annoyed the fuck out of me. </garnt>
<garnt> And they told this thing like three times </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> in my whole school life. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> And every single time, I
used to get seethingly mad </garnt>
<garnt> when they would tell this story. </garnt>
<connor> And no one else seemed
to be bothered by it, </connor>
<connor> they were like, "Yeah
that's a good moral." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "This is a dumb, dumb moral." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> This is never a situation you would be, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> who asks you which gift
do you want, you know? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's never gonna be
between money and a book. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always, "What do you
want for your birthday?" </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> It's not, "Oh which two do
you want? Money or this?" </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, maybe the money. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, what is this choice option? </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but it's never
a philosophical question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of which do I want, I'm just
gonna take the thing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want, this shouldn't be a fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> a question of my moral standing. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> You're giving me a gift
for Christmas, fuck off. </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) It's like Christmas
is which one do you want, </joey>
<joey> the "Millionaire" music
just starts playing, </joey>
<joey> it's like (heavy breathing). </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] It really annoyed me. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Can I call a friend?" </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - It's just the whole, </connor>
<joey> I really, really, really,
really, really despise </joey>
<joey> when they try and turn- </joey>
<joey> - That's really weird. </joey>
<joey> - When they try and turn
very unreligious situations </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> or philosophical situations
into philosophical situations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That have no right to be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I'm just tryna
buy my homie a present. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna know what they want." </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> Genuinely. I'm tryna be a good friend. </joey>
<joey> If Garnt wants the five pounds,
that's what Garnt wants. </joey>
<joey> - Imma give him the five pounds. </joey>
<connor> - Who am I to preach that Garnt
wants to fuckin' Bible, bro? </connor>
<connor> He doesn't want that shit.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Maybe he's not religious.
You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I'm not tryna save him. What is this shit? </connor>
<joey> - You want five pounds?
Are you sure about that? </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> I gotta Bible! </connor>
<connor> - And every year I got older
and they would tell this story, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> I would get more annoyed by it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the more I realized how
little sense it made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this whole, I don't know
if this is a common thing </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> or something that they
just told at my school, </joey>
<connor> but they would tell
this story all the time. </connor>
<connor> And I hated it.
- I mean, I went to a </connor>
<joey> Catholic high school and I've
never heard of that story. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know if it's
something that they made up </connor>
<connor> and this was like their
banger that they kept in, </connor>
<connor> like the person telling the story. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - It was just-
- This is the story that </garnt>
<garnt> gets people to discover Christ. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, "Oh, Lord!"
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, Lord!"
- "Oh, Lord, a tenner!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> - It's like, "You're not
a Christian yet? Oh, just- </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] I remember one time. </connor>
<connor> - "Connor, tell him the Bible story. </connor>
<garnt> Come on. Come on. Come on." </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember one time, as well, </garnt>
<garnt> because they used to
tell my primary school </garnt>
<connor> and I remember, 'cause this </connor>
<connor> is the one that really pissed me of. </connor>
<garnt> I just remembered this right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that the headmaster of my high school, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was the primary school, </garnt>
<garnt> the elementary school, who told it twice. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> Throughout the elementary school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember this, 'cause I always hated it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it always stood out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember it, my head, my
prime, the sub headmaster came in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he fucking came in and
he started talking about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> And I'm like, "No. Don't
you dare tell this story." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And he had the audacity to bring
in both the props, as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - And he couldn't just tell the story, </connor>
<connor> he had to ask the kids
which one they wanted. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> And it backfired, 'cause
the first kid he asked </connor>
<connor> was from the same primary school as me, </connor>
<connor> so he knew the answer. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And so he asked, "Which one do you want, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> the Bible or the five
pounds for Christmas?" </connor>
<connor> - And the kid was like, "Bible."
(Joey laughs) Immediately. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, "No. Have another go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Which one do you really want?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Bible." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> And he had to be like, "Good answer. </connor>
<connor> That's the correct answer
'cause there's a tenner in there </connor>
<connor> to reward your faith." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Fuck
off. No. Fuck, off, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate this. This sucks. I hate this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this made me more not, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> this made me despise religion even more. </connor>
<connor> From a young age.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> This is not the way to
get kids into religion. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. There's better ways to do it. </joey>
<joey> It's literally just tricking them, right? </joey>
<joey> And just being like,
"Yeah this kinda untrue, </joey>
<joey> unrealistic thing, happens all the time. </joey>
<joey> Take the Bible." </joey>
<connor> - There's just so many
of these religious things </connor>
<connor> that when you actually
break them down into </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> real scenarios, just don't
work in a way that you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just stop. Just stop." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't mind people's religion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all that, of course,
- Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not against that but when they- </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - There's better ways to
get them into it, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, when they try and
teach these stories like this, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, just "No. Shut up." </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't wait for a
fuckin' Jehovah's Witness </garnt>
<garnt> to knock on your door and you open it </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just see the Bible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a thousand yen in the other hand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're just like, "No." (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Grab the Bible.
- Grab the Bible, </connor>
<garnt> shut the door. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Oh, sweet." (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "Just shake it,
shake it, shake the Bible." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Yeah, you just grab the
Bible just, "Here you go." </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just the dumbest thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why did I tell this story, again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Anyone know why I told this story? </garnt>
<connor> I can't fucking remember. </connor>
<garnt> - I think we were just
talking about, sorry? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Morals. </garnt>
<garnt> - Morals.
- Morals. </garnt>
<connor> - Ah, it's the stealing, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> So moral of the story-
- Moral of the story, </connor>
<connor> take the Bible, 'cause
there's a tenner in there. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Always take the Bible-
- All the time. </joey>
<garnt> - If someone questions you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every Bible you see has
a tenner in it somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - And in any other situation,
just take the fiver. </garnt>
<garnt> Unless you want to take the Bible. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't need religion to
tell me not to be an asshole, </connor>
<connor> I'm already doing that, frankly. </connor>
<connor> I'm trying my best. You know?
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> When the man in the taxi offered
me the money or the Bible, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I took the money. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - (speaks in foreign language) </connor>
<joey> Just like, "Excuse me, sir. Bible?" </joey>
<connor> - I hope you all got that callback. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 4000 yen or the Bible? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he was like, "Do
you want reimbursement </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> or the Bible?" (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Is it was all a set up.
It was all a set up. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) What kills me is
what Christian out there, </garnt>
<joey> who is already a Christian
doesn't already own a Bible? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - Who out there who was posed
this question would be like, </joey>
<garnt> "You know what? I was just
looking for a Bible, actually." </garnt>
<joey> - "Oh, shit man."
- [Garnt] "Shit." </joey>
<garnt> - "I needed a seventh copy
of the Bible in the house. </garnt>
<joey> I'll take the tenner as
well, thank you very much." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> Jesus Christ. </joey>
<garnt> - This has been like one
of the weirdest tangents. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Starting off season two strong, I can see. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> My god. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) It always just annoyed me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm still annoyed about it, to this day. </garnt>
<garnt> When I go back, if I ever go to school, </garnt>
<connor> I'm not gonna give a shitty talk, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna, I should do an
even worse one than that. </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna come up with the worst. </joey>
<connor> - You know what you should do,
you know what I'm gonna do? </connor>
<joey> If I ever have a kid, I'm gonna
tell that story to my kid. </joey>
<joey> - You should. </joey>
<joey> - But not put the tenner in the Bible. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> - But like, "You're dumb. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> There's one of these in
every single hotel room. </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> You coulda got one for free. </joey>
<joey> You're not a fuckin' hustler." </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) Shoulda taken the five. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - So, how was this spread out </garnt>
<garnt> throughout your entire region, or? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, well, you
know, I think it's because </connor>
<connor> the area where I grew up was, </connor>
<connor> everyone, every teacher
knew every other teacher </connor>
<connor> in the high school." </connor>
<joey> - I guess you did live-
- All the police people knew- </joey>
<joey> - In a small village.
- All the, you know? </joey>
<connor> Odds are that is that half of your </connor>
<connor> school would have, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> all the teachers at the school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were people who went to the school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And all the people who got jobs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were relatives of people
who worked in the school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was all very tight-knit,
very, very tight-knit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I think all the stuff got passed down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything that they thought, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Well, this is a good idea," </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> just kept getting repeated and </joey>
<joey> yeah, everything-
- Probably some dude being </joey>
<joey> like, "I've gotta banger
story for you. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Check this out."
- Yeah, stuff you did </connor>
<connor> in primary school somehow
the high school teacher </connor>
<connor> would tell you about. </connor>
<garnt> You're like, "How did
you know I shit myself </garnt>
<garnt> in third grade?"
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> "How did you know that?" </garnt>
<connor> "Who told you there that?" </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, how do primary school
teachers still remember </garnt>
<garnt> every student that they've taught? </garnt>
<connor> - This is the thing, the thing is </connor>
<connor> that this would be totally unrelated. </connor>
<connor> This would be a different
school, different teacher </connor>
<connor> and they would somehow
know the shit that you did </connor>
<connor> in primary school. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "Stop talking
to each other about me. </connor>
<connor> Don't talk out of school.
Don't talk about me. </connor>
<connor> Talk about me in school. </connor>
<connor> Don't talk about me outside of school." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh.
- Oh, shit. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, it's back. </connor>
<connor> - "Trash Taste" malfunction. </connor>

<SPEAKER_04> Completely unrelated, but
an hour after the FCCJ thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we did, I got two emails
from, I don't even know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if they're students or teachers or what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from my high school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In Welsh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just from, saying, one
of the teachers misses me </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) What?
- And I was like, "What?" </joey>
<connor> - How does a teacher remember you? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, actually I mean, they remember, </connor>
<connor> it's a small school and also, I, </connor>
<connor> I think we've had like my brother </connor>
<joey> and my little brother went there, </joey>
<connor> so three generations of ours. </connor>
<connor> And I've also, I did talks there. </connor>
<joey> - You did talks? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you went back to your school </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- To do talks. </joey>
<joey> - I did a talk there, which was terrible. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I didn't prepare at all, </connor>
<connor> I just went there and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "What do you want me to say?" </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you YouTuber? </joey>
<joey> - All you have to say is I'm a YouTuber </joey>
<connor> and every kid is just
like, "Tell me more." </connor>
<connor> - No, so-
- Yeah, tell me more. </connor>
<connor> - I'm immediately interested. </connor>
<connor> - We'll actually, actually, now
I have a frame of reference, </connor>
<connor> so I've done two talks now. </connor>
<joey> I've done one talk at my high school </joey>
<joey> for sixth form students, </joey>
<joey> which are like 17, maybe 18. </joey>
<joey> And I've done a talk at
my mom's primary school </joey>
<joey> for 10 year olds. </joey>
<joey> It was very different experience. </joey>
<connor> And I way, way, way enjoyed
talking to the 10 year olds </connor>
<connor> way more than I did the 17 year olds. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause 17 year olds, </connor>
<connor> they're at that age </connor>
<connor> where they're way too
shy about everything. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And they're starting
to get self-conscious. </garnt>
<garnt> They hate life. I mean I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, everyone remembers that age. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so, even though I've thought, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, I'm a YouTuber, right? </garnt>
<garnt> This is a cool-ass job. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd be fuckin', I'd be
like "Yeah, this is sick." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went out and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> "All right so who's got any questions?" </connor>
<connor> Fuckin' no one had questions. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Man, what's going on?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Am I not cool?"
- "Is it me?" </connor>
<garnt> - "Am I not cool?" </garnt>
<garnt> Is this not epic? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Are you not being
entertained right now?" </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughs) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> "Are you not entertained?"
- What do I have to do, dab? </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'll dab.
(Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> You want me to dab? </connor>
<connor> What am I gonna do? </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I gotta TikTok." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - And then I was like,
and then, oh god, shut up. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> And then I think the
teacher felt bad for me </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was like, "Oh, I have a question." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh,
fuck my life. This is so- </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - "Do you know PewDiePie?" (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - You got the pity question. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But then I think they started
asking some questions. </connor>
<connor> It was all right. </connor>
<connor> It was just terrible and I
had to talk in Welsh, as well, </connor>
<connor> and I'm not, and I can talk in Welsh </connor>
<connor> but I'm not as able to express
myself as much in Welsh. </connor>
<joey> - How do you say YouTuber in Welsh? </joey>
<joey> - Just YouTuber. YouTuber.
- Oh, okay. that's boring. </joey>
<connor> Sounds like Japanese.
- Same in Thai. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Oh, fair enough. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, YouTube, YouTube, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kinda like a
slightly different accent. </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - Yeah, (speaks in
foreign language) YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Just that's it. But- </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and it was all
right. It was just fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> I shoulda prepared more. </joey>
<joey> But I also didn't know what to talk about. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Just ask me shit?" </joey>
<joey> - I guess the 10 year olds
woulda been better, right, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they were more curious. </joey>
<connor> - Bro, they were great. </connor>
<joey> They were fuckin' loving it. </joey>
<garnt> They were, 'cause I also
was doing it over Zoom </garnt>
<garnt> and I had my streaming-
- Oh you did it Zoom? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it was like three weeks ago. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, shit. Wow. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, you didn't tell me about this. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you didn't tell me about this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was saving it for "Trash
Taste". (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. Fuck. (laughs)
Wow, there you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> - Thank God I remembered. </joey>
<joey> - We're getting the same
experience as you viewers. </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I set up my streaming
stuff with the virtual webcam. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So basically, I had my
stream setup up to the Zoom, </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> and what I was doing was- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's just my Phillips
Hues lights back there. </joey>
<garnt> You know, I can control it. </garnt>
<joey> - No, you were like, "So,
what do you think Twitch, </joey>
<connor> I mean, 10 year olds?" </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - So I had all the zooms
and the wide angles </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like fuckin' around with that </garnt>
<garnt> and doing all the sound effects </garnt>
<garnt> and doing all the memes sounds and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> while I was doing the
presentation for them </garnt>
<connor> and answering their questions. </connor>
<garnt> - You like these memes, kids? (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I was literally
doing live video editing </garnt>
<garnt> and these fucking kids
were losing it, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> It was so fun. It was so satisfy- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Were you just in a private livestream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just did a private Twitch
stream, basically. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - Yeah. Literally. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It was so fun.
These kids loved it, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I bet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> every time I did the
fucking wide camera angle </garnt>
<garnt> they fucking started
pissing themselves laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> It was so fun. </garnt>
<connor> And (laughs) </connor>
<connor> and they also all watched anime. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - Which was great. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember you
saying in the FCCJ interview, </garnt>
<garnt> that you were like, "What's
your favorite anime?" </garnt>
<garnt> And you said "Attack on Titan". </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I assume you just said that
'cause you were just like, </connor>
<garnt> "What's a popular anime every kid-" </garnt>
<connor> - So these kids were 10 years old. </connor>
<garnt> They should not be
watching "Attack on Titan". </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - They should not be watching. </connor>
<connor> - Shoulda said "JoJo" and see if- </connor>
<connor> - No, I don't think, no. </connor>
<garnt> - How far the net has been casted. </garnt>
<connor> - So I said "Attack on Titan" </connor>
<garnt> and these kids all went like, "Yes!" </garnt>
<connor> They were like, "Who's
you favorite character?" </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Captain Levi." </connor>
<connor> They were like, "Yes!" </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What
the fuck is goin' on?" </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "What's
your favorite sound effect?" </connor>
<connor> And I started playing with them and stuff. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> They loved it. They were like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I was surprised 'cause normally
the one question you get </connor>
<connor> from kids is like "How much do you make?" </connor>
<connor> None of them asked that. </connor>
<connor> I was very, like "Wow. Nice
kids. Very respectful kids." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because at that
age, right, YouTube is still </joey>
<connor> kind of in the dreamscape, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's not until you hit high
school where you're like, </garnt>
<joey> "So is it worth not going to uni for?" </joey>
<garnt> - Do 10 year olds care about
how much money people make? </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think. </garnt>
<connor> - Some do. </connor>
<joey> - I never cared at 10 years old. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno, it depends on the kid. </joey>
<joey> But they were really nice. </joey>
<joey> They asked, they were like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, what age do you
recommend starting YouTube?" </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "That's a tough question." </joey>
<connor> 'Cause at one point, I'd
recommend stay as far away </connor>
<connor> from the internet as
possible as long as you can. </connor>
<connor> But I'll also, on the other hand, </connor>
<connor> getting experience editing
is never a bad thing. </connor>
<connor> Getting good video
editing from like age 12 </connor>
<connor> is just great experience. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, just for life in general. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Being able to make
videos is a super useful, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very handy technique
that will come in useful, </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> I guarantee, in your life. </joey>
<joey> At some point you will wanna make a video. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Even in a corporate
job, it's useful as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - You will wanna make
a video at some point. </joey>
<joey> And being able to make a
video and not shit yourself </joey>
<joey> opening software is very useful. </joey>
<joey> - True, true. </joey>
<joey> - And I was saying, "It's
all just being able to learn </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> something's great." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was great. These kids were really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "I," I sort of
felt like, I was kinda proud. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "These kids are
good. Good kids, these." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "They're askin'
the right questions." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good lads, these lads. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - I'm like, "You gotta
a good set there, Mom." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, "Did you like school?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Of course I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> Only when my mom told me
to." My mom was in the room. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, "Yeah, of course." </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like, "Oh, </garnt>
<garnt> did you like school?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Of course I did. </garnt>
<connor> That's what I told Mrs. Colquhoun. </connor>
<connor> But secretly, no I didn't." </connor>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - So, this thing was it a Zoom call? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Or were, was it like a virtual classroom </garnt>
<connor> or were they in a physical classroom? </connor>
<connor> - They were in a physical classroom. </connor>
<garnt> I was on like a big screen.
- [Garnt] Okay. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I could see them. </garnt>
<connor> And then, at one point,
I tried to show them </connor>
<connor> my audio setup thing </connor>
<connor> and it unplugged and crashed my whole PC. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, I texted
my mom, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Mom, I'm sorry, gimme five minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Gotta reboot my whole PC." </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> It was pretty bad, but it was good fun. </joey>
<joey> They were really cute.
They were really nice. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna do that.
- I wanna do that. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds really fun.
- I'm sure, ask- </joey>
<joey> - Where's-
- Ask your- </joey>
<joey> - Hey, Allambie Heights Primary School, </joey>
<garnt> gimme the email. </garnt>
<connor> - Hey, Baginton Mill,
come on. Come on. Come on. </connor>
<garnt> I'm right there. I'm right there, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I was just tellin' my
mom, I was telling my mom, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Ah, sure." 'Cause
my mom really wanted to, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, maybe she wanted
the flags, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, hardcore. Hardcore.
- I don't know why Mom wanted, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they all knew I was a YouTuber </connor>
<connor> but my mom didn't want
to tell them who I was, </connor>
<connor> 'cause all my stuff is not
appropriate for 10 year olds. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Fair enough." </connor>
<joey> I mean, especially "Trash Taste" is not- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, let's not show them "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> - Nevermind. Allambie Heights,
I take that back. (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> Maybe it's not a good idea for the kids </connor>
<joey> to be exposed to my content. </joey>
<joey> - Oh you can call someone
and talk about it, </joey>
<joey> they don't have to know your
YouTube channel, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe the sixth graders can watch, </joey>
<joey> but anyone below that, probably not. </joey>
<joey> - Baginton Mill, show
them the hentai episode. </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey's like "Fuckin',
I went to a porn studio. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I went to Porn Land." </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - Show them the episode d-link. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> - Here's my favorite porno. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Perfect content. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, no, no. </connor>
<joey> - I'll send you the Patreon
version, it's all right. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was fine. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it was way more
fun than the high school. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause the high school I just
stood there and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What do you wanna know?" </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were like, "Ah, nothing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "You're all
boring. You're all boring." </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> - It's like "We know what you do." </connor>
<connor> Yeah, because I guess at that age, </connor>
<connor> it's like you hear enough
about the behind the scenes of </connor>
<connor> YouTubers, right? </connor>
<connor> Because you kinda start to
explore further past the surface. </connor>
<connor> - But, I do feel that like one thing, </connor>
<connor> especially in a small
town where I grew up, </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not told anything about
being able to do anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> outside of your small town. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, the most ambitious
thing you're told about doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is leaving your town to go
to another university town </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> Like, the thought of being
able to go to a foreign country </garnt>
<garnt> and study was like never
even brought up to me. </garnt>
<garnt> It was never even suggested to me </garnt>
<garnt> that was a possibility. </garnt>
<garnt> No one in my school studied abroad. </garnt>
<garnt> That was not even mentioned. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I feel kinda cheated </garnt>
<garnt> that that was never mentioned to me. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I meet people who studied
in all of these countries </garnt>
<garnt> and that was just 'cause
their school was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, by the way, these
courses are available." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Why did no one tell me?" </garnt>
<garnt> This is my, </garnt>
<garnt> this is like, maybe it's my
teachers' fault, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Someone should've told me
that this was an option </garnt>
<garnt> that I coulda done. </garnt>
<garnt> This is something that </garnt>
<connor> there shoulda been more
options told to me. </connor>
<connor> And so I went into there and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Listen, the teachers
are gonna tell you stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like what they're supposed to tell you. </connor>
<connor> But please, do your own
research and check for courses </connor>
<connor> that interest you, check
for international courses, </connor>
<connor> check for stuff that's
outside of what is being told </connor>
<connor> and fed to you. </connor>
<connor> Because there is so much more options </connor>
<connor> that are so interesting </connor>
<connor> and way more fitting for you. </connor>
<connor> Like somebody who hates engineering, </connor>
<connor> like myself, who did it, </connor>
<connor> was never really gonna
get an engineering job. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I would, I'd realize
within two, three years </connor>
<connor> I despise it and I would quit
and go do something else. </connor>
<joey> - That might of been like a
deadbeat job for you I reckon. </joey>
<joey> - Right. It woulda been
something I despised, right? </joey>
<connor> And that was just because I didn't, </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> there was no other
options presented to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I almost feel like
the system was kind of, </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> failed, because it
didn't tell me anything. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just told these
are the courses I can do. </garnt>
<garnt> "Just choose. </garnt>
<connor> Or go to McDonalds, see ya buddy." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and I feel like
a lot of people do just, </connor>
<connor> it's not a case of people
don't wanna do this, </connor>
<connor> it's just a case of people just </connor>
<connor> don't know that it's out there. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I had exactly the
same experience with you, </connor>
<garnt> where the only reason I have a more </garnt>
<connor> understanding about international culture </connor>
<garnt> is because I come from an
international background </garnt>
<garnt> and an international family. </garnt>
<garnt> Because my family flew over from Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the only reason I knew, </garnt>
<garnt> but even with that background, </garnt>
<garnt> I had no idea how many different
paths I could've taken, </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of study abroad </garnt>
<garnt> or have different kind
of experiences like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. If you speak fluent English, </connor>
<garnt> you can go and study in any
English-speaking country. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And apply for an international student </garnt>
<garnt> and you'll probably get
accepted if you're not, </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't have like a
fuckin' criminal background. </garnt>
<joey> You'll probably get accepted. </joey>
<connor> And if I'd have known that I
coulda just gone to America </connor>
<joey> and studied I'd have done that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- 100%. </connor>
<connor> I woulda done that.
- That's one of my </connor>
<connor> biggest life regrets, is
the fact that I got offered </connor>
<garnt> to go study in Japan for two
months during high school. </garnt>
<garnt> And I said no, because I was too lazy. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's legit the biggest
fuckin' regret in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Same here. I think I always
had the same opportunity </garnt>
<garnt> to study abroad when I was in high school </garnt>
<joey> and I just didn't take it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm like "Well, none
of my mates are taking it, </joey>
<garnt> so why would I take it?"
- [Joey] Yeah! Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, well that- </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, "I'm gonna be away </connor>
<connor> from my friends and family for like </connor>
<joey> three months, I don't want that." </joey>
<joey> - Instead I went to another
shit hole Welsh town. </joey>
<joey> I'm kidding, it was all right. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<joey> But I would've loved to
have explored, you know? </joey>
<connor> And done more stuff. </connor>
<joey> And if I knew that was an
option, I woulda gone for it. </joey>
<joey> So that's the main reason
why I went to the school, </joey>
<connor> to talk to these kids, </connor>
<connor> was 'cause I was like, "Tell
these kids." Sorry. (laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck was that?
- "Teach the kids." </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> "Gotta teach the kids." </connor>
<connor> No, I thought, I'd let them
know and just say like, </connor>
<connor> "Listen, you can do shit." (laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, just do shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can literally do anything
you want, bro. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> - Don't let your dreams
be dreams. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - So, hopefully, one
of those kids looked up </connor>
<garnt> and did something and had fun. </garnt>
<connor> Probably not, though, I mean.
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, 'cause even in university, </garnt>
<garnt> there would be like courses where </garnt>
<garnt> you'd have the opportunity
to study at one of </garnt>
<garnt> their sister universities
in another country. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember, there were, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can tell the kinda people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who were going to study abroad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they just seemed like
they were up for anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just like, "Man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I had the balls that you had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Back when I was in
university 'cause I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that woulda been one of the
best experiences in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or just like a really valuable and, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a valuable piece of experience that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just didn't get until
later in life, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> part of your life after university, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and especially during your mid to late 30s </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that you kinda realize that life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just kinda stays the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unless you actively search
for new experiences. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, exactly, that's it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I didn't realize that until after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> university life had ended, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we were just really lucky, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as a kid, as a teenager,
whatever, to just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every year you'd kind
of get a new experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, once that period
of your life is over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then you just have to
search for that yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just not gonna come to you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gotta do that yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's why I feel like a lotta people </SPEAKER_05>
<joey> who we, in the same area
who we grew up with, </joey>
<joey> they just didn't end up
staying in that same area. </joey>
<joey> Or they just, </joey>
<joey> you go back home and they
haven't changed much, right? </joey>
<joey> And that's just because
they haven't realized that </joey>
<joey> if they don't do something, </joey>
<joey> then nothing's ever gonna change </joey>
<joey> and some people are comfortable with that. </joey>
<joey> And that's completely fine. </joey>
<joey> But I think there are, </joey>
<joey> I've met enough people in my life who </joey>
<joey> have like this urge to do something new </joey>
<joey> and do something different </joey>
<joey> but don't even know where to get started. </joey>
<joey> - You should go for it. </joey>
<garnt> - And I feel like, just go for it. </garnt>
<joey> Just do you- </joey>
<joey> - You miss every shot
you don't take, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- That's like it. </garnt>
<connor> - Just do something out
of your comfort zone. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, at some point. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you don't need
an excuse to do anything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just take a risk. </joey>
<joey> - I remember, one time, my friend went </joey>
<joey> and traveled abroad alone. </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Wow. What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can do that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just go somewhere for fun, alone?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember I thought, "Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> I'm kinda jealous that this guy </connor>
<connor> just had the balls to do that." </connor>
<connor> And now, I wouldn't mind doing that. </connor>
<connor> I'd do it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't, it's not preferable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I wouldn't mind doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I wanna go somewhere,
or you wanna do something, </SPEAKER_04>
<connor> you don't need an excuse to do it. </connor>
<connor> Just fuckin' go somewhere.
- Just do it. </connor>
<garnt> - I always thought, I remember, </garnt>
<garnt> I was talking to a guy who had, </garnt>
<garnt> back in university, </garnt>
<garnt> he was talking about, </garnt>
<garnt> this was a guy in his 30s, </garnt>
<joey> he was talking about, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I used to work at this big company. </joey>
<joey> And then I just quit. And saved up. </joey>
<joey> And just traveled, for
like a year or two." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "Wait. </joey>
<joey> I thought gap years were, </joey>
<joey> I thought you could do
that after your gap years. </joey>
<joey> That's what gap years were for." </joey>
<joey> And he's just like, "No, </joey>
<joey> I just did it because I just
needed change in my life." </joey>
<joey> And you're like, "Wait, </joey>
<joey> but what happens when you go back? </joey>
<joey> What, you have a career, right?" </joey>
<garnt> I just couldn't comprehend
someone just doing </garnt>
<joey> something out of </joey>
<garnt> the life path that, you know, </garnt>
<joey> the career path that I was taught." </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] You can do everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, yeah, the
moment you have your career, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, "Why would you willingly </garnt>
<garnt> just end your career like that?" </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughs) Why would you just
quit your job like that? Ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But, I mean, yeah. Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> If I was in that position, I'd
probably do it too, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> And sometimes it does take that
kind of massive risk-taking </garnt>
<connor> to realize that, "Oh,
maybe it's fuckin' worth it </connor>
<connor> to end your career. </connor>
<connor> Maybe that career wasn't worth it." </connor>
<garnt> - I'm gonna end my career.
- Be a YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, YouTubers be like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just be a YouTuber.
- YouTubers be like. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just gonna end my career. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just gonna end my
career. Go on a trip. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I feel like
especially this goes to most </garnt>
<garnt> high schoolers, because I feel like that's </garnt>
<joey> the point in your life where
you have the most opportunity </joey>
<joey> to do something crazy with your life. </joey>
<joey> Not even something crazy, </joey>
<joey> just something outta your comfort zone. </joey>
<garnt> Something that can increase
your perspective of </garnt>
<joey> what happens in the world.
- Just try some shit out, </joey>
<joey> if it doesn't work out, </joey>
<joey> try some different shit, until it clicks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, if you're about to go
to university at some point, </connor>
<connor> and you might be looking
for courses or whatever, </connor>
<connor> dude, look around for international stuff, </connor>
<garnt> whatever, there's tons out there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anything that interests you.
- It'll be fun as fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Trust me. </connor>
<connor> I remember, the biggest
adventure I'd gone on </connor>
<joey> is just moving cities to
go to my university town </joey>
<joey> and in England, every
city's kind of the same. </joey>
<joey> You get the same kinda experience, </joey>
<joey> you get freshers week,
you go drink a fuckton, </joey>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the same, (laughs) it
was like the same experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no matter what university
I would've gone to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I wish I studied abroad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish I'd done something new. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> after I quit to become a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> I was gaining back the
years that I could've had </garnt>
<garnt> if I'd just gone out of my
comfort zone earlier in my life. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I've definitely been doing that, </joey>
<joey> since I've gotten so many
opportunities doing this job, </joey>
<joey> I feel like I'm just
playing a catch-up game, </joey>
<connor> I'm taking literally every thing </connor>
<connor> that comes to my doorstep now, </connor>
<connor> because I didn't take any
of that shit, back then. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Same, same. </garnt>
<garnt> - So and now I regret it. </garnt>
<garnt> Being like, "Oh, fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> Why was I so lazy and
dumb to not take these, </garnt>
<garnt> now that I look at it, </garnt>
<joey> amazing fuckin' opportunities?" </joey>
<joey> Now I know that, everything
that comes to me, </joey>
<joey> even if it seems dumb or
pointless or whatever, </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna fuckin' take it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean. </connor>
<connor> I let "League of Legends"
ruin my life so I'm just, </connor>
<connor> I put far too many hours
into "League of Legends" </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "I want
something from them." </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you know what,
I'm gonna try something else, </connor>
<connor> "Apex Legends".
(Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<joey> - I'm gonna, it's like I
quit "League of Legends", </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> I might try happiness
for once, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<joey> See how it works out for
me, you know? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - See which one I prefer. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna see if it's for me, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> Gonna see if being happy works out for me. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> - This thing called
happiness, what is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "League" players be like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - "I've heard about that before." </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god, I hate "League of Legends". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was so, I've never
felt more empowered than </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> leaving "League of Legends". </connor>
<connor> I feel like, "Wow. I have
more time for shit now. </connor>
<SPEAKER_04> Look at that. Look at that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<garnt> - I feel like that, </garnt>
<connor> I haven't touched a gacha game in a while- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Good for you,
Garnt. Good for you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, the only reason I
haven't is because I filled </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> that time with learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, "Well."
- The glow-up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I'm gonna have time
wasted doing something everyday </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> then I might as well
do it productively and- </connor>
<connor> - I think that's not a waste then, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Exactly. (laughs)
- So, it's not a time waste. </connor>
<connor> - Wow, that is like- </connor>
<connor> - Or, I should say, time sink. </connor>
<connor> - There you go. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause learning a language
is definitely a time sink. </garnt>
<connor> - "League of Legends"
is not a hour time sink. </connor>
<connor> It's like a four hour time sink. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs)
Minimum. </SPEAKER_05>
<garnt> And then you get angry after it. </garnt>
<garnt> At least with Japanese,
you're frustrated after it. </garnt>
<connor> You're not angry. </connor>
<joey> - You're optimizing
adulthood right now, Garnt. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - You know who else loves
taking opportunities and risks? </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> Our patrons. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just, I don't know. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a wild accusation, but. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<connor> I'm sorry if you're a
non-risk taker patron, but. </connor>
<garnt> - That was like a segue
that just veered off </garnt>
<connor> and crashed man. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] You tried, Joey. You tried. </connor>
<connor> - An attempt was made. </connor>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, an attempt was made. That's right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As usual, look at these lovely patrons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who are now funding this new studio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We literally, our patrons
are now funding this studio, </SPEAKER_05>

<connor> adequate space. </connor>
