<garnt> - I wanna get better at pen spins again. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just do it with muscle memory now. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even think about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I hold a pen and I just start doing it. </garnt>
<joey> - I used to be able to do
that one and then the one </joey>
<joey> where you flick it and
then it goes back it back. </joey>
<joey> - And it goes back, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I can't do it anymore. </joey>
<joey> I can only do that one.
(pen clatters) </joey>
<joey> Fuck. (chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> (laid-back music) </garnt>
<garnt> - How many like useless
skills have you ever learned </garnt>
<garnt> in your life? </garnt>
<joey> - It's just my entire life. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> My entire life is a list of useful skills. </connor>
<connor> - Every video game ever. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Every video game ever. I think one day- </joey>
<joey> - What counts as a useful skill? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Like, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> So, like the reason I learned pen spinning </joey>
<joey> is 'cause I fidget. </joey>
<joey> Like, I guess we just started, </joey>
<joey> but the reason I learned pen spinning </joey>
<joey> is because I just really like to fidget, </joey>
<joey> as you guys know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- So I thought to myself, </joey>
<joey> if I fidget all the time, </joey>
<joey> might as well make it look cool. </joey>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<garnt> And that's literally the reason I learned </garnt>
<garnt> how to do the pen spin thing. </garnt>
<joey> - I just did it 'cause
I was bored in class. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Otherwise I'd probably
just like start chewing </garnt>
<garnt> on the pen or something, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. I was like,
I was definitely that kid. </garnt>
<connor> - What about like the people who like- </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Felix does this with the knives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The knives?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna- </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Well, you can't really bring
a knife to school, can you? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - How do you even get into that? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Hey, teach." </joey>
<connor> - How do you learn and get into that </connor>
<connor> and then start doing it? </connor>
<joey> - I'd be way too scared to try. </joey>
<garnt> - It's not about learning
or getting into that </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there's so many YouTube
channels that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> teach that kind of stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's having the commitment to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to learn this now, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to spend time
learning this skill, </garnt>
<garnt> which I don't ever know if I'm gonna A, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, gonna be able
to use this in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> Or again, what's a skill that's useful? </joey>
<garnt> - Actually. Why did you learn
how to solve a Rubik's Cube? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I've always just wanted to. </garnt>
<connor> - Really?
- 'Cause again, </connor>
<connor> you know, imagine you're
the only Asian kid </connor>
<connor> in a white school, right? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> So, you're just like given
these like insane expectations </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to do these like crazy skills, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Like people never believed me in school </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> when I said that I couldn't play chess </joey>
<joey> just 'cause they're like,
"But you're the Asian kid. </joey>
<joey> You're the smart kid. </joey>
<joey> You should know how to
do all these things. </joey>
<joey> Like you can't play
Shogi you can't play Go?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, fake Asian. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And so, and Rubik cubes </joey>
<joey> are a bit like stereotypically, right? </joey>
<joey> - Are they? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Are they though? </joey>
<joey> - Back when I was in school it was. </joey>
<garnt> - By the way, welcome to Trash Taste. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> We just jumped right into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> I'm Connor featuring the
boys, Garnt and Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Me, the Rubik's Cube player. </joey>
<connor> - The Rubik's Cube kid. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, and like I always like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was one of
those things that I feel </connor>
<connor> you go to like any house.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - And there's like a high possibility </connor>
<connor> that it's just kinda like sitting there </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> as like an ornament, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like very rare, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say like out of 10 houses
that have a Rubik's Cube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nine of them probably
have like a thin layer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of dust on top of 'em
'cause it's just like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like a cool little knick-knack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to put on the shelf, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To make my- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like that coffee table book, </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> you know, that like no one
actually reads when it's like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, you read this?" </connor>
<joey> And they're like, "Yeah.' </joey>
<garnt> - It's like iconic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. It's like a piece- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like how often do you get to flex </garnt>
<joey> your Rubik's Cube skills? </joey>
<joey> If it's not like- </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Only on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If we didn't have like a
Trash Taste Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How many times in your life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have like you gone to a party </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> and you're like, "Oh my
God, it's a Rubik's Cube. </garnt>
<garnt> Guys, I'm about to flex." </garnt>
<garnt> - Step back.
- Step back, guys. </garnt>
<joey> - Here comes the Asian kid. </joey>
<joey> - I think everyone who knows
how to solve a Rubik's Cube </joey>
<joey> says they don't regret it. </joey>
<joey> - No? </joey>
<joey> - No, they don't. </joey>
<connor> They've very (cross-talking). </connor>
<joey> - I guess it's like weirdly
an impressive skill to have. </joey>
<connor> - I promised them a video,
I was gonna learn it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not that hard. I actually
learned it once as well. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I learned it, </garnt>
<connor> I've completely forgotten
it, but I remember like- </connor>
<connor> - Couldn't have been that
easy then? It's not that hard. </connor>
<connor> I forgot it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - I learned it in a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like I remember
I was in a hotel room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was staying in this
hotel and for some reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like this, you know,
it was like this chic hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> they tried doing like different things </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with their decorations and
it just had a Rubik's Cube </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that was unsolved in this
like really clean hotel room. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - And my like OCD mind was
just like, how dare they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How dare- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like they fucking designed this room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like just mildly infuriating. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> Just to like, it was a
perfectly clean room. </joey>
<joey> It looked amazing. </joey>
<joey> But on the desk there was
just a Rubik's Cube on there. </joey>
<joey> - It's like those memes of like, </joey>
<joey> you just see a picture and it's like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> what's wrong with this image? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like I could not sleep
in this like hotel room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing that there was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like staring all
night at this Rubik's Cube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was just unsolved. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And so I just took a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just Googled how
to solve a Rubik's Cube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I could fucking just like solve it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I went to bed, learn how to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it like, I never really
thought about how to solve </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> a Rubik's Cube before and I was like, </joey>
<garnt> oh, it's actually pretty simple. </garnt>
<joey> It's just an algorithm basically. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Right. </joey>
<joey> It's just a bunch of like algorithms. </joey>
<connor> - When you're following a
guide, it's pretty easy. </connor>
<connor> But the hard part is being able to do it </connor>
<garnt> independently of a guide.
- So, I never got to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where it was just like
muscle memory, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like- </garnt>
<garnt> it was just like, you know,
it was a slow process, </garnt>
<garnt> but anyone's able to solve a Rubik's Cube. </garnt>
<joey> - I also remember like
the reason why I actually </joey>
<joey> like finally learnt how to solve it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I always wanted to solve it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> since I was in high school, 'cause again, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I got, you know, called that kid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> But then, you know, pandemic hit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone's stuck inside
and it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I think everyone had that
point where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I need to fucking
do something, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can only play so many hours </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> of Animal Crossing per day, right? </connor>
<connor> So, it's like- </connor>
<connor> - There's only so many sourdough
breads that you can bake. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, exactly. So,
I was like, all right, </connor>
<joey> well, let's like learn a
bunch of useless skills. </joey>
<joey> So, I think I learned how to
do like four or five different </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> useless skills and just Rubik's Cubes </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> just happened to be one. </joey>
<joey> - What were the other ones? </joey>
<joey> - The other one was, you know, </joey>
<joey> you've probably seen it before. </joey>
<joey> Do you know what kendama is? </joey>
<joey> It's like this very old Japanese toy </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> that it kind looks like
a hammer with a ball. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Oh that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I did that as a kid, but
I wasn't very good at it. </joey>
<joey> - And what is that like? </joey>
<joey> - It's this like really
ancient Japanese toy, </joey>
<garnt> kind of like, you know, like
spinning tops and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the challenge? </garnt>
<garnt> - The challenge is you have to- </garnt>
<garnt> So, there's three different
plates on this like, </garnt>
<joey> it looks like a hammer.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And there's like a concave
like plate on the bottom </joey>
<joey> and there's two concave plates on the side </joey>
<joey> and there's like a
little spike on the top. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The regular one, </joey>
<joey> yeah, that thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The regular one is like, </joey>
<joey> you kind of turn it to the
side and you have to throw </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> the ball up without
actually holding the ball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and let it land in the cup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Mm, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just like the simple skill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's like a million
different like tricks you can do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> It's kinda like yo-yoing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Where it's like, you can just
like regularly do a yo-yo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then there are yo-yo tricks, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Which are just like on another
level of difficult and skill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Those are cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so like kendama is
kind of the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like Japan every year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has like these like kendama championships </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> where like you can
actually get like licenses </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like certificates to say
that you are a pro kendama </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like player, if you do like
these certain tricks, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - That sounds cool. </joey>
<joey> - And one of the tricks, </joey>
<joey> I could do like the regular cup. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like that's fucking easy. </joey>
<joey> Like anyone can do that, honestly. </joey>
<joey> One of the hardest ones is
where you have to get it </joey>
<joey> so that the ball lands on the spike. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> - By doing this. </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds impossible. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a trick to it. </garnt>
<joey> But then I was like, I'm
gonna learn how to do that </joey>
<joey> during this pandemic. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, I bought like a proper
like professional-graded, </joey>
<garnt> like kendama because they have those. </garnt>
<garnt> There's like toy ones and then there's- </garnt>
<garnt> - Professional-graded. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, there's like a kendama- </joey>
<joey> - This is a serious player. </joey>
<joey> - There's like a national
kendama committee in Japan </joey>
<joey> where they're like they
look at each kendama </joey>
<joey> and they're like, "Yeah, </joey>
<joey> you can use those in competitions." </joey>
<joey> And it comes with like a
certificate to be like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> this is a certified kendama.
- So, did you learn how to do? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I learned how to do it. </joey>
<joey> - Well, now you've gotta
bring it into the office. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like curious now. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't say that. </garnt>
<connor> They better be a video on screen
right now of Joey doing it. </connor>
<garnt> - How have you never like posted a video </garnt>
<joey> on Twitter or something? </joey>
<joey> - Because it's like the most
niche thing on the planet. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would like to see you.
- Okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just randomly like
in the next Anime Man </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> or Joey video, you just like have, well, </joey>
<joey> just casually do it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Just don't explain yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just casually do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear to God, I swear to God, </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> every comment is going to be
about that one thing, right? </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I was gifted a Rubik's
Cube once as a kid. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For Christmas. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - By my parents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was a Harry Potter Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, all the tiles were themed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were all pictures of Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right.
- 'Cause I loved Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> Of course, I did, 'cause I'm British. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so I have this cube, right? </joey>
<joey> And I'm thinking, wow, this is just great. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I turn it once. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh no, no, I'll put it back. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't wanna ruin the picture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like the picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> What's the point in the
cube if I (muttering). </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - That's me and basically
every Rubik's Cube before. </garnt>
<connor> - So, you know, and then
another day I go back to it </connor>
<connor> and I turn it once, turn it
twice. And I'm like, no, no, no. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't, I don't want to ruin it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And then one time I go, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> a few days later or
whatever, I love this cube. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> It's the most awful thing. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's so hard to solve
because the pictures are so shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I start turning it </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> and I turn it like four or
five times and I'm like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna start turning it back. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I turn it back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like one, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Two, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not back the way it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I'm like, okay,
I think it's like just one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's one thing out of place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can fix this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I start trying things and
I just keep fucking it up. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] It just gets worse and worse. </connor>
<connor> - And then I realized
what a shit toy this is. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like eight years old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I cannot solve this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now, I'm just fucked. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> And now if I wanna see the
picture of Harry Potter, </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> I have to actually like
learn how to solve it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But I'm eight and I don't know how, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> no one's even began to explain to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's an algorithm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Now, I Google, I get one
hour a day to go online. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not using that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna go watch Yu-Gi-Oh!
GX, episode 400 part one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of three hours (cross-talking). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Espanol. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna do that and not
look at the Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I was just like really disappointed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was really sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember I found
it a few years later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought, oh, I'll give it a shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> And then I just- </joey>
<joey> - That seems more difficult
than a regular one. </joey>
<joey> - It was. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the pictures were all like- </joey>
<joey> - Like low res? </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was Harry Potter and it was Hogwarts. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> So, they're all like brown. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Did you take like the stickers off? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, okay. I was gonna ask that. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> That's what I did as a kid. </garnt>
<connor> - But then when I did
that, it wasn't, you know, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause this was the factory,
the factory production, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the cubes were perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> So, when I started peeling them and shit </joey>
<joey> they were all like,
oh, a little bit wonky. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't get... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Stickers are some of
the most annoying shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like place. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you put it and you're like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm doing it perfectly flat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You put it on. Doosh. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> I don't know how that happens. </connor>
<garnt> - Every time. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't wanna get gum clumpy like. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, fuck it. (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - It's like that, but
(cross-talking) (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> like I think the only like
useless skill I've learned </garnt>
<garnt> before was, I mean, do you
guys know how to juggle? </garnt>
<joey> - I learned how to do the one handed. </joey>
<garnt> - Learned how to do the one handed juggle? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> But like, you know, with two
balls where you kind of like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never got to the point
where it was with three. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, growing
up in Brighton Beach, </garnt>
<joey> I remember like one day I
just decided to just learn </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> how to juggle using pebbles and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think I can still juggle. I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I dunno, I dunno. It has been a while. </garnt>
<joey> - We have to have a video
where we show each other </joey>
<garnt> the useless skills we learned. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually, the most useful party trick, </garnt>
<joey> do you guys have any party tricks </joey>
<joey> that you like can show off
in a party or whatever? </joey>
<garnt> - Not that I remember. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm like fucking Susan
Boyle, every party I go to, </connor>
<connor> just everyone stops. </connor>
<garnt> - Actually, like the
most useful party trick </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> I know is just being able to
open a bottle with anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I've done that a few times. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's not just like- </joey>
<joey> Every time you do it, if
you wanna just know a trick </joey>
<joey> that will take you five minutes to learn, </joey>
<garnt> but will be useful in basically
every party you go to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just learn how to open
a bottle with a lighter </garnt>
<garnt> or another bottle. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like us not
sharing these abilities </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> is like making this episode worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the point of us filming this? </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - No-one believes us. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's point of us filming this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like how often do you go to a party </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see a Rubik's Cube there </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> and you're like, finally. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like boys, step back. </garnt>
<connor> - Boys, my time to shine. </connor>
<connor> - I can click my wrists on command. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Yeah, I can. </connor>
<connor> (wrists clicking) </connor>
<joey> - Urgh. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, that doesn't sound healthy. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Ah. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> You got like a 80-year-old wrist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that the gamer wrist? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the gamer wrist. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - That's the gamer wrist. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wanna see these scars, boys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tell me you have carpal tunnel. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> Say you have carpal tunnel. </joey>
<connor> - I can just click both of them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I only know like
small little things that will, </joey>
<joey> you know, maybe impress like
your five-year-old cousin. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You know, </joey>
<joey> when you're at home, </joey>
<joey> like I can do like the
water droplet sound, </joey>
<joey> like that's the only thing I can do. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> You can do the Skype thing perfectly. </connor>
<connor> - The Skype thing? </connor>
<connor> - The Skype... </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey singing the Skype ring theme) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Is that a skill? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just like ran out
of shit to talk about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, Oh, what'd you do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey do that thing again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey sings the Skype ring theme) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's really
funny. (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - We're talking about useless skills. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - That appeals to a very
like tight niche, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> like you have to be on the
internet in the mid 2000s </connor>
<joey> to appreciate that one. </joey>
<connor> - Can you do the Windows
XP shutdown noise? </connor>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<connor> Can you do that? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey singing the Windows shutdown notes) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not accurate at all.
That's just me singing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing)
- Shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've never done that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why did you think I could do that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've always been able to
do that thing where you like </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> hold your body up. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why I've
always been able to do that. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, what do you mean? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, the one that's like
through here, like that? </joey>
<connor> - Like when you're just like on a surface </connor>
<garnt> and you can like hold your whole body. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you mean like what
break dancers do, kind of? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've
always been able to do that. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. You have to have like
good core strength for that. </connor>
<connor> Don't you? </connor>
<connor> I guess you got great
core strength, right? </connor>
<connor> - I dunno. Maybe I do. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if (mutters). </connor>
<garnt> - This like conversation
has just reminded me </garnt>
<garnt> that I like I went through like a phase, </garnt>
<garnt> like, you know, you're a kid </garnt>
<joey> and sometimes you go
through phases, right? </joey>
<joey> So, I remember the first
time I ever saw David Blaine </joey>
<joey> on TV doing street magic. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, I want to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That looks incredible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like
going through this phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I, you know, there
was these packages, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was before you could
just Google or YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to do magic tricks online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I actually had to
like pay, like send off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had to convince my
parents to send off money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this company that like
supposedly sent you magic tricks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like magic secrets and all that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That just sounds like a
scam. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, I'm surprised
like for the one time </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> in my life, it wasn't a scam. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They actually like
sent me back like a VHS </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I-
- Oh shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like played. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember like learning
how to do like a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of these magic tricks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna impress everyone around me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like there's never a moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you go to a party or
you go to a family gathering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, you don't wanna be
that guy who just brings out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a deck of cards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey ya, pick a card.
Pick a card, any card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, you know, I know magic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have have a deck of cards
on me right now, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't wanna be that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I've never been able to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though I learned how to
use these skills as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I never was able to show them off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I mean, it's kinda like
martial arts in some way, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, you know, talking to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember seeing this YouTube video about </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> like why do people learn martial arts? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you basically
spend years of your life. </connor>
<connor> You spend years and years
honing this one skill </connor>
<connor> for like these moments that will only last </connor>
<connor> maybe like a few minutes
of your life, right? </connor>
<joey> Unless you go to tournaments
and stuff like that, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like you're training yourself </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> for like that one fight
you're gonna be in, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in like whatever moment
that's going to be, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But then you spend years
building up to that moment, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like what if you just
fuck up in that moment, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> What if all the training
just leaves your body </garnt>
<garnt> in that one moment? </garnt>
<garnt> - What if the dude's like nine foot? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't try out for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> What weight are are you again? </joey>
<joey> Oh shit. </joey>
<joey> That's my weight class. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> (Connor laughing) I feel like
that's the good thing though </connor>
<joey> about like doing YouTube
is that like, for me, </joey>
<connor> I just use videos to do shit </connor>
<joey> that I otherwise wouldn't normally do. </joey>
<joey> So, like with like martial
arts, for instance, </joey>
<joey> like I remember, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> I don't even remember how
many years ago this was, </joey>
<joey> this is like a four or
five year old video. </joey>
<joey> I learned how to like backflip in a video. </joey>
<garnt> - I was going to say,
if there's one skill, </garnt>
<connor> I want to learn how to do
actually, it's the backflip. </connor>
<garnt> - What? Just like standing? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Just standing </joey>
<connor> - A standing backflip.
- You did a standing backflip? </connor>
<joey> - I did a standing backflip
once in a video. (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> It was me and like- </connor>
<connor> - What did your parents encourage you? </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> They're trying to get rid
of you? Like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I was in Japan already. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I was in Japan and it was
me, Dogan and my friend Al. </joey>
<connor> - But you were above the
age of like 15 doing this? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. This was like
four years ago. (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. That's like suicide. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And we, yeah, because we cosplayed </connor>
<joey> as Naruto characters. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> That's the reason you
learn how to backflip </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause of Naruto? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause there was a
Naruto online sponsorship. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Oh my God. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, well, </joey>
<joey> I need to do something Naruto-related. </joey>
<garnt> You know what? I'll learn ninja tricks. </garnt>
<garnt> And by ninja tricks, </garnt>
<joey> I mean just tricking and
learning how to backflip. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so how long did I
used to learn how to backflip? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Like I think we were in that gym </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> for maybe like five, six hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I learned how to do like
other tricking, like tricks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like Dogan used
to be like a fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like professional trickster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that the right word? I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Professional trickster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like a Persona character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What like hard-core? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He used to do like tricking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck?
- Are you serious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then he like hurt his
knees, I think really badly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he like couldn't stop doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> But he taught me how to
like backflip and shit. </joey>
<joey> And I did it successfully once. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- And I haven't done it since. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you think you'd be able to relearn </garnt>
<garnt> and pull off another backflip? </garnt>
<joey> - Maybe. </joey>
<joey> Because I think what took me so long </joey>
<garnt> and I think what the level of entry is </garnt>
<garnt> is that you just have
to get over your fear. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> That's what like, 'cause
I've seen people trying </joey>
<joey> to learn backflips. </joey>
<joey> So, I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> that looks like a really
interesting process. </connor>
<garnt> - You just snapped your
neck, just get over it. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> Get over the fear, you piece of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because like it's not natural </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> for you to be like, all right, </garnt>
<joey> jump and also pull your entire body back </joey>
<joey> like this at the same, like
your body's just like, no. </joey>
<joey> Don't do that. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's cool. </joey>
<connor> But the one skill I learned,
I also love this channel. </connor>
<connor> It's Mike Boyd. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, he just like </joey>
<joey> how long can it take me to learn X thing? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I think I know that
ca- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think I've seen that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's got this one video
and I really wanna learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> how to do this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He has an umbrella and
he's holding the umbrella </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the trick is is that
he throws the umbrella </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in front of him. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It goes like quite far away. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> And then it opens in midair
and while he's walking, </joey>
<joey> he catches the umbrella as he's like- </joey>
<joey> So, it fully opens- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it floats down and he catches it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I want to learn how to do that. </connor>
<joey> - There's so many like
little tricks like that </joey>
<joey> I wanna learn how to do. </joey>
<connor> - So, imagine you're on
like the Japanese street </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor makes whooshing noise) </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> all right. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like some anime shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I wanna do that with like a cap </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where like you throw the cap </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> and it lands perfectly on your head. </joey>
<connor> - But then that's not good enough. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you're always gonna
like pull it down, right? </joey>
<joey> With the umbrella it's like immediate. </joey>
<joey> You're like walking, you're good to go. </joey>
<connor> No readjustment. </connor>
<connor> You've got the umbrella. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no. You know, what's
a truly useless skill </joey>
<joey> I've always wanted to learn? </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Is to draw a perfect hand circle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. I've seen that. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I've seen so many
videos and every time I see it, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, not, </garnt>
<garnt> that is the most satisfying
thing in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like free=hand. Just like, whoosh. </garnt>
<garnt> - That one video when
the guy like does that. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The guy does that. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - I wanna do that shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, that's a cool party trick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is a cool party
trick. Everyone has a pencil. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> Not everyone has a Rubik's Cube, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. Exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't carry a pencil
on me all the time. </connor>
<joey> - Well, no, if you're at someone's house. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You're not gonna be in a house
that doesn't have a drawing </joey>
<joey> equipment of some kind. Have
you ever been in a house </joey>
<joey> where they just don't
have any pens and pencils? </joey>
<connor> - I think that's my house (mumbles). </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] That's just
Connor's house, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's my house.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - True millennial right here. </connor>
<garnt> - What's pencil? </garnt>
<garnt> What's pen and paper, dude? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - Actually. I don't think I
have a pencil in my house. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<garnt> - I have pens. </garnt>
<joey> - No, there's no way,
you guys live in Japan. </joey>
<joey> There's more paperwork
than fucking anything. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pencils, pens-
- Yeah, we just use pens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, pens, that's what
I mean like drawing things. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess like
now that I'm thinking- </joey>
<garnt> - Drawing equipment. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Drawing things.
- What's the word? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Are you calling pens- </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Drawing things.
- It's drawing things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is it called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - What are those painters paint with? </garnt>
<connor> Oh, yeah, they're drawing things. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fortunately I don't
draw anything. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When was the last time I drawed something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the sad music playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't drawn anything
since the accident. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> I haven't drawn anything. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just have like zero skill in drawing </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> and I have done for my entire
life, I think, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - We need to do like a
drawing competition now, </joey>
<joey> but just a- </joey>
<joey> - I'm somebody who also sucks at drawing, </joey>
<garnt> I believe it's like singing. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think you're
just like naturally good </garnt>
<garnt> like immediately, oh,
maybe you are actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think some people are.
- Some people are. </garnt>
<connor> - I think you do have to practice though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course you have to practice. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think the last
time I drew something, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember what the context was, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think I had to
draw a cat for something. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey sniggering) </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, it was the Netflix shoe. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember 'cause it was
for Anime Club and Netflix </garnt>
<garnt> and I had to draw a cat on
the whiteboard or something. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And, Joey just made like, </garnt>
<garnt> Joey, I was drawing this cat
and Joey could not recognize </garnt>
<garnt> like that was even an
animal that I was drawing </garnt>
<garnt> on this whiteboard. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - He drew like a UMA. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I dunno what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> It was like it was not of this earth. </connor>
<connor> - What's a UMA? </connor>
<connor> - Like those like
unidentified, what is it? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> Like the chupacabra. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like that level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like urban legend shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Chupacabra? </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - What the fuck's a UMA? </joey>
<joey> (Ashley speaking) </joey>
<joey> Something animal. </joey>
<connor> - This is the first time I've ever- </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Unidentified mysterious animal. </joey>
<connor> - Unidentified mysterious animal, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - This is the first time.
- Like UFO. </joey>
<connor> - This is the first
fucking thing I've ever- </connor>
<joey> - You know, like Mothman
or like chupacabra, </joey>
<garnt> like any of those urban legends. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't know they were called UMAs. </garnt>
<garnt> - UMAs, unidentified mysterious animal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you believe any of those? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Although when I was 10,
I did believe chupacabra. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think anyone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you believe in chupacabra? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you're 10 years old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> You believe Harry Potter is
real when you're 10 years old. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't that like Mexican or something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was Mexican or Spanish. </connor>
<connor> I mean, chupacabra means
goat drinker or some shit, </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, what is the chupacabra? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I killed it in Red Days, I killed it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I killed it in Red Days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was this like viral video
in like early 2000s, I think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Where like there was this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it was Mexico or Spain or somewhere, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was some Spanish speaking country, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where like just some dudes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> went into a forest at night
'cause they heard some shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then there was this like creature </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that appeared on camera. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - It was like the goat person, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah, it was like eating a goat </garnt>
<garnt> or it looked like a demonic goat. </garnt>
<garnt> And like I remember like back then, </garnt>
<garnt> like it was a huge sensation,
especially in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a massive sensation
because for an early </garnt>
<garnt> 2000s video, it was like
way too high quality. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it looked way too real. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you look at the
chupacabra videos now, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, oh,
that could almost like, </garnt>
<joey> if you weren't aware of it, </joey>
<joey> that could almost come off as convincing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- 'Cause it was like too good. </joey>
<joey> And then people were like
shocked when they found out </joey>
<joey> it was fake and it's like,
oh, who would've thought </joey>
<joey> there isn't a fucking
goat drinker demon thing </joey>
<joey> in the forest of Mexico, or
whatever the fuck it was. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think like the only
thing that I believed as a kid </garnt>
<joey> or I wanted to believe, </joey>
<joey> I really wanted to believe
like the Lochness Monster. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, 'cause a kid, </connor>
<connor> you just obsessed with
dinosaurs and you're like- </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - You like stories.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - You like thinking cool
shit exists out there </joey>
<connor> But it doesn't. </connor>
<joey> - It's like everyone, you know, </joey>
<joey> everyone wanted to believe
Moby Dick was a real thing. </joey>
<connor> - Like Bigfoot, like a lot of people, </connor>
<connor> weirdly a lot of people really- </connor>
<joey> - That fucking image of
Bigfoot, like doing this. </joey>
<garnt> - People like really believe
Bigfoot for some reason. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like it also like makes me think, </garnt>
<garnt> what if one of those
things was real, right? </garnt>
<garnt> What would make you actually
believe it, right? Because- </garnt>
<joey> - Seeing it. </joey>
<joey> - If I, yeah, if I see it, like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> If I see like a news
article of like scientists </connor>
<connor> like properly talking about it. </connor>
<joey> - Having someone credible
be like, yep, this is legit. </joey>
<garnt> - Because like I remember, because I think </garnt>
<garnt> we have talked about this
before, but like, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> it's been proven by the
government that UFOs exist. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- And like nobody </connor>
<connor> freaked out over it. </connor>
<connor> Nobody really reacted to it. </connor>
<connor> - Besides Alex Jones. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> Well, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean like, yeah, last year with the, </connor>
<connor> what was it the black files? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- But, yeah, like it's like, </connor>
<connor> if I said to you, "Oh, </connor>
<connor> by the way we found an alien spaceship, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> we know it's an alien, by the
way." You'd be freaking out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're like, "Oh,
we have no fucking clue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what that thing was." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] It could've been like a drone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone like doesn't,
'cause you're like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I'm sure there's
an explanation for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> by the way we literally found
the things from Men in Black, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> then I think everyone's
gonna be like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean like, 'cause
I mean it's weird, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you do look at the videos. </garnt>
<garnt> I do look at the videos of the UFO images </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> and the UFO videos and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's freaky and I do think UFOs exist, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but do I think it's aliens? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno myself. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> I dunno how to react to it, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, go on. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I was gonna say like </garnt>
<joey> there was a weird part
of me that saw those </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> like government file, you know, videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which are like, you know, legit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause why would a
organization like that lie? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's like, I saw it and
I was like, why does that look </joey>
<joey> like just every other
UFO video I've ever seen? </joey>
<garnt> - I think that's the
problem with it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because there's so many fakes nowadays </garnt>
<garnt> that even when the real
thing is actually released, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> you're so desensitized with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the fake ones
looked more real than this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Right, right.
- Like why is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - It's just I thought
seeing UFOs, real UFOs, </joey>
<joey> would be more impressive.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I dunno why I thought that, </garnt>
<garnt> but I just thought it
would be more impressive. </garnt>
<garnt> And it didn't just wasn't, you know. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I assume that if
an alien species finds us, </connor>
<connor> we'll probably be dead. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Why? They'll just wipe us out? </joey>
<connor> - Odds are, think of it. </connor>
<joey> If an alien spaceship, </joey>
<connor> if an alien civilization
had the opportunity to, </connor>
<joey> or had the capability
of finding other planets </joey>
<joey> and going around scouting. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Mm.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're more technologically
advanced than us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- We're pretty fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Odds are they're not gonna
wanna be like, hey, friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're gonna be like,
let's take all your stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have minerals. We need them. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Collect the minerals. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You require more minerals. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - Like fucking StarCraft. </connor>
<connor> They're just gonna use us
for another (indistinct). </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would they give a shit?
They're not gonna give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they'll treat us like cows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - I mean, it's like, it's kind of, </connor>
<connor> I agree with you because I think, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> what if humanity had this capability? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We would fuck over everyone.
- Yeah. We would, we would. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We would fuck everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - Yeah, we fuck ourselves over enough. </garnt>
<garnt> Like let alone another species. </garnt>
<joey> - We can't even save
our own fucking planet, </joey>
<garnt> let alone some other
species planet, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Anyone who thinks that like, </connor>
<connor> we wouldn't just blow up a planet, </connor>
<garnt> if we just thought they were
a little strange looking, </garnt>
<garnt> they just like that doesn't
have enough understanding </garnt>
<garnt> of human (cross-talking). </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially if they have
like natural resources </garnt>
<garnt> or some shit.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sure a lot of people would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think we should do this, </garnt>
<garnt> but the government of whatever, </garnt>
<joey> the United government of all, whatever, </joey>
<joey> would be like bye bye, bye bye planet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Bye bye, bye bye. </joey>
<joey> - We'll just find another one. </joey>
<connor> - But they are rich in
iron, we must destroy. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly. Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Which, speaking of destroying planets </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> and living through the
apocalypse, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> we kind of- </garnt>
<joey> - What a fantastic segue. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. What a fantastic segue. </garnt>
<garnt> We kind of lived through
something like that yesterday. </garnt>
<joey> Didn't we?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> That was terrifying. We
had a very big earthquake. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like what you referring to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I knew immediately
what he was on about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you had a very
different experience to us. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Same brain cell.
- Yeah, we have </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> the same brain cell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, we had two big
earthquakes actually </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> yesterday back-to-back. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure the world news has covered it. </joey>
<joey> It's probably old news by the
time you're watching this. </joey>
<joey> But- </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it was the biggest earthquake </garnt>
<joey> I have lived through so far. </joey>
<joey> I think. </joey>
<joey> It was bigger than the one in LA </joey>
<garnt> or at least it felt like it
was bigger than the one in LA. </garnt>
<joey> - I think Tokyo was like mag 4 or 5. </joey>
<garnt> - 4, 4.5, I think. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> But I think it was like magnitude 7.3. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- The epicenter. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and Fukushima. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I'd experienced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like big earthquakes in Japan before. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> And this one, like even for
people who have lived here, </joey>
<joey> lived in Japan for longer than me </joey>
<joey> said that this was the biggest one </joey>
<joey> that they've experienced as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, it's a lot of people said, </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the biggest one
that they've experienced </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> since the 2011 earthquake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In Fukushima as well, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Because I think it was
because it wasn't just one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was like one that
was pretty big already. </joey>
<joey> That caused another even bigger one </joey>
<joey> like literally two minutes later. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, it just felt like one
continuously large earthquake. </joey>
<joey> - Well, how was it for you guys? </joey>
<connor> - Am I weird? I like earthquakes. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] You like earthquakes? </joey>
<joey> - I quite like it. Is that bad? </joey>
<joey> - Like in what sense? </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like a fun, quick
time event or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause, I dunno why, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it feels kind of fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> Is this weird? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's a bit.
- I know this is weird. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I dunno. </connor>
<connor> - And it is technically
a natural disaster. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I know. </connor>
<garnt> I know, I know. </garnt>
<connor> Because it's like it causes
so many problems, but like- </connor>
<joey> - That's like watching a bush fire </joey>
<joey> and being like, "Sick!" </joey>
<joey> - You know like I get it. </joey>
<garnt> I get it. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you don't say
that about like typhoons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the guy who gave
us shit for looking at fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like so a canister and here he is </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> being like looking at an earthquake. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like, wee! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a disaster on like
10 times the magnitude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No more, like thousands of times </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> the magnitude of an exploding can. </joey>
<garnt> And he's just like, "Ooh,
a quick time in bed." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just, I dunno. </garnt>
<joey> - The bayonet of music starts playing. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - I obviously protect whatever
is valuable in my house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also it's kinda of interesting seeing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> what stays and what falls over. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I quite enjoy that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> I understand- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - Taking bets, being like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - I kinda, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Well, I was out and I was
kind of like hyped to think </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> like when I came back I was like, ooh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder what fell over? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like nothing had fell over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you were disappointed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Obviously if like my TV had fell over, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, fuck, that's shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know when it's mild ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> like obviously 'cause
it was a big earthquake, </joey>
<joey> but it wasn't that big in Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I like those ones, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously if it was like 8, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that'd be like, I'd be
another thing entirely. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Well, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I do not like this one. I
do not like this earthquake. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like one thing
I do not understand </garnt>
<joey> after having lived in
Japan and experienced </joey>
<joey> a bunch of earthquakes now is, </joey>
<connor> when do they send out
the earthquake alarm? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I do not get it. </connor>
<joey> - Like I swear to God- </joey>
<joey> - It's when the epicenter is close enough. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> - Did you get one? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No.
- [Garnt] No. </joey>
<connor> - I have never gotten one
since I got my new phone. </connor>
<joey> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I've definitely gotten a bunch, </connor>
<connor> but it's only when the
epicenter is close enough </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> to where you live, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it sets it off? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it was in Fukushima and Miyagi, </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> it was like too far away. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - But the earthquake was
big enough to the fact </joey>
<joey> that we felt it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. Because I hear the earthquake alarm </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> and I brace myself and it's
like the piddliest, piddliest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like little earthquake I've ever felt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like out of nowhere, like yesterday, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get like the entire
fucking house starts shaking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, why didn't I
get an alarm for this? </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> I feel like this is like more
prevalent for like the alarm </garnt>
<garnt> that I should be bracing myself for. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I do. Have you watched
that YouTube video </connor>
<joey> that's like noises that
will give you anxiety </joey>
<joey> if you live in Japan or something. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like all the disaster noises. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Have you heard the tsunami one? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. The tsunami one was terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - It's horrible, it's like the, </joey>
<connor> what's the tower in Pokemon called? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, the fucking Pokemon Tower. </joey>
<connor> - Like that, no, the one with the dead- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Pokemon Towers. </joey>
<joey> - It's just Pokemon Towers? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, no, Lavender Tower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lavender Tower.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like that level of
creepy, the tsunami one. </SPEAKER_07>

<garnt> (man speaking in foreign language) </garnt>
<connor> (bells chiming) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's it. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking hate that. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> It's horrible.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - That one's horrible, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] That one. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor singing) </joey>
<joey> It sounds like when you get
an item in an (indistinct). </joey>
<garnt> - It sounds like I just opened
a box in Zelda or something. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey singing)
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> (Connor singing) </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's creepy because like- </connor>
<joey> - It's slightly dissonant. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it feels like you're in a
room that is like collapsing. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like it's designed to do that
and it's like, you're dying. </joey>
<connor> - It's like you're in a game </connor>
<garnt> and you just like triggered a bad event. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I know the feeling. </garnt>
<joey> Have you ever heard
like those music remixes </joey>
<joey> where they take a happy
song and they remix </joey>
<garnt> it in like a minor key? </garnt>
<garnt> That's exactly what it sounds like. </garnt>
<joey> - You talking about like
"Wrecking Ball" in G minor. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> Joey gets what I mean.
Joey gets the music memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Music memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like Joey gets the music memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, something in G minor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, that feels dirty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I don't like that feeling.
- Yeah, yeah. It's demonic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> The one that always
gives me fucking anxiety </joey>
<joey> is the earthquake alarms.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Joey mimicking earthquake alarm) </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that one feels dangerous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The tsunami one is creepy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it doesn't feel like it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> this is like a world ending event. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> It just sounds like a minor discomfort. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the malls
closing. Dring, dring. </joey>
<joey> Dring, dring. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Get out of the mall now. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, like for the
earthquake yesterday for me, </garnt>
<garnt> so it was actually big enough
that it knocked out the power </garnt>
<garnt> in my section of Tokyo. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you just dox yourself, Garnt? </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Sorry?
- Did you just dox yourself? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, it was like the
path of power got outed </garnt>
<garnt> in a bunch of facilities in Tokyo. </garnt>
<joey> - I think the news said it
was like 2 million homes </joey>
<joey> were out of power.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't even know if mine, </connor>
<connor> I might've lost power, </connor>
<garnt> but I was out so. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you definitely would've
known if you lost power. </garnt>
<joey> - I wasn't there, you see?
- Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> You weren't at home. Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - I could've gone out. </joey>
<connor> - Mine was fine. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I mean, like, I actually
didn't even feel the first one. </joey>
<joey> I dunno, like sometimes
people were just like, "Oh, </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> there was an earthquake." And
I'm like, "I didn't feel it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was there really an earthquake? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or did you just stand up too fast? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just got a head rush." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, 'cause that happens
to me sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I think it's an
earthquake happening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's really just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just me tripping balls. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I just feel like a little lightheaded. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you watching
something in Dolby Atmos? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> I genuinely think there's
always an earthquake happening </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> when I'm watching Dolby Atmos. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Well, like the THX starts.
It's like (trilling). </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, like, the floor
shakes with the Dolby, </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> I'm always like, "Oh shit, are we?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I was actually in
my office on the bottom, </garnt>
<garnt> on the ground floor. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I live in a house </garnt>
<garnt> and Sydney was chilling on the bed </garnt>
<garnt> on the third floor of our house. </garnt>
<joey> And I just hear Sydney
going, "Garnt, Garnt, Garnt!" </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, I didn't know </joey>
<joey> it was an earthquake going on. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I was just like
taking my time with her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me finish this piece of work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'll just like
casually stroll upstairs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I see Sydney, like
just looking shell-shocked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause Sydney's like really
sensitive to like earthquakes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like natural disaster kind of thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, she's just like, (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> "Did you feel that, did you feel that?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "What? </joey>
<joey> What's going on, Sydney?" </joey>
<joey> "That was an earthquake,
Garnt. That was an earthquake." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Was there? </joey>
<joey> Are you sure, Sydney? Are you sure?" </joey>
<joey> And like 'cause I didn't feel it at all. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. Yeah, yeah.
- I didn't feel that at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so I, you know, I was
like about to check my phone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to see if, you know, anyone
else had posted about it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then just as I got out my phone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it like the second quake
hit, the second quake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The bigger one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The bigger one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like, you know, this one, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it didn't like immediately
start off strong for me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It like shook a little bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It shook a little bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so it started shaking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Oh, that's an earthquake." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And Sydney was like, "Huh? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, you feel it now, you son of a bitch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You feel it now? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You feel it fucking now?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then as she finished that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> our lights just like turn off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And there was just
an immediate 180 from, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh, (heavy breathing)
no, no, no, come here, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> come here, please. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> Come here, come here." </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where are you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - All it took was the lights going out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But yeah, I mean like it was
actually like pretty surreal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for me because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was the first time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, in Thailand we're like, fuck, </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> I'm fucking used to power outages. </joey>
<joey> We have like plenty of lights
and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> In here, it was just so surreal </joey>
<joey> seeing just my entire block,
basically, my entire town, </joey>
<joey> just like in complete darkness. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I think I posted </joey>
<joey> a video of me just like walking around </joey>
<garnt> outside my house. </garnt>
<joey> I have never seen my street
almost in complete darkness. </joey>
<joey> This is freaky as hell. </joey>
<garnt> Which, because it was the first time </garnt>
<joey> I'd just seen any side of Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> just completely dark with
some emergency lights on. </joey>
<joey> It was like, it was
kind of surreal, right? </joey>
<joey> - Like apocalyptic. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, kind of apocalyptic, right? </joey>
<joey> So like, 'cause I thought, </joey>
<joey> why not just take a walk just to see, </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> just to see what the city is like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Take it in.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just to see what the city is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we're going through
a disaster like this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- And I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the first time it hit me of
just how surreal this was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was I walk out and, you
know, Tokyo was dark, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but the point it actually
hit me was when I walked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to my main road and I
could see the Lawsons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had its lights out, and
I'm just like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even the combini is affected. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That never happens. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is the first time I've ever seen </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> the fucking combini just out. </joey>
<joey> And like the employees are
in there just like fucking, </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> they couldn't even open the
door because like the power </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like the automatic door wasn't open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, this is real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno why it was the combini </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> just 'cause like I thought no matter what, </garnt>
<garnt> like a comet could be
crashing and like Lawsons </garnt>
<joey> would still be like serving. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Because like even when Japan
has like the worst typhoon </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the past 10 years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I think it did like
last year or the year before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - The only thing that
was open, the Lawson. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - The combini's, right? </joey>
<joey> - The combini's are all open. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Through thick and thin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yep.
- So, that was the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that was the first
time it was surreal for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was also surreal
just seeing which parts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the grid were still supported. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Mm. </joey>
<joey> - So, actually like, 'cause
I had to walk around. </joey>
<joey> So, like it was some
traffic lights were working </joey>
<joey> and some weren't. </joey>
<joey> So, that was weird. </joey>
<joey> - Wow, traffic lights weren't working? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Some of the traffic
lights weren't working, right? </joey>
<joey> But I think they must have prioritized </joey>
<joey> the more busier intersections, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> Because all like the big
intersections were working, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but some of the smaller ones- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, all right.
- Weren't working. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - Oh, I always thought that
the road lights and stuff </connor>
<joey> are on a separate thing
entirely from the normal- </joey>
<joey> - Well, they might have
like a backup system. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. They normally do. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause obviously the last
thing you want is no- </connor>
<garnt> - No traffic lights. </garnt>
<connor> - No traffic lights. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and there was
actually a traffic accident </garnt>
<connor> like near where- </connor>
<connor> - That's not surprising at all. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Near where I was, </connor>
<connor> I think might have been because of that. </connor>
<connor> But like the only thing
that was actually lit </connor>
<garnt> was the train stations actually. </garnt>
<garnt> The train stations had everything working. </garnt>
<garnt> The elevators were still
working and everything, </garnt>
<garnt> even though everything
else was like pitch black. </garnt>
<connor> - It wasn't the only
thing that was like on. </connor>
<connor> I was having a great time in Akihabara. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was having a whale of a
time. I was in the basement. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- In some anime song bar, </joey>
<joey> went in there and there's
a bunch of Japanese men </joey>
<joey> singing Macros songs.
- Nice. </joey>
<joey> - With a bunch of very
young looking girls. </joey>
<joey> - Oh.
- Okay. </joey>
<connor> - So, we went in there and we
were just having a good time. </connor>
<connor> I sang- </connor>
<garnt> - You were like, "Man, I'm
fucking lighting this place </garnt>
<garnt> on fire, man." (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I was singing, "Colors." </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor sings and laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone clapped. (clapping) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Must have thought like the base </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> of your voice was just like so strong </garnt>
<connor> that it was shaking the entire building. </connor>
<connor> - I did "JoJo" as well.
So, I- (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I bet everyone
in the bar was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> "Oh, they got Dolby Atmos here." </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Holy shit. </connor>
<connor> - It was so funny. </connor>
<connor> When it came, </connor>
<garnt> I was with the guys that I
did the wrestling video with. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "Oh, there was
an earthquake just now." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Ah, I didn't know." </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Then 10 seconds later, </joey>
<joey> the second one that was bigger, </joey>
<joey> started like shaking. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were all like, "Yeah, whoa." </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause everyone was drunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jo! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - JoJo! </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then, yeah, but we were in
the basement, it was shaking. </connor>
<connor> But it wasn't like that bad. </connor>
<connor> So, like that's why,
initially, I was quite shocked </connor>
<joey> when I was getting
texts, a bunch of texts, </joey>
<joey> people being like, sorry that scared me. </joey>
<joey> I was like ghost, ghost. </joey>
<joey> - Earthquake, earthquake. </joey>
<joey> - That's why I was quite shocked </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> when I was getting so many texts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and people being like,
"Oh my God, are you okay? </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> Are you okay?" What, what, what? </joey>
<joey> - Well, weirdly enough you don't feel it </joey>
<joey> when you're underground. </joey>
<joey> You feel it when you're really up higher. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - And you feel it more at least. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. You feel it way
more when you're up high. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was all right. It was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you get a lot of people
who don't live in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who don't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who aren't used to
earthquakes messaging you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, of course.
- Oh my gosh. Are you okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - After the round of like
people living in Japan tweets </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> that I saw, I started to get
like 17 messages from people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all over the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause once it hit the mainstream, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> you know, international news. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, 'cause it's like, I get it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like how could you
know the severity of it? </connor>
<connor> But I think if I'm tweeting
about it, it's probably- </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - It probably means I'm okay.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everybody's, oh, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean like I think it's worse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> for like someone like Chris, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause he was living right next to it. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> Like I can't imagine how strong
the earthquake was for him. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it hit really hard with him. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've never been in an earthquake </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> where a lot of stuff has
literally like just like gone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on the floor and started smashing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- 'Cause I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno why, I'm oddly
calm during an earthquake. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> And I remember like- </connor>
<connor> - I like it. You see
what I mean? It's good. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Woo! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't say I like it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like, I remember like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I remember seeing
Arkie's video of, that she took, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I related to Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, of course, of course, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me and Joey sharing the same brain cell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember relating to
Joey so hard just seeing Arkie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like freaking out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to the bed and Joey just sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a stone-cold face on the couch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just like experiencing
the world ending around him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And Joey's just, this is fine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was literally just the "this is fine" </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> face look, you know? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Arkie] Joey? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (building rattling) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (object thudding) </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> (mechanical pulsing) </joey>
<joey> (Arkie sighing) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] There was two earthquakes. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Arkie] Was it a level six just hit? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Yeah, that was a level six. </joey>
<joey> - [Arkie] Fukushima. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one that got meme'd a lot online </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like afterwards, it started
to like really shake, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so Arkie ran to the
other side of the house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> like to the bed because like
we always go to the bedroom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's nothing in our
bedroom other than our bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So, there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't have any worry about
things like falling on us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, we go to the bed,
she's like calling out to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, why the fuck
you calling out to me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're the one that left me behind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She like bolts, bolts into the bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, "Joey, where are you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You left me in the living room." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so there's just this footage of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like casually
strolling in with my hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my hip being like,
"Oh, two earthquakes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, fucking sick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, and people are like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> just Joey, just like as a chat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like walking in, like dad pose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like hand on his hip. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> Just like, I think someone said like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> "Why does he look like a dad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's like waiting for
like an argument to finish?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> But to be fair in my
defense, I was surprised </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I looked way calmer in that video </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than I actually was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I think in those
kinds of situations, like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which earthquake was this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one that happened yesterday. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, you had a video?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Arkie filmed it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, Arkie filmed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, yeah, I think I was surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was like, oh, I looked way calmer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than I actually was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause inside I was like, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like really long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Also I was worried about my grandma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause she lives up north. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- So, I was like trying </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> to text her and stuff. </joey>
<joey> But outta context, </joey>
<joey> it just looks like me just
fucking standing there, </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> just like waiting for
this earthquake to end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - End already. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - End already, fark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really want to go
on one of those like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I know they had it in
like "Takeshi's Castle." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They had the challenge
where you had to like sit </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> in like the Japanese tatami room. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- It's on one </joey>
<joey> of those earthquake simulation things. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they have to like try
and sit on the platform without </joey>
<joey> falling over while it's like magnitude 9. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I really wanna go in one of those. </joey>
<joey> - I've been on one of those. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, dude. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- That sounds fun. </joey>
<joey> That sounds fun.
- Yeah, Arkie did a video </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> at like the like emergency
center type of thing in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like where you get to
experience like a house fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like an earthquake
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> And they have one of those things. </joey>
<joey> And I tried it on magnitude 9, </joey>
<joey> which is the same as the 2011 earthquake. </joey>
<joey> Dude, it's crazy. Like- </joey>
<connor> - Right, what does it feel like? </connor>
<connor> - It just feels like four guys </connor>
<joey> are just surrounding
you and just doing this. </joey>
<joey> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like you can't even, </joey>
<joey> like I was sitting down like legs crossed, </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> I was sitting down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like after the first shake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I was like lying flat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Holy shit.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You cannot even like lie down straight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's so fucking intense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so it really like
went to (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, when you
hear magnitude 9, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> You're like, oh fuck,
that seems really big. </connor>
<joey> But I think like actually
experiencing magnitude 9 </joey>
<joey> is another lever. </joey>
<connor> - Isn't it exponential? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think they just like </garnt>
<garnt> whoever designed the Richter scale </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> really like fucked up by
making it a logarithmic scale. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause it's not like
it's not linear, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> So it's like by- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's logarith- </garnt>
<garnt> Do you mean exponential? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's the same thing. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I think
logarithmic is exponential. </joey>
<joey> - It's the inverse of exponential. </joey>
<joey> - Is it?
- So, logarithmic means </joey>
<joey> that it goes like this
and then exponential </joey>
<garnt> means it goes like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. I might be wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> It might be- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just- </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanted to say logarithmic. </garnt>
<garnt> - One of them's like this, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Make myself sound smart. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt, logarithmic, exponential. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna Google this
right now. Which one is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Logarithmic means that
it peak like the gains </garnt>
<connor> that you see are initial and
then it starts flattening out. </connor>
<connor> Where as exponential's the opposite. </connor>
<connor> (Ashley speaking) </connor>
<connor> Oh, it is logarithmic? </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you were trying
to explain exponential. </garnt>
<garnt> - I smart. I smart. </garnt>
<garnt> - You said the right word, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> but you were saying the wrong thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - No. What I'm saying is it- </garnt>
<garnt> - We're professionals. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like exponential is kind
of also logarithmic kind of. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the inverse of logarithmic. </connor>
<connor> - Is it? I don't know
about that. I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know because like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the opposite. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, man. (chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - Either way it's- </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - It's not linear. </joey>
<garnt> - It's not linear. It's in a scale. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. Yes, Ashley? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Logarithmic functions </garnt>
<garnt> are the inverses of exponential functions. </garnt>
<joey> - So, how is- </joey>
<joey> - So, Richter scale is logarithmic? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Richter scale is logarithmic. </joey>
<connor> - So, that means that it would, </connor>
<connor> after like four or five, </connor>
<connor> the difference isn't much. </connor>
<joey> - That can't be right?
- No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] It goes up this way. </joey>
<joey> Exponential goes up this way. </joey>
<connor> - No.
- [Garnt] No, no, no. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Hence the word exponential. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> It goes exponentially higher. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - This kind of just- </garnt>
<garnt> - What! </garnt>
<garnt> - This kind of just proves my point. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A bunch of wrong things. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> I think I'm right. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> The original point I was trying to make </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> was that they put it in a scale </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> that is not comprehendible
by the normal human person, </joey>
<joey> which we are literally proving right now. </joey>
<joey> You know, like, you hear like an 8 or 9 </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> on the Richter scale and you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, that's just one up from a 7. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've seen people survive 7s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like your mind can't
comprehend the effects, </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> like the the tangible effects </joey>
<joey> of just how much larger that is, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that's why I think they fucked up. </joey>
<joey> Because if you hear like, oh, </joey>
<joey> it was on a scale of like a thousand </joey>
<joey> on like this earthquake scale. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> You're like, that's a big number compared </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to a hundred, which is what
we're technically talking about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we're talking,
going up from magnitude 7 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to a magnitude 8, right?
- Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I think like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno why we went
with a logarithmic scale </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> for like disasters when the
normal person can't comprehend </garnt>
<garnt> that amount of difference with
just one number, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - True, true. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, Garnt
can't even comprehend </connor>
<connor> what logarithmic and an exponential are, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> so how's he gonna comprehend the scale? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think any one of us can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can, I know what it
is. I've just explained. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Ashley] Yeah, you're right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. (laughing) I know I'm right. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> This is insane. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the Richter scale
is a logarithmic scale? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that logarithmic? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Yeah, so that means that there
wouldn't be much difference </connor>
<joey> between 8 and 9. </joey>
<joey> - But there is. </joey>
<connor> - Well, the scale says
that there isn't, Joey. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh, fuck sake. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that right? </garnt>
<garnt> There's not much of a
difference between 8 and 9? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Logarithmic. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - But how we experience those numbers </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> are all different though. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> So, it's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't wait for the comments </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> to just tear this conversation apart. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hi, mathematician here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hi, mathematician here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally had an aneurysm. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - I invented the Richter scale. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm having an aneurysm. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Technically,
it's supposed to indicate </joey>
<connor> an intensity 10 times the previous number. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what- </joey>
<garnt> - [Ashley] But it's also
described as a logarithmic scale. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> They both seem- </joey>
<connor> - What does that mean? </connor>
<garnt> - I thought like- </garnt>
<connor> - Let me show you a picture
of a logarithmic fucking line. </connor>
<joey> - I know what a logarithmic line is, </joey>
<joey> but it doesn't make sense
because I've learned </joey>
<joey> that the Richter scale
is the higher the number, </joey>
<joey> the bigger the difference in scale. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] 10 times the difference. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I thought it was </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 times the previous number. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - No, 'cause what, I
mean, I guess it could be, </connor>
<connor> but also 'cause it goes like this, right? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So, let's say this was like, if it was 8 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like at the peak or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> It's not gonna get much better at 9. </joey>
<joey> So, increased more so. </joey>
<joey> - Well, then what? Oh
my God. I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - So, that's- </garnt>
<garnt> I am confusion. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - But also a logarithmic
scale also depends </connor>
<connor> on the function you put into it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. That's what I thought. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the logarithmic
scale doesn't necessarily </garnt>
<joey> have to look like that. </joey>
<joey> It's just a scale- </joey>
<joey> - It's a scale that's not linear. </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<garnt> It's not just a non-linear scale. </garnt>
<garnt> It's, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah. </garnt>
<joey> So, that is a logarithmic- </joey>
<joey> - That is a logarithmic. </joey>
<joey> - And that is also what I understand </joey>
<garnt> to be exponential as well. </garnt>
<joey> That's what I thought. </joey>
<joey> - It's an exponential logarithmic scale. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I thought at least. </joey>
<connor> - It's an exponential logarithmic. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, 'cause it keeps going up. Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So- </connor>
<connor> - Either way- </connor>
<garnt> - Either way, my original
point wasn't the fact </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> that exponentials are
the same as logarithmic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That wasn't what I was trying to explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was trying to explain that this shit- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, either way, I'm right. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Either way, I was trying to explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that this shit is too confusing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the normal person to comprehend. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Which maybe </joey>
<joey> we aren't normal. </joey>
<joey> We aren't the normal person. </joey>
<joey> Maybe we're just dumber
than a normal person. </joey>
<joey> - Speak for yourself. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe we're just dumber
than a normal person. </garnt>
<joey> - Bottom line, you could say
that the earthquake yesterday </joey>
<joey> was magnitude 7.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But if you've never
been in an earthquake </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> of that magnitude, you're
not going to fucking know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what that feels like, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like you guys have never
been in a magnitude 7. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> Yesterday was a magnitude
like 4 max in Tokyo. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. And like that's fun zone for me. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I think 6 sounds scary. </garnt>
<connor> - 6. </connor>
<garnt> I wonder how big the one in
LA was that we experienced? </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna say that was
probably around the same. </joey>
<garnt> Like maybe like a magnitude 4. </garnt>
<garnt> - It wasn't that bad. </garnt>
<joey> - It felt around the same.
- Well, it depends </joey>
<joey> like where we were wasn't
it didn't feel that bad. </joey>
<joey> But I can't imagine what it
is Like even if it goes like, </joey>
<garnt> if it's like 10 times
more powerful than that. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean I've been in a 6,
is the biggest one I've been. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know, America has the
most volcanoes in the world? </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does it? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Not active, but total volcanoes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Whereabouts? Just Hawaii? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - The whole thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Well, I think Hawaii has
a lot of active ones. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - But in general, America's a lot- </joey>
<joey> - More than Japan? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. More volcanoes than Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Wow. I thought Japan had the most. </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe Japan has the most active ones? </joey>
<connor> - No, that's Indonesia. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I think that is Indonesia. </joey>
<joey> - Japan can't be number
one for everything. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, America also has
like a massive land mass. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - So, I'm not like surprised about that. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - America has the most volcanoes
that like aren't active, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like they like don't do anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Ashley] Yellowstone </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, then they have like Yellowstone, </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like a ticking time
bomb for extinction, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it kind of is, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If Yellowstone ever explodes,
then humanity fucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Yeah. Well, same with Mount Fuji, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think as well,
is if any volcanoes erupt </joey>
<joey> in the Antarctic, I think, </joey>
<joey> there's some volcanoes underneath the ice. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if they explode- </joey>
<joey> - Then Antarctica's just gone. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, that would be the world's gone. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> That water's gotta go somewhere, Joey. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It doesn't just like go out into space? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it doesn't unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - [Joey] Turns into rain? </garnt>
<garnt> - Gravity's really good
at keeping that shit in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, which like, 'cause
yesterday made me wonder, </garnt>
<connor> like it made me appreciate
just how prepared are you </connor>
<connor> for a disaster, right? Because- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Visos music.
- Huh? </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Visos music.
- Visos music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, because we're in the
penultimate episode of Earth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You think? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like penultimate
episode kind of vibes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, well, hold on. Wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We got a war going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got global warming with the pandemic, </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> the Earth's shaking,
trying to rip itself apart. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're in the- </garnt>
<connor> - The Mayans were off by a few years. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, when you have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's like the disaster movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have the beginning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the act one, where you
have all of the indicators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that the world is ending, but
nobody pays attention to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I believe like 2020 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has like literally been
that indicator IRL. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Quick take a shot of the
seismograph, going crazy. </connor>
<connor> Get that on film. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like I remember
like when the lights went out </garnt>
<connor> and I was walking
around, I was like, okay, </connor>
<connor> if this was like- </connor>
<connor> - That's the title of the movie,
"When the Lights Went Out." </connor>
<connor> - "When the Lights Went out." </connor>
<garnt> When we lost power, I was just like, </garnt>
<joey> it made me think, what if
this was like actually just, </joey>
<joey> you know, a super,
super serious earthquake </joey>
<joey> and like the power would be out for a time </joey>
<joey> when I didn't know when
they would be back on. </joey>
<joey> - Well, you'd be fine </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you have a Gigan
shaft fucking battery. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor singing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is just like, I kinda realized </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how much foreshadowing of, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna call it foreshadowing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because it's basically a
Chekhov's gun at this point, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of items I've collected
thanks to Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that would help me
through a disaster, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> So, the first thing I realized is </joey>
<joey> our house was the only house on our street </joey>
<joey> with any lights on. </joey>
<joey> And that's because I had my
fucking brick of a power bank </joey>
<joey> that I had accidentally bought
for the camping episode. </joey>
<joey> Which if you need a flashback, </joey>
<joey> here's a thumbnail of the clip </joey>
<joey> of me talking about the brick
that I bought by accident </joey>
<joey> for the camping episode. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. But it wasn't by accident. </joey>
<joey> - But it wasn't, I didn't
know, it wasn't by accident, </joey>
<joey> like the script- </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - He foresaw what was gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The script writers for Trash Tastes </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> is just like on another level, </joey>
<joey> Like they foreshadowed
this like two seasons ago. </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) is writing Garnt's life. </joey>
<garnt> - So, like I remember the lights
being off and me thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> fuck, I do not have any torches </garnt>
<garnt> or any sources of power. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait a minute. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I remember, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought I'd never ever
actually be able to use it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for the use that it was intended for. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And luckily I had just
charged it like a week before. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> So, like we just plugged, </joey>
<joey> we could literally just plug in our lamps </joey>
<joey> and we just lit up like our
bedroom, like it was normal. </joey>
<joey> - Plug in your entire house. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> We could charge our phones and everything. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> But like beyond that, I was
also thinking, what if like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what if this was a natural apocalypse </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we needed to survive
for, you know, a bit longer. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> And I remember, do we have
like a good supply of water </joey>
<joey> or like supplies, emergency rations </joey>
<joey> to get us through the day? </joey>
<joey> And I was like, wait a minute. </joey>
<joey> I just bought an entire, </joey>
<joey> like me and Sydney both
have an entire fridge full </joey>
<joey> of green tea that we bought
as like an aesthetic thing </joey>
<joey> for our streams, right? </joey>
<joey> So, if you've seen any of my streams </joey>
<joey> or any of my on-camera shots, </joey>
<joey> there's a mini fridge that I have. </joey>
<connor> And that's just full of
green tea that could last me </connor>
<connor> for a decent amount of time. </connor>
<connor> And beyond that, I also have a backup, </connor>
<connor> just like an entire
crate full of green tea. </connor>
<connor> So, I can like constantly refill this up. </connor>
<connor> So, unknowingly, just from
trying to make something </connor>
<connor> look aesthetic in my background, </connor>
<connor> I'm able to like just survive- </connor>
<connor> - You'll be pissing so much though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm able to survive. And not
only that, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> do we have any food to
be able to like last us? </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, Sydney's got like
10 months worth of Bokksu's </garnt>
<garnt> just lying about. </garnt>
<garnt> So, thanks to Bokksu, </garnt>
<garnt> we also have emergency rations as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<joey> - I've got like an emergency kit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So, do I. </joey>
<joey> - Got like quite a lot of water. </joey>
<joey> - Mm. </joey>
<connor> - You got quite a lot of water? </connor>
<joey> - I've got like that bottle of water </joey>
<joey> that lasts like four
years or whatever it is. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. There's like
emergency water that Japan </garnt>
<garnt> makes where it's like
water that supposedly </garnt>
<garnt> lasts like four or five years. </garnt>
<connor> - Emergency water? </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean, </connor>
<joey> it would last four or five years? </joey>
<joey> - It's like been specifically made </joey>
<connor> so that it doesn't go off. </connor>
<connor> - Water can go off? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, water can go off. </joey>
<connor> - What? I'm still gonna drink that shit. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> (Ashley speaking) </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Yeah, water can get stagnant </joey>
<connor> and collect bacteria and stuff, </connor>
<connor> but like they have like special, </connor>
<joey> like it's like akusui,
it's called in Japanese. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I've got like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like 10 liters of water or something. </connor>
<garnt> - Can bottled water go off? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - After a while, like after
like a year or something. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, you could still drink it. </connor>
<connor> - You can still drink it, but- </connor>
<joey> - You'll be fine. You'll be fine. </joey>
<joey> I've got like a bunch of food. </joey>
<connor> I got a wind up torch. </connor>
<garnt> Got some other shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, so you actually
have an emergency kit? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Where did you buy it? </garnt>
<connor> - They sell them on Amazon. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I just bought one. </connor>
<joey> - Arkie made one for a video. </joey>
<connor> - I thought if I don't use
it, I'll just whatever. </connor>
<connor> You know, I looked into, I
was like, oh, should I get one </connor>
<joey> of those solar panel
battery charging things? </joey>
<joey> Turns out they're like a lot of bullshit. </joey>
<joey> And they like barely work. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, I was like, oh,
and then someone's like, </joey>
<connor> just get wind up torch. </connor>
<connor> It's like way better. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta wind up torch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just get the fucking brick
shit-house battery pack, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Garnt did. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Yeah. But like you gotta
keep that thing fully charged. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's in my cupboard for like 12 months, </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> it might have half the charge
by the time I go to it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Half the charge </garnt>
<joey> could probably still last you
like six months. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm actually probably gonna get </joey>
<joey> like an emergency pack now. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I never really thought
about it before yesterday. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It did humble me a bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just, you know, even though just- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Even though you're
fully prepared. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Even though I am prepared in many ways. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Thanks to Trash Taste </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and Trash Taste law and just
being a content creator. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> You know, (laughs) I didn't
purposely prepare for it, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry, go on. </garnt>
<garnt> - But, yeah, I mean, I just
have a lot of things lying </garnt>
<garnt> in my house that is useful for survival. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you ever watch those videos </connor>
<joey> that are like what to
do if there's a nuke? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're like, all
right. (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You mean like the lie
down with your mouth open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you know that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hold on, tell me this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Apparently I saw a video.
I don't know how true it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but apparently it's like what
to do if a nuke explodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like not close enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it can like immediately kill you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but its like if like the shock wave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could like possibly kill you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And apparently, I don't
know if this is true, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so please take this with a grain of salt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> you have to supposedly lie
down with your like head </joey>
<joey> facing away from the blast </joey>
<joey> and you have to have your mouth open </joey>
<joey> because if your mouth is closed, </joey>
<joey> then the shock wave can
puncture your lungs. </joey>
<joey> - What?
- But if the mouth is open, </joey>
<joey> then it lets the air
escape from your mouth. </joey>
<joey> Supposedly, that's like
a trick that people </joey>
<joey> have just figured out. </joey>
<joey> Again- </joey>
<connor> - Mouth breathers rejoice. </connor>
<joey> - We were talking about- </joey>
<connor> - Mouth breathers rejoice. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were talking about
useless skills, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I know that little useless skill. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is- </garnt>
<joey> - Or it could come very useful, who knows? </joey>
<joey> - That is a piece of knowledge </joey>
<connor> you see in one life
hack on a YouTube show. </connor>
<connor> And then you immediately forget about it. </connor>
<connor> (Connor singing)
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, I wouldn't forget
that. That's very memorable. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah. I remember, and again,
I dunno how true this is. </joey>
<joey> I've never personally
experienced anything like that. </joey>
<joey> So, I haven't tested it myself. </joey>
<garnt> - So, if I see a nuke going
off, I lie down on the ground. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so say if it's
coming out from that window </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> over there, you would face that way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the fuck would you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Calculations. Oh shit. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah. And yeah, you'd like
kind of have your head down </joey>
<joey> and you'd like open your
mouth so that the shockwave </joey>
<connor> can go through your body </connor>
<connor> rather than, 'cause if it's closed, </connor>
<connor> then it gets closed off and then- </connor>
<connor> - It's still gonna hurt a lot, right? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's still gonna hurt. </connor>
<joey> But it won't kill you is the thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like if a nuke's going off, </garnt>
<joey> your life's pretty fucked anyway, right? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean if your close
enough, yeah. (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Obviously. </joey>
<connor> - I think you have like- </connor>
<joey> - I don't think anyone who
was like, oh here's the nuke- </joey>
<garnt> - Hold on, hold on, guys.
- Guys, I got it, I got it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Guys, open your mouths, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Trust me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the next Indiana
Jones he does like, </garnt>
<garnt> he fucks the fridge and
he just turns around </garnt>
<garnt> and with his mouth open. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - No, he's like in the fridge
and he's like, "Oh fuck." </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I forgot. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - That only works, </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> the only reason the fridge
technically worked, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Is 'cause it's a lead fridge, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't make lead fridges anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I can imagine a
bunch of people jumping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in their fridges and it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not gonna do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just put yourself in a coffin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just made it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're just gonna cook
yourself alive, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, it was like they were saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you have 15 minutes
when the nuke goes off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're not in the
immediate danger zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're 15 minutes
before like the fallout </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reaches the ground level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Mm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, you need to get
indoors within 15 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and not leave, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you still might be
dead from the radiation. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - But obviously if you
get any fallout on you, </joey>
<connor> I think you die. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Probably. </joey>
<connor> - Radiation sickness sounds horrible. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Really, really, dude, Chernobyl, man, </joey>
<connor> that HBO series was like rough. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it wasn't just that. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the one thing that
really horrified me was hearing </garnt>
<garnt> about that Japanese guy who was like, </garnt>
<joey> I think he was like the
most radioactive person </joey>
<joey> who ever lived. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think I remember seeing this. </joey>
<garnt> - I saw a documentary on it or- </garnt>
<connor> - Was it the one on the fisherman? </connor>
<connor> Is this that one? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think it was a fisherman. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - He was working for, I believe, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a nuclear power plant
or something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, for what, I don't know the full story, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but for whatever reason, during routine </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> maintenance thing, with
when he was handling </joey>
<joey> radioactive material, they made a mistake </joey>
<joey> due to like time constraints </joey>
<joey> and, you know, trying
to get this project done </joey>
<joey> faster than usual.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, they were pouring
way more radiation material </joey>
<joey> into this tank than was ever
allowed by regulations, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - And, you know, obviously
a chain reaction happened, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> something went wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And this guy who was literally standing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right next to the tank,
right next to the tank </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pouring in this radioactive material, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he got hit by the full blast of this chem- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This chemical reaction
that was happening, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, he was literally the
most radioactive person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who has ever been documented
in history, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Damn.
- And it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a fucking horrific story of like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he actually survived it initially, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He survived it initially
and they went to hospital. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he, on the first day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he looked so well that
the nurses were like ready </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> to discharge him the next day. </joey>
<joey> - Mm. </joey>
<joey> That is until they like
looked at his like DNA </joey>
<joey> and his DNA had been obliterated like- </joey>
<joey> - Jesus.
- Like fucking obliterated. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> And I don't think like
anyone at that point realized </joey>
<joey> the gravity, aside from
like the doctors, of course, </joey>
<joey> realized the gravity of
just like what was in store </joey>
<joey> for this guy. </joey>
<joey> Because like he got to the point where, </joey>
<joey> because his cells could
not make new cells, right? </joey>
<joey> So, he got to the point
where the doctors were trying </joey>
<joey> to save him because his family
and himself wanted, you know, </joey>
<joey> to try everything they could. </joey>
<joey> But I feel like it
would've been less painful </joey>
<joey> just to let him pass away. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Because like, </joey>
<joey> he got to this point where his body </joey>
<joey> just started deteriorating, </joey>
<joey> his skin would fall off </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> and would start bleeding and pussing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he like, they could do
nothing, but just bandage him up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah.
- Because there was no way </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> for like for his body to make new cells. </joey>
<joey> And he basically just
deteriorated to death </joey>
<joey> and it's like- </joey>
<joey> - Geez.
- You hear about the accounts </joey>
<joey> of this and it sounds like fucking- </joey>
<joey> - That's probably the
worst way, worst way. </joey>
<garnt> - That was like one of
the worst ways to die. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was thinking of a different story </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> of like the guy who was
like living in Hiroshima </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> during World War II. </connor>
<connor> And then when the bomb dropped, right? </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> And he survived that one.
- Yeah, I know this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he escaped with his family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> out of Hiroshima to Nagasaki </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Oh.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then the second bomb dropped. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And he survived that one as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Mm.
- I thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you were talking about that story. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Oh no, no, no. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] I think- </joey>
<joey> - He must have been pretty
radioactive after that. </joey>
<connor> - Apparently, I dunno if this is true, </connor>
<connor> but I remember hearing that there's more, </connor>
<connor> it was not just him. There's
a few other people as well, </connor>
<joey> but they reckoned that maybe a hundred </joey>
<joey> or so people had the same experience. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But they just dunno who they are. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But I mean, that is crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> Really crazy. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. </connor>
<garnt> Just like thinking about this.
- Shivers. </garnt>
<connor> - So, there's a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember his name, </connor>
<connor> he talks about a lot of
these radiation stories </connor>
<connor> and mistakes and stuff. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember his name. </connor>
<connor> He does the science videos as well. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, I can't remember his name. </connor>
<connor> They're really, really good. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - And there's some other horrible
stories about like people </connor>
<connor> doing experiments that went wrong. </connor>
<joey> - There was that other
story, I think I know </joey>
<connor> which YouTuber you're talking about. </connor>
<connor> Did he make a- </connor>
<connor> - The guy with the amazing hair? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Did he make that video on the
guy who like stuck his head </joey>
<joey> in the Hadron Collider? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. So, yeah, it was- </connor>
<joey> - And he got like shot by plasma- </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't the Hadron Collider, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was I think a similarish thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> Yeah, he got shot by an atom- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- In the head. </connor>
<joey> - And it like penetrated his
brain and he survived it. </joey>
<joey> But like, but yeah. </joey>
<connor> And then there was some like mix up </connor>
<joey> where they thought he was alive. </joey>
<connor> - He has like amazing hair. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> He's got like a lions mane.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This guy's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Not the guy who got shot. </joey>
<joey> The guy who makes the YouTube videos. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, okay 'cause I was about
to say like is this some- </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Kyle Hill. </joey>
<joey> - Is this some new kind of like therapy </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> to give you like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing hair? Just get shot by an atom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> Shot by an atom. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you experiencing hair loss? Boom! </garnt>
<connor> - You've definitely seen this thumbnail. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> It's called The Demon Core.
Have you seen this one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah. I've seen that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was a good video.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a horrible
story though as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> People fucking around with this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it goes wrong and then like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the scientists die.
- [Garnt] What's a demon core? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just like nuclear active core. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - It's always nuclear. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was, I can't
remember exactly what it was. </garnt>
<garnt> Watch the video, it's really good. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just telling about the story. </garnt>
<connor> And it's really, really strange. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you just think like, why? </connor>
<connor> Just leave it. Just don't. </connor>
<garnt> - What happened with the
guy who got shot by an atom? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think he survived. </garnt>
<joey> - He survived but then he unsurprisingly </joey>
<joey> developed these like really
weird like brain traumas. </joey>
<connor> And like he, I think he had like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] He survived.
He definitely survived. </connor>
<connor> - He survived for a while I believe. </connor>
<connor> But like he lost a lot of
his hair and then he, yeah, </connor>
<connor> he just had all these like
weird brain complications </connor>
<connor> that the doctors were like, </connor>
<connor> I dunno what the fuck to do with this. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- He's currently </connor>
<connor> 79-years-old and living. </connor>
<garnt> - 79 Years old and living? Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> What a fucking badass
title, got shot by an atom. </garnt>
<connor> - So, we know that 100%
of the time, as we know, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> when you put a head in an- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A Hadron Collider.
- You survive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We have a hundred percent survival rate. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> We know that, we know. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I'll fucking stick my head </connor>
<connor> in there like tomorrow, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Jump in the Hadron Collider real quick. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's been other cases as well, </garnt>
<connor> people will get the, what's
the thing that powers x-rays? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> I think there's like, is it something? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There was one guy, I dunno
if it was an x-ray exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it was a medical device. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And some people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> broke into an abandoned hospital
and like stole this thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And they just thought </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> it was some kind of
like cool glowing thing. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Turns out that cool glowing thing </joey>
<joey> was like radioactive like
uranium or something. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, I can even be mixing
up two stories together here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was on his channel
as well, really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - And now they're the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. </joey>
<connor> - I think like the whole, </connor>
<joey> it might be a different story actually, </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> but like the whole
village, they were like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone come check
out the glowing stones. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh no.
- No joke. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And people were all touching
it and playing with it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like a whole like family
and a few other people died </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> 'cause they were just touching
and playing with the stone. </connor>
<joey> - Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> (Joey muttering) </joey>
<connor> - Don't ever touch glowing stones, kids. </connor>
<garnt> - If it's glowing, </garnt>
<garnt> that's probably a bad sign
that a chemical reaction </garnt>
<garnt> is happening there that you
shouldn't be holding, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Curse glow sticks, curse
glow sticks for making us think </connor>
<connor> that things that glow are so cool. </connor>
<connor> God damn it. </connor>

<SPEAKER_00> - Like, eh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, do you want to
survive a zombie apocalypse? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - I don't know. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - It depends where you are, right? </joey>
<joey> Like if you're in an
area that's just like, </joey>
<joey> you're the only one remaining, </joey>
<joey> like there's just zombies fucking clawing </joey>
<joey> at your apartment or whatever. </joey>
<joey> Then it's just like, just take me. </joey>
<garnt> - At that point, I'm just like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> well, the world's fucked anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- You know, whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I mean, (sighs) I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I feel like a zombie apocalypse </connor>
<garnt> wouldn't be that hard to survive. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I'm like. </garnt>
<connor> That's my biggest like, </connor>
<garnt> unless it depends on the
type of zombie, right? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause if you're talking
about like the traditional, </joey>
<joey> really slow fucking
zombie, that fucking walks </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> like one mile an hour, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how did this become an
apocalypse in the first place? </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> How are people this incompetent </garnt>
<garnt> that this became an actual apocalypse? </garnt>
<joey> - In all those movies, </joey>
<joey> they're just like, "No, don't come near." </joey>
<garnt> While they standing still, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's like, "No." (moaning) </joey>
<garnt> - If it's "28 Days Later," all right, </garnt>
<garnt> now I get how it could become a- </garnt>
<garnt> - If we're like talking like
CoD zombies, then it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, I'm fucked. </garnt>
<connor> - But I feel like, you know
how like some of the movies </connor>
<connor> they make, they manage
to make like villages </connor>
<joey> that are like really
tall walls and no one can </joey>
<joey> get in and stuff. </joey>
<joey> I feel like that would be- </joey>
<connor> - If I've learned
anything from Dead Rising, </connor>
<joey> it's just stay at a mall. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> Hit them with a foam bed. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Combined with a chainsaw.
- Hit 'em with a bench. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Put the machine guns on the wheelchair. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And then drive the wheelchair. </connor>
<garnt> - And I feel like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like if a zombie
apocalypse ever did happen, </garnt>
<joey> that's the one place where,
you know, being in America </joey>
<joey> would be a massive fucking advantage. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you think about how
easy it is to gain access </joey>
<garnt> to weapons here in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - Until the zombies learn about those </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, "We can
use this too." (growls) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I thought you were gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you can just go like North Dakota </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> and there's no one there. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Or that, true. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Escape to Wyoming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you're in Idaho? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Zombies actually don't want to go there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> They like go to the board, and like, err. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, mm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Err. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, that's the one place </garnt>
<garnt> where if you have a gun, </garnt>
<connor> it'll be like very, very useful. </connor>
<joey> - But you're assuming
guns will stop zombies. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- That is true. That is true. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like games
have led us to believe </garnt>
<garnt> that it's like, do you
want to kill a zombie? </garnt>
<connor> Just get good at head shots. </connor>
<connor> But it's like- </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Fuck, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Realistically, will it
actually kill a zombie? </joey>
<connor> - How much ammo can you
really get a hold of? </connor>
<connor> You know, Resident Evil
got one thing right. </connor>
<connor> It'd be fucking annoying
to be like conserving </connor>
<connor> your ammo with this shit.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Actually like I would be that guy. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> I would be that guy, where you have- </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - "Oh my God, shoot it!" </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt's like, "No, I'm sorry,
man, I got four bullet left." </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I wouldn't be like, a zombie
could be right in front of me </garnt>
<garnt> and I'd be like searching
for like an ax or something. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> Be like, I don't need to shoot a zombie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't need to shoot a zombie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, maybe I'll need this ammo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like the boss
battle, whatever that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Katana collection boys are
winning, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would do anything I could, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> even if I had a gun, to not use a gun </connor>
<connor> just in case, just in case. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta go back to the safe
room to like buy more bullets. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - In a zombie apocalypse,
probably honestly the best thing </connor>
<joey> you could probably have is
just having a medieval set </joey>
<joey> of armor and weapons. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Like a sword. </joey>
<joey> - How the fuck they gonna bite you? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- If you're wearing </joey>
<joey> a full like chain mail and
you've got a big-ass long sword. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] That's true.
- I think you're good. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> I think you're good. </joey>
<joey> Those chats on YouTube, </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> the ones you're talking about,
the correct sword techniques. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're gonna be the real winners. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause that's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always like struggled
to figure out, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the video game logic of, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> just shoot 'em in the
head and it'll stop them. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, but they're dead already. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Why would they die like
a normal human being? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I don't know it. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. It depends how the zombies function. </joey>
<connor> If it's a parasite taking over the body. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we're talking about fake, I mean, </connor>
<connor> fake science now. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> You know, could be any sort
of reason or any sort way </garnt>
<garnt> to kill a zombie. </garnt>
<joey> - If you just like, you know,
if you have a fucking Katana </joey>
<joey> or something and you just like, you know, </joey>
<joey> chop their body into bits, </joey>
<joey> then they can't do anything, right? </joey>
<joey> Even if they're still alive. </joey>
<joey> - You gonna chop someone's
body into bits, Joey? </joey>
<joey> You know how long that's gonna take? </joey>
<garnt> - How long is it gonna
take one zombie, Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] You're gonna be knackered. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the zombie apocalypse, Joe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll take 'em out one
at a time, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey's gonna like sit
down and have a breather </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> when he's done like- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like hold on, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey thinks a katana
works like it does in anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where he just like does
like the fucking sword thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and like the zombie's in a hundred pieces. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> Alight. You know what? </connor>
<joey> Guns guns are good. </joey>
<connor> - Probably a flamethrower's
pretty good, right? </connor>
<joey> - Flamethrower, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Is a flamethrower an actual good weapon </garnt>
<garnt> or is it just like an aesthetic weapon? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a very good weapon. </connor>
<connor> It's a waste of money. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, if you hit someone
with it, they die, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - But what- </garnt>
<joey> - I know that, but I should- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah but wouldn't the
fuel for a flamethrower tank </garnt>
<garnt> be more scarce than bullets? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Surely there's more
effective weapons and like, </garnt>
<garnt> it looks cool and it's effective, </garnt>
<connor> but surely there's more efficient weapons, </connor>
<connor> I should say than the- </connor>
<connor> - Chainsaw. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like wildly inefficient. </garnt>
<garnt> But like if you hit
someone I think with it, </garnt>
<joey> I think they just, 'cause
like the ones that like, </joey>
<joey> I think like Elon Musk sells, for example. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- That's basically </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a hair spray with a lighter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think the original
ones in like World War II </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like, they would actually
shoot out oil on fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause you could see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the streams of liquid. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> So, they would land and hit. </garnt>
<garnt> And obviously if you get hit with that, </garnt>
<connor> that's just gonna like burn through. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, of course, </garnt>
<garnt> but like what I'm trying
to say is you, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you have two guys, </garnt>
<garnt> one person has a flamethrower,
one person has a gun. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the person with
a gun is going to win </garnt>
<garnt> kinda outta that battle, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. But you're not fighting,
you're fighting a zombie. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. That's true. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. Okay, okay. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like your goal </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> is to make it so the zombie can't move. </connor>
<connor> What a weird topic. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like your goal,
'cause you don't even know </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> if you can kill it? </connor>
<joey> What if the gun doesn't
work? What if it doesn't- </joey>
<joey> - But what if the zombie
doesn't feel the heat? </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - But what if you burn off like his legs? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you could just chop
off his legs as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Are you gonna chop off his legs? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you gonna be hacking away. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> How long is that gonna take? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey's just living like the anime dream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like using his katana now. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - I just want to Kirito okay? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I admit it. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I just wanna come out
and just fucking do this. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] If you just like- </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just duel with the swords. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you just burned
off his arms and legs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he wouldn't be able to move.
- I just wanna be Guts. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> What about like a chainsaw then? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's pretty-
- I feel that'd be more- </joey>
<connor> - Gods of Wars has
probably got that right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Also, but I wonder, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I wonder if like
bones would like clog </connor>
<garnt> a chainsaw or do anything? </garnt>
<garnt> Probably not 'cause I
think trees are stronger </garnt>
<garnt> than bones, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are they? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. I don't know actually. </garnt>
<connor> - But we don't build
houses out of bones, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's because we don't
really farm bones, do we? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> We don't have a forest full
of bones that we can farm </garnt>
<connor> and build houses out of. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - That sounds like an aesthetic, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> build a house out of bones, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That sounds fucking badass. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - [Garnt] It does. (laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like a Tim Burton movie waiting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what you can do,
right? In the zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You collect the limbs and
you just take the bones out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just make a house out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> There you go. Problem solved. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Recycling in the zombie apocalypse. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - The one thing that
zombies can't penetrate, </garnt>
<garnt> a house full of bones. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they'd be like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just one of us
with a few extra bones." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> I'm not gonna go near that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think in some countries as well </connor>
<connor> you're not allowed to fill
up a gas canister as well, </connor>
<connor> I think it's illegal. </connor>
<connor> So, you wouldn't be able
to get a stock pile of gas. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it turns into a weapon? </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, normally it is when
the government is concerned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that your population
might be making weapons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Molotov cocktails. Things like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - That makes sense.
- Yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - So- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But will they care
during a zombie apocalypse? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is the question. (sniggers) </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - No. True. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] They're not gonna be like- </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Step number one, you've
gotta get a container. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And number two, you're probably
not gonna be the first guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the gas station. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's be honest.
- [Joey] That's true, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true.
- We've seen it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when gas prices, when we hear about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gas shortages, everyone goes- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- It's already too late. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess that's the first
thing you should do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in any apocalypse, is
immediately go to the gas place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and get, I don't even have a
car, but I'm getting the gas. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. I'm getting gas. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I know I'm gonna be
king when people want gas. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, well I can give you it. </joey>
<joey> I have four tanks in the back. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's true. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like covered in
like fucking black smoot. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing)
- Yeah, 'cause I was thinking </garnt>
<garnt> because like I feel like
part of the reason why </garnt>
<garnt> it's so hard to get people
to take action over, </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno, like real life
apocalypses that could be happening </garnt>
<garnt> right now is because real life apocalypses </garnt>
<garnt> sound so fucking boring. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, oh, like, oh, the
temperature of the Earth's </garnt>
<garnt> slowly changing by a
few degrees every year. </garnt>
<garnt> And we need to do the best to Earth. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that sounds so boring
like compared to like, </garnt>
<garnt> we are being invaded by hoard of zombies </garnt>
<garnt> and only you can take them on with a- </garnt>
<connor> - Global warming is the
least sexy apocalypse. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Let's be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Chad versus like
a virgin apocalypse. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone likes the zombie thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they think that
they're gonna become the Chad </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> who games the system, becomes this king. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's all in video games, right? </connor>
<joey> Like when have you heard
of a fucking video game </joey>
<joey> where you have to fight global warming? </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe we need that.
- We need that. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - We need that in real life. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, let's be honest, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I think in a zombie apocalypse, </garnt>
<connor> you're gonna die from another person. </connor>
<connor> Not a zombie. </connor>
<joey> - The people who made Dead Rising </joey>
<joey> just need to make like Heat Rising. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Right now.
- Something like that. </joey>
<connor> - You go to prison for 20
years if you kill someone, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and people still do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> In a zombie apocalypse, there's
not gonna be any punishment. </joey>
<joey> People are gonna start killing everyone. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] That's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Everyone's gonna be like, "Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> that one guy pissed me off on the train. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go find him." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I feel, yeah, I feel
during a zombie apocalypse, </joey>
<garnt> everyone's just gonna be so on edge </garnt>
<garnt> that you're probably gonna
get killed by another human </garnt>
<joey> before you get killed by a zombie. </joey>
<garnt> - There's no way anyone
would admit to being bitten. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I thought everyone who
didn't admit to being bitten </garnt>
<joey> in a zombie movie was the asshole. </joey>
<garnt> But in reality, we've been
through a pandemic now. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just like most of the
human race at this point. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Like if you got- </connor>
<joey> - You also probably have to
kill other people as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Of course. Of course. </joey>
<connor> - If you wanna get their stuff. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Of course. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a Battle Royale now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If Fortnite has taught me anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kill them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If that old grandma has a full supply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of water and food, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Zoom was already man. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> Fortnite has trained
them just how to kill- </garnt>
<connor> - Just border up the fucking
house in two minutes. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The zombie apocalypse happens
and you just hear (knocking) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like, ssh.
(both singing) </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Dude, we're fucked,
we live in like Japan, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> the last person you ever go against </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a video game is like
16-year-old Asian kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they're just insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, we'd be killed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like challenger rank. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're like trying to
figure out what's going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they've already built a fortress. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They've been perfectly
trained by Fortnite, Minecraft </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to build the perfect fortress. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Unironically, these
kids would've somewhat </connor>
<connor> of an understanding of basic
survival 'cause of Minecraft. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. More than us, right? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. You're actually right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That's something to think about. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - They know how to
craft all the materials. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not good but it offers something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- It offers something. </garnt>
<garnt> - They at least know that coal
can be turned into charcoal. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- It's useful to know. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause we're talking about
going back to useless skills, </garnt>
<garnt> like I think I feel like I should know </garnt>
<garnt> more survival skills than I do. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, you shouldn't, you shouldn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why? Why? I mean, I've seen you- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - God. You're like, please,
please, I need to survive. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've seen you try to start
a fire with a piece of flint. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> And that didn't go well. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I feel like I need to learn </garnt>
<garnt> more survival skills than I already do. </garnt>
<connor> - Would you ever get a bunker? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> Like a bunker in your house? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a bomb bunker? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Like a shelter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That'd be cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - But, yeah, if you're
like traveling a bunch </connor>
<connor> for your work, it's useless. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah, it is. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's just cool, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't want a bunker for emergencies. </garnt>
<garnt> I would just want a bunker
because it's just cool </garnt>
<garnt> to have like a secret bunker. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you seen that guy on
YouTube who's building one? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Colin Furze. </garnt>
<connor> Like a whole bunker underneath his house. </connor>
<garnt> - Underneath his garden. </garnt>
<joey> There's actually one company in Japan </joey>
<garnt> that can build bunkers. </garnt>
<garnt> - How much is a bunker? </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, it depends on the size, </joey>
<joey> but it's like $50,000 or something. </joey>
<garnt> - Can we build a bunker? </garnt>
<garnt> - If you have like- </garnt>
<joey> - Trash Taste bunker. </joey>
<joey> - Trash Taste bunker. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Trash Taste emergency bunker. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt, we need land for that. </connor>
<garnt> - It's true. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - We don't have land, Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> None of us own land. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Buy the land first </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can do whatever
the fuck you want with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yet, yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I'm gonna do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I ever buy land in the future here, </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I'm like, fuck the house,
build a bunker first. </garnt>
<joey> - Who needs a soundproof- </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, there's just
something about the idea </garnt>
<joey> of building a bunker
that just like no matter </joey>
<joey> how old you are, it just fulfills
like this childhood dream. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a tree house. </joey>
<garnt> - It's kind of like the next
level tree house, right? </garnt>
<connor> - It's kinda like exciting. </connor>
<garnt> It's like your kinda place. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's like a secret base, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, just imagine- </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, what's the
difference between a basement </connor>
<connor> and a bunker?
- Huh? </connor>
<joey> - A basement is just like
an underground like... </joey>
<joey> I think a bunker is
supposed to be like secured. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's supposed to be secured. </garnt>
<joey> - With like concrete or- </joey>
<connor> - You can survive there, you know, </connor>
<garnt> a basement is just a roof. </garnt>
<connor> - There's tons of basements in London. </connor>
<garnt> It's like three story basements. </garnt>
<garnt> - But they're not bunkers. </garnt>
<garnt> - But they're not bunkers. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I thought like three levels deep, </garnt>
<garnt> which some of these basements are. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, when I think of a bunker- </garnt>
<garnt> - If you're three level deep. </garnt>
<connor> That's probably good, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe you can convert
that into a bunker. </garnt>
<garnt> But when I think bunker,
I don't just think a room, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I think like a
sizeable amount of secret space </garnt>
<garnt> that's secure and you can be like- </garnt>
<joey> - I think like the only way
to get in is through a hatch. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> You know, like that's what
I think when I think bunker. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not like a welcome to
the bunker. (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Open the plywood door. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey imitating creaking door) </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - That's not a bunker, you know. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - Move the ethnic looking beads </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> out of the way to get
into the room, the bunker. </joey>
<joey> - Place the book in the bookshelf. </joey>
<connor> - I really want a basement.
I just wanna have a basement. </connor>
<garnt> - I wanna bunker. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then, no, you want a basement. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you ever have like a tree house </garnt>
<connor> or anything like that as a kid growing up? </connor>
<joey> - Who the fuck had a tree house? </joey>
<connor> - That's what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] No one had a tree house. </joey>
<joey> - A tree house was this
mythical thing that some kids </joey>
<garnt> talked about, but I'd
never known a single person </garnt>
<joey> who had a tree house.
- My friend had a tree house. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] He had a tree house? </joey>
<joey> - Because there's always that one kid </joey>
<joey> who has that one dad who's
like never tired after work </joey>
<joey> and actually wants to do shit. </joey>
<connor> And he actually gets shit done. </connor>
<joey> - No, it was the one dad
that worked from home. </joey>
<connor> - Oh. Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It was the one dad
that worked from home. </joey>
<joey> - Checks out, checks out. </joey>
<joey> - Also the construction dance. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yep. </joey>
<connor> That was my task.
- Ah, they get shit done. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> My friend, but it wasn't like a massive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like fucking Simpsons
tree house looking thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was literally like
enough to maybe fit like two </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> five-year-olds in. </garnt>
<joey> Like an adult would not
be able to fit in that. </joey>
<garnt> - Why a tree house? </garnt>
<garnt> I've always wondered, why? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it feels like a one with nature. </garnt>
<joey> - Because it's just
kind of cool to be able </joey>
<joey> to like sit comfortably- </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Those poor trees- </connor>
<connor> - On a tree. </connor>
<connor> - We mock it by taking its own kind </connor>
<joey> and fashioning it into a house
and putting it on top of it. </joey>
<joey> How cruel of us. How cruel. </joey>
<connor> - It's kinda like building
a house outta bones. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - No, a dog house. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - A dog house made out of dog bones? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually kinda
true, that is. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you put it like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - It's kinda fucked up, yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we Google are there
any houses made out of bones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Can we fact check that? </connor>
<connor> Tim Burton must have a
house made out bones. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I refuse to believe- </garnt>
<garnt> - If anyone is gonna have
a house out of bones, </garnt>
<garnt> it's Tim Burton. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna build a bunker now. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna build a space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I do want </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> a basement, let's just start
off with a basement, right? </joey>
<joey> - Did you, did you not have a basement? </joey>
<garnt> - No, I've never had, no,
I've never had a basement. </garnt>
<connor> Sorry? Sorry? </connor>
<connor> - Going back to another question. </connor>
<joey> I'm ignoring your basement. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which one of us would
survive the longest </joey>
<connor> in a zombie or some kind of apocalypse, </connor>
<connor> do you think? And why? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. It's a good question. </joey>
<connor> I feel- </connor>
<connor> - I feel Garnt would trust
someone and be betrayed by them. </connor>
<joey> - I feel you would just be like, </joey>
<joey> I'll be the alpha male and
just go out immediately </joey>
<joey> and just get killed. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> That's so true. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're like, "Outta the way boys. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> I got this. Aah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you would come
up with like the perfect plan </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> of how to survive the zombie apocalypse- </joey>
<joey> - And then not follow the plan. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And then you'd somehow
like overlook something </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> at step one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Out of confidence or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - I feel like Joey wouldn't
realize the apocalypse </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> is going on, except- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The moment I would realize- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Oh, sorry, mate. I was
playing PhotoFantasy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The moment when I realize
is when you're dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guys, I turned up to the (indistinct)- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, where is everyone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> It must be the wrong day. </connor>
<connor> - I was too busy meditating,
watching Pokemon. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just escaped to my mind palace. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I feel like we have
different varying degrees </garnt>
<garnt> of survival instincts, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't feel any one
of our survival instincts </garnt>
<garnt> is particularly strong either. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I guess, we're all like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe we should do a survival special too. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel the best way to determine
how someone would survive </joey>
<joey> in a zombie apocalypse is
how they play Dead Rising. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no it's not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it is not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You are talking outta your ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because I feel like
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm just gonna fucking pick up something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and charge right into the crowd." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are the people who would not
survive a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like pick up what? A newspaper? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would anyone go into a newspaper? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, "I'm gonna pick up this
tennis ball, see much damage </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> it does to the zombies." </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the kind of person who
would just be like, "Charge." </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - I don't think anyone's doing that, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> but I dunno like everyone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what I'd do
in a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, everyone would be like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cry.
- Yeah, just cry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just cry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just camp and like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Break down and cry. (lips blowing) </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - I mean, you just try
to stay in the same place </garnt>
<garnt> for as long as possible. </garnt>
<connor> - I think you'd have to find a
sidekick as soon as possible. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - A sidekick? (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What, like Robin? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, if you're gonna survive, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> you need to become the main character, </connor>
<connor> how do you become the main character? </connor>
<connor> By getting a sidekick. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? You get a sidekick. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - What are you gonna run around </joey>
<joey> in like the fucking
apocalypse town and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Who wants to be my sidekick?" </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] You know, you- </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you'd like to survive, come with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're just walking around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, all right a
zombie is about to destroy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about to kill this 10-year-old kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- You save the kid. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "All right, fine. </joey>
<joey> I'll look after you." </joey>
<joey> Now, you're their main character. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. But then you have to take care </joey>
<joey> of a fucking 10-year-old. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, that
obviously is the downside, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then if something happens- </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - You can just chuck the
10-year-old. (chuckling) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're like, "Sidekick, do your job." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - "You're bait." Innit? </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause he's only 10 years old. </connor>
<connor> So, he doesn't need as
much food as a full adult. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, then you can make him go
and like lookout or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, so just bait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like finding a
kid and then making him </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> like do all the tedious tasks
is probably a good idea. </connor>
<connor> - But what- </connor>
<garnt> - It just sounds like
a parent at that point. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, yeah, but. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> But also you'd get some tangible benefit. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> But whereas in real life you don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> he just fucks off and
then goes to move to Japan </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> and doesn't contact you for months. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<garnt> Not a zombie apocalypse,
what if it was like </garnt>
<connor> you're in "Lost" or something. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - You're stranded on a desert island. </connor>
<connor> Who would survive the longest? </connor>
<garnt> - On a desert island? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. You're in "Lost." </garnt>
<garnt> You've seen "Lost," right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably me, because I'm
the most familiar with like- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wildlife and just like dangerous shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just- </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - That's just the Ozzie advantage. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I would definitely- </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, you kids, outta the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - I would definitely
eat something and die. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> I would get food poisoning. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Yeah, you would get food poisoning. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's an illness. It's an illness. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not sick, lads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I could still go out spear fishing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - The one time Connor
loves that food poisoning </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> and isn't honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a poisoning, Garnt, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> hence why it's called food poisoning. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - You see the reason why I think </connor>
<connor> you would have an easier time surviving </connor>
<joey> the zombie apocalypse is because
you almost get a tangible </joey>
<joey> benefit from being an asshole,
being a piece of shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But in a desert's island, </joey>
<connor> you have to actually work together. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Because if you're the asshole, </connor>
<joey> then you're the one that's
gonna be exiled, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you need as much
help as you can get. </connor>
<garnt> - Joey's like a few steps ahead </garnt>
<garnt> where you have like a fucking society now. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Well, yeah, of course- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like "Lord of the
Flies." Like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't wanna be exiled, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I was thinking about
how to start a fucking fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before I get exiled. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - To the other side of
the island with you! </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a desert island, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you can't steal people's
food or whatever, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to work together.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the zombie apocalypse </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> you could just go steal someone's house, </garnt>
<garnt> go and, you know, steal someone's house. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. That's true.
- Steal someone's house? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry. Go steal their
stuff from their house. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. That's true. </joey>
<joey> - You know, but, yeah- </joey>
<connor> - You're very limited on an island, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. You gotta work together. </connor>
<joey> - You can't really hide on an island. </joey>
<connor> - One of you fishes, one
of you doesn't make a fire. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And one makes a house full of bones. </joey>
<garnt> - This conversation's making
me like wanna just learn </garnt>
<garnt> a lot more survival tips
and survival instincts </garnt>
<garnt> that I don't know now because-
- Just drink your own piss. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you done that? </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> I do it all the time, just
to get ready. (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Just in case, you never know. </connor>
<garnt> - Just put it through
a Brita filter, innit. </garnt>
<garnt> That will sort out the piss. </garnt>
<connor> - I watched the survival man thing. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, even if you're
on like a raft in the ocean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You should never drink your own piss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- It's worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> Apparently you should
never drink your own pee. </joey>
<joey> - Why?
- See, like- </joey>
<joey> - Apparently, even if
you're super dehydrated, </joey>
<connor> apparently it makes it worse. </connor>
<joey> - But that's so conflicting </joey>
<joey> because it's either everything
I've seen about drinking </joey>
<joey> your own piss is either, </joey>
<joey> never drink your piss or
always drink your piss. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> No, I agree, I agree. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's never in between. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually had the same
thought where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is so conflicting. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> One minute, Bear Grylls is
absolutely like smashing </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> his own piss down like it's a beverage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would recommend, 10 outta 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - And then there's another
time where it's like, </connor>
<connor> absolutely do not drink
your own piss ever. </connor>
<garnt> - I just wasn't expecting. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, you think on like the scale </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> there should be like
a drink pissing scale. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There should be a middle ground </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> on whether we should be
drinking piss or not. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a lot of
misinformation about pee drinking </connor>
<connor> that I think needs to be corrected. </connor>
<connor> I would like to know. </connor>
<connor> - There's never a video that I have seen </connor>
<joey> where the guys like, you may
consider drinking your piss. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm always like you think
under certain circumstances, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe you should be able to drink piss. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's about filtering it. </connor>
<garnt> You need to find a way to filter it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bear Grylls doesn't filter it, does he? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - I distinctly remember
there's one time where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> pissed in a snake. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - While it was alive? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not while it was alive. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Not while it was alive. </connor>
<connor> Can you get this? </connor>
<connor> (Ashley mumbling) </connor>
<connor> Well, yeah, I think it was a
dead snake that he'd killed. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> I think, can you Google this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he turned it into like a water sack </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> by pissing in it.
- [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I think, I don't know how, </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> I don't know how- </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - This just sounds like a meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] This does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Can you check this out? </joey>
<connor> - It's like a parody
of a Bear Grylls video. </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] Urinating into snake skin. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I think it filters
it or something, somehow? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> Or makes it somewhat
edible or I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - Was it Bear Grylls who like used condoms </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> as like a device to hold
water or I might just like- </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Probably, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno. Why? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I dunno why that- </joey>
<joey> - Why would we have condoms? </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, Bear Grylls who comes </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> to a desert islands with condoms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, have a seat, have a seat, Bear Grylls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You brought Hard Mike's Lemonade </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and condoms to the desert island, huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah look, now what do we have
here? It's the condom tree. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I dunno if I can just
pick a condom of this? </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This isn't a sign out a
happiness skit. I think- </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno why I've heard that, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> condoms are very useful for
holding bodies of water in case </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to survive. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I don't know who said that to me </garnt>
<garnt> or if it's Bear Grylls or
not, but I'm just like- </garnt>
<connor> - Wasn't that just like
a YouTube challenge? </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's gonna be real annoying
getting that lube out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that condom, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are we pissing in the snake again? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> What was the purpose? </connor>
<garnt> - To survive? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] He said to have
required the additional liquid </garnt>
<garnt> as a last resort for whatever reason. </garnt>
<joey> - So, basically survival instincts, </joey>
<joey> which is what we're arguing here. </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying like you should drink </joey>
<joey> your piss on a Sunday
morning. I'm saying like- </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - If only they had giant tortoise shell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) I
have one liter of... (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I was saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going on a desert island, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm hoping it's the one desert island </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> that has the last remaining
like giant tortoise. </joey>
<garnt> - That question of like what do you bring </garnt>
<garnt> to a desert island? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One giant tortoise, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - A family of giant
tortoises that I can breed </connor>
<connor> so I can sustain myself forever. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you guys seen
like, "Nathan For You," </garnt>
<garnt> like talk about piss drinking. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you guys ever seen "Nathan For You?" </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, is this the one where he like tries </connor>
<garnt> to fix their business or something? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> There's one where he tries
to fix their business. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I've heard this is really good. </connor>
<connor> I really wanna watch it. </connor>
<garnt> - It is a really good show.
So, it's kind of like, so it's, </garnt>
<connor> I dunno what the actor's name, </connor>
<connor> but the character he plays is Nathan </connor>
<connor> and he tries to fix these businesses. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - With like the most like out-of-the-box, </connor>
<connor> dumb idea possible, right?
- Mm. </connor>
<connor> - And like part of like
what makes the show funny </connor>
<connor> is him pitching these ideas, </connor>
<connor> to these failing businesses. </connor>
<connor> So, it's kinda like, you know, </connor>
<connor> like what Sasha Baron Cohen does. </connor>
<connor> Like he puts people in
ridiculous situations </connor>
<garnt> and sees how they react, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I think (laughs) like
one of my favorite TV moments </garnt>
<garnt> of all time was possibly
like the only time </garnt>
<garnt> that I've seen him like break character </garnt>
<garnt> or almost break character. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause he was talking to this guy, </garnt>
<garnt> this old guy. </garnt>
<garnt> And he randomly, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember the exact
context of the conversation, </garnt>
<garnt> but he randomly brings up like
a jar of piss or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? Just to try and shock the guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay.
- And the guy goes, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh yeah. Like I drink jar
of pisses all the time." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And you could tell like it
was like the most unscripted, </garnt>
<garnt> amazing piece of moment
on TV I've ever seen, </garnt>
<garnt> where Nathan's like,
"What did you just say?" </garnt>
<garnt> He's just like, "Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like sometimes like I have
like my grandchildren's piss </garnt>
<garnt> just lying about,
sometimes I take a swig." </garnt>
<garnt> And (laughing) you need </garnt>
<garnt> to watch this clip,
like 'cause in context, </garnt>
<garnt> it's hilarious, outta
context, it's still hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the only time this
like Nathan comes close </garnt>
<garnt> to like breaking character
because he's hearing </garnt>
<joey> something so shocking. </joey>
<joey> - Why is it that immediately in my head, </joey>
<joey> I was like, drinking your own piss. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> Ha ha, hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Drinking your children's piss, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> Like as if it's like worse. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just completing
the cycle of life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They came outta you. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - [Joey] You're going back in. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're taking it back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - That's disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh gross. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. So, you go to a desert island? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - All right? You're on the
plane that Wilson's on. </joey>
<joey> - Mm.
- And what three items </joey>
<joey> do you bring to that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think his
name was Wilson, was it? </joey>
<connor> - No, but the ball's name was Wilson. </connor>
<connor> That was on the plane.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Tom Hanks' character, right? </joey>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - No, that wasn't his name.
It was the ball's name. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt coughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know </joey>
<joey> but you're talking about
Tom Hanks' character, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Who cares about him.
Wilson was the star. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - So, you can bring
three items to survive. </connor>
<garnt> What do you bring? </garnt>
<garnt> - Firestarter. (sniggers) </garnt>
<garnt> Come on, come on. </garnt>
<connor> - No.
- [Garnt] What? </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a waste of an item. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - The waste of an item? </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Learn there, learn there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What if, okay- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We're not counting
giant tortoise, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. You can't bring a giant tortoise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it, that's finite, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> That's gonna run out.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You should get something more- </joey>
<joey> - Just like flint or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Well, the flint's gonna
run out too eventually. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess. </joey>
<joey> - But like okay. </joey>
<connor> - You shouldn't rely on that. </connor>
<connor> - You shouldn't. </connor>
<connor> Okay. Assuming we're going now, right? </connor>
<garnt> Without prior knowledge that
we're gonna be crashing. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you're gonna be going, </garnt>
<connor> like the "Big Brother" or some shit. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> You're gonna be sent
to this desert island. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A tent. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] You can take a tent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would take a tent 'cause I'm
not fucking collecting bones </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> to make a house, fuck that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just collect leaves, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Just fashion your own tent. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would love to see
you try and build a house </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> from leaves, dude. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's tear these things down at the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what are the other two? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - A knife.
- Okay. I think that's valid. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> a nice book. Oh fuck. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - A nice book!
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Joey's gonna die day one. </connor>
<joey> He's gonna actually cut his
tent and then rip the book </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> in half out of anger. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - And stab myself. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh God. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> What would you bring, Garnt?
- I would bring a knife. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - A water filter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That can filter salt
water to fresh water. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Smart, smart.
- Mm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Hold onto those lines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you can do that with a leaf. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - You can do that with a leaf, right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just piss in a snake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just drink your piss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - And my grandchild's
jar of piss, of course. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just in case I run out, just in case. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I think the one big
thing you'd want to take </connor>
<connor> is probably a fishing net. </connor>
<joey> - I thought that as well,
I was like fishing rod </joey>
<connor> or fishing net.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You'd probably want a
really nice-sized fishing net. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] True.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - It'd probably make
your life a lot easier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mm, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Or maybe like a fishing spear. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like a knife you can make, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you could make like a cavemanesque one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a sharp rock. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like you could do that. </garnt>
<connor> And that would do
everything you need to do. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, but I feel like a knife </connor>
<garnt> would make things a lot easier. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] I think an ax
would be better though. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - But using the knife, you
can make more knives, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> How are you gonna start
by making the knife </joey>
<garnt> to begin with? </garnt>
<joey> - It's the first knife </joey>
<garnt> that's like gonna be the hardest to make, </garnt>
<garnt> unless you're like that one guy on YouTube </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> who made like a knife out of cardboard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that.
- A knife out of air. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Damascus leaf knife
or some shit like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, if you're with
that one Japanese dude </connor>
<connor> on the island, you'll be
like, "Can I have a knife?" </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "Which one?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What have you got? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which genome of tree do you want? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> I'll make it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> Can I take a boat? </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like a really nice yacht? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll just taking my 6
million dollar mansion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, I'm pretty sure some of
these like rich billionaires </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> would do it. </connor>
<connor> Why can't I do it? </connor>
<connor> No one set the scale of items I can bring, </connor>
<connor> why can't I bring a boat? </connor>
<joey> - Well, then I'll bring a
jet and get the fuck out. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Let's assume it's
like a Minecraft sandbox </connor>
<connor> where there's no end to the ocean. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just goes on forever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I would like the
boat just to be able to- </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - I'll just bring a house then with... </garnt>
<connor> I'll just bring a city. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - How are you gonna
bring the house, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> How are you gonna bring a house? </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a boat? </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - No, you cannot. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> You cannot bring a house. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - I'll fucking, I'll fucking- </connor>
<joey> - What if it's a houseboat? </joey>
<joey> - I'll fucking float in up-style </joey>
<joey> with a fucking bunch of balloons, Connor, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're just making up
rules as we go along here. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> So, I'm just gonna make up rules as well. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's perfectly
reasonable that you can sail a boat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to a desert island. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't see why this is it not fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Well, then you wouldn't
need anything else </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you could just fucking
go back to the mainland </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with the boat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one said you have
to stay there, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> The implication was you had
to stay there and survive. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm staying there and surviving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - The entire "Magic
Mike" collection on DVD. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Never get bored. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A DVD player. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And a monitor with a solar panel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A laptop with a 3060 in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My entire gaming set. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - A super computer chip. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'll be the only one
who has them apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. What would I actually bring? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] What would you actually bring? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Probably a fishing net. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. You said that. (laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know. I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I could make
a spear out of something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also think that is a lot of work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'd rather just catch the fish easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I'm gonna die pretty soon
if I don't get this food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, true.
- So, I got a fishing net. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey And Garnt] Mm-hm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A Toyota Prius would be (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very economical. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Take a sick beach shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mm, what else? Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> What's like the perfect strat? </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> What's the optimized strat? </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> A net's pretty good, a knife is shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't bring a knife. </garnt>
<garnt> What a fucking waste. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like a knife enables you </garnt>
<garnt> to make more tools needed to survive. </garnt>
<connor> - Faster, as well.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, fine. So, fishing net and a knife. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I think fishing net and a
knife is like the go-to. </joey>
<garnt> - Like 'cause you can make a knife, </garnt>
<garnt> but like in order to craft a knife, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like that would
take a lot of effort. </garnt>
<connor> But a knife is so useful </connor>
<garnt> that it can help you craft other tools- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fast as well.
- Fast as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like a wind up torch </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> would be super useful actually. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like how, let's be honest here. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not gonna fucking do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Indiana Jones shit- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With the fire? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just not gonna work.
- Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How are you gonna make that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't have oil?
- Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Those are like oil rags
soaked in like a ball. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - How are you, you can't
make one of those normally. </connor>
<joey> - I just sweat onto it. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I don't know
how you'd make that? </connor>
<connor> How would you make one of those things? </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure. </connor>
<connor> Maybe like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> There's maybe like some
life hack where you use </connor>
<joey> like tree sap or some shit, you know. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe, but like do you
really wanna be fucking around </connor>
<connor> harvesting tree sap when you could just- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Well, you're
probably gonna be harvesting </connor>
<joey> other shit, right? </joey>
<garnt> - But like what would you want to be doing </garnt>
<connor> in the nighttime anyway? </connor>
<connor> Because everyone's stuck
on a desert island. </connor>
<garnt> - Actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's gonna be pretty dangerous. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe you see something? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe you wanna-
- Well, if I see something- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, also rope. Rope actually. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> I don't wanna make my own rope. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - Like a good fucking rope. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Like a really good rope. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel like rope is, I mean, </connor>
<connor> rope is obviously useful. </connor>
<connor> If you only have- </connor>
<connor> - Do you know how to make rope? </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - Do you know how to make a rope? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't. But do you
know how to make a fire? </garnt>
<garnt> - I can learn how to make a fire. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know how to make a knife? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I can make a knife. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> Start bashing shit together. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But like, if you can
learn how to make a fire, </connor>
<garnt> you can learn out to make rope, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] I feel that's different. </joey>
<joey> That's different. </joey>
<joey> - Rope is so hard. </joey>
<joey> You've gotta make these
like individual strands. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> And then, I don't even
know how you do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then you have to start wrapping that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> How do you? Do you know what makes a rope? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I swear to God- </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - What's the base ingredient to a rope? </garnt>
<garnt> - A base ingredient. </garnt>
<connor> - What is a rope? </connor>
<connor> - I swear to God, </connor>
<garnt> I've seen like ropes on
like YouTube tutorials </garnt>
<joey> being made by like massive leaves. </joey>
<joey> And like- </joey>
<joey> - It's like tiny strands.
- Tiny strands that they like- </joey>
<connor> - Braid them together. </connor>
<connor> - Are you really gonna
want to like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> rely on that though? </garnt>
<garnt> Like and then when it breaks,
like fuck sake. (muttering) </garnt>
<garnt> - What if the rope you bring breaks? </garnt>
<connor> - How would you break a rope, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - With a knife. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you be doing that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean, how
do you break a rope? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> How does any rope break? </connor>
<connor> When you use it a lot,
sometimes it breaks. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - You must be trying really
hard to break this rope. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - How much rope are we talking about? </joey>
<connor> - Like as much rope as you want. </connor>
<connor> - Give me a length. Like roughly. </connor>
<garnt> - An infinite amount of rope. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - You're gonna have an
infinite amount of rope. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, then I'll bring an
infinite amount of knives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can, what is more
than one knife gonna do? </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - I will tie the rope on one side </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the fucking city I'm leaving from. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'll fucking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just like rope myself
back out, like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Garnt, you could barely
cycle across the (indistinct). </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> How are you gonna pull
yourself back via rope? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> (Garnt sighs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I would be
interested to do like, </garnt>
<garnt> not a complete like a desert
island survival special. </garnt>
<joey> - We should do this.
- We should do a survival- </joey>
<joey> - Where we take the items that we said, </joey>
<joey> I'll take a rope, a
fishing net and a knife. </joey>
<joey> And you can take, what was it? </joey>
<connor> - Ah, rope. No, not rope. </connor>
<connor> A knife. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] It was knife,
tent, and a nice book. </joey>
<connor> - That's right. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Knife, tent and a nice book. </connor>
<connor> - I tell you what you should've gone for, </connor>
<connor> you should've gone with take nothing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he's an idiot. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Water filter for salt water. </joey>
<joey> And you didn't mention the last one. </joey>
<joey> - I said Firestarter. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Firestarter?
- Firestarter. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes, yes. That's what I would take. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - What would you use to
start the fire though </joey>
<garnt> with the firestarter? </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because usually firestarters work </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> because you already have like
a preexisting light, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> So, where are you gonna get that from? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like firestarters kits available </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> that make it easier to start a fire. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- Than, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> using the raw materials there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- But getting that initial </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> spark is the hard part, right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - I mean, have you guys
ever made a fire before? </garnt>
<garnt> - Once. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Once. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - When? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Like ages ago. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did the fucking stick. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Yeah, I did the rope one.
- Stick one. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I did the rope and the stick- </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where'd you learn how to do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - When we had like those
like, not scout things, but- </connor>
<joey> - At like school camp thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like a camping thing.
- I did it, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I never got taught
this in school at all. </connor>
<garnt> Like I never had like a
fucking like a survival. </garnt>
<connor> - If you had rope, Garnt, </connor>
<connor> you could make that fire a lot easier. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - How much rope are we talking?
How thick is this rope? </garnt>
<connor> - I would probably side with a
thicker rope though actually. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it wouldn't work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you could also, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the good thing about
rope is that you could, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's say if you had a really long rope, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> just cut of piece and
then start peeling off </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the individual strands
that make the thick rope. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then you got a small rope. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now, Shaq, he did this.
- He did this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is just three idiots talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about surviving on a des- </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> Three idiots with zero survival knowledge </garnt>
<garnt> talk about surviving on a desert island. </garnt>
<joey> - Now, I just wanna do a video </joey>
<garnt> where we should just try do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you move into a house you know </garnt>
<garnt> someone died in? </garnt>
<joey> - No.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, if it's a fucking steal. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, okay, hold on. It depends. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> How did they die? </joey>
<joey> Because if they died
from like natural causes. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, sure.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But if it's like a
brutal murder, then no. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Okay. Well, why though? </garnt>
<garnt> Why?
- It is literally all bone. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> That looks like a dark souls dungeon. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] That (laughs) is literally </garnt>
<joey> where the final boss lays. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's fucking horrific. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> - [Garnt] That's the end
game in Elden Ring, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't imagine the skulls
being a part of the equation. </garnt>
<joey> I thought it was just like
bones, tibias and shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Fucking hell. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like so, you would
happily move into a house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where someone got murdered? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Oh God, yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - If I'm getting a deal on this. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'll be at the fucking meeting with them </joey>
<joey> being like, "Oh, I dunno,
10% off is a little. </joey>
<connor> Ooh, someone did die? </connor>
<connor> Maybe 15, 20% off?" (inhaling) </connor>
<garnt> - How low would you be willing to go? </garnt>
<garnt> Like how much would you negotiate down </garnt>
<garnt> if you knew someone
had died in this house? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd try at least get a third off. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like that's
actually a pretty big thing </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> Not people getting brutally murdered, </garnt>
<garnt> but like houses where people
have died of natural causes. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, Garnt, in this
market, you can't be picky. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta take what you
can get if it's a steal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] That is true.
That is true. That is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - I'll be like, "Who died in here? </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, yeah? Great. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm moving in now, is that all right?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's a website actually.
- [Connor] I know, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is like a real estate website </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> where it tells you which
houses are on sale of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they call it jiko bukken or
like accident apartments, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where some horrible </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> accident has happened
and now it's on sale. </joey>
<connor> - Why would that affect
your view of the apartment </connor>
<connor> or the house though? </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, if someone had used
that swing and died on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would you not want to use it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, probably not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it because they lived there? </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Is that what like adds the weight to it? </connor>
<connor> To me, I don't quite- </connor>
<garnt> - To me, like a house is
just personal, you know? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like your personal space. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not a house. It's a home. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - To me, it's like, what
makes a home is the, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> the way that you've made it yours, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like the base walls and
floors don't mean shit to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but all my stuff, that's my couch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's my TV and I put it there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what makes it me,
well, to me at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, when you know, that's why
when I move into an apartment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone used to live here." </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh, it's a box." </connor>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> I don't think that of like,
someone used to live here, </joey>
<joey> but like, there's a big
difference between, oh, </joey>
<joey> someone lived here for 30 years and, oh, </joey>
<joey> that guy was dead there
a couple years ago. </joey>
<joey> Like brutally, I'm not okay with that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I know, it's- </joey>
<connor> - But if it's not there anymore, </connor>
<connor> it's not like you moving in and it's like, </connor>
<connor> don't mind the dead guy,
he's been there for a while. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Step over him real quick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - (cross-talking) insurance
should get rid of it. Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> having your, what was it like? </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, it goes back into
partly into like superstition. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's a how, you know, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not religious, I'm not
very spiritual or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> So, I don't have any sort
of connection with death </joey>
<garnt> and people or anything. </garnt>
<connor> I just think it's a steal. </connor>
<connor> - You just think it's a building. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's free real estate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally. Literally, right? Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - Free real estate. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally free real estate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Originally, like sometimes
when houses were really cheap </connor>
<joey> in Japan here, I would
go and look, so I'm like, </joey>
<joey> there's no way this is this cheap. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you'd go online you would see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> occasionally, that actually
someone had passed in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> if there's so many apartments where like, </connor>
<garnt> eventually everyone has
to die in an apartment. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Or somewhere.
- Or somewhere, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> - Or somewhere, yes. </connor>
<connor> - But it's also like, that's like, </connor>
<connor> what if something like a battle </connor>
<connor> or something happened on a piece of land, </connor>
<connor> does that affect if you
built something on it? </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - Uh.
- What about it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Is it 'cause it's just a personal feeling </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's 'cause it's a house? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm trying to get like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like in Ikebukuro, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> Sunshine City. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> That was built on like
a POW camp originally. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it actually?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why they called it Sunshine. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> Because they were like let's rebrand it </connor>
<connor> to make it more happy. </connor>
<joey> - Well, they weren't gonna
call it... (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Prisoner of War prison.
- Prisoner of War City. </connor>
<connor> POW City. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like I think
it was like one of the, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why they renamed
it to be like Sunshine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they wanted it to be more positive. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you, I believe, can you check this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy shit, I did not know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I believe, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I believe that it was a
prisoner of war camp before. </joey>
<joey> And so you'd think like, I don't go there </joey>
<connor> and I'm like, "Oh fuck, man. Oh, Jesus." </connor>
<joey> - I think for me it's more
so about like the recency </joey>
<connor> of the event, right? </connor>
<connor> Like 'cause-
- That's fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - You know- </connor>
<connor> - So, it's a mixture between
recency plus intimacy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Recency and intimacy. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, I'm sure
there's a ton of land </connor>
<connor> all around us that was, you know, </connor>
<connor> where probably soldiers and, you know, </connor>
<connor> people just died, right? </connor>
<joey> But it's like, that
happened a very, very, very </joey>
<joey> long time ago. </joey>
<joey> Whereas if someone, you know, </joey>
<joey> just last year got brutally
murdered in this living room </joey>
<joey> then, yeah, I'd be a
little more uncomfortable. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just not a nice thought </garnt>
<garnt> knowing that, I guess,
such an atrocious thing </garnt>
<garnt> happened in the very spot that you're- </garnt>
<connor> - Are we talking about
just murder, by the way? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Well, just if someone
died from natural causes, </joey>
<connor> I'm okay with that. </connor>
<connor> - My concern would be with
murder or something, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, all right, what
if the guy got murdered? </connor>
<connor> He was involved in like gangs
or something, dealing, right? </connor>
<connor> I don't want, on their address book, </connor>
<connor> for it to be like the guy
that we hate lives here. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> And then they come to my- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Knock knock. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I would probably be
asking a bit more questions. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> 'Cause obviously I'm not gonna, you know, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's something like that
or the person was doing stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that, I'd be like, all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> this address is probably not
a great address in general. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But I mean like I'd be
okay finding staying </garnt>
<garnt> there for like temporary or, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> just like, you know, you
stay there and, you know, </garnt>
<connor> you find out it happens. </connor>
<connor> And like that's an interesting story, </connor>
<joey> but like there's just
something about settling down </joey>
<joey> or just calling somewhere a home </joey>
<joey> where something like that has happened </joey>
<joey> that would just like, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't make me superstitious. </joey>
<joey> It's just not a nice thought to have </joey>
<joey> where somewhere for a place where you </joey>
<connor> should be completely comfortable. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess from my permanent home, </garnt>
<garnt> I might be a bit different towards it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- But towards renting, </garnt>
<connor> I don't, I couldn't care. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Really? </connor>
<joey> - If it's renting and I'm- </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't even be okay
with renting, to be honest. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Even if it's a steal?
- Even if it's a st- </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> But there's like there's other ways </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to get a steal, you know.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's just like barter down. (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did, I'd kill for these
prices, literally. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - I guess, different
question, but when does- </garnt>
<garnt> You move into a new place? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Okay, okay. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> - When does it start
actually feel like your home </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and not just a place of residence? </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> If you've ever felt like that, Connor. </connor>
<connor> - The moment you've like </connor>
<connor> hit the wall and you've
chipped it and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh fuck, fucking hell,
that's my problem. Oh fuck!" </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's when it hits you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's literally- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did that day one. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Literally day one. (laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are just being irresponsible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I did that day
one 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> I'm not used to a wall being here. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I chipped a good chunk of like the wood </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> in the frame of something
when I was moving </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> one of my chairs. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - And I was like, "Oh fuck. </garnt>
<connor> I'm not gonna get some my
deposit back now. God dammit." </connor>
<garnt> - It's literally day
one where your furniture </garnt>
<garnt> is just a little bit more heavy </garnt>
<garnt> than you think it's going to be, </garnt>
<joey> your sofa, you just wanna
move the sofa a little bit. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, you're
just trying to nudge it </joey>
<joey> and then it just, (makes ripping noise) </joey>
<joey> and it just makes that fucking scratch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that scratch. </joey>
<joey> - And you never see it coming. </joey>
<joey> You're like, I'm going to try my best </joey>
<joey> to not make this scratch, </joey>
<garnt> but it's always like just a little late. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it just slips a little
bit more than you think </garnt>
<garnt> it's going to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think-
- And just leave that scratch. </garnt>
<joey> - I think for me, </joey>
<joey> the moment where I know I've
like really settled down </joey>
<joey> is when I am a hundred percent aware </joey>
<joey> of where everything is in the house. </joey>
<joey> Because you have that
period where, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're first moving in, </joey>
<joey> you're putting shit away in like cabinets </joey>
<joey> and, you know, everything. </joey>
<joey> And then for a while you're like, </joey>
<joey> fuck, where was that thing again? </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> And you just like look
all around the house </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because you dunno where it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But the moment where you're
like, (thumb clicking) </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> I know exactly where that
really specific thing is. </joey>
<joey> I feel that's when it's like. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you know what it is for me? </garnt>
<garnt> It's really weird for me. </garnt>
<garnt> For me, it's when I can
switch on and off the lights </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> without having to look at
them or try to find them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you move into a new
house and you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where's the fucking light switch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where's the fucking light switch? </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> And then you live there
for like a week or two </garnt>
<garnt> and then you can like
fucking ultra-instinct </garnt>
<garnt> this thing, you know? </garnt>
<joey> Like what- </joey>
<joey> - So, when you enter a room, you just... </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? Especially like
if it's the living room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like there's different
switches depending on which part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the living room and like you live there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for long enough, and like, to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a home is when I want to
turn on that exact light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know the exact switch
that I have to flick to turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on that exact light.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so weird for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've never been a guy who's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> decorated his house a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's weird, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My room's always been like really bare. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> It's like a proper engineering room, </garnt>
<garnt> which is, I buy everything
exactly what I need to get </garnt>
<garnt> whatever I need done, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I need a desk, I need a
computer, I need a chair. </garnt>
<joey> - So basically, you don't
buy nonfunctional things? </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't until I moved to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I realized how weird it is. </garnt>
<connor> So, I was like, I feel like
Mark Zuckerberg, you know, </connor>
<connor> I was like- </connor>
<connor> - I was the same. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like, I need to
add personality to this room. </connor>
<garnt> I need to buy stuff to like
fill this room up, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - I've always been that person </joey>
<joey> where even when I was back at home </joey>
<connor> where I'm like if I see
an empty piece on my wall, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, I can fill
that up to something. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Ah, no, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<joey> - Whether that's a poster
or a calendar or anything </joey>
<connor> that I can. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't decorate my walls until JoJo. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, if you go look at my first videos. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For JoJo, so, my walls are like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like a scientific experiment room. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like depressing. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> And JoJo changed them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I guess it's because like, I
guess before moving to Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the reason I never decorated anywhere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was because I'd always
think about the moment </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I would have to
move out of that place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that, the thought of
having to like pack things up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just take everything down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that seemed like such a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Such a hassle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to remove
the hassle from myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> even though that's like years away </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from when I need to move out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right.
- And then I just never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ended up decorating my room. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I remember like the only reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I started decorating it was
because I was on camera more so, </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> (Joey laughing) so it would
look weird if there was nothing </joey>
<garnt> in the background and that
was literally the only reason. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess if you're not on camera, </garnt>
<garnt> then there's no need, right? </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, that makes sense. </joey>
<garnt> - But, but I guess, I'm
wondering what it would be like </garnt>
<garnt> when you actually have
your own personal home </garnt>
<garnt> that you're gonna, I guess,
your permanent residence, </garnt>
<garnt> that you know you're
gonna stay in for like, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, years and years, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm putting a big
fucking hole in the wall </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_07> because I finally can. </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - Because I can't in my current place. </joey>
<joey> - You know, I wonder what the feeling </joey>
<joey> is of being like a true homeowner. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And just like being </joey>
<garnt> able to do- </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanna get to that point </garnt>
<joey> where I'm like, you know
what? I don't need this wall. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Entire wall, take it down. </garnt>
<joey> Just do it. </joey>
<joey> - That's just like, I look at that </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, that is the end game. </joey>
<joey> - That's the end game.
- That is the end game. </joey>
<garnt> - If I can do that, where I'm like, wait, </garnt>
<joey> I don't need permission
to take down this wall, </joey>
<garnt> I just do it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, right on, like in university </garnt>
<garnt> you fucking needed permission
to fucking put posters up. </garnt>
<garnt> And like the type of blue
tack you use, you know? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And like go from that to
like breaking down a wall </joey>
<joey> is just like so alien to me.
- It's like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I want another room. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Give me another room. </joey>
<joey> That's what I want. </joey>
<joey> - Gimme another room. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Well, let's just make these two rooms </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> into one massive room. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like that just sounds so cool to me. </joey>
<joey> - I want a bunker, that's what I want. </joey>
<joey> That's the end game for me. </joey>
<connor> - I want a church of made out of bones. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] In my backyard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, luckily for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's just one ready for purchase. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Does the price get dropped for that? </connor>
<connor> That's a lot of deaths on that wall. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel-
- A house made out of bones? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like at that point, </SPEAKER_07>
<garnt> it's just like an
aesthetic choice, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, you kill one person
in a house, suddenly, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> You kill 50 people, oh,
now it's an attraction. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Now it's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, I see how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, what I'm hearing is,
you shouldn't stop at one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You should go the full... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fully commit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Profitable to be a serial killer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Well, it is. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Here's the idea, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're done, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You wanna make money,
you wanna be comfortable. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> First of all, step one,
become a serial killer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Step two, profit because
you go to prison, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never have to pay
for a thing ever again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No taxes, nothing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then now Netflix ringing you up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We wanna make a true crime doccie." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Ah, ooh, six figures at per episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're just living like Biscuit Oliva. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, you would be. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> You'd be the king of the prison. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I don't have to pay rent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you want from the prison store? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, you want four packs of ramen? </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I'll get it for you. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Clean my bum.
- You'd just be in prison. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe you're into that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the slight
downside to that, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Slight downside. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's just like a bunker,
isn't it? (chuckling) </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you'll be rich. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In ramen. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Do you ever wanna take on a DIY project? </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. I'd love to. </connor>
<joey> - I'd love to. </joey>
<joey> - It's one of those things
that I definitely, definitely, </joey>
<joey> definitely, when I work less in future- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Mm-hm, yeah.
- And I get my own place, </joey>
<joey> is that I'm gonna have a lot of fun. </joey>
<connor> - You're like half retired. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Definitely have a lot fun doing it. </joey>
<connor> - It's just like- </connor>
<joey> - You get the mate over and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Do you think this is a good idea?" </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Let's
give it a go, Connor." </joey>
<connor> - What's the one thing
you want to build or like- </connor>
<connor> - Shed for sure. </connor>
<connor> - Shed?
- Just number one. </connor>
<connor> - You wanna build a shed?
- I wanna build a shed. </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought about building a shed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at my current place. (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Just 'cause I have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot of space, but
like, yeah, build. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> Shed, I don't know? </connor>
<joey> What is it about building
a shed that it's like, </joey>
<connor> yeah, I'm a man? </connor>
<connor> - It's like the tutorial
level into like building shit. </connor>
<joey> - Or like a table? </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> I think that's the tutorial level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the tutorial level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a work table.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - Building a work table
where you can do other DIYs. </joey>
<garnt> - Building a shed is just
like the easy version </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> of building a bunker, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like not a tree house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't have to worry about gravity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not underground. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just in your garden, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Just sitting there. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just sitting there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like
right now it's annoying. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like I'll have a problem, I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> man, if I just had a saw and some wood, </joey>
<joey> I could like make this
thing in my apartment </joey>
<garnt> just work easier.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you ever want a man cave? </garnt>
<connor> - I guess that's the shed, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. For sure.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What is it about? </connor>
<garnt> I dunno, but like there's
just something primal </garnt>
<garnt> about just having your
own like man cave, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno why, but every guy I know- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - No ladies allowed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a shed with like
a Time Crisis machine in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> It's like, "Boys, come over." </connor>
<joey> - It's like pool table, dartboard. </joey>
<connor> Time Crisis machine.
- Time Crisis machine. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's all I need. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Has to be Time Crisis,
one or two, maybe three. </garnt>
<connor> Anything- </connor>
<connor> - I don't wanna be that guy who
assumes things about genders </connor>
<garnt> and stuff like that, but like
do girls want a girl cave? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm genuinely curious
because every girl- </garnt>
<garnt> - A girl cave. (laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt, the house is the girl cave. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> (Garnt laughing)
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> That's why we build a man cave </SPEAKER_07>
<connor> because the girl doesn't
let you build the man cave </connor>
<joey> in the house. </joey>
<joey> - As men, we can't comprehend
more than one room. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're like one room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't need more than one room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're like, I wanna be able
to play Osu! on 4k Dolby Atmos </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> in the shed and have a beer machine. </joey>
<joey> That's what I want. </joey>
<joey> I don't care about how it looks. </joey>
<SPEAKER_07> It's my thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas I think, generally,
you know, I'm not assuming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that normal, I think,
women like taking care </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the whole space, don't they? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We're messy.
- [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> - I don't know if I'm correct, </joey>
<joey> I might've just said something
that's (cross-talking) </joey>
<connor> if I did- </connor>
<joey> - Also again, like in my opinion, </joey>
<joey> like just because I'm
this, men just in general, </joey>
<joey> just don't have a sense of interior design </joey>
<joey> like a lot of ladies do. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then you meet some guys who do. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - You meet some guys who
are just like wizards </joey>
<connor> and you're like how- </connor>
<connor> - But you're saying generally.
- Generally speaking. </connor>
<connor> I think the general consensus
is that a lot of guys </connor>
<connor> are just like, put up poster here. </connor>
<joey> And then put up something </joey>
<joey> that doesn't completely match over here. </joey>
<joey> Whereas, you know, </joey>
<joey> a lot of ladies like,
no, balance, theming. </joey>
<connor> - That was probably one of the things </connor>
<connor> I hated most about moving, </connor>
<connor> was having to figure out
where everything goes. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't like that. </connor>
<connor> - Because every time you
try to do it yourself, </connor>
<connor> you just like, no-
- I just did my office. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, I dunno
what to do for the rest. </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just did my
office as well. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I just did my office as well. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> And even my office was like
fucking difficult as shit </garnt>
<connor> to figure out. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> - I thought I had like the perfect setup </joey>
<joey> and then I put everything in place </joey>
<joey> and then it just looked shit. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) It looked
shit. It looked shit. </joey>
<joey> And I had to like do real life Sims </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like placing
things in different spaces. </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Moving it around.
- But unfortunately, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't just click on a button, </joey>
<joey> I had to like physically move
this fucking heavy-ass desk </joey>
<joey> like around my room until I found a place </joey>
<garnt> that I felt comfortable with. </garnt>
<garnt> And I wish I could just
like see in my mind's eye </garnt>
<garnt> where would look the best. </garnt>
<garnt> But like my imagination
just sucks when it comes </garnt>
<joey> to interior design. </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish I had that like
overview camera, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<garnt> of the room where I could
just see the entire thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, yes, I know exactly
what this is gonna look like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, like I just hate making decisions. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like, I dunno if that's the thing, </garnt>
<garnt> but like the thing- </garnt>
<connor> - Decision fatigue. </connor>
<garnt> - This is why you would fail
in the zombie apocalypse. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Probably, I just- </connor>
<connor> - Which weapon? </connor>
<garnt> - I just want someone to
make all my decisions for me. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? Like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Goo, goo, ga, ga, Garnt. (laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> Change my diapers, Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - I just want to exist comfortably. </garnt>
<joey> Like I want someone to
make the decisions for me. </joey>
<joey> As long as I can just exist comfortably. </joey>
<garnt> It's a good life. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a good place for
that, I think it's called jail. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Prison. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Honestly, you're bashing prison, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it kinda sounds like you like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah, they make all the
decisions for you there. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - They tell you when to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They tell you when you
can go and exercise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look, Garnt, they kinda
sound like you might like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - But it's not- </garnt>
<connor> - I think you would do the best in prison </connor>
<SPEAKER_07> out of the three of us.
- Why? (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you'd be in the fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you do well in prison? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd be sitting in the fucking corner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having a great time watching
like "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> in your head for the
third time, obviously. </connor>
<connor> Me and Joey would be like going crazy. </connor>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> - That's probably </garnt>
<connor> true actually.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Garnt would be totally chill in prison. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You'd be friends with everyone. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause no one can hate you.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> You'd have no decision fatigue either </joey>
<joey> 'cause everything's been selected for you. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't have to worry
about interior design. </garnt>
<joey> - Literally, the most
stress-free lifestyle. </joey>
<connor> - Consider, consider? (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It's the knowledge that if
I wanted to, I could leave. </garnt>
<joey> If I wanted to, I could make a decision </joey>
<SPEAKER_00> and have my own freedom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I see, I see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, maybe like a make-believe prison. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So, Garnt wants prison, </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> but he can leave when he wants. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, like a rehab? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a hospital? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a hospital. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a mental asylum? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you're well enough, you can leave. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you can't leave
a mental asylum, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd be the easiest like
grandparent to take care of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I would just like just leave- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Old folks home.
- Yeah. An old folks home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Just leave me there.
- Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Future child, please do not
take this clip out of context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Please take care of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is just young me
talking shit with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> Please do not leave me
in an old folks home. </garnt>
<connor> - I can just imagine you go
to visit your grandparents </connor>
<connor> in this old person's home. </connor>
<connor> And then just like next to
your 70-year-old granddad </connor>
<connor> is 30-year-old Garnt, playing Solitaire. </connor>
<connor> Like (chuckles) Garnt's
like, "I love it here. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> It's amazing. They take care of me." </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever thought
about it? Because, so like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - No.
- Have you ever thought about- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No never thought. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, you have kids, right?
- Mm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm sure every parent
goes through this phase. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You have kids. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You want them to take care
of you when you're older </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> because I don't know like many people </joey>
<joey> who want to be in a
retirement home, right? </joey>
<joey> You want to be close to
your kids as possible. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> - How'd you trick them
into doing that? (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> How would you convince
your kids to do that? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, this is where the past 40 years </connor>
<joey> will matter, Garnt. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Whether or not you
treated your kids right. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Did you raise a piece of shit? </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I think it's all about
how you raised them. </connor>
<garnt> - How were you raised? </garnt>
<garnt> Were you raised- </garnt>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wasn't. I was left to
fend for myself, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<connor> On a desert island. </connor>
<garnt> - The wolves were my parents. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because for me, right. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor howling) </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> For you, guys, you've got family, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You got brothers and sisters. </garnt>
<garnt> You can spread the load, right? </garnt>
<garnt> For me, I'm like an only child. </garnt>
<garnt> So, like my parents are
like all or nothing for me. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like praying that I
don't just wake up one day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "Mom, dad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess you're going in
the retirement home today." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God, they're probably sweating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching this right now
actually. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit, he's considering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Depends, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause what if it's like different, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you are like 40, 50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Mm.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You probably have a lot
more like time and resources </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to be able to help. </SPEAKER_07>
<joey> If you're 20, 25, 30.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, you're barely being able </joey>
<connor> to take care of yourself. </connor>
<joey> - Also think about like, you know, </joey>
<joey> if you live near your parents. </joey>
<connor> Like you could be, you know, </connor>
<connor> you could be on the
other side of the planet. </connor>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, if they can't
take care of themselves, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then who's going to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause- </SPEAKER_00>
<joey> - Retirement home. </joey>
<joey> - We're, unfortunately, we are three guys </joey>
<joey> who are living like very, very
far away from our parents. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly.
- But like, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I think like we're like the exceptions. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why my sister
lives near my parents. </joey>
<joey> So, all the work goes to her. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I'm saying. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do your parents need help already? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Having siblings is a cheat code, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I'm saying, man. Like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "Sister, good
luck. See you later." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Teleport away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were the first one
to leave the house like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, now my sister's like,
"Oh fuck, I can't leave now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Totally raising another
kid wasn't so annoying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'd all have like 15 kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> All right, well, Garnt, I'm
glad to know that your parents </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are on a one way street
to a retirement home. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
