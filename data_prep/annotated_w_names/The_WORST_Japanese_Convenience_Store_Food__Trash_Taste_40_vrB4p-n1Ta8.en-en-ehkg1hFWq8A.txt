<garnt> (chewing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Chewy bread doesn't taste good with the chocolate </garnt>
<connor> that they put in there. </connor>
<connor> - I'll fuck with it. </connor>
<connor> - Joey you fuck with anything. </connor>
<connor> - Joey's like, is that fucking weird? </connor>
<joey> I'll fuck with that. </joey>
<joey> - Is this seasoned vomit? </joey>
<joey> I mean, I'ma try it. </joey>
<joey> (groovy music) </joey>
<joey> - What's up you crazy konbini cunts? </joey>
<joey> Welcome to another episode. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That wasn't my idea. </joey>
<garnt> That was Garnt's. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know you've been hanging out with Aki too much. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that was the most American sounding cunt </garnt>
<joey> I've ever heard. - Really? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah that was like the hard C, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> That is like actually the most offensive thing you can say </garnt>
<joey> to an Australian. </joey>
<connor> - POV you're a YouTube channel </connor>
<connor> waving goodbye to monetization. </connor>
<connor> So what are we doing today Joey? </connor>
<connor> What's the theme of today's episode? </connor>
<joey> - Well the theme of today's episode </joey>
<joey> is Japanese convenience stores. </joey>
<joey> I didn't just say konbini in the intro </joey>
<joey> for shits and giggles. </joey>
<joey> Like we're going to be talking konbinis </joey>
<garnt> as it's called in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> Because Japan I feel is the only country where </joey>
<joey> the word convenience in the word convenience store </joey>
<joey> actually, you know, means what it means. </joey>
<garnt> - I think there's a lot of places in Asia where </garnt>
<garnt> convenience stores are very convenient </garnt>
<garnt> but definitely as someone who's traveled around, </garnt>
<garnt> Japan's up there. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just built different. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Japan's up there, some of the best convenience stores </garnt>
<garnt> in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> - Absolutely. </garnt>
<connor> - And you've seen all those videos, </connor>
<connor> there's YouTube is with the, you know, Kevin MacLeod </connor>
<connor> or whatever the fuck he's called. </connor>
<connor> Copyright free music playing in the background being like, </connor>
<joey> these are my favorite 10 konbini snacks. </joey>
<joey> That's not what we're doing today. </joey>
<joey> We're going to crack open-- </joey>
<joey> - The konbini halls? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the konbini. </joey>
<joey> We're just going to crack open a bunch of beers, </joey>
<connor> just start eating shit and just saying words. </connor>
<connor> That's how we do it. </connor>
<garnt> - Part of this is we want to represent our team </garnt>
<joey> because I am team 7-11. </joey>
<joey> He is team Lawson. </joey>
<garnt> and he is team Family Mart. - I'm team Family Mart. </garnt>
<joey> - I just think Lawson's is built different. </joey>
<joey> They've just figured it out. </joey>
<joey> Like Family Mart? </joey>
<garnt> Okay honestly like, 7-11 I respect the choice. </garnt>
<garnt> Family Mart? </garnt>
<garnt> You're actually just like, you have zero taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree. </garnt>
<connor> Family Mart is the clown pick right here. </connor>
<garnt> 7-11, we are a global conglomerate. </garnt>
<garnt> We have not just taken over Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> We are fricking everywhere in Asia. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm gonna prove-- </garnt>
<joey> - And that's why they've been tainted </joey>
<joey> by all the other countries. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm going to prove why today 7-11 is the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> convenience store. - Mind you, </garnt>
<joey> there's more than these three convenience stores in Japan. </joey>
<joey> There's like the smaller ones </joey>
<connor> like Mini Stop, Daily Yamazaki. </connor>
<joey> I fuck with Daily Yamazaki. </joey>
<connor> - Do you? </connor>
<connor> Everyone I know. </connor>
<connor> I think I asked Chris, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> do you like Daily Yamazaki? </connor>
<connor> And Chris was like, </connor>
<joey> no that's fucking awful. - Chris is the whitest </joey>
<joey> man alive, what does he know? </joey>
<connor> - He's like me. </connor>
<joey> That's why I can trust his opinion. </joey>
<garnt> - He's like finally, another white man. </garnt>
<joey> - Chris, I need another white British man opinion. </joey>
<garnt> Is this good? </garnt>
<connor> No it's shit. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> - No, whenever I go to like Daily Yamazaki </connor>
<connor> or one of the smaller chains </connor>
<garnt> it's like going to fucking Audi's or Iceland </garnt>
<connor> in the UK. - You never see </connor>
<connor> these convenience stores. </connor>
<connor> Now, if you don't know anything about convenience stores </connor>
<connor> they are pretty much found every 100 meters. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Literally every block of land </joey>
<joey> there's at least one konbini, I find. </joey>
<garnt> - Literally, when you like look into houses to rent, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the selling points is literally </garnt>
<garnt> the meters away from the nearest convenience store. </garnt>
<garnt> When you're looking at listing for houses. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how much they care about convenience. </garnt>
<connor> - If you live in Tokyo, there'll most 100% be </connor>
<joey> like three within your vicinity. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And even when you go rural areas </joey>
<garnt> you're driving around, there'll be nothing. </garnt>
<connor> And then out of the distance-- - Suddenly there's a konbini. </connor>
<garnt> - You'll just see this perfect immaculate 7-11 just there. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's great because it's not like a gas station </garnt>
<joey> where you're like, fuck. </joey>
<joey> God, I gotta go, </joey>
<joey> there's hot dogs that are probably gonna give me salmonella. </joey>
<garnt> I'm probably not gonna like this. </garnt>
<garnt> It's legit good food. </garnt>
<garnt> So we picked a bunch of items today </garnt>
<garnt> that we all kind of liked. </garnt>
<garnt> Or that we could find. </garnt>
<connor> Cause sometimes the item's not available. </connor>
<garnt> - We pick the items that we normally buy </garnt>
<garnt> when we go to our convenience store of choice. </garnt>
<connor> And then we got our intern to buy a lot of other random </connor>
<connor> shit from convenience stores, just to show to you </connor>
<connor> what-- - Go out of our comfort zone </connor>
<connor> a little bit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, going out of our comfort zone </connor>
<garnt> just to show you what is available </garnt>
<garnt> at Japanese konbinis. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah we definitely haven't tried </joey>
<garnt> all the things we're going to talk about today. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's kind of a learning experience. </garnt>
<garnt> Also, if you're an audio only listener </garnt>
<garnt> this is just going to be eating ASMR. </garnt>
<garnt> You should probably </garnt>
<joey> tune into YouTube. - Highly recommend. </joey>
<garnt> This is going to be the closest to the figure episode </garnt>
<joey> that we've released in a while </joey>
<garnt> where if you're an audio only listener, I apologize. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Shall we just kind of jump right into it, gentlemen? </garnt>
<connor> - Sure. </connor>
<connor> - Now I think I know what I want to start off </connor>
<connor> because this is the debate </connor>
<connor> that I think started this episode idea, </connor>
<connor> which is fried chicken. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now, I don't care about how good </garnt>
<garnt> the rest of the konbini food is. </garnt>
<garnt> How I judge konbinis is the fried chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because when I moved to Japan, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> we think that a lot of Americans, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> they would like to stan their fried chicken, </garnt>
<garnt> but a lot of the best fried chicken I've </garnt>
<garnt> had has come from Asia. </garnt>
<garnt> And konbini fried chicken is way too fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> It should be illegal to make fried chicken taste this good. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like restaurant quality fried chicken. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So when you go to the konbini </connor>
<connor> there'll be hot food sections, right, </connor>
<joey> Where you can get various amounts of hot food, </joey>
<joey> but the fried chicken is like the selling point. </joey>
<joey> They'll often have a whole section. </joey>
<joey> - It's like probably the first thing you'll see. </joey>
<joey> - And it normally comes in as, </joey>
<joey> as the gentleman will show you. </joey>
<connor> It comes in this little pouch like this, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it doesn't come in the pouch, </garnt>
<garnt> it's on display on like a heating rack. </garnt>
<garnt> But they put it in a pouch. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they put it in a pouch. </garnt>
<garnt> And what you can do is you just rip off half the pouch, </garnt>
<joey> - Unless you're Lawson and you have to open it from the top </joey>
<joey> like a madman. - I don't mind that. </joey>
<joey> I don't mind squeezing it out. </joey>
<connor> This is the Lawson fried, look at that, look at that man. </connor>
<connor> Is that not? - Family. </connor>
<garnt> - Look. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Convenience store points down, </garnt>
<joey> Because look how convenient it is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> Look at the convenience of this. </garnt>
<joey> - Look at that, look at that. </joey>
<connor> - Where's the fucking seasoning on that? </connor>
<connor> There's nothing on there. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> I'd like to just give a huge disclaimer. </joey>
<joey> I'm personally not a huge fan of this. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I think I'm like one in a million where </joey>
<connor> I almost never buy the fried chicken at convenience stores. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<joey> - Cause I don't really like fried chicken to begin with. </joey>
<connor> - Now this is the standard, </connor>
<connor> just pepper and salt fried chicken. </connor>
<connor> But at Lawson's you can get like </connor>
<connor> a ton of different variations. </connor>
<connor> They have one that is like, it's like a, </connor>
<connor> it's like a Chinese sweet and sour one. </connor>
<connor> And it's like black. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know why it doesn't look good at all, </connor>
<connor> but it's fucking amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> That just, I've never tried it, </garnt>
<connor> but it just looks-- - Chinese sweet and sour, </connor>
<connor> I know, I know. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's a literal black chicken, </connor>
<connor> and it looks like someone, </connor>
<garnt> it's like someone took a chicken </garnt>
<garnt> and just dunked it in squid oil. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it looks like. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I think we should do </garnt>
<joey> is we should cut up three pieces. </joey>
<joey> We should trade pieces. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> We should trade piece. </joey>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> - My hands are greasy. </joey>
<connor> Can we get like napkins galore by the way? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to take the knife </garnt>
<connor> and then I'm going to cut up three pieces. </connor>
<joey> - Do mine as well. </joey>
<joey> Now here's the thing, these chicken right now. </joey>
<joey> They're not going to look at peak condition </joey>
<joey> because we had to microwave these. </joey>
<joey> Normally they're crispy. </joey>
<joey> They're nice and crispy. </joey>
<joey> - They come in piping hot. </joey>
<garnt> - Fresh out the oven. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I just cut two pieces. </garnt>
<joey> So you guys can take and I'll just take this half. </joey>
<garnt> - Fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fan fucking tastic. </garnt>
<connor> - There we go, there's two pieces for you boys. </connor>
<connor> - And also if you're not really into like a whole breast, </connor>
<connor> that's fine, 'cause a lot of them also have like, </connor>
<connor> the like, nuggets, like substitute. </connor>
<connor> Thank you. </connor>
<joey> - All right here you go. </joey>
<joey> I'ma hand these over to you. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, let's give it a shot. </connor>
<connor> - Alright, let's-- </connor>
<joey> - This is like the last supper, but Family Mart edition. </joey>
<joey> - We're not sharing the bread. </joey>
<connor> We're sharing the chicken. </connor>
<connor> - Joey if you will do me the honor. </connor>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Grab one of these. </joey>
<garnt> - Grab one of these. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll try it. </garnt>
<connor> Should we try the Family Mart chicken first? </connor>
<connor> - Let's go bottom up. </connor>
<connor> - Let's start with Family Mart. </connor>
<garnt> - You know what, the crispiness looks good. </garnt>
<garnt> The color looks good. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm down for it. </garnt>
<garnt> That was very wet. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at the grease that's left on my plate. </garnt>
<joey> - There is a lot of grease in there. </joey>
<joey> - Out of all of these, </joey>
<joey> out of all of these, like, </joey>
<garnt> The Family Mart one has almost left a puddle. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - It's just actually like, kinda, I'm gonna eat it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, look. </garnt>
<garnt> You can tell this is Family Mart chicken </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like compared to the Seven chicken, </garnt>
<joey> this one ain't, </joey>
<joey> This one can't be white. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's gonna stain the white one. </joey>
<joey> - It's just going to go straight through. </joey>
<connor> - It's gonna go straight through. </connor>
<garnt> - So I'm gonna... </garnt>
<connor> - It is very fatty and very greasy. </connor>
<joey> I feel like there's no breast. </joey>
<joey> It's not good. </joey>
<joey> - It is, ugh. </joey>
<joey> - Obviously, if you know, I'm in the middle of nowhere, </joey>
<joey> I'm in Hokkaido. </joey>
<joey> I want a beer and a fried chicken. </joey>
<joey> It's going to do the job. </joey>
<connor> But when there's Lawson's and you know, 7-11. </connor>
<connor> - Again, I will happily take this L </connor>
<garnt> because I don't even eat fried chicken to begin with. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, okay. </joey>
<garnt> My problem with Family Mart fried chicken is that </garnt>
<joey> it tastes like death. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You know, sometimes when you're eating and you realized, </garnt>
<garnt> wait a minute, I'm eating a dead animal right now. </garnt>
<connor> That is what Family Mart chicken tastes like. </connor>
<joey> - It feels like they inject it with stuff as well. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like that too, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's try the 7-11 one now, shall we? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Shit, which one's the 7-11 one? </joey>
<garnt> - It'll be this one, this color. </garnt>
<garnt> - The slightly orange one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> - The reason. </garnt>
<garnt> The reason I stan 7-11 and the reason it's my favorite one </garnt>
<garnt> is because of their fried chicken. </garnt>
<joey> - This one's also quite fatty. </joey>
<garnt> - It's fatty enough where it's less </garnt>
<garnt> than the Family Mart chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the perfect amount. </garnt>
<garnt> You know when you... </garnt>
<garnt> You know when you want a beer and you just want to </garnt>
<garnt> eat something unhealthy? </garnt>
<garnt> This is the perfect amount of oil and unhealthiness </garnt>
<garnt> that doesn't make you feel like you're eating death. </garnt>
<garnt> It still makes you feel like you're eating, </garnt>
<garnt> like something that you shouldn't be enjoying every day. </garnt>
<joey> It's a bit of a... </joey>
<joey> - I have to say, I think in terms of the seasoning? </joey>
<garnt> - They seasoned the fuck out of that. </garnt>
<joey> - It's way better than the Family Mart. </joey>
<joey> - I think out of all of them, this, like, </joey>
<connor> with Lawson's they have way more choice </connor>
<connor> in the chicken seasoning. </connor>
<connor> Like there's like the spicy seasoning. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I do this this is gonna be the weakest one </garnt>
<garnt> out of the choices that Lawson's have. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not trying to like, you know, </garnt>
<connor> put myself in a corner, but like, yeah, I'm just saying. </connor>
<garnt> - Like out of everything, </garnt>
<garnt> 7-11 does just, just does the basic fried chicken the best. </garnt>
<connor> Has the best seasoning. - I'll agree. </connor>
<connor> Doesn't need anything fancy, no spicy chicken. </connor>
<connor> It's just pure, here's what fried chicken should taste like, </connor>
<garnt> salt and pepper, seasoned perfectly, </garnt>
<garnt> the right amount of oil. </garnt>
<garnt> It is the best fried chicken. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay let's try this Lawson one, </joey>
<joey> because I've realized immediately that </joey>
<joey> in terms of the thickness of chicken, </joey>
<joey> this is probably the thickest. </joey>
<joey> - The thick one. </joey>
<joey> You're getting good chicken. </joey>
<joey> - That's like a proper amount of chicken. </joey>
<joey> - This is a proper amount of, </joey>
<joey> here's the chicken, and here's the... </joey>
<joey> - That could be a tendie dude, that's so good. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<joey> - It honestly tastes like a tendie as well. </joey>
<connor> - Just the right amount of juicy. </connor>
<joey> - Actually you know what? </joey>
<connor> I think that might be my favorite. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<joey> - It tastes more like a chicken tender than like a breast. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It tastes like, the closest to KFC for some reason. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? - I agree, I agree. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it needs more seasoning. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. This is what I mean, like take that chicken, right? </garnt>
<connor> And then actually put like a fuckton of seasoning on it. </connor>
<garnt> Make it spicy. </garnt>
<connor> That's the best. </connor>
<connor> - Because that's the reason I stan the 7-11 chicken. </connor>
<connor> It is, </connor>
<connor> It is, like I'd say there's less fat </connor>
<connor> than the 7-11 chicken. </connor>
<connor> But the 7-11 chicken just has the best seasoning. </connor>
<joey> And why do we eat fried chicken? </joey>
<joey> It's because of the seasoning. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know. </joey>
<joey> - 11 secret herbs and spices. </joey>
<joey> - Like imagine buying KFC chicken </joey>
<joey> and then all the skin's off. </joey>
<joey> No one would want to eat that shit, let's be honest. </joey>
<garnt> You eat it because of the skin, </garnt>
<garnt> because of the seasoning on the fried chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> So I will go, you know, </garnt>
<joey> I will fight you on this. </joey>
<joey> - So let's rate one two three. </joey>
<joey> I personally would say Lawson, 7-11, Family Mart. </joey>
<connor> - I'd say the same for me personally. </connor>
<garnt> I'm biased obviously, it's mine. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd say-- </connor>
<connor> - I mean you two are a little more biased. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I'd say 7-11, Lawson's, Family Mart right at the bottom. </garnt>
<garnt> - We can all agree that Family Mart's </garnt>
<joey> at the bottom in this case. </joey>
<joey> - As the third opinion in the room, Joey, </joey>
<joey> I suppose you've put it over the edge for Lawson's. </joey>
<joey> - I would have to give a point to Lawson. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I will say though. </connor>
<connor> - The seasoning for 7-11 is good. </connor>
<joey> But I think it's like too much seasoning for me. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> They also do nuggets. </connor>
<connor> Now these are the basic kind </connor>
<garnt> which you'd never catch me finding. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, I don't really care for it. </garnt>
<garnt> I want spice. </garnt>
<garnt> There's like, there's a hot version. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think there's a cheese version. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fuck with the cheese versions. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it's like injected cheese. </connor>
<connor> I don't trust that, cheese should be on top. </connor>
<connor> It should never be injected. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's some things that should be injected. </garnt>
<garnt> Cheese isn't one of them. - Cheese ain't one of them. </garnt>
<connor> - Vaccines, check. </connor>
<connor> - Medicine? </connor>
<garnt> Medicine, check. </garnt>
<garnt> - And these have been microwaved, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we've heated them up. </garnt>
<joey> But yeah, they don't look too great not gonna lie, </joey>
<joey> you guys want to try a nugget? </joey>
<joey> The color on this chicken is kind of tragic looking, </joey>
<garnt> I wanna say. </garnt>
<connor> I did eat one before recording 'cause I was </connor>
<garnt> getting really hungry. - This looks actually, </garnt>
<garnt> this is the most depressing chicken nugget </garnt>
<joey> I've ever seen. - You know what this looks </joey>
<joey> like, this looks like, this is like frozen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah look how yellow this is. </joey>
<joey> - It was once frozen and I just defrosted it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like, it lacks any kind of color </garnt>
<garnt> that makes it look, </garnt>
<connor> that would make it look appealing. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not any good. </garnt>
<connor> They had a slam dunk. </connor>
<connor> - Lawson's, 7-11, Family Mart, </connor>
<joey> and then whatever the fuck I just ate. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, that was worse than the Family Mart chicken. </garnt>
<connor> I said the Family Mart chicken tastes like death. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> That was-- </connor>
<connor> - That tastes right out the freezer. </connor>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - You know what this tastes like? </joey>
<joey> This tastes like-- </joey>
<joey> - Can you show it, put it like, stab it, </joey>
<connor> and share it to the camera? </connor>
<connor> - Look at that. </connor>
<joey> - This for real tastes like-- </joey>
<connor> - The skin is like dying to get off it. </connor>
<joey> - This is like one of those karaages you order </joey>
<joey> at a really, really cheap izakaya. </joey>
<connor> - It's like 50 yen fried chicken. </connor>
<connor> - 50 yen for one, yeah. </connor>
<joey> That ain't it, chief. </joey>
<connor> - Man. The fried, but I mean, honestly, </connor>
<connor> you can't really go wrong unless you go Family Mart. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would say the reason that, I mean we, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> so where we live right now, </garnt>
<garnt> we live right next to a Family Mart </garnt>
<joey> and we live right next to a Lawson's. </joey>
<joey> Unfortunately we don't live next to a 7-11. </joey>
<joey> And that's a shame for me. </joey>
<joey> Cause some of my best food items, like the fried chicken, </joey>
<joey> and like some of the other things </joey>
<garnt> I'm going to show off today is from 7-11. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why like every time you see a 7-11 </joey>
<garnt> it's like an event or it's like (gasps). </garnt>
<garnt> - Definitely. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a random encounter. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, yo, I can get a friend chicken right now? </joey>
<garnt> I'll be right back. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just had lunch but finna grab a fried chicken </garnt>
<garnt> real quick. - Be right back boys. </garnt>
<connor> - They also have a bunch of, it's not just these. </connor>
<connor> They have tons of other hot food items. </connor>
<connor> They have like, it's like a pita bread with like fillings </connor>
<connor> like folded up and then they microwave it. </connor>
<connor> Is that what you have? - Well, and the other one </connor>
<joey> that I have right here, well, no, the one I have here </joey>
<connor> is like a kushi. </connor>
<connor> Like skewered meats. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I have that as well. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So these are like the snack ones. </joey>
<connor> They have like, pseudo-meat. - Again, I don't think I've </connor>
<joey> ever ordered these before, but it looked like that. </joey>
<garnt> - That just looks like a yakiniku. </garnt>
<garnt> I have never ordered. </garnt>
<joey> - This is yakitori. </joey>
<garnt> - Also yeah, yakitori. - Yeah, yakitori. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never ordered this. </connor>
<connor> - I've never ordered this either. </connor>
<connor> Should we get some of that off? </connor>
<connor> - I don't have a yakitori. </connor>
<connor> - You don't? </connor>
<joey> Well you can try some of mine on. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, these don't look like, </joey>
<joey> you look at, you look at these on camera </joey>
<connor> and they don't look any different from each other at all. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't tell which one, the Lawson's... </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Can I grab one of those? </connor>
<connor> - Yakitori is, and I can't tell which one </connor>
<connor> is the Family Mart yakitori. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I've never gotten the yakitori. </connor>
<connor> Which is like skewered, like barbecued skewered meats. </connor>
<garnt> - Just feels like I'm playing with fire. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because these, both of these, </garnt>
<garnt> the color of them. - They look awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - The coloring, just, </garnt>
<garnt> there is no coloring at all. </garnt>
<joey> - Don't go to like any kind of convenience store </joey>
<joey> to get yakitori, there's plenty of amazing </joey>
<joey> yakitori restaurants all over Tokyo. </joey>
<connor> It's so cheap as well. </connor>
<connor> Normally you can buy per skewer. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like, you know, some of the cheaper places </joey>
<joey> are like 30 yen a skewer. </joey>
<connor> - I'll try the Family Mart one first. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. Let's try the Family Mart. </joey>
<connor> - That's awful. </connor>
<garnt> That's so bad. - That is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> That is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think this has to be fresh </garnt>
<connor> because we microwave these. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> This, what this tastes like is, </garnt>
<garnt> they didn't know how to flavor this. </garnt>
<garnt> So they just put as much salt on this as possible. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah this is salted like fucking crazy. </joey>
<garnt> - This is salt and oil. </garnt>
<garnt> What I'm tasting right now is just very salty oil. </garnt>
<joey> - I just stabbed into the Lawson </joey>
<joey> and it like squirted oil. </joey>
<joey> Straight up squirted oil. </joey>
<garnt> - Alright, let me try the... </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's try the Lawson one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me try the Lawson's one. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're just both as bad as each other. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they're not that good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah that's pretty fucking bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bottom line, don't go to a convenience store </garnt>
<garnt> to get yakitori. </garnt>
<joey> Lots of amazing izakayas and restaurants to go to for that. </joey>
<joey> - You alright Garnt? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to, I'm trying to chew this and swallow this. </garnt>
<connor> - I felt like we need a drink to go along </connor>
<connor> with this amazing food. </connor>
<joey> - Ashley, get us a drink! </joey>
<garnt> - [Ashley] Yes sir. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have we talked about Ashley before on this podcast? </garnt>
<joey> - We talked about him </joey>
<garnt> on the live stream. - On the livestream </garnt>
<joey> that we did, but yes. </joey>
<joey> We now have a intern. </joey>
<garnt> We hired our new intern Ashley. </garnt>
<garnt> What he did was he sent a full CV to us. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - What did you get Ashley? </garnt>
<garnt> No! </garnt>
<garnt> No Ashley! </garnt>
<garnt> What, why? </garnt>
<connor> - Do you actually have a beer so I can wash this down? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh no. </garnt>
<joey> - At least he did us a favor and got the mini ones. </joey>
<connor> - Do you wanna explain what this is Joey? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so this is Ozeki's one cup sake. </joey>
<joey> Which is essentially the like trailer trash level of sake </joey>
<joey> that you can get at convenience stores. </joey>
<connor> - Imagine Budweiser </connor>
<connor> trying to make a cheap version of Budweiser. </connor>
<connor> And this is what you would get. </connor>
<garnt> - This is the Blue Lightning of sake, right? </garnt>
<joey> So how much does one of these cost? </joey>
<joey> These cost like a dollar a pop, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like 100 yen, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] 250. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, it's 250 yen. </joey>
<joey> - That's too much for this. </joey>
<joey> - So this costs about $2. </joey>
<garnt> It's literally a jar of sake. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we all know how much I love sake. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - From the episode with Chris. </connor>
<connor> - None of us have tried this, right? </connor>
<connor> - I've never tried </connor>
<garnt> this before. - I've never tried </garnt>
<joey> this either. </joey>
<garnt> So I'm not even a big fan of sake </garnt>
<garnt> in the first place. - I like sake, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's-- - Well actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like wine, right? </garnt>
<joey> Like I need the right food for it. </joey>
<joey> And this is not the right food for it. </joey>
<connor> - If you calculate the price per milliliter. </connor>
<connor> This is actually more expensive </connor>
<joey> than the one Chris brought us, so. </joey>
<joey> - Could that actually? </joey>
<joey> - If it's 250 yen, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, probably. </joey>
<joey> - So Chris you fucking cheap mother. </joey>
<connor> I'm joking, I'm kidding. </connor>
<joey> - Well it doesn't smell horrible. </joey>
<connor> - It's sake, it never smells of anything much. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't smell too bad. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it smells like sake. </garnt>
<garnt> What does bad sake smell like? </garnt>
<joey> - A bad sake will smell sour. </joey>
<joey> Like you'll know. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, why, that's like having milk and being like, </garnt>
<joey> this smells sour. </joey>
<garnt> - Legit, like-- </garnt>
<connor> - Do you wanna give me this shit, </connor>
<connor> do you wanna throw it away? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Legit, like I've had bad sake before and it's sour. </joey>
<connor> It's like sour milk, but like, sake, it's horrible. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<joey> Well I guess we got to try this huh? </joey>
<joey> - So should we all do it at the same time? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Cheers. - Cheers, gentlemen. </joey>
<joey> - To a successful podcast, I hope. </joey>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - All right, let's give it a shot shall we? </connor>
<connor> Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - That's actually not bad. - That's not bad. </connor>
<joey> - That's not bad at all actually. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> I was not. </joey>
<garnt> I was expecting a burn, or a bad after taste. </garnt>
<joey> That's not bad. - You know what? </joey>
<joey> I can't believe I'm saying this. </joey>
<joey> I'm kind of fucking with this. </joey>
<joey> Like it actually tastes all right. </joey>
<joey> - You want mine? </joey>
<connor> You want mine? </connor>
<joey> I don't fuck with that. </joey>
<joey> - This man just cannot drink sake. </joey>
<joey> This is actually, </joey>
<joey> I was expecting it to feel like I'm drinking petrol. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I was expecting as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Damn, Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the cheap alternative </garnt>
<garnt> to like getting pissed in Japan? </garnt>
<joey> - I can see why all these, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> like old people go into, you know, 7-11 or wherever, </joey>
<joey> buy one of these and just chill at the front of the 7-11. </joey>
<garnt> Like I would probably be there as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly this is why we like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is why konbinis are great. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause sometimes you buy something </garnt>
<garnt> and it's way better than you expect to buy </garnt>
<garnt> at a convenience store. </garnt>
<garnt> This sake tastes way too good for something </garnt>
<garnt> that just came out of a 250 yen convenience store sake. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's actually not bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Wow. </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't really taste of much. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I mean, it's easy to drink. </connor>
<garnt> - It's really easy to drink. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause a lot of like cheap sake </garnt>
<joey> usually has like a very harsh </joey>
<joey> flavor. - Honestly it's less, </joey>
<garnt> I think it's less offensive than the one that </garnt>
<connor> Chris brought the other day. </connor>
<connor> - This actually tastes better than what Chris brought. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah yeah. </connor>
<joey> So Chris fucked us over, thanks Chris. </joey>
<joey> - I'm still gonna to my beer. </joey>
<connor> - That's what I'm saying, </connor>
<connor> it's the milliliter up to price ratio. </connor>
<garnt> But go on, you have two more hot food items, </garnt>
<connor> what the fuck are they? </connor>
<connor> - I do, I do, I don't know what Ashley has bought me. </connor>
<connor> But let's let's have a look. </connor>
<joey> Okay so the first one looks like a koroke. </joey>
<joey> - What the? </joey>
<joey> A potato? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so what a koroke is </joey>
<garnt> is kind of just like a potato katsu, right? </garnt>
<joey> That's the way I would describe it. </joey>
<garnt> So sometimes, oh, that is, </garnt>
<joey> that is very oily. - That's an oily boy! </joey>
<garnt> - That is a very oily boy. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at that. </garnt>
<joey> - Do we have more plates? </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is literally, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're going to get the desk all oily. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look how, that is literally see-through. </garnt>
<joey> That is, that is a see through. </joey>
<joey> - That is like the Simpsons episode </joey>
<joey> with like Dr. Nick. </joey>
<joey> - This is the Simpsons episode right here. </joey>
<connor> So what this is, I don't know what kind </connor>
<connor> of koroke this is. - You sure you wanna </connor>
<connor> crack that open on the table? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it's all right. </connor>
<connor> Let's do it. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> It's not a koroke. </joey>
<joey> What is this? - Oh it's mince katsu. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so it's not a koroke, it's katsu. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like minced meat katsu, basically. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, I've never had this before. </garnt>
<garnt> - So essentially, you know what this is? </garnt>
<garnt> This is literally a deep fried hamburger. </garnt>
<garnt> This is what this is. </garnt>
<garnt> This is literally what this is, </garnt>
<joey> it's a deep fried hamburger. </joey>
<joey> This is, look at that. </joey>
<garnt> This is basically a hamburger, this is horrible. </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't smell bad. </connor>
<garnt> You know what it smells like? </garnt>
<garnt> It reminds me of like pies in the UK. </garnt>
<joey> - It does. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, a little bit. </connor>
<connor> It's like a mince pie. </connor>
<connor> - It has a very pie smell. </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if you can see this on camera </garnt>
<garnt> but the oil has seeped. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> - The oil has seeped through to the table. </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't really taste of anything. </connor>
<connor> Like meat and grease. </connor>
<garnt> That's all I taste. </garnt>
<garnt> There's like no seasoning. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> This tastes like, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Actually you don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> How do you eat something </garnt>
<garnt> and just have zero opinion about the taste? </garnt>
<garnt> - This tastes alright. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it tastes like nothing. </connor>
<garnt> - This literally tastes like cardboard. </garnt>
<garnt> Because there's no taste in it at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you'd expect the burger </garnt>
<garnt> to have some kind of seasoning on it. </garnt>
<garnt> This tastes like batter. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Granted I've had really good mince katsu </joey>
<connor> and this is definitely - That's weak sauce. </connor>
<connor> - weak sauce compared to what I have. </connor>
<connor> - What else did you get, Garnt? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<connor> Do you wanna see this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, sure. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a spring roll. </garnt>
<connor> - You haven't all gotten a spring roll from that? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, oh, look at that. </joey>
<connor> - Look at that. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] That just looks sad. </garnt>
<joey> - Look at that. </joey>
<garnt> I do not stan this. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at that. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to cut this up. </garnt>
<joey> You know what this is? </joey>
<joey> - You know it's not good when you're cutting a spring roll </joey>
<joey> and it turns flat. </joey>
<joey> It's a soggy spring roll right? </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> Oh. </joey>
<joey> - I don't like spring rolls in general. </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't like spring rolls. </garnt>
<garnt> They're way too oily for me. </garnt>
<joey> - That's not bad. </joey>
<joey> - Actually that's not bad at all. </joey>
<joey> - Is it? </joey>
<connor> How's it taste? </connor>
<connor> How does it taste? </connor>
<connor> - It's quite fatty somehow. </connor>
<joey> Like oily. - It is very fatty. </joey>
<joey> You know what? </joey>
<joey> It tastes like a dim sum. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> A little bit. </joey>
<garnt> It's like the kind of oilyness. </garnt>
<joey> - Like a really bad one. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it's like an oiliness of a dim sum. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I can see that actually. </joey>
<connor> - You know when you, 'cause in the UK we have these like </connor>
<garnt> party platter things that you get from Iceland. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what it looks like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So you thought you were just gonna get a bite </garnt>
<garnt> of just pure like, just pastry. </garnt>
<garnt> Was it pastry, is that what it is? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think it's pastry. </garnt>
<connor> - Pastry, and then just, maybe like a crumb of meat. </connor>
<garnt> And like that's normally how it is. </garnt>
<joey> That's why I hate spring rolls, but that? </joey>
<joey> - That one was packed. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, I'd get that. </garnt>
<connor> - I would actually get that, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I did not expect it to taste that good. </garnt>
<connor> It tastes like, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Like you said, like a mini dim sum, </garnt>
<garnt> but in a spring roll pastry. </garnt>
<connor> Wow. </connor>
<connor> That was not the taste I was expecting. </connor>
<garnt> - That's points for 7-11. - I thought they would somehow </garnt>
<connor> make this one work and fuck up the spring roll. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - It was the opposite way around. </joey>
<joey> - You surprise us. </joey>
<joey> - But there's tons of stuff that we don't have here, </joey>
<joey> the hot foods. </joey>
<joey> Like they change all the time. </joey>
<joey> Like for example, Lawson's has like hot dogs </joey>
<connor> that have like different toppings, like salsa. </connor>
<joey> There's like meat. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, let's not forget it as well, </joey>
<joey> about like the nikkumans and the pizzamans </joey>
<garnt> and stuff like that. </garnt>
<joey> I think all of the convenience stores have those. </joey>
<joey> - Nikkuman, what's it called, just like a steamed bun? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a steamed meat bun, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So you can get like the Chinese steamed meat buns. </joey>
<garnt> - See them in all the animes. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, like all of the meat buns </joey>
<joey> in all three of the konbinis are lit. </joey>
<connor> - And they taste really good. </connor>
<garnt> They taste way too good. - They taste really good. </garnt>
<garnt> - And those are really good. </garnt>
<joey> I'd fuck with the hot dogs, </joey>
<joey> hot dogs are pretty fucking good. </joey>
<joey> - What are they called, the goo dogs? </joey>
<joey> - Goo dogs they're called. </joey>
<joey> And at one point, okay. </joey>
<joey> So they also go through at all the chains. </joey>
<joey> They all go through seasonal items. </joey>
<connor> One point they had like, mini burritos. </connor>
<joey> - Mini burritos? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like microwaveable burritos that were like </connor>
<joey> the size of that spring roll. - Like proper, </joey>
<connor> like proper burritos? </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - If there's one food item that I think </garnt>
<connor> is really hard to get in Japan or one </connor>
<connor> food cuisine, Mexican food. - Mexican food, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's so hard to get good Mexican food in Japan. </connor>
<connor> You can get any other, any other food, I feel like I've had, </connor>
<garnt> I've gone to a restaurant and I've been like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> this is almost as good. </garnt>
<joey> - The only way you can get Mexican food is to go to like </joey>
<joey> international chains that just happen to be here right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And even then, like, we've been to some Mexican restaurants. </garnt>
<connor> - On my plate so we can get rid of this shit. </connor>
<garnt> - We've been to some Mexican restaurants </garnt>
<joey> and I've always felt underwhelmed. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's always, it's always felt like the Mexican-- </joey>
<joey> - But it's sad because that's the best you're gonna get. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> We need more good Mexican in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm putting that out there right now because Mexican, </garnt>
<garnt> Mexican food fucking slaps. </garnt>
<connor> - I get really sad 'cause I watch on like YouTube, </connor>
<connor> I watch like, there's like, </connor>
<connor> Food Insider or whatever the fuck they're called, </connor>
<garnt> like videos, like, the 10 best burritos in LA. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like, Oh my God, all of them look fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, no. </joey>
<joey> I mean, there's, there's other food items </joey>
<joey> as well that are hot. </joey>
<joey> Like you can get actual, like full meals. </joey>
<joey> You can get instant ramen, </joey>
<joey> which is like, it's like a solid, like frozen broth? </joey>
<joey> I'm not really sure. </joey>
<joey> It's a block. - It's like freeze dried. </joey>
<joey> - It's a freeze dried block, and it basically, </joey>
<joey> when you microwave it, that it melts and makes a broth. </joey>
<joey> That's actually like better than most of the shit </joey>
<joey> you'll get ever in like America. </joey>
<joey> - Oh hands down, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, even like some restaurants I've been to, </joey>
<joey> they say ramen. And it was like definitely not ramen. </joey>
<connor> - Not ramen, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's actually not bad. </garnt>
<garnt> There's also, you can get, </garnt>
<garnt> I think Garnt has one of them with us. </garnt>
<connor> So there's a bunch of variations. </connor>
<connor> Lawson's does a ton of like, </connor>
<connor> I mean there's pastas as well. </connor>
<connor> I remember as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah the pastas are lit. </joey>
<connor> - Pastas are, weird combinations of pastas as well. </connor>
<connor> Like stuff that like you would never see </connor>
<joey> ever in Europe. </joey>
<joey> - Very Japanese twist on Italian food. </joey>
<connor> What's a weird combination they have? </connor>
<connor> They'll have like, </connor>
<connor> fucking like egg and tomato sauce or something. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - They put hot dogs in their pasta, </connor>
<joey> some pastas as well. - Yes, they put hot dogs. </joey>
<garnt> - Sausages in their pasta. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, sausages, tomato sauce and spaghetti, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Alright. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some of the pastas literally look like a kid's meal. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's true, it's true. </garnt>
<garnt> They look like the dairy meal lunch pack, </garnt>
<garnt> Lunchables or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> You know when you're a kid </garnt>
<garnt> and you kind of make your own like, </garnt>
<garnt> sandwich out of the Lunchables. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like the equivalent of putting into Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> sorry, Italian cuisine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Lawson's has like a premium hot food section, which is, </connor>
<connor> doesn't include any that pasta shit. </connor>
<connor> It's only Japanese and normally fried food. </connor>
<joey> But there is gyudon, and, pudon? </joey>
<joey> - Gyudon. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know what gyudon is? </joey>
<joey> - Butadon? </joey>
<joey> - Butadon, butadon, that's what it is, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Butadon and gyudon. </joey>
<joey> Which is like, gyudon is just like, </joey>
<connor> I guess strips of beef and then grilled </connor>
<connor> and then put with rice and you normally get like a sauce </connor>
<connor> or a mayo to dip it in and put it in the rice. </connor>
<connor> And then butadon which is my favorite, is just pork. </connor>
<joey> Like strips of pork. </joey>
<joey> - Pork on, </joey>
<connor> just pork on some rice. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a pork bowl or a beef bowl, </garnt>
<garnt> we're about to show you. </garnt>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's! </joey>

<joey> - They give us both quality and fair price? </joey>
<garnt> - I thought that was illegal. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought that was illegal as well. </joey>
<connor> - Now I will have to ask boys when you got your first </connor>
<connor> Harry's razor set and shaved with it. </connor>
<connor> What surprised you most about the quality of the products? </connor>
<joey> - Well, for one, it comes in a lovely cardboard box. </joey>
<garnt> And look look at the packaging on this. </garnt>
<joey> - This looks clean as fuck, look at that. </joey>
<joey> - Goddamn. </joey>
<joey> - What do you go got there in your hand? </joey>
<joey> - I have here the body wash which Meilyne literally said </joey>
<garnt> earlier, and I quote, "if you're lonely, </garnt>
<garnt> "you can know what a boyfriend smells like." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean they're literally giving life to dreams. </garnt>

<garnt> - [Connor] Harry believes in quality so much </garnt>
<garnt> that they bought their own factory in Germany </garnt>
<garnt> so they could own every step of the manufacturing process. </garnt>
<joey> - Now that's an epic gamer move. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's German. </garnt>
<connor> So, you know, they're getting shit done! </connor>
<connor> - But I'm sitting here and I'm wondering, </connor>
<connor> how do they do it, Garnt? </connor>

<connor> with five sharp blades. </connor>

<garnt> and manufacture their blades </garnt>
<garnt> in their world-class blade factory. </garnt>

<connor> Go to harrys.com/trashtaste to redeem your offer. </connor>
<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, so as the gyudon that Connor was talking about, </garnt>
<joey> I have some 7-11 gyudon right here. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't look appetizing. </joey>
<joey> - I have also never seen that before. </joey>
<joey> - Have you never seen it before? </joey>
<connor> Honestly it fucking slaps. </connor>
<connor> It tastes great. </connor>
<connor> - Show it vertically to the camera. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. I can't show it vertically. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's got, it's got sauces in it, but look. </connor>
<connor> What happens is that it comes, </connor>
<connor> it comes with two compartments, right? </connor>
<connor> Okay. There we go. </connor>
<connor> I just hope </connor>
<connor> none of the sauce falls out. - Oh, there's juices! </connor>
<connor> The juices! </connor>
<connor> - There's a lot of juices in here. </connor>
<connor> So what happens is it's basically just grilled, </connor>
<connor> like what is it? </connor>
<garnt> Grilled beef, beef strips in whatever juices </garnt>
<garnt> they cook it in. </garnt>
<garnt> And it comes with two compartments. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah, that is, that is hot! </garnt>
<connor> - Comes with a rice compartment. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a common mistake that people make. </garnt>
<garnt> - Comes with a rice compartment. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or you could just dump it all on, </garnt>
<garnt> or you can just take a piece at a time. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> You got two compartments. </connor>
<joey> You can eat it however you like. </joey>
<joey> I like to dump it on. - I'll give a shot. </joey>
<joey> - The reason, the reason why they split it up </joey>
<joey> is so that-- - Can we put some spices </joey>
<garnt> on this bitch as well, kind of just some, </garnt>
<connor> some like heat mix? </connor>
<garnt> - - This is just an excuse </garnt>
<garnt> for us to film eating our dinners right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Not gonna lie, </garnt>
<connor> you can tell this is like super cheap </connor>
<connor> because like it's, this beef is half just fat. </connor>
<connor> Look at that. </connor>
<connor> Like that is... </connor>
<joey> - You know the reason though, why they split it off </joey>
<garnt> into two layers? - That's the good part. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the good part. - Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know the reason why they split it up </garnt>
<garnt> into two layers though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why? - It's so that the rice </garnt>
<connor> doesn't sog up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, obviously. </garnt>
<connor> You wouldn't want the rice being soggy Joey, come on. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, if you come to Japan, try the beef bowls. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the beef bowls are by far my favorite like, </garnt>
<garnt> 7-11 or whatever konbini you decide. </garnt>
<joey> - Or you could go to the top three beef bowl chains. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, </connor>
<joey> or you could just go outside. </joey>
<garnt> There'll probably be a Matsuya Sukiya, </garnt>
<connor> or Yoshinoya right outside. - Or Yoshinoya. </connor>
<connor> - Look at that. </connor>
<connor> It's my favorite cheap Japanese dish. </connor>
<connor> - Yo, throw some of that on my plate, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - So do you get this often? </connor>
<joey> - I get this whenever like I'm traveling and I just, </joey>
<garnt> you can never go wrong with beef bowls. </garnt>
<connor> - If I have to get a meal, in Lawson's right, </connor>
<connor> they basically like a katsu-don </connor>
<connor> and they have like a, it's really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> Really clean katsu-don with just rice, </connor>
<connor> It's just like, perfect. </connor>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<garnt> And they give you all like a fuckton as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So good. </garnt>
<connor> Fuck, Garnt, you really piled that on there, eh? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, I just... </garnt>
<connor> - You do like gyudon. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm more of a butadon. </garnt>
<garnt> - You will be the final judge of this because you love </garnt>
<connor> your beef bowls, you love your gyudons. </connor>
<connor> - I probably eat by far the most beef bowls. </connor>
<joey> - Out of the three of us. </joey>
<joey> - Gotta get the right ratio. </joey>
<garnt> I do actually like mayo with mine. </garnt>
<garnt> - You like mayo with your beef bowls? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause some of the chains will give you mayo, </garnt>
<garnt> and sometimes it's so nice to have mayo with it, </garnt>
<garnt> I know there's some people who think that's disgusting </garnt>
<connor> but you really like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause sometimes all you're getting </connor>
<connor> is just grease, grease, grease. </connor>
<connor> and Mayo helps like... </connor>
<joey> - I always get mine with Mayo. </joey>
<connor> - I mean I like the fat. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah but sometimes you need to like </joey>
<joey> mellow it out a little bit, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but this man doesn't like condiments, </joey>
<joey> so there's no use talking to him. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow, that's not bad actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's good right? </garnt>
<garnt> - And how much is this? </garnt>
<garnt> - This is 400 yen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Four bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is literally, yeah, this is about four bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> And you can get an entire meal. </garnt>
<connor> And it fucking slaps. </connor>
<connor> - For like a one off, it was pretty fucking good. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, if you're desperate and you want a good meal, </garnt>
<connor> that's actually not bad. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty surprised </connor>
<joey> about how good that is. - If the gyudon man says so, </joey>
<joey> then it must be good. </joey>
<joey> - Obviously, you know, if you go to Matsuya, Yoshinoya, </joey>
<connor> or wherever, they literally cook it in front of you, </connor>
<connor> like, from fresh. </connor>
<garnt> - This is like. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is not bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you're out and about, and you just want a quick meal, </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, can't, there's no Matsuya, </garnt>
<garnt> or there's no like chain around you. </garnt>
<garnt> Look he's going on for seconds, </garnt>
<garnt> that's how good it is. </garnt>
<joey> - That's that says more than anything. </joey>
<connor> - A little fatty. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, it was pretty actually, yeah, I'd eat this. </connor>
<joey> - Would it be good for, with some mayonnaise on it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Bit of mayonnaise. </joey>
<joey> That's not bad though. </joey>
<joey> - There you go. </joey>
<joey> Points to 7-11 for that one, I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah so there is tons of other hot food </joey>
<joey> that we couldn't get. </joey>
<connor> And also we just don't wanna waste all of it. </connor>
<connor> We don't want to throw away too much food. </connor>
<joey> - The staff is eating all of it, don't worry. </joey>
<connor> So yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's most of the hot food </connor>
<joey> that we to talk about today. </joey>
<connor> And the rest is just a bunch of snacks. </connor>
<joey> - If there's one thing that all three </joey>
<joey> convenience stores have it's snacks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> They have way more snacks than they do hot food, </connor>
<connor> I think so. - Oh way, way more. </connor>
<garnt> - Alright, so before we move on, before we move on </garnt>
<garnt> from the hot foods. </garnt>
<garnt> So how long do you guys feel </garnt>
<garnt> like you can survive on convenience store food </garnt>
<garnt> before you start to get bored of it? </garnt>
<joey> Well, I actually tried that out once when I... </joey>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it was the only option I had. </garnt>
<garnt> So basically when I was-- </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean it was the only option you had? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, let me explain. </joey>
<joey> When I was working, I was like 16 </joey>
<garnt> and I was working at the ski fields in Hokkaido, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in the middle of fucking nowhere in Hokkaido. </garnt>
<garnt> Like in the mountains. </garnt>
<garnt> The only thing they had, I'm 16 as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So I can't drive to the next-- </garnt>
<garnt> - And you can't afford a fancy meal every time. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't afford fancy. </joey>
<joey> So basically I'm living day by day </joey>
<garnt> with what they're paying me, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And also because it's snowing fucking 24/7 there, right? </garnt>
<connor> Without a car you're basically fucked. </connor>
<connor> Like you can't walk into a snow storm </connor>
<joey> to like go to the next town. </joey>
<connor> - Not even your financial advisor could save you. </connor>
<joey> - Not even my financial advisor could save me. </joey>
<joey> But so the only thing they had around where I was staying </joey>
<joey> was a Family Mart. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that's why you're a Family Mart stan. </garnt>
<joey> - So I literally, throughout that entire month. </joey>
<garnt> I would want to say minimum two meals a day </garnt>
<garnt> everyday for a month was Family Mart. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I felt like I wanted to die by the end of it. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> There's only so much. </garnt>
<garnt> Like first week, you're just like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to try that bento, I'm going to try that bento. </garnt>
<joey> Basically. I like, </joey>
<joey> I like fully completed the Pokedex </joey>
<joey> of like, Family Mart food, right? </joey>
<connor> I was like, yeah, I tried everything. </connor>
<connor> And once I did finish everything, I was like, </connor>
<joey> I highly regret that I did that </joey>
<joey> 'cause I feel so fucking unhealthy right now. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing is when you come, </garnt>
<garnt> when you come to Japan for the first time </garnt>
<garnt> and you see how, just how much choice of meals there are </garnt>
<connor> in every convenience store. </connor>
<connor> Especially for me coming from England where </connor>
<connor> the only choice I have is the Tesco's meal deal. </connor>
<connor> - Hey, come on. </connor>
<garnt> Don't talk ill of like </garnt>
<garnt> the best thing that we have about our country. </garnt>
<garnt> - But in terms of like, </garnt>
<garnt> let's say packageable lunches or meals </garnt>
<garnt> that you can get away with. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lunchables? </garnt>
<garnt> - Not even Lunchables. </garnt>
<joey> - That's all I think of. </joey>
<garnt> - Pastries? </garnt>
<garnt> That's kind of about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - You got sandwiches, you got... </garnt>
<connor> - I think we all have, the problem with the UK stuff </connor>
<connor> that you can like kind of take quickly. </connor>
<connor> It's all within like the same genre of food. </connor>
<connor> There's no variety. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And the thing is only say, only like </connor>
<joey> the big super mega stores have the hot food. </joey>
<joey> Like the fresh chickens. </joey>
<joey> - The hot food is good, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you go to like, Sainsbury's, </joey>
<joey> it's the big Sainsbury's </joey>
<garnt> and they have like the hot rotisserie chickens. </garnt>
<garnt> Those actually slapped. </garnt>
<connor> - Tesco's have like the sausage. </connor>
<connor> The like foot-long sausage that you can eat. </connor>
<garnt> Fucking amazing. </garnt>
<connor> So good. </connor>
<garnt> - But those are limited to like </garnt>
<garnt> the really, really big stores. </garnt>
<garnt> So the good thing about convenience stores </garnt>
<garnt> is that all this, </garnt>
<garnt> like everything you see is basically homogenous </garnt>
<garnt> throughout basically every convenience store you can find. </garnt>
<connor> There are some that are bigger </connor>
<garnt> that have even more choice of what you can buy </garnt>
<garnt> but we are showcasing stuff that you can buy in </garnt>
<garnt> basically every convenience store you can get in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - I do think when you, after living here, </connor>
<garnt> it's sort of like, you view convenience food </garnt>
<garnt> almost like McDonald's in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it starts to have like a, almost McDonald's </garnt>
<connor> characteristic to the taste at how, you know it's not like, </connor>
<connor> it's not all fresh. </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't all taste quite like, </garnt>
<joey> something's been a little too </joey>
<joey> like, manufactured. - It's not as healthy </joey>
<joey> as they package it out to be. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> I mean there were definitely some healthy things. </joey>
<joey> Like there's some decent salads, </joey>
<joey> there's some stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> And like, I mean, after the gym, I think we always, </connor>
<connor> we always just get like, there's just chicken breasts. </connor>
<connor> - Salad chicken, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So they have literal-- </garnt>
<connor> - You have one of them, right? </connor>
<connor> One of you has one of them. - Do I have a chicken breast? </connor>
<connor> - I think Joey might have one. </connor>
<connor> - Did you buy a chicken breast? </connor>
<garnt> - No, the only thing I have is this sausage. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - That's just a sausage. </joey>
<joey> - Just, it's from Johnsonville. </joey>
<connor> Amazing name for a sausage. - I think that's </connor>
<joey> an American brand, is it? - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - And you can just rip it open </joey>
<connor> and just start eating it, right? </connor>
<joey> It's just one sausage. </joey>
<joey> What I do have, it's not a chicken breast. </joey>
<connor> - That's it. </connor>
<connor> Something similar like that. </connor>
<connor> but they literally have a, this is this. </connor>
<connor> This is a salad chicken bar. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what a salad chicken bar is. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] What the fuck is that? </connor>
<connor> - It's like a salad in a bar with chicken. </connor>
<connor> - No, what? </connor>
<garnt> What is that shape? </garnt>
<joey> No chicken has ever been in that shape. </joey>
<joey> What is that? </joey>
<joey> - It's like a chicken sausage almost. </joey>
<joey> - So normally the ones that I get, </joey>
<garnt> and they also have them at Family Mart and Lawson's, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why they wouldn't have them at 7-11. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a salad chicken nugget. </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine literally a chicken breast seasoned. </garnt>
<joey> I think the one that I always go for is tandoori flavored. </joey>
<joey> - The tandoori one slaps. </joey>
<joey> - Chicken tandoori. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally just a chicken breast </joey>
<connor> just in a vacuum sealed package that has just </connor>
<connor> been cooked and you just eat. - Yeah, the vacuum seal, </connor>
<connor> vacuum seal package like this. </connor>
<garnt> - Crack that bad boy open at like 3:00 AM </garnt>
<connor> and it's like, really good. </connor>
<joey> - You go for a workout, right? </joey>
<joey> You know, you want to get some protein. </joey>
<joey> What's the best source of protein? </joey>
<connor> Just eat a fucking whole chicken breast. </connor>
<connor> 20 grams of protein. </connor>
<connor> Boom, you're talking. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause normally like, it makes it so convenient </garnt>
<garnt> because no matter what mood or no matter </garnt>
<garnt> what kind of food you want, </garnt>
<garnt> they probably have it at your convenience store. </garnt>
<garnt> If you want something healthy, you can... </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh god, that looks awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - This.. </garnt>
<connor> - That looks, oh, show the gloss to the cameras. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. (Joey cackling) </joey>
<garnt> Look at that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yo, give me a bite of that. </garnt>
<connor> Here, let's cut that up. </connor>
<garnt> - This is glossier than some nails. </garnt>
<connor> Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - That looks vile. </connor>
<connor> - Let me try that, let me try that. </connor>
<garnt> - Where's the knife? </garnt>
<garnt> Ashley, get us a knife. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay, go ahead. </connor>
<joey> - Just gimme one of those. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yay, okay. </connor>
<joey> - Oh this feels. </joey>
<joey> You know what this, it feels plastic. </joey>
<connor> - I'll try it, but I'm not going to like it. </connor>
<garnt> - This looks like a hot dog with extra peppers on it. </garnt>
<connor> Honestly. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God it tastes like a chicken hot dog. </connor>
<connor> That's fucking weird. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, that's just a chicken hot dog. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if you were supposed </connor>
<joey> to take the skin off of those though. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a chicken hot dog. </garnt>
<connor> I like how they call it a salad chicken </connor>
<garnt> when it's just a chicken hot dog. </garnt>
<joey> - Well Japan's not going to know what </joey>
<joey> a chicken hot dog is probably. </joey>
<garnt> - That's fucking awful. </garnt>
<joey> - Do you know what they call corn dogs here? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, America dogs. </joey>
<connor> - America dogs. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, honestly, that's a pretty fucking good name. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's a pretty accurate name. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, what are the hot dogs that they eat in America? </joey>
<joey> Corn dogs. </joey>
<connor> - Alright, gentlemen. </connor>
<connor> We all have sandwiches from our respective stores. </connor>
<connor> And I want to know which sandwich is your go to? </connor>
<joey> - For me it's always this one. </joey>
<joey> Tuna and tamago. </joey>
<connor> - Oh fuck my bag got crushed. </connor>
<connor> But, honestly I'm not making this look appetizing. </connor>
<connor> but same Joey! </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! </connor>
<connor> - You'll notice though, </connor>
<connor> the difference between the Family Mart </connor>
<connor> and the Lawson sandwiches with the, </connor>
<connor> especially with the egg. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> The egg, in Family Mart, </connor>
<connor> it kind of like. - They actually use </connor>
<connor> sliced eggs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah they slice the eggs, </connor>
<connor> whereas Lawson is just fully scrambled. </connor>
<connor> - And honestly, yeah, this shit slaps. </connor>
<connor> This shit is insane. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly both of them slap, I feel. </joey>
<joey> And what the fuck does Garnt have? </joey>
<garnt> - They didn't have the sandwiches I asked for, </garnt>
<garnt> which is just a katsu sando. </garnt>
<garnt> So a katsu sando is literally just like a pork katsu. </garnt>
<garnt> Just with some bread slapped on the side </garnt>
<garnt> and some katsu sauce. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck is, </garnt>
<connor> see, I've always seen. </connor>
<connor> So show it to the camera. </connor>
<connor> So I'm always seeing this, right? </connor>
<connor> You should put it in frame with us so that it's in frame. </connor>
<joey> - It's literally like a strawberry shortcake </joey>
<joey> turned into a sandwich. </joey>
<connor> - That looks awful. </connor>
<connor> Can you crack that open? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I've always seen those </joey>
<joey> because they sell those at Family Mart too. </joey>
<connor> I've never tried them. </connor>
<connor> Also the genius, Japanese packaging, you just, </connor>
<joey> there's a little slip that you pull open and boom. </joey>
<joey> It's ready to go. </joey>
<joey> Everything convenient. - And it folds outward </joey>
<connor> like that, isn't that amazing? </connor>
<joey> That's just beautiful. </joey>
<joey> - That is Japanese engineering to the finest level. </joey>
<connor> - And boom, you've got a little picnic for your sandwiches. </connor>
<garnt> - How do you feel about the lack of crust, boys? </garnt>
<connor> - Disgusting. - Not gonna lie, </connor>
<garnt> it's disappointing. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean look at this, right? </garnt>
<connor> Like there's something missing. </connor>
<connor> It's the bite of the crust. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I agree. - It's beautiful. </joey>
<joey> - I agree. - It's beautiful. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you guys give a shit if I rip some off </garnt>
<garnt> and hand it to you? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, just you. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you try that egg on, that's the real egg. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the best, look at the color. </garnt>
<connor> Look at the fucking bright, </connor>
<connor> the saturation has been pumped to 10,000 on that. </connor>
<joey> You know that shit's </joey>
<connor> gonna taste good. - This one's got </connor>
<joey> some slices in it. </joey>
<connor> - I've had this one. </connor>
<connor> Oh, that that feels like a weak bread. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - They're all weak breads, what are you talking about? </joey>
<joey> - Oh god it's been dunked in the grease. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how to properly share this. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Oh it's cross contaminated. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no! </joey>
<connor> - Which tamago are we trying first? </connor>
<joey> - Let's try the Family Mart one first. </joey>
<garnt> - So the, </garnt>
<joey> it's the one with the slices on it. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly like what I love about Japanese eggs </garnt>
<garnt> is that they just have the color in them. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Every Japanese egg just is like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like they took the egg, the egg yolk, </garnt>
<garnt> put it in Photoshop and turned up the saturation. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks beautiful. </garnt>
<joey> - It is like way too yellow for it to be real. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I like the egg. </joey>
<connor> The problem I have with this sandwich, sorry. </connor>
<connor> I'm eating with my mouth. </connor>
<connor> Is the tuna tastes like shit. </connor>
<connor> - You think so? </connor>
<connor> - On this sandwich, I think so. </connor>
<joey> - I think the tuna tastes the same. </joey>
<connor> - No, you'll see what I mean, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I really liked the egg. </garnt>
<garnt> I like the egg to be solid. </garnt>
<joey> - I love the egg slices. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I do like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right let's try the Lawson egg sandwich then. </garnt>
<joey> So this one is no egg slices is just fully mashed. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> What I don't like about this one and why </garnt>
<connor> I've never bought this one is because this egg </connor>
<connor> looks like runny yolk. </connor>
<connor> - No honestly, it's good try it. </connor>
<garnt> - It looks like shit the that comes out of your nose, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like runny egg yolk. </garnt>
<joey> - Definitely a lot more of like a mayonnaise flavor in this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - No I prefer, </garnt>
<garnt> I prefer to chew on my eggs and I feel it. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I'll give you that one. </garnt>
<connor> That like, there is something about knowing </connor>
<connor> there's like an egg slice in that </connor>
<connor> that's way more comforting. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to try and fucking dissect this. </joey>
<joey> This isn't working. </joey>
<connor> This isn't working. </connor>
<garnt> - Sandwiches were just not meant to be shared. </garnt>
<joey> Let's be honest. </joey>
<connor> I'm just going to rip it off. </connor>
<joey> Sorry. </joey>
<joey> - Here you go Joey. </joey>
<connor> - Shit. </connor>
<joey> - Shit. </joey>
<joey> - Try some real fucking tuna tasting sandwich action. </joey>
<connor> Give me some of that sandwich. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, like when it comes to the tuna, </joey>
<joey> it all tastes the same. </joey>
<garnt> - No I disagree. - What I want to mention </garnt>
<garnt> though is that all the breading </garnt>
<garnt> for all the sandwiches in Japan, it's so fluffy. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so light and fluffy. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why it's some of my favorite breads, I think. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my god I just realized we're breaking bread guys. </joey>
<joey> Like true comrades. </joey>
<joey> - Which one are we eating first? </joey>
<joey> - I'm the Family Mart one. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - What's the difference? </joey>
<joey> - Again, there is no difference. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, I can spot which one. </connor>
<connor> That one's Lawson's. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - No that's Lawson's. </joey>
<joey> - I can tell the difference </joey>
<joey> Oh no actually (stammering). </joey>
<garnt> - I'ma call sus on this one. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> No, no, the bread. </garnt>
<connor> The bread's different. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - The bread hit different. </garnt>
<joey> - No listen, listen, try it, </joey>
<joey> you'll know what I, </joey>
<joey> shit, I should put that on the table. </joey>
<joey> You'll know what I mean. </joey>
<connor> You'll know what I mean. - Honestly, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> Like you're you're the mediator in this one. </joey>
<connor> Have both of those </connor>
<connor> and tell me if there's a fucking difference. </connor>
<connor> - They taste different. </connor>
<joey> - Like the Family Mart one. </joey>
<joey> It's great. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, it's got a weird tinge to it. </connor>
<joey> - Let's try the Lawson one. </joey>
<joey> - Okay so this one's the Lawson one, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, let me try both. </garnt>
<joey> - It tastes the fucking same, </joey>
<garnt> oh actually hold on. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, see? </joey>
<joey> See what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - Lawson one's better. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, okay, I agree. - Right? </joey>
<joey> - The Lawson one actually tastes like tuna. </joey>
<connor> - It's so clean. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is, man. </connor>
<connor> The Lawson tuna sandwich? </connor>
<garnt> It's amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Like the initial taste. </connor>
<connor> I bit into both. </connor>
<garnt> And the initial taste was just like, hmm, okay. </garnt>
<joey> They both taste the same. </joey>
<joey> And then the aftertaste from the Lawson's tuna, </joey>
<joey> you actually get a taste </joey>
<joey> of tuna. - It tastes like fish. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it tastes like fish. </garnt>
<joey> - So if you like the taste of fish, </joey>
<garnt> I'd say the Lawson one is better. </garnt>
<garnt> If you don't like the taste of fish, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say the Family Mart one is better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I'll give that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Alright let's try the-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Now let's try this abomination. </garnt>
<connor> Honestly there's a part of me. </connor>
<connor> There's a part of me </connor>
<connor> that's thinking this is going to be good. </connor>
<joey> Although mine's contaminated with egg. </joey>
<connor> - This is my only strawberry. </connor>
<garnt> - I've only got one strawberry as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I've got two in mine. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, one thing that the sandwiches are guilty of </connor>
<joey> doing here is that they look loaded in the front. </joey>
<joey> They look like they're filled. </joey>
<joey> And then you take one bite and you realize </joey>
<garnt> there's nothing in the back. - They clickbait you. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's literally like the Walker's crisps where, </connor>
<connor> like you bite into it, </connor>
<garnt> and most of it is just air. </garnt>
<connor> - And I found that Family Mart does that the worst. </connor>
<garnt> - You think so? - Family Mart has this </garnt>
<garnt> sandwich, right, that I used to get from Family Mart, </garnt>
<garnt> which is egg and ham, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> And in the front man, it looks like it's bursting. </garnt>
<garnt> It can't wait to get out, and you take one bite. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you realize that it goes from like, this. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so thin. </garnt>
<garnt> - Alright, let's give this a shot. </garnt>
<connor> That's not a sandwich. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly? </connor>
<connor> - That's just a cake. </connor>
<garnt> - That's just, yeah, it's a dessert. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a strawberry shortcake. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's really fucking weird. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> It tastes like a strawberry shortcake. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you're just chewing bread. </garnt>
<connor> - Proof that bread works with fucking anything. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I, that, that tastes wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not a fan of that. </garnt>
<joey> - I would rather just eat a strawberry shortcake. </joey>
<garnt> - That's like the equivalent of putting a burger </garnt>
<connor> or putting a patty between two, two bread, </connor>
<garnt> two bread slices, and calling it a burger. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Yeah I've always seen those being sold. </joey>
<connor> Because I think they sell all of those </connor>
<connor> at like Lawson and 7-11, Family Mart. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they all have dessert sandwiches, </connor>
<connor> which is just fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> - I saw one with like, </connor>
<connor> I saw one where it was like, cream and lime? </connor>
<connor> - Cream and lime? </connor>
<connor> - Not lime, sorry, kiwi, kiwi. </connor>
<garnt> It was kiwi slices with like, </garnt>
<garnt> whipped cream. - Kiwi and lime, </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen that one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And I was like, that looks fucking wack. </joey>
<garnt> - One thing I will say, </garnt>
<garnt> the whipped cream they use here in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's S-tier whip cream. </garnt>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<connor> - Whipped cream to me doesn't really </connor>
<connor> fucking taste like anything. </connor>
<garnt> I just kinda like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - You taste Japanese whipped cream, </garnt>
<garnt> and you think it tastes like, you taste? </garnt>
<connor> - I can stan that better. </connor>
<connor> I don't like whipped cream. </connor>
<garnt> - You're telling me that the whipped cream </garnt>
<connor> did not carry what you just ate right there. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly the bread kind of carried it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Get out of here. </joey>
<garnt> - This man I swear. </garnt>
<joey> - I had like one quarter of a fucking strawberry. </joey>
<connor> There's nothing happening. </connor>
<joey> - I used to fucking despise like </joey>
<joey> all cakes and stuff like that. </joey>
<garnt> Like strawberry shortcake, I was like, nah, </garnt>
<garnt> that's some boring shit, </garnt>
<garnt> but then I had strawberry shortcake here and I was like, </garnt>
<joey> oh my god. </joey>
<garnt> - I was exactly the same. </garnt>
<garnt> Strawberry shortcake here blew my mind, </garnt>
<garnt> because the cake part is so fluffy. </garnt>
<garnt> - The cream, man. </garnt>
<connor> - The whipped cream, Japanese whipped cream </connor>
<connor> is the best I've tasted in the world. </connor>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<connor> - I will stand by that. - I agree with that. </connor>
<connor> - And that's why Japanese sweets tastes so good. </connor>
<connor> A lot of it is just-- </connor>
<connor> - Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. </connor>
<connor> - The whipped cream. </connor>
<garnt> So what are we trying next lads? </garnt>
<connor> - Should we try like the more like savory snacks? </connor>
<garnt> Maybe like the fish and the meat snacks? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you guys have any of those? </garnt>
<connor> - Sure. </connor>
<connor> So gentlemen, as you know, </connor>
<connor> one of the most well-known food items </connor>
<garnt> - What was that? - from Japan </garnt>
<garnt> - Was like, uh, uh. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was trying to figure out what I was trying to say. </garnt>
<garnt> But one of the most well-known food items </garnt>
<connor> from Japan is of course the jelly donut. </connor>
<connor> AKA. </connor>
<connor> - Actually you took me back there, like wait, what? </connor>
<connor> - The onigiri. </connor>
<connor> Which if you've seen, </connor>
<joey> if you basically watch any anime, </joey>
<joey> you've seen characters eating onigiri. </joey>
<joey> - The rice balls. </joey>
<garnt> - This is basically the closest we get </garnt>
<garnt> to an actual Japanese sandwich. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it's a rice sandwich, basically, right? </connor>
<connor> This is a... </connor>
<connor> - Wait, whoa. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> Oh, oh, oh my God. - What is that? </connor>
<connor> - I did not, where's the seaweed? </connor>
<garnt> Where is the seaweed? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like the best part. </garnt>
<connor> It's like the hot dog wrapper, right? </connor>
<garnt> The best part of a hot dog is the crunch, right? </garnt>
<connor> What is that? </connor>
<garnt> - It is a grilled salmon onigiri. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh I have a grilled salmon one as well, from Family Mart. </joey>
<joey> - Okay we all grilled - I also have a grilled </joey>
<connor> salmon one. - salmon onigiri. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, as you know, me and Garnt actually ate onigiri, </connor>
<connor> and this is actually one of them that I was eating, </connor>
<connor> and it was quite delicious as much as I was complaining. </connor>
<garnt> Show business. </garnt>
<garnt> Acting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, that is my favorite onigiri to get, </garnt>
<garnt> from Lawson's. </garnt>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I've never seen that one. </joey>
<joey> - What'd you mean, from Lawson's? </joey>
<joey> You mean from all of the places, Garnt. </joey>
<connor> Now Lawson's, like every good big brain company, </connor>
<joey> has their own product line, specifically for onigiri. </joey>
<joey> They have the basic bitch onigiri. </joey>
<joey> It's like 100 yen. </joey>
<joey> Now this is shit is like 190 yen. </joey>
<joey> - Ooh, that's the premium shit. </joey>
<joey> - Premium. </joey>
<connor> You can't even see it. </connor>
<connor> That's how premium it is. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I will stan 7-11 hot foods and fried foods. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't stan its onigiri. </garnt>
<joey> - What is that? </joey>
<joey> - This is the most depressing looking onigiri </joey>
<garnt> I've ever seen. </garnt>
<joey> I'm sorry. - Look at that Joey! </joey>
<connor> - Looks like someone put the condom on wrong. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - They put the condom on sideways </joey>
<joey> instead of on top. </joey>
<connor> - Now gentlemen, let me show you what a good onigiri. </connor>
<connor> Okay actually that could-- </connor>
<garnt> - It looks the same! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's just a bigger condom. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, that's how it should look, look at that. </joey>
<joey> - That's just a bigger condom. </joey>
<connor> - It's so beautiful. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, it's beautiful, </joey>
<joey> because every bite you get, you get a bit of seaweed in it. </joey>
<garnt> It's the perfect ratio. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's the thing that differentiates </garnt>
<garnt> between a good onigiri and bad onigiri. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the rice to insides ratio. </garnt>
<garnt> - 100% agree. </garnt>
<garnt> - 100% yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - If there's like, the first bite you bite into </garnt>
<joey> in an onigiri and you immediately hit the inside, </joey>
<joey> that's a good onigiri. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, to be fair, a lot of the cheap ones, </connor>
<connor> or even sometimes like if they've just filled it, </connor>
<joey> not quite right that one time you do just get like </joey>
<joey> four bites in and you're like, where is the </joey>
<joey> fucking filling? - Where's the filling? </joey>
<joey> - I gotta ask. </joey>
<joey> Do you boys actually eat onigiri anymore? </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I still do. </connor>
<garnt> - You do? </garnt>
<garnt> I gave up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do whenever I need a quick, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I literally need a quick snack. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just never in the mood for a block of carbs. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> That's the problem. </joey>
<joey> And like, there's not enough filling. </joey>
<connor> I'd rather just have a block of-- </connor>
<joey> - Wait, you get the fucking microwaveable goo dogs. </joey>
<connor> - That's if like, I want to fucking, </connor>
<joey> I wanna pig out. </joey>
<garnt> I haven't had a goo dog in a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like, that shit is just dreadful. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, because sometimes, </connor>
<garnt> sometimes I miss my lunch and I have like a filming </garnt>
<connor> or something and I just need to fill up my stomach </connor>
<connor> as quickly as possible. </connor>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<connor> - And that's when I get just like one onigiri, </connor>
<garnt> that lasts me until dinner. </garnt>
<garnt> And it does everything it needs to do. </garnt>
<connor> - What is your favorite filling of the onigiri? </connor>
<garnt> So there's different flavors that you could have in it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh god, that's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally all fish, there is sometimes grilled chicken </garnt>
<joey> but honestly. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not not a fan of the </joey>
<joey> chicken breast though. - Don't get it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the good part about the fish one </joey>
<connor> is that normally it like seeps into the rest of the area. </connor>
<connor> But the chicken one just is a ball in the middle. </connor>
<connor> - I'd have to say the tuna is probably </connor>
<garnt> my favorite. - The tuna is my </garnt>
<joey> favorite as well. </joey>
<joey> - Actually you are holding my favorite one </joey>
<joey> which is the salmon belly. </joey>
<joey> It's really, really good premium salmon. </joey>
<joey> In terms of the chicken. </joey>
<joey> How'd you guys feel about the onigiri where </joey>
<joey> it doesn't really have a filling. </joey>
<joey> It's just kind of like the grilled rice </joey>
<garnt> with grilled chicken or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - I used to eat those when I was little. </joey>
<garnt> But as I got older, I was like, nah, I just want, </garnt>
<connor> I want something more like, </connor>
<connor> you know. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Satisfying. - It feels like a fake, </joey>
<joey> feels like a fake meal. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> When I first visited Japan, I fucking, </joey>
<joey> all I had was like onigiri. </joey>
<joey> - I think everyone's like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah because you're like, oh my god, I'm in Japan. </joey>
<connor> I gotta eat the Japanese things. </connor>
<connor> I can't get this at home. </connor>
<connor> I can get a sandwich at home. </connor>
<connor> But then when I started living here, I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> yo, the sandwiches are pretty fucking bomb. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you tried these sandwiches? </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, nearly the same price. </garnt>
<garnt> What am I doing, man? </garnt>
<joey> And sandwiches are easier to eat. </joey>
<joey> Cause sometimes onigiri falls apart, </joey>
<garnt> if you like, if you're, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you're in a rush. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you're bad at eating it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Onigiri to me, I'd never eat onigiri as a meal. </garnt>
<joey> Like if I'm having a lunch, I never pick onigiri </joey>
<garnt> as the lunch. </garnt>
<garnt> Onigiri is a convenience </garnt>
<garnt> if I need to stuff myself and have it not taste awful. </garnt>
<joey> - I just realized there's no way for us to like share. </joey>
<joey> - We've just gotta bite into it. </joey>
<connor> - It's all salmon onigiri. </connor>
<garnt> - To be fair, I've never tried the Family Mart </garnt>
<joey> branded onigiri before. - I have never tried </joey>
<connor> the Seven onigiri yet. </connor>
<garnt> - I've had this one before and it's good. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just gonna do a bite just to prove that it's good. </garnt>
<joey> Again. </joey>
<joey> - Oh look at that. </joey>
<joey> Immediately. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> How deep would I have to bite, do you reckon, </joey>
<connor> to get the filling, Joey? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I just bit a whole ton of rice, </garnt>
<garnt> and it didn't even have any seaweed. </garnt>
<garnt> I hit like one millimeter of fish though. </garnt>
<connor> - Let me give a bite. </connor>
<connor> How deep, this deep? </connor>
<connor> - Mmm, I already broke into salmon. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Look at that. </joey>
<joey> - Mine, like my salmon actually has </joey>
<joey> like a little bit of like soy sauce in it. </joey>
<joey> So the soy sauce kind of seeped into the rice a little bit. </joey>
<connor> - That's good. - That's really flavorful. </connor>
<connor> - That's nice, fatty salmon. </connor>
<garnt> - This is awful. </garnt>
<connor> This is awful, I do not... </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Honestly, </joey>
<garnt> this is the most depressing looking grilled salmon </garnt>
<joey> I've ever seen. - 7-11, fix your shit. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so we can say Family Mart and Lawson </joey>
<joey> have got their branded onigiri pretty down pat. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah if you want the best onigiri from a chain, </connor>
<garnt> I would highly recommend </garnt>
<connor> Lawson's. - I would highly recommend </connor>
<connor> Lawson's as well. </connor>
<garnt> Lawson's, especially the grilled salmon belly. </garnt>
<garnt> That is fucking bomb. </garnt>
<connor> - What other cold or savory snacks </connor>
<connor> do you guys tend to go for? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay we have the... </garnt>
<connor> - You don't eat that. </connor>
<connor> - I do not eat this. </connor>
<connor> You know what this is? </connor>
<connor> This is the seafood sticks that you see </connor>
<joey> in every Asian restaurant. </joey>
<garnt> And I don't know why every Asian restaurant serves these </garnt>
<joey> seafood sticks. - Look, I don't wanna make </joey>
<joey> this a dick measuring contest, but mine's bigger. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Although to be fair. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't eat these, but every now and then, </garnt>
<connor> Aki asked me to come and buy like one of these crab sticks. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I tried it. </connor>
<connor> It's actually kind of good. </connor>
<joey> If you like like crab, especially. </joey>
<connor> - This isn't just like crab or fish. </connor>
<connor> This is fish paste, cheese, and cod roe. </connor>
<joey> That sounds dreadful. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Oh, that sounds awful. </joey>
<connor> - My one's got like, mayonnaise inside of it. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - It's a seafood stick, spicy roe. </connor>
<joey> - That looks fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. - That looks disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Look at that. </joey>
<joey> Look at that. </joey>
<joey> Oh my god. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] I'm gonna try this. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is just like. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, smell it, smell it. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh that smells awful. </garnt>
<garnt> That smells like off tuna. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh it just dribbled. </garnt>
<garnt> - Smell that. </garnt>
<joey> - Ooh. </joey>
<joey> - That does smell like bad tuna, doesn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Ooh. </joey>
<joey> - I really don't wanna eat it. </joey>
<joey> - That is like the fishiest fish smell ever. </joey>
<garnt> - You know what, I'm not even gonna open this, </garnt>
<joey> I'm just gonna eat yours. </joey>
<joey> - You know, when you just have fish </joey>
<garnt> that's been left out for a few days? </garnt>
<garnt> That's what this smells like. </garnt>
<garnt> - It smells like cat-- </garnt>
<joey> - The thing is, I usually fuck with the crab sticks </joey>
<joey> at like summer festivals and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> So I hope this is something like that. </joey>
<connor> - That's not good. </connor>
<connor> It's just, it's bad. </connor>
<connor> - Not good, no. </connor>
<connor> - Oh god. </connor>
<garnt> No, that is, that is bad. </garnt>
<connor> - That's awful, that is. </connor>
<connor> I just prefer the normal crab stick. </connor>
<connor> Don't put shit in it, don't put cheese in it. </connor>
<connor> I can't even taste the cheese. </connor>
<joey> - I don't like crab. - I definitely taste </joey>
<joey> the cheese. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I don't like crab sticks. </joey>
<joey> - I don't mind. </joey>
<joey> - Crab is one food </joey>
<joey> that I think just doesn't taste good processed. </joey>
<garnt> And crab sticks just feel like, </garnt>
<connor> they feel like such processed food. </connor>
<connor> - It's like canned lobster, you don't can lobster. </connor>
<connor> No one wants canned lobster. - But you gotta have, </connor>
<joey> with the crab sticks though, </joey>
<joey> I used to think the same, </joey>
<joey> but like you go to like a summer festival and </joey>
<connor> you get the ones that are like on the fucking grill with </connor>
<connor> like the fucking sauce. - Oh yeah, I bet that's </connor>
<joey> fucking good, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That shit is fire. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but it's not, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think it's the crab that tastes good. </garnt>
<joey> It's the fact that it's grilled </joey>
<joey> and it's got the sauce on it. </joey>
<joey> I'd rather have another. </joey>
<garnt> - It can be good. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's really good, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - This video is sponsored by Bokksu, </garnt>
<garnt> Connor, what is Bokksu? </garnt>
<connor> - Bokksu is the only Japanese snack box </connor>
<connor> that partners with over 100 year old family snack makers </connor>
<garnt> to deliver Japan's exclusive snacks right to your door. </garnt>
<garnt> And I have to say, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never seen any of these at a konbini. </garnt>
<connor> So that probably means they're premium. </connor>
<connor> Look at this. </connor>
<garnt> I love my soft cookies and this, oh, this, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna have this later. - Well boys. </garnt>
<joey> March is the start of the hanami season. </joey>
<garnt> What's hanami, Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> - Or the cherry blossom season in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> as it's called. - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So to commemorate that, </garnt>
<garnt> Bokksu orders placed in March will get a special </garnt>
<connor> hanami themed pink box instead of Bokksu's signature orange. </connor>
<connor> But be quick because these stocks are limited. </connor>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] I'm showing the box. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's right here! </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] You can't see! </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] First time Bokksu customers </connor>
<connor> will receive the Seasons of Japan box </connor>
<connor> so they could get a taste of the snacks per season. </connor>

<garnt> a themed box every month. </garnt>
<garnt> Gentlemen, what kind of snacks do you like? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm a giant senbei fan. </connor>
<connor> And this is a rather extraordinary looking senbei. </connor>
<joey> - That's the black Sesame taiko with the kumamon design. </joey>
<connor> - I love me some sesame. </connor>
<connor> So I'm very down. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you got there Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have here a cookie. </garnt>
<joey> Joey, what is this cookie? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's the aomuri apple caramel yakkoi sable. </joey>
<garnt> - Damn, that sounds sexy. - Aomori is famous </garnt>
<joey> for their apples, right? </joey>
<joey> - All I know is I like me my soft cookies, and this? </joey>
<joey> - That looks so good. </joey>
<joey> - This is a nice soft moist cookie. </joey>
<garnt> - God I want a cup of tea. </garnt>
<garnt> - Best part is, it's vegetarian. </garnt>
<connor> - Ooh! </connor>
<connor> - Joey, what's yours? </connor>
<connor> - Well, my favorite one is the </connor>
<connor> stick potato supamucho plum. </connor>
<garnt> We talked about the sour plums on this episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you know me. </garnt>
<garnt> I love me my sour plums. </garnt>
<joey> So if there's a sour plum snack, </joey>
<joey> you know I'm gonna dig that. </joey>
<garnt> - Ooh, that looks nice. </garnt>
<garnt> And gentlemen I'm sure we can all agree </garnt>
<garnt> that ever since moving to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> Japan's snack game is just on another level. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, there's no competing with it. </connor>

<joey> - Back to the video. </joey>
<joey> - What'd you got there Conner? </joey>
<joey> What do you got there Conner? </joey>
<joey> - This is a rather odd looking. </joey>
<connor> It's like a fucking whole deli. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, it's just a bunch of cuts of bacon, it looks like, </garnt>
<connor> but like, sausages. </connor>
<garnt> - We're about to show off why Japanese bacon </garnt>
<garnt> is just one of the worst bacons you can find in the world. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll try my best to hold this up </connor>
<connor> without burning myself. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, so this is Japanese bacon here. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is a meat platter. </garnt>
<joey> - And as you can see, it is floppy and soggy. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh god, oh god. </garnt>
<joey> - Don't flop it around! </joey>
<joey> Hold still. </joey>
<joey> - I just want to show off </joey>
<garnt> that this is not what bacon should look like or feel like. </garnt>
<connor> - This is two kinds of sausage and pepper bacon. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, what are we trying? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I'll, you know, I'll try the one kind of sausage. </joey>
<joey> - I'll try the other kind then. </joey>
<joey> Whatever one is-- </joey>
<joey> - Should we just cut one in half actually? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But what else do you have there in the meantime Joey, </connor>
<connor> while I prepare this? </connor>
<joey> - Okay, well I know you guys have never tried this but </joey>
<joey> we have Nankone. </joey>
<joey> Shiu nonkone, which is pickled plums. </joey>
<garnt> - Pickled plums. </garnt>
<garnt> You think I haven't tried that, </garnt>
<joey> I actually have tried that. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, but there's two different types. </joey>
<joey> - Because, for some reason, </joey>
<garnt> Sidney fucking loves pickled plums. </garnt>
<garnt> And I do not know why. </garnt>
<joey> - Here's the thing. </joey>
<joey> Literally, I dunno if this is just a stereotype, </joey>
<garnt> literally every female I know loves pickled plums. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> Like if it's plum, if it's like an actual plum, </connor>
<joey> plum flavored things. </joey>
<joey> - Meilyne it true? </joey>
<joey> - Meilyne, do you like pickled plum? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> That's what I'm saying! </joey>
<joey> Chicks love pickled plums. </joey>
<garnt> I don't understand. </garnt>
<joey> Literally every Japanese girl I know loves </joey>
<joey> pickle plum flavored shit. </joey>
<connor> - Alright boys. </connor>
<joey> Tell me what kinds of sausage you would like to have. </joey>
<garnt> - Just give me one of them. </garnt>
<joey> - What are the different, </joey>
<joey> I mean, this just-- - It looks like a finger. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's basically, they call-- </connor>
<connor> - It's like straight up a finger, look! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> It looks like a finger! </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like fucking out of Yoshikage, </garnt>
<joey> that's out of Kira's collection, man! </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - Yoshikage Kira's collection. - That's one thing that Japan </garnt>
<garnt> just doesn't do and it's sausages. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they just don't do them, right? </garnt>
<joey> And like, they'll they'll go around calling this chorizo. </joey>
<joey> Like that's what they, in restaurants. </joey>
<joey> - That is not chorizo. </joey>
<connor> - They will call this chorizo. </connor>
<connor> And it's a joke. </connor>
<connor> I mean it's literally a hot dog. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's just a sausage, eh? </joey>
<connor> - Just a hot dog. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just a sad frankfurt. </garnt>
<connor> That's what it is. </connor>
<joey> - You can palate cleanse though with a kitsunanko... </joey>
<connor> - They don't need to see this. - Let me try the bacon. </connor>
<connor> Yeah it's shit. </connor>
<joey> - Here, I'll give you guys the pickled plums </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we have three. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so this is actually something new. </garnt>
<garnt> They, you know, I'm sure the viewers watching, </garnt>
<garnt> they've tasted bacon before. </garnt>
<garnt> They've tasted sausages. </garnt>
<garnt> They've tasted hot dogs. </garnt>
<garnt> What they haven't tasted pickled plums. </garnt>
<joey> - So Japan is like kind of known </joey>
<joey> for its pickled plum. </joey>
<joey> Umeboshi it's called. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, umeboshi. </joey>
<joey> - But basically there's two types of umeboshi. </joey>
<garnt> There's the really, really sour types of umeboshi </garnt>
<garnt> that you find-- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the only one I've had. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is the sweet umeboshi. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sweet umeboshi? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, this amakachu umeboshi. </connor>
<connor> - This one too? </connor>
<joey> - Yes, yeah. </joey>
<connor> these are all the same. - So this is the sour one. </connor>
<connor> - No these are the sweet ones. </connor>
<garnt> These are all sweet. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'll try it. </connor>
<connor> - It's a slightly salted sweet umeboshi. </connor>
<connor> - Oh shit, it's dripping everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, watch out. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. let me taste this. </joey>
<joey> - I know you guys haven't tried this, but-- </joey>
<connor> - Why does it look like a deflated scrotum? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Because it's been, </joey>
<joey> because it's been dried basically. </joey>
<joey> What do you think? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not a fan. </garnt>
<connor> I'm still not a fan. </connor>
<joey> - So what'd you do, </joey>
<joey> just take a big bite? </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, there's a seed inside of it </garnt>
<connor> so watch out. </connor>
<garnt> - Watch out for the seed. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> It's so sour! </garnt>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> This is the sweet one. </joey>
<garnt> - This is the sweet one. </garnt>
<joey> - This is sweet? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - In what universe is this sweet? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this is the sweet one. </joey>
<garnt> - So if you have the sour one, it's literally like... </garnt>
<joey> What's the most sour thing you can normally get in like... </joey>
<joey> - Sour Patch Kids. </joey>
<connor> - It's way more sour than that. </connor>
<connor> - You know that one video we did with Joey's channel </connor>
<garnt> where we had to, the powdered sour. </garnt>
<connor> It just tastes like a bite of that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's basically pickled plum. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it's like, there's, </joey>
<joey> I bought this thing for my channel </joey>
<joey> which is pure umeboshi extract. </joey>
<joey> And it's considered one of the most </joey>
<joey> sour things in the world. </joey>
<joey> - That's fucking awful. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's basically you start salivating immediately. </garnt>
<garnt> It's one of the most sour things you can just naturally get. </garnt>
<joey> - It was really good. </joey>
<joey> My grandma used to hand make these. </joey>
<connor> So that's why I have a special </connor>
<joey> thing for them. - I do think there was </joey>
<joey> a lot at play of like, </joey>
<joey> I am not used to these foods. </joey>
<connor> And although I'm more than happy to try every single item. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't mean I have to like every single item. </connor>
<garnt> - No of course not. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I don't understand about pickled plums. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that why'd you like eating something that sour? </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's so sour, it's more sour than any kind of sweet </garnt>
<garnt> or any kind of. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> Like I used to like, cause again, like my grandma </joey>
<connor> used to like hand-make the umeboshi, and would just </connor>
<connor> send it in tupperware, right? </connor>
<connor> And it's like, it is the most sour shit imaginable. </connor>
<joey> I used to just come home - If I had a Japanese grandma </joey>
<joey> that made it for me, </joey>
<connor> I'm sure I'd love the fuck out of it, right? </connor>
<joey> - I would just come home after school </joey>
<joey> and just get the tupperware and just fucking eat it. </joey>
<joey> - That's got love in it Joey. </joey>
<joey> That didn't have love. </joey>
<connor> That had factories and suffering. </connor>
<garnt> That tastes like shit. </garnt>
<connor> - My grandma's umeboshi's the best. </connor>
<joey> - Did you mouth just look like this? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, all the time, but I fucking loved it. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause that's me after one bite of eating umeboshi. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I dunno, I love it. </garnt>
<connor> - Another item that you can get that, you know, </connor>
<connor> you won't really find elsewhere in the world probably </connor>
<connor> is a lot of dried fish items that are like snackable. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So Garnt has some... </connor>
<garnt> - I have some squid and seaweed tempura chips. </garnt>
<connor> - So tempura is a kind of light batter. </connor>
<joey> - It's a light batter </joey>
<joey> for frying, yeah. - For frying. </joey>
<joey> - I have salmon skin chips, which, </joey>
<joey> they really didn't do good with a good name there. </joey>
<connor> - I kind of fuck with these. </connor>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<connor> I like these. </connor>
<joey> I also really fucking love all of the squid stuff. </joey>
<joey> Like fried squid. </joey>
<joey> What's the other one? </joey>
<joey> - The dried squid? </joey>
<joey> - Dried squid as well I like. </joey>
<joey> They have like a certain type of frying technique </joey>
<joey> for some of the squids that are really good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - It looks fucking vile </joey>
<joey> when you pull this out of the package, like octopus, </joey>
<joey> it looks so gross. </joey>
<joey> But it's pretty good. </joey>
<joey> So should we bust some of these open? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, let's try them out. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think I have any. </connor>
<connor> - Joey, you wanna have, </connor>
<connor> oh actually you know what? </connor>
<connor> Wow, they look like crisps. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So these are designed to basically look like fish crisps. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's crazy. </garnt>
<connor> That's kind of epic. </connor>
<garnt> - That's kinda epic. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's an epic gamer moment right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look at that. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I'll hold one up, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - So, look at that. </garnt>
<connor> That could be like a square. </connor>
<connor> Do you have squares in Australia? </connor>
<connor> They're British crisps. </connor>
<connor> - No I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> - They look exactly like this, don't they? </connor>
<connor> Wow. </connor>
<connor> - But they also, </connor>
<joey> I mean they smell like you think they smell. </joey>
<joey> It's a very fishy smell that they smell like, obviously. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause it's fish. - That's good, I like that. </garnt>
<connor> With a beer? </connor>
<joey> - With a beer, oh, we'll do it. </joey>
<joey> With a beer, cheers boys. </joey>
<garnt> - Cheers, gentlemen. </garnt>
<connor> (can opening) </connor>
<connor> Mmm. </connor>
<connor> Mmm. </connor>
<connor> That's great. </connor>
<connor> I love that. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I just worked a hard day fishing </connor>
<connor> in the middle of nowhere in Aomori. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like it takes me back. </connor>
<garnt> Honestly, these taste so good with beers. </garnt>
<connor> I just kind of want to keep eating these. </connor>
<joey> - Yo, give me one. </joey>
<joey> - Give me one of those. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's try one of these. </garnt>
<garnt> Try one of these. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think I've tried these, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - These have a bit more bite to them. </garnt>
<connor> - Ooh! </connor>
<connor> Yo! </connor>
<garnt> That's good! </garnt>
<garnt> - They've got some texture to them, don't they? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's like the unhealthier version of this, I suppose. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause this, it's basically, </garnt>
<connor> this is basically that with a bit more batter. </connor>
<garnt> So you've got a bit more of a bite. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I might prefer these ones. </joey>
<connor> - Those are nice. </connor>
<joey> These have a nice crunch to them. </joey>
<connor> - I'm having another one, man. </connor>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - Let me bring out a snack that another snack that I'm sure </joey>
<joey> you guys have probably never seen or heard of before. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - I'm glad that, </joey>
<joey> I'm glad that Ashley brought them. </joey>
<joey> It's kaninto. </joey>
<connor> - What is that? </connor>
<joey> - Ah, I did buy these one time. </joey>
<connor> I thought they were chocolate. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They weren't chocolate. - Most people will look at </joey>
<connor> this and go, oh look, </connor>
<joey> it's actual pieces of turd. </joey>
<joey> - I thought it was chocolate, </joey>
<joey> I was so hype to dig in! </joey>
<joey> - What is it? </joey>
<joey> - Basically it is black sugar particles. </joey>
<garnt> But when you pull it out. </garnt>
<joey> - Black sugar particles? </joey>
<connor> - Really selling me on this. </connor>
<connor> - It's like fried black sugar right? </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure that's what it is. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds like a physics term. </garnt>
<joey> - But when you pull it out, </joey>
<joey> it straight up just looks like a turd. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know what to tell you. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a very fancy name for a turd there. </garnt>
<connor> - That looks Brian Griffin's poop. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] There you go. </joey>
<joey> - What is this? </joey>
<joey> - You know what that looks, you know what this looks like? </joey>
<joey> This looks like a turd that like a Pomeranian would do. </joey>
<joey> Cheers? - Like a small dog. </joey>
<garnt> - Cheers? - Cheers. </garnt>
<garnt> (crunching) </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> That ain't bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<connor> - It just tastes like-- </connor>
<connor> - Sugar with air. </connor>
<connor> It's just sugar. </connor>
<connor> - It just tastes like a crisp sugar. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's basically just deep fried sugar. </joey>
<connor> - I honestly don't really like that. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> It's a, black sugar is kind of a hit or miss </joey>
<joey> with a lot of people. </joey>
<joey> - It's a miss. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So the thing is I couldn't eat a whole packet of these. </garnt>
<garnt> I chomp on one of these, I'm like, that was nice. </garnt>
<garnt> Am I, am I getting a craving to go for one more? </garnt>
<garnt> Nope. </garnt>
<garnt> One's enough for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, what, what is this in Japanese again? </connor>
<joey> - This is called kokto karinto. </joey>
<connor> - What a fucking name. </connor>
<joey> - Kokto is black sugar, </joey>
<joey> karinto is like the name of the actual snack. </joey>
<garnt> - How unhealthy is it to just eat the entire thing? </garnt>
<connor> - What's the calories on that one? </connor>
<joey> - Calories? </joey>
<joey> 698. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Per how many grams? </connor>
<joey> - For the whole bag. </joey>
<connor> 135 grams. - Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> How much sugar is in that bitch? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you're just eating pure sugar. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, wait. </connor>
<connor> - 37 grams. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, that's way less than I expected. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it just feels like you're eating fried sugar. </garnt>
<joey> - There's actually more carbs in this, </joey>
<joey> there's 81 grams of carbs. </joey>
<garnt> - Holy fuck. - What? </garnt>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> - There's seven grams of protein in this thing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh well great, after a workout. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah perfect for after a workout. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where's the protein coming from? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have no idea. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where the fuck is the protein coming from? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have no idea. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're literally making protein out of thin air here. </garnt>
<connor> - Japan be doing that. </connor>
<garnt> Did they just put like a bit of protein powder in it? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<joey> - Just like balance it out. </joey>
<garnt> - We're going to make this healthy somehow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shall we get out something else? </garnt>
<garnt> - A giant bag full of things now, </garnt>
<connor> these are more like, I guess sweets or kind of. </connor>
<garnt> - Should we just dump the rest on the table </garnt>
<garnt> and see what we got? </garnt>
<garnt> All right. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at all that. </garnt>
<connor> - Holy fuck I have a lot </connor>
<garnt> more than you guys. - Let's see what Santa </garnt>
<garnt> brought us. - I have way more </garnt>
<connor> than I think you guys do. </connor>
<connor> - What is that that you bought? </connor>
<connor> - So many, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - I do have that. </connor>
<garnt> - So many sweets there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Alright. </garnt>
<connor> Should I just start with the stuff that looks interesting? </connor>
<connor> Okay first of all, one of my favorite Japanese snacks. </connor>
<garnt> it's gotta be top, it's top tier for me, this is S-tier. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mochi senbei? </garnt>
<garnt> - Senbei in general. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, senbei in general. </joey>
<joey> - Not mochi, but senbei in general, </joey>
<joey> there's a senbei store not too far from us. </joey>
<joey> I go there like every week to get my </joey>
<joey> weekly supply of senbei. - Yeah, I do as well. </joey>
<joey> It's so good. </joey>
<joey> - Oh fuck, senbei is so good. </joey>
<joey> If you don't know it's like a rice cracker. </joey>
<joey> But it's basically like, </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't feel too heavy. </garnt>
<garnt> And you can have like one or two </garnt>
<garnt> and you feel like really satisfied. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not too bad for you either. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean it is just like, rice. </connor>
<joey> - It feels like a crisp. </joey>
<garnt> But just lighter. </garnt>
<joey> And for some reason it's more filling </joey>
<garnt> than a single crisp. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, an entire packet of senbei </joey>
<joey> is like a meal. - So this is mochi, </joey>
<connor> oh my god, whoa, this has a funky texture to it. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Is it soft? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like a soft cookie, </joey>
<connor> a soft baked senbei. </connor>
<connor> - Woo, okay, is it chewy? </connor>
<garnt> It looks chewy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is that? </garnt>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> - This is, yeah, so mochi senbei </joey>
<connor> is kind of in the same. </connor>
<connor> So there's different types. </connor>
<joey> There's hard senbei and then there's soft senbei. </joey>
<connor> - There's hard senbei, </connor>
<garnt> and then there's rock fucking solid senbei. </garnt>
<garnt> There are some senbei where I've had, there was one, </garnt>
<garnt> there was like, it was like yuzu pepper or something. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like oh, that sounds amazing. </connor>
<connor> So I order it, right? </connor>
<connor> And I fucking like, break my teeth I swear, </connor>
<connor> biting on this shit. </connor>
<garnt> - What is it like a jawbreaker </garnt>
<connor> kind of senbei? - Honestly, there's like, </connor>
<connor> there's the perfect hardness which is just, </connor>
<joey> cracks immediately upon... </joey>
<joey> - It's like a rice cracker. </joey>
<connor> - Right, that's what you want. </connor>
<joey> - And then some of them it just feels like </joey>
<garnt> you're biting into a stone. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's pretty weird. </garnt>
<joey> Huh. </joey>
<joey> - If this was a cookie, </joey>
<garnt> I would think this is the perfect kind of texture </garnt>
<joey> I'm looking for in a cookie. </joey>
<joey> - There's actually one more level above this </joey>
<joey> called nure senbei which literally means wet senbei. </joey>
<joey> And it's like actually like wet. </joey>
<joey> But they make it for old people who can't like, </joey>
<joey> break into it. - Aww. </joey>
<connor> That's wholesome, okay. </connor>
<joey> Let's give it a shot. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Whoa, that's weird. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so mochi rice is actually different </joey>
<joey> from regular rice. </joey>
<joey> Mochi rice is a lot softer </joey>
<connor> and a lot more like squishier. </connor>
<connor> So you get something like this, yeah, </connor>
<connor> it's a little wack aint it? </connor>
<connor> - Whoa, that's so bizarre! </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't like it. </joey>
<garnt> - You know what it is? </garnt>
<joey> It's moist. </joey>
<connor> - To explain-- </connor>
<connor> - Why's Meilyne laughing, what's funny Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I just love Garnt's reaction. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - To explain what I just experienced. </garnt>
<garnt> So as we said, </garnt>
<garnt> this has the perfect texture for like a good cookie. </garnt>
<garnt> And like my experience has told me that this is good. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to bite into this and it's going to taste sweet. </garnt>
<garnt> And what I tasted was a salted cracker </garnt>
<garnt> with a moist cookie texture. </garnt>
<connor> - It isn't bad though. </connor>
<connor> I'd eat it. </connor>
<connor> Like I wouldn't search for it, but I'd eat it. </connor>
<garnt> - That, that was, </garnt>
<garnt> that texture and taste just doesn't belong together. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, something about that. </joey>
<joey> - You've kind of been conditioned, right? </joey>
<joey> - Maybe so. </joey>
<joey> Cause I, taste it and it tastes good. </joey>
<garnt> And I feel the texture and the texture feels good. </garnt>
<garnt> but together it just does not synergize at all. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like anti umami, man. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a plus and a minus put together. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, it looks like you have a senbei there. Garnt. </garnt>
<connor> A big boy senbei. </connor>
<garnt> - I have a proper senbei. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a kabukiage. </joey>
<garnt> This is my favorite type of senbei. </garnt>
<garnt> Kabukiage. - Fucking hell Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> Fucking-- - Yeah, Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanted to try how hard it is. </garnt>
<joey> - We actually have the smaller kabukiage. </joey>
<joey> These ones I buy quite regularly. </joey>
<connor> - These ones, I like these. </connor>
<joey> But when you have like four or five, you start to feel sick. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - 'Cause they're so like, </joey>
<connor> what's the word to describe, maybe just fat. </connor>
<joey> (crunching) </joey>
<joey> - These are really good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So there it's like, how would you describe the texture? </garnt>
<garnt> It's... </garnt>
<connor> - Cavernous. </connor>
<joey> - It's like The Thing from fantastic four, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It kinda does. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what it is that's like amazing </connor>
<connor> for like one or two bites, </connor>
<connor> but really like sickly after like three. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, man. </joey>
<connor> I could destroy a whole packet of these. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe it's just me, </joey>
<joey> it's gotta be just me. </joey>
<joey> This is not bad though. </joey>
<joey> - These are my favorite types of senbeis I think. </joey>
<garnt> - So this tastes exactly the same as what we just had. </garnt>
<garnt> but this is the texture I imagine that taste having. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, it's a nice salty cracker </garnt>
<joey> just with a bit more air in between. </joey>
<joey> Or like it's, it's fatter than the cracker </joey>
<joey> but it's lighter than the cracker. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of like eating card and foam. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Just like flavored. </garnt>
<connor> - Alright Joey, what are we having from yours? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so I've never </connor>
<connor> actually seen this before. - The fuck is that? </connor>
<garnt> - But I know this brand, Baby Star Ramen. </garnt>
<connor> - That looks like a ramen. - Baby Star Ramen is like, </connor>
<connor> yeah it is. </connor>
<connor> So basically Baby Star Ramen is like, </connor>
<connor> the kind of really, what's the word? </connor>
<garnt> It's like the dried out ramen? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh is it the instant ramen? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like the instant ramen looking things </garnt>
<garnt> but it's in a snack form. </garnt>
<joey> And I guess this is like the mazesoba flavored one. </joey>
<joey> Which I've never seen before. - Crank that bitch up. </joey>
<connor> So you just eat it dry? </connor>
<connor> - Oh look at that, it's like... </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - It's like little snacks. </joey>
<joey> It's literally tiny instant ramen. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> That looks next level. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to try this, here you go. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, I hate this is my first concern </connor>
<connor> but this just cannot be even remotely healthy, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Of course it's not healthy. </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally fried instant ramen noodles. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fine. </garnt>
<joey> - I kinda like it. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if you did the same thing, but as a child. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes you would, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I would take instant ramen </garnt>
<garnt> like hardened instant ramen, </garnt>
<garnt> and just kind of like smash it up into little pieces, </garnt>
<garnt> put the like, the seasoning on it and just eat it </garnt>
<garnt> like it was like a snack. </garnt>
<joey> - We had a brand of that, it's called Mami noodles. </joey>
<garnt> They would actually sell packets of that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> It was the best. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you in prison? </garnt>
<garnt> What do you do that for? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it tastes fucking great, fuck off. </garnt>
<joey> - Ashley, you know Mami noodles, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Ashley] I did the same thing when I was young. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, right! - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - Have you never had like, the ramen seasoning, </connor>
<garnt> or the instant noodle seasoning? </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - It tastes fucking bomb. </joey>
<joey> It's like putting the seasoning off-- </joey>
<joey> - It's like MSG. </joey>
<connor> It's like pure MSG. - Pure MSG. </connor>
<connor> - Alright, now I'm salty. </connor>
<garnt> - Ask a kid I was told to never do that </garnt>
<garnt> because it's unhealthy as fuck, but. </garnt>
<joey> - But I guess someone grew up and was like, </joey>
<joey> I can make a product out of that. </joey>
<joey> - This literally tastes like childhood. </joey>
<garnt> It tastes like every Asian childhood. </garnt>
<joey> - It's got a little spice to it too, </joey>
<joey> which is nice. - Ooh, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] So good on salad. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so good on salad. - On salad? </joey>
<joey> - You mean croutons? </joey>
<joey> They're not croutons. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah they're not croutons. </joey>
<joey> They do look like croutons. </joey>
<garnt> - They kind of look like croutons. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a Japanese crouton. </joey>
<joey> - What is this? </joey>
<connor> - Watashi no, what is that? </connor>
<connor> - Karashi? </connor>
<connor> - Karashi, what is that? </connor>
<joey> - That's mustard. </joey>
<joey> - What is this? </joey>
<connor> - I don't actually know </connor>
<connor> what it is. - Crack it open. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, let's crack it open. - This is from Lawson's. </joey>
<connor> I don't know what it is. </connor>
<connor> Our intern just bought it. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] I have no idea what it is either. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] What is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - That just looks like a potato chip I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god, that has a kick to it. </joey>
<connor> - There we go. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Wow. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That has a kick. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not a fan. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you don't like condiments. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> This is like condiments in a snack. </joey>
<connor> - It tastes like mayo and mustard in like a crisp. </connor>
<connor> That's so weird. </connor>
<garnt> - I actually kind of fuck with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fucking horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck is wrong with you guys? </garnt>
<garnt> Condiments. </garnt>
<garnt> Condiments are meant to be, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> are meant to enhance food. </garnt>
<garnt> They're not meant to be the food. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally just ate. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally just ate hardened mustard and mayo. </garnt>
<joey> - I actually kinda like that. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's actually kind good eh? </joey>
<joey> It has a really strong like mustard kick to it. </joey>
<connor> - So I'll pick another one. </connor>
<joey> Cause I have too many. </joey>
<joey> What looks interesting? </joey>
<garnt> That's, we literally just have these in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are those? </garnt>
<garnt> - What's this? </garnt>
<joey> Biscuits? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, the cream sandwiches. </joey>
<joey> The custard creams? </joey>
<joey> Custard cream biscuits? </joey>
<joey> That's what they look like. </joey>
<joey> This is cognac chip seaweed and salt. </joey>
<joey> Konyaku? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Konyaku. </garnt>
<garnt> Low in calories, Natural Lawson's, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Should we give it a shot? </joey>
<joey> - Konyaku does have zero calories, so. </joey>
<connor> - Well, well, well, gamers, let's give it a shot. </connor>
<connor> Garnt, go ahead. </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you very much. </garnt>
<connor> - Go ahead. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Look at that. </garnt>
<connor> - That looks healthy. </connor>
<joey> I don't know if that's a good comment. </joey>
<joey> I can literally see through it. </joey>
<joey> That's how you know how healthy it is. </joey>
<joey> - Okay it doesn't taste like anything. </joey>
<joey> That is the most inoffensive thing ever. </joey>
<garnt> - That tastes like air with like a hint of seaweed. </garnt>
<joey> - Try these, try these. </joey>
<joey> - The moment like moisture hits it, </joey>
<joey> it just dissolves and disappears. </joey>
<garnt> - That was literally like eating nothing. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what it was? </connor>
<connor> A Rice Krispie if it had been scaled up in size, </connor>
<connor> but not with like the added ingredients </connor>
<connor> needed to scale it up. </connor>
<joey> - It's literally just going into Photoshop and going. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Have you seen that video on the internet </joey>
<connor> where someone manages to like, deep fry water? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, someone managed to deep fry water. </garnt>
<connor> Like a packet of water. </connor>
<connor> That's what I imagine that tastes like. </connor>
<connor> - Why would they do that? </connor>
<connor> - Why would they do that? </connor>
<connor> - Alright, I've got here, Castella. </connor>
<joey> - I fucking love these. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what Castella is. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh Castella, that's a specific type of Japanese-- </joey>
<connor> - Because normally it's in like a block. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a block, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Which country is Castella from? </connor>
<joey> - Look it up. </joey>
<garnt> - What is Castella? </garnt>
<joey> - Do you want to explain what it is? </joey>
<garnt> - We'll find out. </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] I did buy one, Castella. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Castella's like a cake of kinds, right? </garnt>
<joey> Or it's like a pastry? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay it looks like a pastry. </garnt>
<connor> - It's really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Japan made it. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it really? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Developed in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so it's made in Japan, </garnt>
<joey> looks like a little pastry. - Dude it's good, try it. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a cream puff. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, let me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mmm. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, that's good. </connor>
<garnt> That is fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Imported, but Spanish made. </garnt>
<connor> - Spanish. </connor>
<garnt> - Spanish, I thought so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Spanish. </garnt>
<connor> - Mmm! </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Portuguese. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Portugal. </joey>
<garnt> - Portugal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that nice or not? </garnt>
<connor> That is a nice clean cake. - That is fucking nice. </connor>
<garnt> One thing I've noticed about the pastry here that I love. </garnt>
<connor> Everything is fluffy as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so fluffy. </connor>
<connor> - I love-- </connor>
<connor> - Yo, give me another one of those. </connor>
<connor> Those are fucking great. </connor>
<connor> You guys want a Castella? </connor>
<connor> - Like from the shortcake, to the bread, </connor>
<garnt> to the whipped cream, to the fucking Castella. </garnt>
<joey> Everything is so fluffy. </joey>
<joey> - Soft and fluffy. </joey>
<joey> - Soft and fluffy. (moans) </joey>
<joey> - I saw a bit just fucking. </joey>
<garnt> - Which is why it's so easy to eat sweets here, </garnt>
<garnt> because they find a different way </garnt>
<garnt> to market different kind of sweets, </garnt>
<garnt> and they all taste fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> You really can't go wrong with sweets. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well I'm gonna try something </garnt>
<joey> from the Family Mart collection. </joey>
<connor> - Whoa, is that an Italian import? </connor>
<connor> What is that? </connor>
<joey> - It's using proper Italian caramel sauce. </joey>
<joey> Caramel popcorn. </joey>
<joey> - Isn't caramel just sugar? </joey>
<joey> - It's literally just fried sugar. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But like, I won't lie. </joey>
<joey> One thing as I've said in the past before, </joey>
<connor> with the movie theaters. </connor>
<connor> I have been very impressed with popcorn in Japan. </connor>
<connor> They have really taken popcorn. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not a huge fan of popcorn, but lemme try. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, Japanese popcorn, if you come here, </connor>
<connor> it's fucking good, yeah? </connor>
<connor> You think popcorn is like, an American staple, </connor>
<connor> like it's good shit. </connor>
<joey> - I actually like that, that's not too sweet. </joey>
<garnt> - That is just popcorn. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> I don't really care about popcorn. </garnt>
<connor> - Go to a movie theater in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Make sure you get popcorn. </connor>
<connor> Get the half and half. </connor>
<garnt> You won't be disappointed. </garnt>
<garnt> - The thing about popcorn to me is that </garnt>
<connor> I'm never the one to buy popcorn. </connor>
<connor> But I'll always take it if someone's got it. </connor>
<connor> - I'm always that guy. - Like I never go out of </connor>
<garnt> my way to be like, okay, I am craving popcorn now, </garnt>
<garnt> I need popcorn. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm more just the guy who's just like, </garnt>
<joey> okay, there's popcorn? </joey>
<garnt> I mean I'm gonna take some. </garnt>
<garnt> If it's there, but I'm never gonna </garnt>
<joey> go out of my way. - Like I'll never order </joey>
<garnt> my own popcorn at a theater, </garnt>
<garnt> but if someone has popcorn, I'm taking it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> If I'm offered I'm not gonna say no. </garnt>
<joey> - I just read what this is called. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - This is the most unappetizing name </joey>
<joey> I've ever heard in my life. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Go on. - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Sugar Rusk. </connor>
<connor> Is the English name. </connor>
<joey> - Rusk? </joey>
<joey> - And it's actually in Japanese as shuga rasshu. </joey>
<garnt> - Shugarasku. </garnt>
<connor> - Shugarasku. </connor>
<garnt> - Are you sure they didn't like, </garnt>
<garnt> just try to spell out Sugar Rush, </garnt>
<garnt> and just kind of fucked it up? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm having a shugarasku! </garnt>
<connor> - Where's the Fortnite chug jug? </connor>
<connor> - Wow, look at that. </connor>
<garnt> - What is it? </garnt>
<garnt> Let me take one. </garnt>
<garnt> What is, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I look at this. </garnt>
<joey> - Mini baguette. </joey>
<connor> - I look at this and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> this should not taste sweet. </connor>
<garnt> If I bite into this and it tastes sweet. </garnt>
<joey> - This is like those like party baguettes </joey>
<joey> where you put like a little bit of like, </joey>
<garnt> salmon on top of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, you put a little salmon, </garnt>
<garnt> you put a little bit of mozzarella cheese. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ooh la la. </garnt>
<joey> - Like at a fancy house party. </joey>
<joey> (crunching) </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, but it's really sweet. </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> It's literally sugar on a baguette. </connor>
<joey> - It's sugar on a baguette. </joey>
<connor> - Nope, nope. </connor>
<garnt> Nope. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's get that out of here. - I'm noping, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm noping the fuck out of there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Get it the fuck out of here. </garnt>
<joey> - That is like, going against like, </joey>
<joey> - That's fucking awful. </joey>
<joey> - everything that France fought for. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - They did not have the French Revolution </connor>
<garnt> so this could happen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's, oh god. </garnt>
<garnt> - To help us out. </garnt>
<joey> Lawson's has a collaboration with, </joey>
<joey> how do you pronounce this? </joey>
<joey> Godiva? </joey>
<joey> Godiva? - Godiva? </joey>
<connor> - Is it Godiva or Godiva? </connor>
<connor> - I think it's Godiva, right? </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Godiva. </joey>
<joey> - No one knows? - It's Godiva. </joey>
<garnt> - So they have like their own collection of like, chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm not gonna lie. </garnt>
<connor> It looks fucking sexy. - Honestly any time they have, </connor>
<garnt> so Family Mart or Lawson's. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait. </joey>
<joey> Gimme that? </joey>
<joey> - What is it called? </joey>
<joey> - That's fucking curry bread. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, what? </joey>
<joey> - It's kare pan. </joey>
<garnt> - Is that curry bread? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's curry bread. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<joey> Oh no. </joey>
<garnt> - This is chocolate bread. </garnt>
<joey> - This is beef curry bread in a chocolate bun. </joey>
<connor> - Yo crack that open, let's give it a shot. </connor>
<garnt> Let's give it a shot. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh I gotta try this. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<connor> This is gonna be a Trash Taste first here. </connor>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I have literally never-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god, </garnt>
<garnt> yo, show it to the camera. - Oh my god! </garnt>
<garnt> - Pull it out. - What is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - What is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's... </garnt>
<joey> That looks like a donut! </joey>
<connor> - It looks like curry bread, but, with, </connor>
<connor> if it's like made out of chocolate. </connor>
<connor> - Open up a napkin, rip that shit open. </connor>
<garnt> - So to explain what curry bread is normally like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's literally, you take Japanese curry. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you deep fry it in katsu, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Katsu bread, and then, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like a jelly filled donut, </garnt>
<garnt> except, imagine the filling was curry. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's fucking good. </garnt>
<joey> - Normal curry bread is fucking amazing. </joey>
<connor> This is not normal curry bread. </connor>
<joey> - This is </joey>
<connor> an abomination. </connor>
<connor> - I'm excited to, </connor>
<joey> I'm actually excited, 'cause I - I'm kind of interested. </joey>
<connor> wanna know what the fuck has gone wrong. </connor>
<joey> - Like how is the synergy of chocolate and curry </joey>
<connor> gonna mix? </connor>
<garnt> - If I like this, what does it say about me? </garnt>
<garnt> - I will say for experience points. </garnt>
<garnt> One of the worst combinations I've had </garnt>
<connor> was when I went to this Wisconsin state fair, in the USA. </connor>
<connor> And they were selling chocolate bacon. </connor>
<connor> They would literally take bacon, </connor>
<garnt> and dip it in chocolate. - That ain't it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm about to find out if there is a worse combination </garnt>
<garnt> right now than chocolate bacon. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know man, </joey>
<joey> chocolate bacon sounds fucking horrible. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Well chocolate curry bread? </garnt>
<garnt> That also sounds horrible. </garnt>
<joey> - Alright. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay, look at that. </joey>
<connor> So from the looks of it, </connor>
<garnt> it literally looks like curry in between chocolate bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - That smells like, </garnt>
<connor> just a contradiction. </connor>
<connor> Let's give it a bite. </connor>
<connor> Let's bite into it, boys. </connor>
<connor> Oh that's fucked up. </connor>
<connor> That's fucked up. </connor>
<garnt> That ain't right. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't like that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - Do you like that, Joey? </connor>
<connor> - I kinda like it. </connor>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<connor> - Wait. </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<garnt> - That's awful. </garnt>
<garnt> That was awful, that's awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is so awful, oh my god. </garnt>
<joey> Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if I'm just fucked up, </joey>
<joey> but that just tastes like curry bread to me. </joey>
<joey> - No it tastes, what are you talking about? </joey>
<joey> - I legitimately can't taste the chocolate. </joey>
<connor> - I can't taste the chocolate. </connor>
<garnt> All I get is like a weird bitter after tone. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's even worse than chocolate bread </garnt>
<garnt> because it's not even sweet. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the, you can taste the cocoa in the chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you bite into it and then you get a </garnt>
<garnt> mouthful of curry. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the worst. </garnt>
<connor> It's an aftertaste that you, ugh. </connor>
<garnt> - I like legitimately can't taste the chocolate at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - You taste the cocoa though, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I bet with this one, </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna be rich. </garnt>
<connor> This is the chocolate bread, </connor>
<connor> and it's their collaboration with Godiva. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh god, get that away from me. </garnt>
<joey> That literally felt... </joey>
<joey> - To me, that just tastes like a curry bread. </joey>
<garnt> So I liked it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh ho ho. - Oh ho! </garnt>
<garnt> - Now that - That looks good. </garnt>
<joey> - is a heart attack. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That is a heart attack </joey>
<joey> in a piece of bread. - Did you get a whiff of that? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That was heavy chocolate. </joey>
<garnt> - That's how chocolate should look like. </garnt>
<garnt> Chocolate bread, yes please. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, I get like a nosebleed </joey>
<joey> after eating one piece of Godiva chocolate, </joey>
<joey> let alone this whole fucking bread. </joey>
<joey> - The chocolate bread which actually, </joey>
<joey> looks pretty fucking good. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah that looks good. </joey>
<garnt> - That looks very good. - But that's because </garnt>
<garnt> they're not being adventurous with fucking curry bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - Look, if there's one thing you shouldn't put </garnt>
<garnt> in chocolate bread, it's curry. </garnt>
<connor> - Here's a nice cross section. </connor>
<garnt> We've got some </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate paste here. - Oh god, that is very strong. </garnt>
<garnt> - Chocolate paste on chocolate bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - It smells like heaven. </garnt>
<connor> - Just took a wish. </connor>
<garnt> A whiff, sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, that's... </joey>
<joey> - [Siri] Chocolate is spelled C-H-O-C-O-L... </joey>
<connor> (stifled laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Okay, that's really good. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly? </joey>
<connor> A little disappointed. </connor>
<joey> - Really? - Okay, no. </joey>
<connor> No. </connor>
<joey> - You don't like that? </joey>
<joey> I really like it. </joey>
<connor> - The chocolate tastes very artificial. </connor>
<garnt> - The chocolate tastes good. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like the bread. </garnt>
<joey> That tastes not as good as I, </joey>
<joey> It's chewy bread as well. </joey>
<joey> It's not the fluffy bread. - I like the chewy bread. </joey>
<joey> - Chewy bread doesn't taste good </joey>
<garnt> with the chocolate they put in there. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd fuck with it. </connor>
<garnt> - Joey, you fuck with anything, Joey. </garnt>
<connor> - Joey's like, is that fucking weird? </connor>
<garnt> I'd fuck with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this seasoned vomit? </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I'ma try it. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, I'd fuck with that. </garnt>
<connor> I'd fuck with that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm the kind of guy who's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna offend anyone. </connor>
<connor> So if I went to another country and they're like, </connor>
<connor> oh, this is what we eat. </connor>
<garnt> And it's just vomit with seasoning. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be like, well, I mean, </garnt>
<joey> I don't wanna offend anyone. </joey>
<joey> So I'll give it a shot. </joey>
<joey> And I'd be like, it's great. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you don't have to like it at all. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, just trying it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just trying it I think </garnt>
<garnt> is more of an appreciation to the culture </garnt>
<garnt> than anything else. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was presented here was a massive disappointment </garnt>
<garnt> from the usual kind of Godiva. </garnt>
<connor> - It looks like sex. </connor>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> This looks like sex. </garnt>
<connor> Tastes like it should be like fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> And how many calories is this bad boy? </connor>
<connor> 254 calories. </connor>
<connor> 31 grams of sugar. </connor>
<connor> Oh carbohydrates, and 29 grams of sugar. </connor>
<joey> - Damn. </joey>
<joey> The black sugar poop pieces were less healthier than that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I know. </garnt>
<joey> And I've got here some almond cookies? </joey>
<joey> - Yo, okay, I'd fuck with that. </joey>
<joey> - But in Japanese it's called almond balls. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, why do they look like that? </garnt>
<garnt> What's with the? - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't look like cookies. </garnt>
<joey> - They look like bonbons. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah they look like fucking bonbons, don't they? </garnt>
<joey> Okay let's... </joey>
<joey> - I do fuck with anything that has almonds in it. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just getting so full. </connor>
<joey> - Almonds are easily my favorite kind of nut. </joey>
<connor> - Oh that's kind of nice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, almond is a good nut. </connor>
<connor> - Almond is like... </connor>
<connor> - Top tier. </connor>
<garnt> - One of the top tier nuts. </garnt>
<connor> - S-tier nut. </connor>
<garnt> - If we were gonna like, tier the nuts, almonds up there. </garnt>
<connor> - Alright let's give it a shot boys. </connor>
<connor> Whoa. </connor>
<connor> That was weird. </connor>
<connor> - It's got this, covered in powder sugar. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So I thought, I don't know why I thought </garnt>
<garnt> it was gonna be soft on the inside. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just shortbread. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what this tastes like? </joey>
<joey> It tastes like something you'd buy in Hawaii. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's like, very like-- </connor>
<joey> - But why Hawaii? </joey>
<joey> - It tastes like somewhere you'd go to like </joey>
<joey> a food festival. </joey>
<connor> And they're like, here's our new weird thing. </connor>
<connor> We mash up almonds, put them in a bowl, </connor>
<connor> and put sugar on them, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I mean, yeah, sure. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, it tastes very like, </joey>
<joey> kind of like tropical. </joey>
<garnt> - It's good. - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's good, but like, why? </garnt>
<garnt> Just eat an almond, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - It just tastes like shortbread </garnt>
<connor> with a bit of almond in there. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Bang on, that's spot on, actually. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it's shortbread with almond </connor>
<joey> and some frosting inside. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's literally, - Wanna try, Meilyne? </joey>
<joey> - You literally just described what it was. </joey>
<connor> - I just described it as a whole. </connor>
<garnt> - That's okay. </garnt>
<connor> I mean that's, you know. </connor>
<connor> - It's okay. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna go and buy that, but I'll eat it. </connor>
<garnt> - Now we are getting to the point where </garnt>
<garnt> you might recognize some of these brands. </garnt>
<joey> So I've got here some Kit-Kat. </joey>
<joey> - Is that sweet potato? </joey>
<garnt> - What is this flavor? - That's sweet potato, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's beni imo, which is like red potato, I think? </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's called taro in English. </joey>
<garnt> - You always-- </garnt>
<joey> - It's just sweet potato, okay. </joey>
<connor> - This is sweet potato Kit-Kat. </connor>
<connor> - Whenever you see this paste or this color, </connor>
<connor> it's always sweet potato, I've learned in Japan. </connor>
<connor> They love it. </connor>
<connor> They put it on everything. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, sweet potato kinda slaps, but... </garnt>
<garnt> - Whoa. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whew, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whoa. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a ball of Kit-Kat. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a Kit-Kat ball. </connor>
<connor> - Bite that in half, </connor>
<connor> let me get a cross section going on. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Okay it's like wafer. </connor>
<connor> Yeah it's good. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I would eat that. </connor>
<joey> - You can't go wrong with a Kit-Kat I find. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like this is just a Kit-Kat. </garnt>
<joey> - It is. </joey>
<garnt> - No I mean. </garnt>
<joey> - It's literally just, </joey>
<joey> they took a Kit-Kat and they went (grunts). </joey>
<connor> - Honestly? </connor>
<connor> I would say that tastes better than a Kit-Kat. </connor>
<joey> - I'd prefer that over a regular Kit-Kat. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I would say. </connor>
<connor> - Is that one or one bag? </connor>
<joey> - One bag. </joey>
<connor> - I was gonna say. </connor>
<joey> - 244 calories for one ball? </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I was like, oh my god. - Holy shit! </joey>
<connor> - I'm gonna go to the toilet right now. </connor>
<joey> - All three of us would've had a heart attack. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my god, I was getting scared there, </connor>
<connor> I was like, why does this taste so good? </connor>
<joey> - Alright, I got, I've never seen these before. </joey>
<garnt> - Ahh. - Ahh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some fancy shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Smokey Pretz. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Pretz, this is smoked potato butter flavored. </garnt>
<joey> - Smoked potato butter! </joey>
<joey> - Smoked potato butter. </joey>
<joey> - Pretz are just like basically... </joey>
<connor> - Savory Pocky. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, (babbles) I'm losing words right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Savory Pocky. </garnt>
<garnt> - I prefer Pretz over Pocky, personally. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean they're savory. </connor>
<joey> - If you go to the supermarket, </joey>
<joey> you'll see that flavor, </joey>
<joey> and you'll always see the pizza flavor </joey>
<joey> which they have. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So they have pizza flavored sticks. </joey>
<garnt> Just eat a fucking pizza. </garnt>
<connor> - Just eat a pizza. </connor>
<garnt> - Pizza shouldn't be a flavor. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there's different flavors of pizza, </garnt>
<garnt> so what is pizza flavor? </garnt>
<garnt> - I quite like that. </garnt>
<joey> - I like that. </joey>
<joey> - I hate that I like that. </joey>
<joey> - You can never go wrong with Pretz, honestly. </joey>
<joey> If you're looking for a savory snack, </joey>
<garnt> Pretz is the way to go. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh that aftertaste is gross. </connor>
<connor> I'm getting really bad aftertaste from that. </connor>
<garnt> - What's this flavor again? </garnt>
<joey> - Smokey potato butter. </joey>
<joey> I can taste the smokiness of it. </joey>
<garnt> - I can taste the butter as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh Jesus, that's awful. </garnt>
<garnt> Another one from Natural Lawson, </garnt>
<garnt> so there are two types of Lawsons. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm getting very full, gentlemen. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> We're nearly done, we're nearly done. </garnt>
<garnt> There is the Natural Lawson's, </garnt>
<garnt> which tends to have more healthy options, healthy snacks, </garnt>
<garnt> healthy meals. </garnt>
<connor> It's actually pretty good. </connor>
<connor> It's a pretty cool marketing strategy. </connor>
<connor> And so they have their own brand of stuff </connor>
<connor> and this is their cranberry cookies with GABA. </connor>
<joey> - Cranberry cookies? - GABA? </joey>
<connor> - GABA it says. </connor>
<joey> - Isn't GABA like the stuff they put in energy drinks? </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah it is isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - Kuranberi kuki. </connor>
<joey> Is what it says in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - Very good Japanese. </joey>
<joey> Nihongo Jouzu! </joey>
<connor> - I was looking for GABA. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, where's GABA? </connor>
<connor> - It's literally at the top, it says GABA. </connor>
<joey> - GABA. </joey>
<garnt> - You wanna point it at the camera? </garnt>
<garnt> - They literally spell GABA in English. </garnt>
<joey> - They're just like fuck it. </joey>
<garnt> - Just gave up on learning the language. </garnt>
<connor> - [Meilyne] It's enriched chocolate. </connor>
<joey> - Enriched chocolate? </joey>
<joey> - That's what GABA is? </joey>
<joey> - It has aminobutyric acid? </joey>
<garnt> - Aminobutyric acid. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I know exactly what that is. </garnt>
<connor> - This is supposed to be healthy, so, </connor>
<connor> what is it, like... </connor>
<joey> - Yeah so the stuff at Natural Lawson </joey>
<joey> is way more healthy, so it should be healthier. </joey>
<connor> - So, one of these is, is that a one, one bag? </connor>
<connor> 65 calories, is that right? </connor>
<connor> 17.5 grams. - Oh that's nothing. </connor>
<connor> - Oh that might be. </connor>
<garnt> I'll just give it a shot anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> You can tell me Joey, I'll hand it to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - There you go. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> Ooh, this looks like a diet. </joey>
<connor> This looks like a diet. </connor>
<connor> - Like a belVita? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this looks like a diet snack. </connor>
<garnt> It looks like a diet bar honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - How many calories, is it bag, or like, what is it? </connor>
<joey> - So it's per meal. </joey>
<joey> - Meal? - Meal. </joey>
<joey> - Which is 17 and a half grams. </joey>
<joey> Oh, this is 35 grams, so, okay, so, two. </joey>
<connor> - So this is 100. </connor>
<connor> - So half a bag is 65 calories. </connor>
<joey> - That's not bad. </joey>
<connor> - For what looks to be like a very heavy snack. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's have a taste. </garnt>
<connor> - That's literally like a belVita. </connor>
<connor> - It is a belVita. </connor>
<garnt> - What's a belVita? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like the diet like, cookies, </garnt>
<garnt> or diet biscuits with like, </garnt>
<garnt> they have them in every country. </garnt>
<joey> - This tastes something like my grandma would've had. </joey>
<garnt> It's like grandma, can I have some snacks? </garnt>
<connor> And she's like here you go. </connor>
<connor> - That's not actually, I quite like that. </connor>
<joey> - I like that. </joey>
<joey> - That's nice. - I like that. </joey>
<joey> - Actually, if I had a Natural Lawson's closer to me, </joey>
<joey> I'd probably get that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's actually, fuck. </connor>
<joey> - Cranberry flavored stuff is actually really good. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I'm taking that home with me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Put it in a little Ziploc bag. </connor>
<connor> Fantastic. </connor>
<joey> - Should we talk about </joey>
<joey> some of the stuff at the front here? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, yeah, I wanna talk about this. </garnt>
<garnt> I already like these. </garnt>
<garnt> These are the ramune flavored... </garnt>
<garnt> - Candy? </garnt>
<garnt> - Candy. </garnt>
<joey> - I have an ancient video on my channel </joey>
<connor> from like six years ago where I bought like </connor>
<connor> a box of those candy. </connor>
<connor> And I said to myself, </connor>
<joey> would I be able to change ramune candy back to ramune? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> This ancient video on my channel, </joey>
<garnt> it's still up there. - What is this, </garnt>
<garnt> a Vsauce video? </garnt>
<garnt> - So what I did was I emptied out like 30 of these </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] No don't put it on the table, </joey>
<joey> you'll get grease on there. - into a ball. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, oh god. </joey>
<joey> - I emptied like 30 of these into a ball, </joey>
<joey> and I crushed them into a powder, </joey>
<joey> and then I mixed it with carbonated water, </joey>
<joey> to see if it would go back into a ramune. </joey>
<connor> Spoilers! </connor>
<joey> It doesn't go back into a ramune. </joey>
<connor> - I only ever had the drink a few times. </connor>
<connor> It's quite nice. </connor>
<garnt> - Ramune is basically what, </garnt>
<garnt> how would you describe ramune? </garnt>
<garnt> It's basically like Japanese lemonade? </garnt>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Japanese lemonade. </garnt>
<garnt> I love these. </garnt>
<garnt> This. </garnt>
<garnt> - You love this? </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude I grew up with this shit. </garnt>
<joey> - This is like eating a kid's cereal. </joey>
<joey> - I eat this, and I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> I taste a childhood I never had. </garnt>
<connor> - No wonder you don't like tengone, </connor>
<connor> because you're fucking eating kid's shit all the time! </connor>
<connor> What, were you drinking like breast milk still all the time? </connor>
<connor> What's going on? </connor>
<joey> - It's a secret. - I would eat this. </joey>
<joey> What Connor has right there, Choco-babies. </joey>
<connor> - I love these. </connor>
<joey> - These are great. </joey>
<joey> - These are like, </joey>
<connor> these are terrible though, 'cause like, </connor>
<connor> you think you're not eating a lot of chocolate. </connor>
<connor> But it's so fucking dense. </connor>
<garnt> - I look at this and I thought </garnt>
<garnt> it was gonna be a Tic-Tac. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - The first time I tried it I thought it was, </connor>
<joey> it looks like a Tic-Tac. </joey>
<joey> And then you bite into it and it's just. </joey>
<joey> It's just like-- - It's pure chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - Pure chocolate is rare though. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the most inoffensive chocolate that it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the good chocolate you would eat as a kid. </garnt>
<connor> - Gimme gimme. </connor>
<joey> You're opening it. </joey>
<joey> There's a tag at the bottom. </joey>
<joey> - There was a tag, it doesn't matter, I did it. </joey>
<joey> - You did it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, literally just, Tic Tac chocolate version. </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> - It makes chocolate way too easy to eat. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you just. </garnt>
<garnt> - The supermarkets have the big versions. </garnt>
<garnt> And if I get them, it's almost impossible </garnt>
<garnt> not to eat it in one day. - 'Cause it's like, </garnt>
<connor> it's like eating sprinklings. </connor>
<connor> - Oh that's my childhood right there, lads. </connor>
<connor> - Like this big as well. </connor>
<joey> - Tiny. </joey>
<joey> - That's my childhood right there. </joey>
<joey> - That's really nice milk chocolate. </joey>
<connor> Mmm. </connor>
<joey> That's good shit. </joey>
<joey> - The other thing though that is my childhood, </joey>
<joey> is these things, Umaibo. </joey>
<connor> - Oh I hate these. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> These suck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you tried these? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, you can try it. </connor>
<joey> - So these. </joey>
<joey> They're literally called Umaibo, </joey>
<joey> which means tasty stick. </joey>
<joey> That's literally what it's called. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's basically, oh god, </garnt>
<garnt> how do you even explain it? </garnt>
<garnt> - So basically there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> these have been around since like the fucking 20's. </garnt>
<joey> These are ancient. </joey>
<joey> And they're 10 yen each. </joey>
<joey> Alright? </joey>
<joey> Fucking nothing. </joey>
<connor> But feel how light that is. </connor>
<joey> - These are the Space Raiders. </joey>
<connor> These are the Space Raiders of Japan I think. </connor>
<joey> - This is packaged air. </joey>
<joey> - If you throw this high enough into the air, </joey>
<joey> it'll just go off to the stratosphere. </joey>
<connor> - This has no weight at all. </connor>
<connor> - What's the actual weight written on the package? </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<joey> Six grams. </joey>
<joey> - Six grams. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Six grams, but I guarantee-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure most of the grams </joey>
<joey> is the packaging. - Is the packaging. </joey>
<joey> - Is the fucking packaging, </joey>
<garnt> I'm literally holding air here. </garnt>
<joey> - So I have the corn potage flavored. </joey>
<joey> Which is like corn. </joey>
<garnt> - Dude this just looks like, </garnt>
<connor> these just look like Monster's crisps. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh mine's, I got the cheese one. </garnt>
<joey> - You should try it. </joey>
<garnt> - What is this flavor? </garnt>
<joey> - This is the mentaiko flavor, the cod roe flavor. </joey>
<garnt> - This is just Monster's crisps, isn't it? </garnt>
<connor> - No it's like Monster's crisps </connor>
<connor> if they were made by Space Raiders. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Did you have Space Raiders in Australia? </joey>
<joey> - I've heard of those, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<connor> - Alright, let's try it. </connor>
<connor> (crunching) </connor>
<connor> - It's a big Wotsit. </connor>
<joey> - It takes away all the moisture in your mouth though. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, It's a Monster's crisp. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a Wotsit. </connor>
<connor> It's a big Wotsit. </connor>
<connor> This isn't cheese, it's just a Wotsit. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I can understand why that was your childhood. </garnt>
<garnt> - Americans, this is a Cheeto. </garnt>
<joey> That's what this is. - I honestly, dude, imagine, </joey>
<garnt> you're like a five year old, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You're given like 100 yen of like, just, you know, </garnt>
<connor> pocket money from your grandma or something. </connor>
<connor> - Of course you're buying 10 of these. </connor>
<connor> - I'm buying 10 of these. </connor>
<joey> Like these motherfuckers are gonna fill me up until dinner. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, who doesn't love fucking Wotsits </garnt>
<connor> or Monster's crisps or whatever? </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Just cheese sticks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh chikama, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I can guarantee though, </connor>
<connor> that these are probably not the best tasting cheese. </connor>
<joey> - Look, I also grew up with these, </joey>
<joey> but after about age eight, I stopped eating them, </joey>
<joey> because I had proper cheese in Australia. </joey>
<joey> - When you have real cheese, you can't eat this. </joey>
<joey> - But if you're American, </joey>
<connor> and not from Wisconsin. - But this is not just cheese, </connor>
<joey> this is cheese with kamaboko, which is fish cake. </joey>
<connor> (sighs) </connor>
<connor> - You shouldn't have said that, </connor>
<joey> you should've let him try it. </joey>
<connor> - Just give it a go. </connor>
<joey> - Wanna try it, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - Sure. </joey>
<joey> - You're on the show, you can't say no any more. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't say no. </garnt>
<joey> I'm actually </joey>
<garnt> really fucking full. - Look at that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck is this? </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck? - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Kamachi, kama. </garnt>
<garnt> - How the hell do I describe. - I've never had one of these. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do you eat these, Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna be honest. </garnt>
<connor> This is probably the least appetizing looking thing </connor>
<joey> that we've had on today. </joey>
<joey> - Ugh. </joey>
<joey> - You kinda just rip it open like that. </joey>
<connor> - We've had some pretty gross shit, </connor>
<connor> but this looks vile. </connor>
<connor> This actually looks disgusting. </connor>
<garnt> - This looks like on the same level as </garnt>
<connor> squirty cheese, almost. - What's the ratio of cheese </connor>
<connor> to like, fish? </connor>
<joey> - You don't wanna smell them. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - How do I open this? </garnt>
<joey> - This immediately, just like, grab the top and just, </joey>
<joey> down like a banana. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> These boys are strong. </joey>
<joey> Here, I'll open them up for you, there you go. </joey>
<garnt> - Let me get this one. </garnt>
<joey> - There you go, just get a knife. </joey>
<garnt> - Fucking hell. - Oh okay. </garnt>
<connor> - Fort Knox should be... </connor>
<garnt> - This actually tastes, this actually smells </garnt>
<joey> close to vomit, I think. </joey>
<joey> As close to vomit </joey>
<joey> as you can-- - It's like cheesy vomit, </joey>
<garnt> isn't it? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's it. </joey>
<joey> - Alright, I'm gonna have one. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I haven't had these. </garnt>
<connor> - Smell it, smell it. </connor>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't had one of these since I was about eight. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, is this gonna be cheese flavored vomit </garnt>
<garnt> like I imagine it to be? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It tastes exactly how I remember it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<connor> - Boomer tries Japanese snack for first time. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly it doesn't taste as bad as I thought it would. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - It tastes like you're eating plastic. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It tastes like you're eating plastic </connor>
<garnt> and then you get the fish aftertaste. </garnt>
<connor> - Where is the cheese in that? </connor>
<connor> I don't taste any fucking cheese. </connor>
<garnt> - That was not cheese, that was plastic. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a plastic fish sausage. </joey>
<garnt> - That's fish flavored plastic. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have a Melty Kiss, as they're called. </garnt>
<garnt> - Meruti Kissu! </garnt>
<garnt> - Meruti Kissu, as they say in all the commercials. </garnt>
<connor> - And I don't particularly like these. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] You don't? </connor>
<connor> - It's just, mochi, right? </connor>
<connor> Am I eating mochi, kind of? </connor>
<joey> - It's like mochi with like chocolate on it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, well. </connor>
<connor> Let's give it a shot, shall we? </connor>
<joey> - You're not a fan of mochi? </joey>
<connor> - Mochi's hit or miss for me. </connor>
<connor> - Of course, because it's Japan, </connor>
<joey> they're individually packaged. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Love the packaging. </garnt>
<connor> - Say what you will. </connor>
<garnt> It's fucking pretty. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the box makes you wanna get it. </garnt>
<connor> - The thing about Melty Kiss </connor>
<garnt> is Melty Kiss is one of those brands in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> that is always seasonal. </garnt>
<garnt> They always have a seasonal flavor of Melty Kiss. </garnt>
<garnt> You can tell what time period you are in </garnt>
<garnt> when you go to a supermarket or a konbini, </garnt>
<garnt> and you see what Melty Kisses are on for sale. </garnt>
<joey> - And as the name suggests, </joey>
<joey> they melt pretty fucking fast. </joey>
<joey> - So I really like it. </joey>
<garnt> It's... </garnt>
<joey> - Mmm. </joey>
<joey> I like it. </joey>
<garnt> - It is just basically mochi, with chocolate. </garnt>
<connor> - Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. </connor>
<connor> Mm. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just basically-- </connor>
<connor> - I'd fuck with that. </connor>
<connor> - Actually you know what? </connor>
<connor> That's really good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what Melty Kiss you have. </connor>
<connor> - I think I had an awful like tasting one. </connor>
<connor> This is just chocolate, this is fucking good. </connor>
<garnt> - This is chocolate truffle. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is really rich chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just chocolate truffle, right? </garnt>
<joey> - There's no mochi in this is there? </joey>
<joey> Is there? - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - There might be a mochi variant. </joey>
<connor> - Oh I thought it was mochi. </connor>
<joey> So I tasted that, I didn't taste any mochi. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a truffle, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah that's just chocolate truffle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's just truffle butter </garnt>
<garnt> with chocolate. - I'd fuck with that, </garnt>
<joey> and thank god they're all individually wrapped </joey>
<joey> so we can enjoy those later. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I also have, this is mochi though. </joey>
<joey> - That's the mochi. </joey>
<joey> - That's mochi. - There you go. </joey>
<joey> - What is this? </joey>
<joey> Mochi, mochi... </joey>
<joey> Oh my god, I can't read fucking the font. </joey>
<joey> - Come on, you're Nihongo Jouzu. </joey>
<connor> You can do it. </connor>
<joey> - Shi-yo-ra? </joey>
<joey> Shiyora? </joey>
<connor> - Shiora. </connor>
<connor> - Shiora? </connor>
<joey> - Shoyura? - So cute just trying to, </joey>
<joey> for them trying to figure it out. </joey>
<connor> - Bro, it's the fancy fonts fuck me up in Japanese so much. </connor>
<connor> - It's shokora. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh that's ko! </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - That looks like a yu doesn't it? </connor>
<joey> - I thought that was yu as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yu would be, yu, the bottom would be more... </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I thought it was. </garnt>
<garnt> It's got a little bit there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember the yu, </garnt>
<garnt> it looks like an iron. - That's fancy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Looks like an iron! </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how I remember the yu, it looks like an iron! </garnt>
<joey> - That's cute. </joey>
<joey> So it's separated into cute little packages. </joey>
<joey> - Oh cute. - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, that's like perfect for dates. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah man. </joey>
<joey> You and your GF, rocking out with the mochi. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, how do you feel about mochi? </joey>
<connor> - Mid tier. </connor>
<connor> - It depends. </connor>
<connor> It depends on the type. </connor>
<connor> Like mochi ice cream and like regular mochi. </connor>
<garnt> And like sweet mochis is like completely different </garnt>
<garnt> in my opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so what is mochi again? </garnt>
<joey> - Mochi is just rice. </joey>
<joey> It's rice pudding. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah so, mochi's just rice pudding. </garnt>
<joey> - So basically they grab mochi rice, </joey>
<joey> which is a specific type of rice. </joey>
<garnt> And they just fucking mash it with a hammer </garnt>
<garnt> until it turns into mochi. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's good. </garnt>
<joey> - It's very chewy. </joey>
<garnt> - This is good shit. </garnt>
<garnt> That's clean. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm. </garnt>
<garnt> - How I always feel about mochi </garnt>
<garnt> is that it's just very inoffensive. </garnt>
<garnt> I would never not eat mochi. </garnt>
<garnt> But I would never go out my way to get it as well. </garnt>
<joey> - But you know like a lot of old people die </joey>
<garnt> from choking on mochi. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can see why. </garnt>
<garnt> - So when you're eating mochi </garnt>
<garnt> make sure you like-- - Shit fights back. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Make sure you like, properly chew this shit, </joey>
<joey> otherwise it will get stuck in your throat. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sorry I'm just laughing 'cause I saw </connor>
<connor> one of Garnt's item, I keep forgetting it's called this. </connor>
<connor> It's called the chocolate pound cake. </connor>
<connor> For some reason that feels so, </connor>
<connor> that has such a sexual energy to it. </connor>
<joey> - That is like, I never thought about that, </joey>
<joey> I was like, yeah, poundo cake, of course. </joey>
<connor> But when you say it in English, it's really weird. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the chocolate pound cake. </garnt>
<connor> - Chocolate pound cake. </connor>
<garnt> - Yo girl, you wanna get some chocolate pound cake? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah see? </connor>
<garnt> That has like, I've never had a food item </garnt>
<connor> that has raw sexual energy. </connor>
<connor> But that has it. </connor>
<joey> - Ay yo shawty! </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Y'all want a chocolate pound cake? </connor>
<garnt> - What that pound cake do? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Honestly? </connor>
<connor> I mean it's just cake. </connor>
<connor> - That's just a fat block of chocolate. </connor>
<connor> Yeah I'll fuck with that, gimme that. </connor>
<connor> - I know what this tastes like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I know what this tastes like. </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> When Garnt has run out of energy. </garnt>
<connor> He'll run into the 7-11 or like, Family Mart, </connor>
<connor> and just buy one of these and just devour it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know how you do that to be honest. </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes I just need a sugar rush. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a brownie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That literally just tastes like a brownie, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's good though. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's just a brownie. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't need to describe that taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's way more sexually sounding than a brownie. </garnt>
<joey> The pound cake. </joey>
<garnt> - Pound cake does sound better than brownie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hold up the camera. </garnt>
<connor> That's nice, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That's not bad. </joey>
<joey> - That's sexy. </joey>
<joey> - Hmm. </joey>
<garnt> - Alright, I think we are </garnt>
<joey> almost done, right? - Joey, what'd you have? </joey>
<garnt> - I've got these like, </garnt>
<connor> chocolate pies. - Pain de chocolat? </connor>
<joey> - Choco pie. </joey>
<connor> - Oh god no. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That looks fucking awful. - That just looks like </garnt>
<garnt> a pain de chocolat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like not as good. </garnt>
<garnt> - France is crying right now. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't really fuck with these to be honest. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I'm gonna be honest. </joey>
<joey> I don't need to try that. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't need to try that. - Let's not open that. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's open the stuff that is like, only... </joey>
<joey> - What is that, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> What the fuck is that Kit-Kat? </joey>
<garnt> - This is a melon Kit-Kat. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're kidding me. </garnt>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<joey> - Melon Kit-Kat? </joey>
<joey> - They have, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's a Hokkaido melon Kit-Kat, too, </joey>
<joey> that's the good melons. </joey>
<garnt> - See the thing about Hokkaido melons </garnt>
<joey> is that it is expensive as fuck here. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause apparently it </joey>
<connor> tastes fucking super amazing. - Open that bitch up. </connor>
<joey> - Hokkaido melons, for reference is like, </joey>
<joey> one of like, maybe about that big. </joey>
<garnt> But a regular thing will cost you like two, $300. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like the top class of melon. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh this is the ball variety that we tried before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this just gonna taste like Kit-Kat again? </garnt>
<joey> - Whoa. </joey>
<joey> - I'd fuck with that. </joey>
<joey> I love melon flavored shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Holy shit that's good. </garnt>
<joey> - That's really good. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my god. </garnt>
<joey> - That might be one of the best ones I've tried. </joey>
<joey> Hey, gimme some of that. </joey>
<garnt> - That's probably the best Kit-Kat </garnt>
<connor> I've ever had in my life. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck. </connor>
<connor> - That has such a clean flavor to it. </connor>
<joey> Like-- </joey>
<joey> - That straight up tastes like you're eating a melon. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<connor> That's crazy. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, the crunchiness of a biscuit and a Kit-Kat, </connor>
<garnt> but with the clean taste of a fruit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't... </garnt>
<garnt> - That's really good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know how you bite </garnt>
<connor> into a melon, and it just-- - Fuck, Kit-Kat, goddamn. </connor>
<connor> - You know how you bite into a melon and it just like, </connor>
<joey> it feels like clean, </joey>
<joey> because it feels like you're eating </joey>
<joey> like a really watery fruit. </joey>
<joey> For some reason that was a completely dry snack </joey>
<joey> that we just had, </joey>
<joey> but it felt watery. - But it felt watery, right? </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - What the fuck is this Sugar Butter Sand Tree? </connor>
<garnt> - We don't need to try that. </garnt>
<connor> - It's called Sugar Butter Sand Tree. </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck is that? </joey>
<joey> - It just looks like a custard cream. </joey>
<connor> - Oh it's a 7-11 brand too. </connor>
<connor> - Oh fuck that. </connor>
<connor> I have... </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> Wasabi sticks, it looks like. </connor>
<connor> Is that cheese and wasabi? </connor>
<joey> - Oh that's Jagariko, </joey>
<connor> which is like a brand of like, savory sticks. </connor>
<joey> And I guess this is wasabi shoyu flavored. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you like wasabi snacks? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do not get them. </garnt>
<joey> - I like the wasabi like, beans. </joey>
<joey> The wasabi seed, like flavored things. </joey>
<garnt> I forgot what they were called, but like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know what you're talking about. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the peanut and the like, wasabi food. </joey>
<garnt> - There's like beans that are covered in wasabi. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I fuck with those. </joey>
<joey> - Let me smell this bad boy. - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> For me, wasabi just doesn't feel </garnt>
<garnt> like something that should be snacked on. </garnt>
<garnt> (crunching) </garnt>
<garnt> That's basic as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you taste anything? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't taste anything. </connor>
<connor> I taste the wasabi, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I barely, oh a little bit, tiny bit. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, there it is. </garnt>
<joey> - Because when we eat something wasabi flavored, </joey>
<joey> we're used to the whole like, kickback, right? </joey>
<joey> But this is just like, literally, </joey>
<joey> just a hint of wasabi flavor. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly? </garnt>
<joey> - It's not too overpowering, I like that. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly? </joey>
<garnt> Fuck yes. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally was just shitting on wasabi snacks </garnt>
<garnt> literally five minutes ago </garnt>
<joey> and that's because the wasabi, </joey>
<garnt> normally what happens with wasabi snacks is that </garnt>
<garnt> it overpowers whatever you're eating. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I can probably taste the soy sauce </joey>
<garnt> in that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I ate that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, I can't even taste the wasabi, </garnt>
<garnt> but then, you get that aftertaste. </garnt>
<joey> - You literally just did like the kombucha girl like, </joey>
<joey> mm-hmm? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> You're like, ew, wasabi, actually, </joey>
<garnt> these are pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah because, you know when you have bad sushi, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you kind of like try to overpower it with wasabi </garnt>
<joey> just to get rid of the taste </joey>
<garnt> of the bad sushi. - No, I don't do that. </garnt>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> Who does that? </joey>
<joey> Do you do that? </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<connor> - But like, I don't find myself </connor>
<connor> in a bad sushi restaurant. </connor>
<connor> I know a good one. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<connor> - Joey was Louie. </connor>
<joey> He didn't go into a bad sushi. </joey>
<joey> - I don't go to that 100 yen bullshit sushi. </joey>
<garnt> - You go to some sushi restaurants, </garnt>
<garnt> especially with friends from abroad, </garnt>
<garnt> and you see them like, put a little bit of soy sauce, </garnt>
<garnt> and then fucking wasabi. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it's like 90% wasabi, 10% soy sauce, </garnt>
<joey> and they just basically just dip the entire </joey>
<joey> sushi in the wasabi. - [Joey] And they drown it </joey>
<joey> in that shit. </joey>
<joey> - They fucking drown it in. </joey>
<garnt> And I don't know how they can taste the fish. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the incorrect way to eat sushi. </joey>
<garnt> - Finally, oh go ahead. </garnt>
<connor> - And I feel like this is the perfect kind of balance </connor>
<garnt> of like, how a good sushi should taste like. </garnt>
<joey> - I really like those actually. </joey>
<connor> - Damn, when's the Gigguk video coming out about these? </connor>
<joey> You went on a fucking rant there </joey>
<garnt> about how beautiful they were. </garnt>
<joey> - But, final thing we have </joey>
<joey> is the classic. - Matcha. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Matcha. </joey>
<joey> - We could've had about a bazillion matcha items </joey>
<connor> we wanted to I think. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I think matcha is my favorite kind of snack. </garnt>
<connor> - Weren't you the guy like seven months ago </connor>
<connor> who thought matcha was overrated? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think so. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I don't think that was Garnt. </garnt>
<joey> - That wasn't Garnt? </joey>
<garnt> I thought it was Garnt. - It was someone else. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the thing. - I think matcha's overhyped. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just saying. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel that's like the-- </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so you're the guy who thinks matcha's overhyped. </garnt>
<joey> - I think matcha's </joey>
<garnt> also overhyped. - I feel there's </garnt>
<garnt> the two dichotomies with matcha though. </garnt>
<garnt> It's either you think it's fucking amazing with everything, </garnt>
<garnt> or you think it's overrated as fuck. </garnt>
<joey> - There's too much matcha stuff. </joey>
<joey> - I mean in the last podcast we recorded, </joey>
<garnt> I had a matcha latte. </garnt>
<garnt> - Take a stick there. </garnt>
<joey> - To me matcha is kind of like, </joey>
<joey> sometimes I'll eat one, sometimes, </joey>
<garnt> it's like handing a cigarette over isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Alright, let's fucking try it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Gentlemen. </garnt>
<joey> - I've had these before, these are great. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, these are great. </joey>
<connor> - I mean. </connor>
<garnt> It's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Matcha snacks are great. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd rather a chocolate based thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly have you, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> One question. </garnt>
<connor> Have you ever had matcha soft serve? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause matcha soft serve - I quite like that, </connor>
<garnt> to be fair. </garnt>
<garnt> - is literally the, </garnt>
<garnt> single handedly changed my opinion of matcha. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause after I had matcha soft serve, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, matcha tastes fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh we have more, sorry, I forgot. </garnt>
<garnt> We have this thing which is, go-ha-na desu yo? </garnt>
<joey> - Nihongo Jouzu. </joey>
<connor> - Gohandesuyo. </connor>
<joey> - Gohandesuyo which is basically this like, </joey>
<joey> I don't even know what the flavor of it is. </joey>
<joey> It's just Gohandesuyo flavored. </joey>
<joey> But basically you-- - Can I smell it? </joey>
<joey> - You put it on a bed of rice, </joey>
<joey> and it basically, it's good on rice, </joey>
<joey> that's all it is. </joey>
<connor> - Bruh, you're kidding me. </connor>
<joey> - Can I smell that? </joey>
<connor> - That smells like seaweed. </connor>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] It's seaweed paste. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a seaweed paste. - It's a seaweed paste. </joey>
<joey> - You would give this to like, kids. </joey>
<connor> - I think I inhaled an X amount of salt </connor>
<connor> just from being near that. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> Because it's so salty, </joey>
<joey> you put that on a bed of rice, </joey>
<joey> and it mellows it out perfectly. </joey>
<connor> - This is, I'm not gonna eat that. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not eating that. </joey>
<connor> - This is Jaga Choco. </connor>
<garnt> And it's just potato chips, it looks like. </garnt>
<garnt> - With chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Chocolate potato chips. </garnt>
<garnt> - Looks like it hasn't been, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what, fuck it, </garnt>
<garnt> I can make assumptions all day. </garnt>
<garnt> As the great lord says, </garnt>
<connor> let's just jump right into it. </connor>
<garnt> Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, that's... - A little... </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, I think I've tried these before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Looking a little anemic, dare I say. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's literally just a chocolate potato chip. </garnt>
<connor> - Will it be salty though? </connor>
<connor> That's what I'm curious about. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - They are weirdly salty. </joey>
<connor> - You can't taste the chocolate, there's too much salt. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm having a kombucha tea moment right now. </garnt>
<joey> (snickering) </joey>
<joey> - It's like, mm, mm? </joey>
<joey> Not gonna lie. </joey>
<joey> It's a little too much salt for me. </joey>
<joey> - A little too much. </joey>
<joey> - You know what that tastes like? </joey>
<joey> It tastes like you ate a bag of crisps, </joey>
<joey> and then you instantly downed it with like a hot chocolate. </joey>
<connor> - If I'm gonna </connor>
<joey> - That's what that tastes like. </joey>
<connor> - get double calories of eating crisps and chocolate, </connor>
<connor> I wanna enjoy both, right? </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna like, have one, </connor>
<joey> and then just eat calories for no fucking reason. </joey>
<joey> - I gotta cleanse my palate with this. </joey>
<joey> - What is that one thing </joey>
<joey> you have over there, Joey? - I'm having like </joey>
<joey> an existential moment. </joey>
<connor> - What's that polar bear thing you have? </connor>
<joey> - It's basically, </joey>
<garnt> what the fuck this this? </garnt>
<garnt> Konayuki Shokora. </garnt>
<garnt> It's basically Melty Kiss I think. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it really? </connor>
<garnt> - It's kind of the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Crack it open, let's try it out. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a brownie I guess, let's try it out. </joey>
<joey> - This is giving me an existential crisis right now. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt, just keep eating it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, they're big. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Whoa. </connor>
<connor> - Look at the packaging it comes in dude, </connor>
<connor> that's fancy as fuck, - Whoa. </connor>
<joey> What is that? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Let's crack it open though. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt, are you okay? </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm not okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's not good Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Why are we deciding if it's good or not? </connor>
<garnt> - Because it tastes good, and then it doesn't, </garnt>
<garnt> and then it does, and then it doesn't, </garnt>
<garnt> and then it, ugh. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so fucking confused. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, yeah, again, it's like a Melty Kiss, </joey>
<connor> but kind of more fancy looking. </connor>
<joey> - Just wanna grab one. - Just grab one. </joey>
<joey> Just pop it out. </joey>
<garnt> There we are. </garnt>
<joey> It's like a mini brownie. </joey>
<garnt> - Whoa. </garnt>
<joey> Oh it's not like a mini brownie. </joey>
<connor> - Oh it's like if snow was chocolate. </connor>
<joey> - Oh actually it says powder snow chocolate. </joey>
<joey> There you go. </joey>
<joey> The branding on point. </joey>
<connor> - Man that's so rich. </connor>
<joey> - That instantly melts away. </joey>
<joey> - Holy fuck. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] You wanna try that? </joey>
<joey> - Hold on. </joey>
<joey> - You still having an existential crisis with that one? </joey>
<garnt> - I think I like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Really? </garnt>
<joey> - It took me three bites. </joey>
<joey> - After much deliberation, lads. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't hear whatever you guys were talking about. </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I was-- - Guys, he likes it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was just trying to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> if this was a taste that I like, and, </garnt>
<garnt> this tastes pretty good. </garnt>
<joey> - He was like having like an ancient Greek like </joey>
<garnt> philosophy like Aristotle moment in his head </garnt>
<garnt> while we were eating this. </garnt>
<garnt> - So what is it that you're talking about? </garnt>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> - This is powder snow chocolate. </joey>
<joey> It literally just melts away. </joey>
<joey> That is (mumbling). </joey>
<joey> - This man can't make up his mind on anything! </joey>
<garnt> - This honestly has fucked me up, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I'm just like, do I like things now? </joey>
<joey> What do I like any more? </joey>
<garnt> What is life? </garnt>
<connor> - (burps) Oh god, I feel sick. </connor>
<connor> - I don't eat chocolate, but this is </connor>
<connor> more chocolate than I've had in so long. </connor>
<garnt> - This is, </garnt>
<garnt> remember how we were debating if we were gonna have dinner </garnt>
<connor> after filming this episode? </connor>
<connor> - That ain't happening. </connor>
<garnt> - We are not having dinner after this episode. </garnt>
<connor> - I just enjoy the atmosphere of having a dinner together. </connor>
<connor> I didn't get that atmosphere. </connor>
<connor> - This is not a dinner with the boys. </connor>
<joey> You literally just witnessed three people </joey>
<joey> have dinner together. </joey>
<joey> - Over two hours. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah for two hours. </joey>
<garnt> - A literal konbini dinner. </garnt>
<joey> - So lads, like, what would you say is your favorite </joey>
<joey> I guess, item from each genre of food? </joey>
<connor> - So are we starting with the hot foods first? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so hot foods, which one, </joey>
<joey> which one reigns supreme in the hot foods? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, hot food, I'm still stanning Seven. </garnt>
<garnt> Seven, if you want a meal. - Lawson fried chicken. </garnt>
<connor> Lawson fried chicken man. </connor>
<garnt> - Seven fried chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> Seven beef bowl. </garnt>
<garnt> Seven any hot food tastes great. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, I think Lawson have been doing </connor>
<connor> the hot food better, man. </connor>
<connor> Gotta be real with you man. </connor>
<joey> - If I'm gonna be the mediator, </joey>
<joey> I would have to just give it to Seven. </joey>
<joey> - Yes! - You fucking, </joey>
<garnt> are you for real? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes! </garnt>
<connor> - I'd have to just give it to Seven </connor>
<connor> for the hot food. - You're not a clown, Joey, </connor>
<connor> you're the whole circus. </connor>
<connor> - Again, I don't eat the fried food, </connor>
<connor> so I don't fucking care. </connor>
<joey> All we know is that Family Mart fried food sucks arse. </joey>
<connor> - I never get the fried food from the konbini </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm just like, if I'm gonna... </connor>
<joey> - If I'm gonna have fried food, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna go to a fucking restaurant. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, if I'm gonna fuck up my body, </connor>
<joey> I'ma do it in a good place. </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Pay good money to fuck up your body. </joey>
<joey> - I want the best shit if this is like my cheat day, right? </joey>
<connor> What are the best like, sandwiches, then? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, sandwich. </joey>
<connor> - Probably Lawson's. </connor>
<connor> - Have I converted you into seeing the way </connor>
<connor> of the tuna sandwich from Lawson's? </connor>
<joey> - Look, the tuna sandwich, </joey>
<connor> Lawson is definitely better. </connor>
<connor> But the egg sandwich, Family Mart's better. </connor>
<joey> - If only they could join forces. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I would agree with that. </joey>
<joey> - If only they could join forces. </joey>
<garnt> - Like runny egg sandwiches </garnt>
<joey> should never be a thing. </joey>
<joey> - It's not runny. </joey>
<joey> - Ooh, I don't know about that. </joey>
<joey> - It's a paste. </joey>
<connor> It's mashed up. </connor>
<joey> - It's the collab we want to happen. </joey>
<garnt> - Japan, we're waiting. </garnt>
<connor> - Like egg paste shouldn't be a thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's not paste, it's just mashed down. </connor>
<joey> - I wanna taste the egg slices. </joey>
<garnt> - I want the texture of the egg. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't need it. </garnt>
<joey> - I need it. </joey>
<connor> - I would prefer it, but. </connor>
<connor> - Even scrambled egg has a texture. </connor>
<garnt> This was like, scrambled egg that was put into a paste. </garnt>
<joey> It is... </joey>
<joey> - I like it. </joey>
<connor> - It's like egg flavored glue. </connor>
<joey> That's what it tastes like. </joey>
<joey> - To me, the egg is like, they're both very strong. </joey>
<joey> But to me the tuna is just so much better. </joey>
<joey> - The tuna is hands down better. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, why would I want it? </connor>
<connor> And also, like, there's supermarkets that like, </connor>
<joey> aren't any of those that get like, </joey>
<joey> the sandwiches as well, and the tuna always tastes </joey>
<joey> like the Family Mart one for some reason. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - For some reason just </connor>
<connor> Lawson's tuna. - I feel the Lawson one </connor>
<garnt> they actually took like the canned tuna </garnt>
<garnt> and just put it in. - Yeah, it's good shit. </garnt>
<joey> It's good fucking shit. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like the Lawson's one, </joey>
<garnt> the tuna sandwich is better, definitely better. </garnt>
<joey> The egg sandwiches from Family Mart were definitely better. </joey>
<joey> - I don't eat that many sandwiches from the konbinis, </joey>
<joey> so I don't really have too much of a strong opinion. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm so full. </garnt>
<joey> - What about the onigiri, the rice balls? </joey>
<garnt> - Lawson's. </garnt>
<joey> - Lawson's. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Lawson's hands down. </joey>
<connor> - Lawson's hands down. </connor>
<connor> - Of a sample size of one type. </connor>
<connor> - I did not realize though, </connor>
<connor> that because we saw two Seven onigiris, </connor>
<joey> I don't know if one will make it to the final cut, </joey>
<joey> but we opened up two. </joey>
<joey> They both looked as depressing as each other. </joey>
<joey> My god. </joey>
<connor> - They're pretty sad. </connor>
<connor> - The Lawson one was clean. </connor>
<garnt> It was nicely wrapped around. - That was an art piece </garnt>
<garnt> right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the fillings were in every single bite. </garnt>
<joey> No matter where I bite, </joey>
<joey> I need to get a bit of filling. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - Lawson's hit it on the mark. </connor>
<garnt> - Lawson's definitely by far the best onigiri. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you guys, thank you. </connor>
<connor> Appreciate the love. </connor>
<joey> - What about the, </joey>
<joey> what else did we cover? </joey>
<joey> I guess snacks? </joey>
<connor> - We had like the like, fish snacks, meat snacks. </connor>
<joey> - I mean the fish snacks and meat snacks </joey>
<connor> I think we can all agree are all pretty mid. </connor>
<joey> - They're all like the same level. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know I liked the fish crisps. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh the Lawson fish crisps. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. - Yeah yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the way that Lawson's do the squid as well </garnt>
<garnt> is really fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> - We unfortunately didn't get to try any like, </garnt>
<connor> dried squid or dried fish or something, but, </connor>
<connor> like it's something that </connor>
<connor> a lot of people from, you know, America and England </connor>
<connor> that I've met have, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I bring this shit from Thailand to England, </connor>
<connor> and people are like, why are you eating fish food? </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it kinda does smell a bit like fish food. </connor>
<connor> - A little bit, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It does, but it tastes fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> It's the perfect amount of salty, </connor>
<connor> it's perfect to go with your beer. </connor>
<connor> Fish snacks just, you can't like, </connor>
<garnt> you don't know the full enjoyment of fish snacks </garnt>
<garnt> until you've had a cold beer with them I feel. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you gotta have a beer with them. </connor>
<joey> - And I must say, </joey>
<garnt> I'm thoroughly impressed with the One Cup, personally. </garnt>
<joey> I thought I was gonna fucking hate this. </joey>
<joey> I finished it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm impressed. </joey>
<joey> - I'm impressed, I thought it was gonna taste like shit, </joey>
<joey> and it tasted, not great, but drinkable. </joey>
<joey> Way better than Chris's. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I would buy another one of this. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck, did Chris just bring us like, </joey>
<joey> just like the budget, yeah. - Expired sake. </joey>
<connor> - The worst one he could find? </connor>
<joey> - He just like pissed in a bottle, </joey>
<connor> was like, yeah, it's sake, trust me. </connor>
<connor> - So potent that it had alcohol in it. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - My favorite snack I think has gotta be </joey>
<joey> the Kit-Kat, watermelon. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah the Kit-Kat watermelon. - The melon Kit-Kat. </joey>
<joey> You mean the melon? </joey>
<joey> Just the rock melon, right? </joey>
<joey> - The Kit-Kat melon, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The melon Kit-Kat. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That was fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - I also really like these though. </joey>
<joey> - I liked them, but I think the Kit-Kat melon </joey>
<joey> was just above the rest. </joey>
<joey> - And then obviously </joey>
<joey> there's like-- - All the breads </joey>
<connor> disappointed me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the breads were kinda mid. </joey>
<joey> - This though. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - No it's not. </garnt>
<garnt> - Lemme just-- </garnt>
<connor> - Choco babies, Garnt, get the fuck out of here! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and again, like, you know, like the ramune </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that, the choco baby, </joey>
<joey> the stuff that I grew up with. </joey>
<garnt> That shit's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I'm so full. - What, you having another </garnt>
<joey> existential crisis right now? </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck, I took a bite, and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this tastes awful, and then I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> no this tastes good. </garnt>
<garnt> You gotta fucking try this, please try this. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't have to. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've got it. </garnt>
<garnt> The initial taste tastes fucking awful. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then the aftertaste kicks in and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> this tastes like, </garnt>
<garnt> the aftertaste gives me the same kind of taste. </garnt>
<joey> When you're cooking like a brownie or something </joey>
<joey> and you have like cooking chocolate. </joey>
<joey> And you're cooking like a chocolate pudding. </joey>
<joey> And then as a kid you kinda just like, </joey>
<joey> have a bit of the chocolate. </joey>
<joey> You know. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't taste like that. - You scoop a bit </joey>
<joey> into your mouth. </joey>
<garnt> - Not gonna like, I wasn't listening, </garnt>
<joey> I was just enjoying Connor looking dead over there. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't taste like that, you're chatting shit. </connor>
<connor> - But all in all, I'd have to say, you can get. </connor>
<joey> Like this is not even. - You're a winner </joey>
<joey> if you're in Japan, </joey>
<connor> 'cause you get to have all of this. </connor>
<joey> - This is not even a corner </joey>
<joey> of what you can get at a konbini. </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck the best tasting thing. </garnt>
<joey> What was the worst tasting thing? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh god. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm having a hard time deciding between this. </connor>
<garnt> And this. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, honestly? </garnt>
<garnt> The crab cake. </garnt>
<garnt> The crab cake was the worst. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, the crab cake was pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> - Crab cake was the worst. </connor>
<connor> - No, actually. </connor>
<connor> It's this for me. </connor>
<garnt> This has a worse aftertaste than crab cake. </garnt>
<joey> I still have the aftertaste of this </joey>
<joey> in my mouth right now after eating all that. </joey>
<joey> - Shit was gross. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, again. - Oh god. </connor>
<connor> - I grew up with chikama </connor>
<connor> and there's a reason why I stopped eating it. </connor>
<garnt> Cause it's gross. - That ain't right. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] It ain't right. </joey>
<joey> - It literally smells like vomit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it ain't right. </joey>
<garnt> - It literally smells like vomit. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was probably the worst flavored one. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was the worst thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, again, this is nowhere near </garnt>
<garnt> the variety that you can get at a convenience store, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, there's so many more snacks, I mean, you know. </garnt>
<connor> Haven't even talked about the fact that you know, </connor>
<connor> you can buy basically fucking anything </connor>
<connor> at a convenience store, right? </connor>
<connor> - You can pay your utility bills. </connor>
<connor> You can send packages. - You can pay your rent </connor>
<connor> at a konbini. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah you can send packages. </connor>
<connor> - You can send packages. </connor>
<connor> You can get toiletries. - What can't you do? </connor>
<joey> - You can get, you know, like-- </joey>
<connor> - Lawson's next to me has now basically </connor>
<connor> just has a whole section for like household items. </connor>
<connor> So like you can buy like bedsheets. </connor>
<connor> And like soap containers. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like, weird shit that you're like, </connor>
<connor> why do I need this here? </connor>
<connor> It's like a mini Ikea in Lawson's. </connor>
<connor> It's so strange. </connor>
<garnt> But really cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can buy stuff like, </garnt>
<joey> you can buy technical stuff like SD cards </joey>
<joey> and USB sticks as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Like chargers and stuff like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Deodorant. </connor>
<joey> - I've bought underwear from Family Mart before. </joey>
<joey> - I have a pair of, </joey>
<joey> honestly the best pair of socks I've bought in Japan </joey>
<connor> are from Lawson's. </connor>
<connor> - From Lawson's! </connor>
<connor> - They're really fucking... </connor>
<garnt> - I have gloves. </garnt>
<garnt> Like hand gloves that I bought from Family Mart </garnt>
<joey> and I still wear them to this day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<garnt> So super super convenient. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, definitely when you come to Japan, </garnt>

<connor> It could be Ministop, it could be Yamazaki, who knows? </connor>
<garnt> - And let Chris Broad know that his shit taste </garnt>
<connor> thinking that Family Mart chicken is the best. </connor>
<garnt> - Family Mart chicken is not the best. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the real loser here. </connor>
<garnt> Family Mart chicken sucks. - The real loser is the fact </garnt>
<joey> that Chris thinks that Family Mart chicken tastes good. </joey>
<garnt> - Please, if you come to Japan. </garnt>
<joey> Please go to Family Mart Chicken. </joey>
<joey> Family Mart, get the chicken, and just, you know, </joey>
<connor> validate our opinion. </connor>
