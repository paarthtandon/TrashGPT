<connor> to me has felt like six months right </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah like aged one year since i saw </joey>
<garnt> you guys </garnt>
<joey> that's crazy </joey>
<joey> oh my god um but yeah like sir if you </joey>
<joey> didn't know me and connor went back to </joey>
<garnt> the uk yeah uh for like three four weeks </garnt>
<joey> and then we had two weeks of quarantine </joey>
<connor> so basically scheduling that out it </connor>
<connor> comes out to about six weeks before we </connor>
<connor> last recorded </connor>
<connor> um it has been like since we started </connor>
<connor> trash taste i didn't realize how much my </connor>
<connor> schedule relied on me going to trash </connor>
<joey> taste and just seeing the boys because </joey>
<connor> like it was weird just not seeing seeing </connor>
<garnt> the both of you like every week i was so </garnt>
<joey> bored during september not gonna lie </joey>
<garnt> like while you guys were gone like every </garnt>
<joey> tuesday i was getting ready to go i was </joey>
<joey> like oh </joey>
<joey> i don't have to honey i'm going to work </joey>
<connor> i'm going to work jk oh we have our </connor>
<garnt> coffees yes oh finally oh god finally </garnt>
<garnt> thank you </garnt>
<connor> so yeah we went back to the uk that was </connor>
<joey> fun yeah how was it that was good i mean </joey>
<joey> how long has it been like two years </joey>
<joey> right almost since you guys might have </joey>
<garnt> two years yeah it's been it's been about </garnt>
<garnt> two years so it's been two years </garnt>
<joey> basically since i've seen any of my </joey>
<joey> mates there or my parents or my family </joey>
<joey> wasn't emotional </joey>
<joey> did you guys hug it out yeah it was </joey>
<connor> weird seeing my parents really because </connor>
<connor> it was just like i've only seen them </connor>
<connor> through zoom for like two years and it </connor>
<connor> was just kind of like right right oh </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah it was weird having </garnt>
<garnt> conversations with people not through a </garnt>
<garnt> discord call or the zoom call because </garnt>
<garnt> you realize i i've forgotten what it was </garnt>
<garnt> like to just actually catch up with </garnt>
<garnt> someone not through a computer like damn </garnt>
<garnt> look at those graphics </garnt>
<garnt> i can touch them </garnt>
<joey> i felt like when i went back to wales i </joey>
<connor> felt like the pope going around a small </connor>
<garnt> town i was like hi guys i'm my parents </garnt>
<connor> yes give me a hug </connor>
<connor> i'll give you i'll take a picture with </connor>
<connor> you parents um </connor>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<garnt> it's uh it was nice i uh i also learned </garnt>
<connor> from my past mistakes of when i used to </connor>
<connor> go back home </connor>
<connor> um i actually like try to schedule as </connor>
<joey> many hangouts with friends as possible </joey>
<joey> right i reached out to as many people as </joey>
<joey> possible yeah because </joey>
<joey> the last time i went home i just kind of </joey>
<garnt> thought yeah i'll figure it out when i </garnt>
<garnt> get there and i ended up like not doing </garnt>
<connor> anything like half the days and i was </connor>
<garnt> like [ __ ] i really should have yeah i i </garnt>
<garnt> uh i did the same thing as you and then </garnt>
<joey> i i think i i made another mistake and i </joey>
<joey> think i planned two months oh yeah then </joey>
<connor> because because then then i i kind of </connor>
<joey> realized about like five six days in </joey>
<joey> like not even like halfway through my </joey>
<connor> trip </connor>
<connor> seeing someone every day you haven't </connor>
<connor> caught up to someone for two years what </connor>
<connor> do they want to do like crack open some </connor>
<connor> beers or a bottle of wine you just like </connor>
<garnt> you end up just eating and drinking like </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] every single day </connor>
<joey> and so you basically downloaded the </joey>
<connor> alcoholic dlc </connor>
<connor> basically so i was there for 20 days and </connor>
<joey> only </joey>
<joey> one day i didn't drink </joey>
<joey> jesus every single day i had at least </joey>
<garnt> one beer or something just because that </garnt>
<connor> was like the thing yeah so i think that </connor>
<garnt> you do in the uk yeah i think seventy to </garnt>
<garnt> eighty percent of my schedule for my </garnt>
<garnt> days there were seeing someone or </garnt>
<garnt> catching up with someone yeah so and uh </garnt>
<garnt> that that meant seventy to eighty </garnt>
<garnt> percent of my trip was like </garnt>
<joey> having some sort of drink yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> do you drink with your parents yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah so your parents are drinking </joey>
<garnt> as well right yes </garnt>
<connor> my parents don't drink but since we </connor>
<connor> haven't drank anyway no no but since we </connor>
<joey> haven't drunk in two years they they </joey>
<connor> they brought open a bottle of wine and </connor>
<joey> they had a glass i was just like oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> okay oh it's this is a special occasion </joey>
<connor> like i think i've seen my mom drunk </connor>
<connor> before this once in my life and it was </connor>
<connor> for like my cousin's wedding yeah it's </connor>
<connor> just just the weirdest [ __ ] thing </connor>
<connor> right because my mom's like my mom is </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> as far as my perception is like the </joey>
<joey> biggest straight edge there is right she </joey>
<joey> doesn't drink she you know doesn't smoke </joey>
<joey> doesn't do anything like that i had </joey>
<connor> never ever seen her like in my life i </connor>
<connor> think i've seen her like take a sip of </connor>
<joey> alcohol about like i think five times in </joey>
<connor> my life total total um and then i </connor>
<joey> remember going to my cousin's wedding </joey>
<joey> and uh my entire family were there um </joey>
<joey> everyone had like flown in from thailand </joey>
<joey> so it was a rare occurrence that we have </joey>
<joey> a massive family gathered in one place </joey>
<joey> and it was the first time i'd seen </joey>
<joey> like a different side of my mum like i </joey>
<joey> had no idea </joey>
<joey> i had no idea that there was just this </joey>
<joey> monster playing with it </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<connor> and it felt like it felt like almost </connor>
<connor> like she she got more drunk than sydney </connor>
<connor> on the day she got drunk faster than </connor>
<connor> sydney and that that gives you an </connor>
<connor> indication of like </connor>
<connor> how surprised i was right and i remember </connor>
<connor> like halfway through the wedding </connor>
<connor> um i i come sit i i i come sit down and </connor>
<connor> my mom and dad are just sitting on this </connor>
<connor> table </connor>
<connor> my mom has a glass of wine in front of </connor>
<connor> us </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> and i i don't know how much she had </connor>
<connor> drunk at this point and she was like </connor>
<connor> gig oh my name's gig it's like gig do </connor>
<connor> you want you want to see me down this </connor>
<connor> glass of wine i was like </connor>
<connor> no no no mom i don't want to see you </connor>
<joey> mom no she was like i'll do it i'll do </joey>
<connor> it i was like mom no no no don't do it </connor>
<joey> and she just </joey>
<garnt> i was like mom </garnt>
<joey> what are you 15 what did what are you </joey>
<joey> 18. </joey>
<joey> meanwhile there's like six bottles of </joey>
<garnt> wine </garnt>
<garnt> on the dance floor like this this is </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 10 11 p.m she was on the dance </garnt>
<garnt> floor just like you know she was she was </garnt>
<garnt> uh sydney was like pretty not sober but </garnt>
<connor> she was like merry you know she wasn't </connor>
<connor> completely drunk and then my mom just </connor>
<connor> comes up to her takes takes the bottle </connor>
<connor> of um beer that she's drinking just </connor>
<connor> downs in front of her and takes that </connor>
<joey> gives it back to her i've never seen </joey>
<joey> sydney so dumbfounded in my life </joey>
<joey> that's awesome but yeah so so yeah </joey>
<joey> i ended up drinking with my parents a </joey>
<joey> bit more which was a very rare </joey>
<joey> occurrence so of course of course i'm </joey>
<connor> gonna share some alcohol with them but </connor>
<connor> about like the fifth day in your body's </connor>
<connor> just like please please no more like </connor>
<connor> please i just like i i i like the social </connor>
<joey> aspect but my god my body just died like </joey>
<connor> halfway through the trip i think jesus </connor>
<connor> damn yeah i don't know i i just i </connor>
<connor> there's a thing where especially in with </connor>
<connor> my family they drink quite often </connor>
<garnt> so i feel like they saw it as an excuse </garnt>
<connor> to drink more than usual yeah so then it </connor>
<garnt> become a thing where i was like this is </garnt>
<connor> great but i'm dying </connor>
<connor> my dad's retired as well now so yeah now </connor>
<joey> he he loves it he's just like yeah i i </joey>
<joey> thought my dad would get bored being </joey>
<joey> retired he seems like i thought he was </joey>
<connor> one of those guys that really needed </connor>
<joey> like a job to keep him like occupied but </joey>
<joey> yeah he [ __ ] loves it he just gardens </joey>
<joey> all day and he loves it it's like he's </joey>
<joey> like that's his life isn't it yeah he's </joey>
<joey> living in life he like bought a canoe </joey>
<joey> and i'm like oh [ __ ] like buying a canoe </joey>
<joey> who buys a canoe that's like what even </joey>
<joey> store a canoe like how do you mean keep </joey>
<joey> that i don't even know the logistics </joey>
<joey> behind owning a canoe seemed way too </joey>
<joey> difficult </joey>
<joey> yeah yes but i mean like seems like he's </joey>
<connor> uh loving it and uh yeah so it's nice it </connor>
<joey> was it was always just picked hobbies </joey>
<joey> that are going to keep him active yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> there's other things you could he could </joey>
<connor> have invested in true yeah </connor>
<connor> he occasionally does do work he does </connor>
<connor> like helps a friend with houses building </connor>
<garnt> stuff i don't know </garnt>
<connor> yeah for me that's all like that's </connor>
<garnt> that's i mean </garnt>
<joey> that's where i want to be when i retire </joey>
<joey> yeah right </joey>
<connor> uh yeah it was it was fun i went back </connor>
<connor> and forth between wales and london it </connor>
<garnt> was a lot of fun um just got to see as </garnt>
<connor> many friends as possible and drink way </connor>
<garnt> too much alcohol we do that's kind of i </garnt>
<garnt> mean like because uh we posted a few </garnt>
<garnt> pictures while we were on like break in </garnt>
<garnt> the uk but i remember like </garnt>
<garnt> i remember we were catching up with a </garnt>
<joey> bunch of our friends and i actually </joey>
<joey> hardly ever talked to connor yeah in our </joey>
<joey> trip i mean we did we we obviously like </joey>
<joey> talked and caught up and everything but </joey>
<joey> we mostly spent time with like just </joey>
<joey> catching up with </joey>
<garnt> other people need to talk to you guys </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah we see each other everywhere </connor>
<connor> we [ __ ] talk to you way too much </connor>
<joey> i feel like we had a mutual </joey>
<connor> understanding that couldn't escape you </connor>
<joey> of like we've talked every week for like </joey>
<joey> the past [ __ ] over a year now yeah we </joey>
<joey> can have a little bit time apart and i </joey>
<connor> think i think the only times that we did </connor>
<connor> do something together was uh i think we </connor>
<connor> played like a game of chess </connor>
<connor> when i was drunk we were both drunk </connor>
<joey> and uh and of course you beat me um </joey>
<garnt> you're the only time when there was </garnt>
<joey> unfortunately there was no one </joey>
<joey> the next chess tournament should should </joey>
<joey> have our blood alcohol level measured </joey>
<joey> before and you need to be x amount </joey>
<joey> required to play that's what we need to </joey>
<joey> disqualify if it's below 0.7 but you're </joey>
<connor> a little too sober for my liking let's </connor>
<joey> like you're not in you're right so many </joey>
<garnt> brains every time you lose a piece you </garnt>
<garnt> got to do a shot or something i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know just just die yeah this this is </garnt>
<garnt> what chess needs the next evolution </garnt>
<connor> from going from casual chess to just </connor>
<connor> absolute abhorrence </connor>
<garnt> i also like playing chess again i </garnt>
<garnt> remember playing chess against you </garnt>
<joey> because we had we had a physical board </joey>
<joey> none of this you know none of this </joey>
<joey> online chess business we're an old </joey>
<joey> school and uh </joey>
<joey> we even had like a chess clock and </joey>
<joey> everything like that and uh i think i've </joey>
<connor> realized how much i've relied on like </connor>
<connor> the chess.com ui to really like oh it's </connor>
<connor> very be good at the game because </connor>
<joey> otherwise you have to look down like </joey>
<joey> this right because because i i was </joey>
<joey> pretty interested at that point but i </joey>
<garnt> remember i fell for like the most </garnt>
<garnt> obvious checkmate of all time oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> and uh and like and i i was like i was </garnt>
<garnt> trying to question how i couldn't see </garnt>
<garnt> that because we bet 20 pounds on the </garnt>
<garnt> game </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know why we bet 20 pounds in the </garnt>
<garnt> game i think i was like drunk at the </garnt>
<connor> time but uh whenever whenever i'm like </connor>
<connor> playing games with friends i'm like 10 </connor>
<garnt> bucks let's make it interesting let's do </garnt>
<connor> it let's have fun </connor>
<connor> fair fair yeah how was how was your </connor>
<garnt> perception of england going back i wrote </garnt>
<connor> notes i wrote your notes your wrong name </connor>
<connor> wrote notes oh this is why you wanted </connor>
<joey> chris told me to write notes my phone is </joey>
<joey> on one percent um you're gonna read them </joey>
<joey> also what i'm gonna do i'm gonna read </joey>
<joey> through them all then we can talk about </joey>
<joey> it okay very very dirty lovely </joey>
<joey> london is really loud i didn't realize </joey>
<joey> how noisy it was before it feels like </joey>
<joey> the same amount of people are walking </joey>
<joey> around tokyo but but in london it's less </joey>
<joey> orderly yeah yeah lots more homeless </joey>
<joey> people making gestures or saying </joey>
<joey> something to you whenever you do </joey>
<joey> anything like when i this guy just </joey>
<garnt> started talking to me in in the </garnt>
<garnt> in the lift and i was really confused </garnt>
<garnt> and i i just forgot that that was like a </garnt>
<garnt> thing that was like </garnt>
<connor> he started just talking to him and i was </connor>
<joey> like i'd literally just checked into my </joey>
<joey> hotel yeah just going off the flight i </joey>
<joey> was like what do you say to you he was </joey>
<garnt> just like he was talking about like um </garnt>
<garnt> did you say hi he's like oh hi hi how </garnt>
<connor> you doing i'm like </connor>
<connor> me </connor>
<joey> it's so funny to say that cause i </joey>
<joey> literally got recommended a video like </joey>
<joey> yesterday of this satire like news </joey>
<garnt> report that's just like northerner </garnt>
<garnt> terrorizes londoners by saying hello </garnt>
<connor> literally what happened oh yeah uh </connor>
<connor> people would </connor>
<connor> people okay when they bump into you </connor>
<connor> right in japan right yeah and i've </connor>
<connor> totally forgot this is a thing this is </connor>
<connor> the longest cable on earth man </connor>
<connor> when when people bump into you in japan </connor>
<connor> they say sorry yeah so many people </connor>
<connor> bumped into me and were just [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> and didn't say something didn't say </garnt>
<garnt> anything i i i could not every time that </garnt>
<connor> happened to me i could not stop saying </connor>
<connor> samimasen </connor>
<connor> it was just like it was just like muscle </connor>
<connor> memory even if i hadn't bumped into </connor>
<connor> someone i was like on the tube right and </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<garnt> i was like i was like i'm not in japan </garnt>
<garnt> anymore i need to stop doing this </garnt>
<garnt> because no one else is saying this [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> but like i just couldn't stop saying it </connor>
<connor> or like subconsciously uh i had um one </connor>
<connor> thing that happens in japan now i don't </connor>
<connor> expect this so i i just i just noticed </connor>
<connor> that it was different when you get a </connor>
<connor> taxi in japan the taxi driver will </connor>
<connor> always try and help you with your bags </connor>
<connor> even if you don't need it right yeah it </connor>
<connor> could be the smallest bag on earth and </connor>
<connor> he might try and come out and help you </connor>
<connor> with it yeah um and like never happened </connor>
<connor> with taxis in the uk i know i was every </connor>
<connor> time i had a suitcase or anything they'd </connor>
<joey> just sit in the car and then i'd have to </joey>
<garnt> open the boot too as well which is fine </garnt>
<joey> totally fine with that but i just </joey>
<joey> thought i was like oh yeah yeah there's </joey>
<joey> the thing that we don't do right </joey>
<connor> um and that was most of them yeah that </connor>
<garnt> was that was the most i'll tell you the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest the the immediate thing </garnt>
<connor> that uh i noticed about going back to </connor>
<connor> the uk that i immediately missed about </connor>
<connor> japan uh so i think it was the second </connor>
<connor> day that uh that we landed there </connor>
<connor> and um oh sorry my second day in the uk </connor>
<connor> we uh went out to just </connor>
<connor> walk around brighton again walk around </connor>
<joey> town uh because it's been a quite a </joey>
<joey> while since i've been in my hometown so </joey>
<joey> me and cindy just went out </joey>
<joey> did a quick shopping trip and uh i got i </joey>
<joey> got thirsty my throat was a little bit </joey>
<joey> parched right okay and so i started </joey>
<garnt> searching for a drink in order to quench </garnt>
<joey> my thirst right and i look around and </joey>
<joey> i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> where are the vending machines </garnt>
<joey> how how am i supposed to procure some </joey>
<joey> liquids so that's </joey>
<joey> so that's how they quench my thirst </joey>
<connor> right and i walk around in this shopping </connor>
<connor> center and i'm like wait and then i soon </connor>
<connor> realized i have to go to a shop yeah in </connor>
<connor> order to purchase some liquid it's not </connor>
<joey> even a convenience store like a </joey>
<joey> supermarket yeah they're like like a </joey>
<joey> corner shop yeah yeah yeah i'm just like </joey>
<joey> well what backward system is this you </joey>
<joey> know yeah i i need to go to go into a </joey>
<garnt> shop that sells other things other than </garnt>
<garnt> drinks and uh i need to do human </garnt>
<garnt> interaction in order to purchase this </garnt>
<garnt> like what </garnt>
<joey> what is this we really do take for </joey>
<joey> granted how many [ __ ] vending </joey>
<garnt> machines are on this car i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> realize that because like sometimes i'm </garnt>
<connor> just walking around i get a little </connor>
<connor> thirsty and i'm just like literally a </connor>
<connor> minute away from the next vending </connor>
<connor> machine i didn't realize how convenient </connor>
<connor> that was until i went to the uk and like </connor>
<connor> it's like it's in a big shopping center </connor>
<connor> most of this is just like clothes </connor>
<connor> or like different different kind of </connor>
<connor> stores that are not like food drink </connor>
<connor> items and even if there is most of them </connor>
<connor> are like you know something like super </connor>
<connor> drug or some some very big you know </connor>
<connor> pharmacy store where they sell they sell </connor>
<connor> drinks there but it's a it's way bigger </connor>
<joey> than it needs to be so i end up like </joey>
<joey> having to go in go into this massive </joey>
<joey> store go to like the small segments just </joey>
<connor> for food and drink and then and then </connor>
<garnt> line up yeah and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> disgusting disgusting </garnt>
<connor> not on my watch </connor>
<joey> but that is like the first thing i </joey>
<joey> noticed where it was just like i i </joey>
<garnt> really missed vending machines and just </garnt>
<garnt> like being able to like buy you know </garnt>
<garnt> very conveniently buy a like a snack i </garnt>
<joey> felt that way as well when like whenever </joey>
<connor> i go back to australia or the or like </connor>
<connor> the us or anything as well because like </connor>
<connor> we have vending machines like in </connor>
<connor> australia in the u.s yeah but you don't </connor>
<connor> have like a suica yeah right yeah so you </connor>
<connor> have to like [ __ ] reach in grab your </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] change jiggle that around and </connor>
<connor> then yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't know why they got your fired </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] vending machines in the west </connor>
<joey> because sometimes the drink doesn't even </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> that's true so i'm like oh good i'm </joey>
<joey> about to gamble three dollars to see if </joey>
<joey> i can even sometimes you get a double </joey>
<joey> pool as well </joey>
<garnt> that just happens sometimes you're </garnt>
<connor> really lucky </connor>
<connor> like you you buy a drink and you're like </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna buy another drink immediately </connor>
<connor> but then but then the machine is </connor>
<joey> designed in such a way that it just </joey>
<joey> can't handle two drinks being dispensed </joey>
<joey> at once so you have to like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> scrunch your hand inside and like pull </joey>
<joey> one out yeah just so you can unblock </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] thing yeah but i noticed as </joey>
<joey> well obviously like i i got out of the </joey>
<garnt> airport and just like no one was wearing </garnt>
<joey> masks really yeah yeah no one was </joey>
<joey> wearing that and that not that i you </joey>
<connor> know i don't i don't have a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> opinion on it i do whatever i'm told to </connor>
<connor> do right i'm a sheep all right what can </connor>
<joey> i say </joey>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> that's taking a stance in the self-care </joey>
<connor> i guess i don't give a [ __ ] i'm just </connor>
<connor> like if everyone around me is wearing a </connor>
<connor> mask i'll wear a mask you know what i </connor>
<connor> mean but it was one of those things i </connor>
<connor> was like oh </connor>
<connor> whoa this is [ __ ] weird and like yeah </connor>
<connor> cause in japan it's like you know </connor>
<connor> you'll be crucified if you don't wear </connor>
<joey> them you could be in the middle of a </joey>
<joey> rice field and they'll still still find </joey>
<connor> a way to crossfire exactly and like it </connor>
<connor> was just like so strange just seeing </connor>
<connor> everything kind of back to normal it was </connor>
<connor> like the uk just took the route of we </connor>
<connor> don't give a [ __ ] anymore open back up </connor>
<connor> but was also it was but the rules are </connor>
<connor> different as well between england and </connor>
<connor> wales and because i was traveling </connor>
<connor> between them </connor>
<connor> on welsh trains you have to wear a mask </connor>
<connor> on english trains you don't have to wear </connor>
<connor> a mask but some trains go from wales to </connor>
<joey> england so what happens is is that when </joey>
<joey> you get into england people just took </joey>
<joey> off their masks on the terrain </joey>
<connor> which does nothing which then just </connor>
<joey> eliminates the whole point of you know </joey>
<joey> yeah where i was like you know i'm not </joey>
<joey> that i i </joey>
<joey> think one or one of either is wrong all </joey>
<garnt> right i'm just like it </garnt>
<garnt> invalidates for both if you have to put </garnt>
<garnt> it on or off yeah yeah you're on the </garnt>
<garnt> same goddamn train it was yeah it was </garnt>
<connor> whatever </connor>
<joey> that was that's that's like you being on </joey>
<joey> a flight and then like oh we're we're </joey>
<connor> now </connor>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<connor> and i was wearing a mask </connor>
<connor> and i thought this was only in like in </connor>
<connor> america but someone came up to me and </connor>
<connor> was like take off your mask </connor>
<joey> what yeah someone came up to me like </joey>
<joey> take off your mask and i was like i </joey>
<joey> don't think i will and then he was like </joey>
<connor> why he was where were you i was in wales </connor>
<joey> all right he was saying so yeah well you </joey>
<joey> have to wear master i stolen well no no </joey>
<connor> no you don't oh you just did anyway but </connor>
<connor> no right um i was like the only person </connor>
<connor> wearing a mask right yeah </connor>
<connor> i because i also i look like [ __ ] i </connor>
<connor> wanted to cover my face </connor>
<connor> i felt dreadful but he came up to me and </connor>
<garnt> he was like take off your mask and i was </garnt>
<garnt> like no and then he was like why why are </garnt>
<garnt> you wearing a mask and i was like i just </garnt>
<garnt> ignored him i was just like i carried on </garnt>
<garnt> my phone and i was just like on the </garnt>
<garnt> train uh no no outside the train station </garnt>
<joey> right you just like take off your mask </joey>
<connor> and i was like no </connor>
<connor> why i don't know some people get weirdly </connor>
<joey> offended by it </joey>
<joey> it's like sorry i'm protecting myself </joey>
<connor> yeah you know like one time i was </connor>
<connor> wearing it as well and the guy asked me </connor>
<joey> uh he was like are you wearing that for </joey>
<joey> me or for you and i was like </joey>
<joey> for me </joey>
<joey> i mean both technically because the </joey>
<garnt> thing was is that even though you know </garnt>
<garnt> because we had a flight to get on so i </garnt>
<garnt> was coming up to that flight i was like </garnt>
<joey> i'm wearing a mask because yeah i do not </joey>
<joey> want to get it yeah of course just be </joey>
<joey> having to rearrange all my plans and </joey>
<joey> delay transition yeah of course so </joey>
<joey> that's why i was wearing it and then i </joey>
<connor> was like oh my god i was like why are so </connor>
<connor> many people [ __ ] coming up to me and </connor>
<garnt> telling me to take off my mess because </garnt>
<garnt> you're taking a stance and like i think </garnt>
<connor> i think going back to england because i </connor>
<connor> had very similar experiences </connor>
<connor> where um every time </connor>
<connor> every time like </connor>
<connor> every time i'd meet like some group of </connor>
<connor> uh some group of friends they'd question </connor>
<garnt> me of like why i chose to wear a mask </garnt>
<connor> why i chose to put on this mask </connor>
<connor> autobiography </connor>
<garnt> they didn't listen to me until i put on </garnt>
<garnt> the mask </garnt>
<joey> and so like i get questioned about it </joey>
<joey> i'm just like i don't know i just i need </joey>
<joey> to fly back to japan in like two weeks </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty used to it and i just don't </joey>
<joey> want to take any risks i don't know like </joey>
<garnt> this that's just my my uh </garnt>
<joey> my opinion man like </joey>
<joey> it's like why do you have to be like </joey>
<joey> accused for protecting yourself </joey>
<connor> i'm not saying that's like being like </connor>
<joey> why are you wearing the condom yeah take </joey>
<joey> it off </joey>
<joey> it's like i'm going around being like </joey>
<joey> put your mask on put your mouth i don't </joey>
<connor> give a [ __ ] you don't need to if you </connor>
<connor> don't if the government tells you you </connor>
<connor> don't need to wear it i don't give a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] don't wear it i'm just going to </joey>
<joey> wear it but the government also says </joey>
<joey> don't wear a mask yeah like it's not </joey>
<joey> like they they're you know they're gonna </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] you know take your mask away i </joey>
<garnt> just feel i just feel like what i've </garnt>
<connor> realized going back home at least in </connor>
<joey> england it was it became very like </joey>
<connor> political yeah like like it's it's like </connor>
<joey> as you know as as everything does but i </joey>
<joey> feel like we got sheltered from that in </joey>
<joey> japan because everyone here wears the </joey>
<joey> masks </joey>
<joey> and </joey>
<joey> everyone here wore a mask before kovid </joey>
<joey> and that's why it was like super easy to </joey>
<joey> just integrate that into society whereas </joey>
<joey> um like people just don't like being </joey>
<joey> told what to do in england </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<garnt> america as well you know it's it's it </garnt>
<garnt> was it was something where just doing </garnt>
<garnt> this one thing like wearing a mask was </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> in the in in that environment you were </garnt>
<garnt> making a statement or a stance or a </garnt>
<garnt> choice </garnt>
<garnt> that was conscious i guess and i just </garnt>
<garnt> never really it's like what about it </garnt>
<joey> that deeply i get that but it's like i </joey>
<joey> don't know why that is you know subject </joey>
<joey> to ridicule or criticism right it's like </joey>
<joey> it's not like you're doing something bad </joey>
<garnt> by protecting yourself yeah i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> i i i it was it was weird i didn't know </garnt>
<joey> it was the other way around right yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean this is </joey>
<joey> the way i looked at it was not even a </joey>
<joey> political sense i was just like i just </joey>
<joey> want to wear it because i want to wear </joey>
<garnt> it [ __ ] off yeah yeah like like you're </garnt>
<joey> wearing a hat would you tell me i can't </joey>
<joey> wear a hat like yeah yeah you know </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] what are you hiding yeah </joey>
<garnt> like like me before going to england i'd </garnt>
<garnt> never really thought about it that </garnt>
<garnt> deeply i i think i've thought about you </garnt>
<garnt> know the difference between chicken </garnt>
<garnt> breasts and chicken thighs more deeply </garnt>
<garnt> than wearing a mask you know that's you </garnt>
<joey> should have just turned around the guy </joey>
<joey> being like it ain't that deep bro </joey>
<connor> i'm just wearing a mask off my back </connor>
<connor> one one positive thing that i think </connor>
<connor> changed about england though since i've </connor>
<connor> been back is uh ever since ever since </connor>
<connor> the pandemic uh a lot of a lot of big </connor>
<connor> establishments now have made it possible </connor>
<connor> for you to just order your food via qr </connor>
<connor> codes oh yeah that was yeah yeah i know </connor>
<connor> and i was like right we're getting to </connor>
<garnt> the japanese way of things now yeah less </garnt>
<joey> human interaction oh brilliant although </joey>
<connor> i love it i was at nando's as you go i </connor>
<joey> had i had to pause that just for </joey>
<garnt> dramatic yeah yeah i was in now nose </garnt>
<connor> and i was i was trying to order my meal </connor>
<connor> and i was in a kind of a rush as well </connor>
<connor> yeah so i didn't have much time and i </connor>
<connor> thought oh it'll be easier on the app </connor>
<connor> turns out like the the this uh specific </connor>
<connor> nando's restaurant just didn't have good </connor>
<connor> cell phone service </connor>
<connor> and they didn't have free wi-fi so i was </connor>
<connor> like fighting for my life trying to </connor>
<connor> order this [ __ ] thing and every </connor>
<connor> single time i got to one webpage it just </connor>
<connor> could not get to the next one and i </connor>
<connor> would it was like i had to keep </connor>
<connor> resetting </connor>
<connor> i spent about 20 minutes trying to order </connor>
<connor> this meal that i only had 10 minutes to </connor>
<connor> eat yeah and then eventually went up to </connor>
<connor> the counter and i was like give me this </connor>
<connor> and they got my [ __ ] order wrong </connor>
<connor> and it was terrible i mean it was it </connor>
<connor> didn't taste good either really the </connor>
<connor> specific nando's did not taste good and </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> butterfly chicken burger </connor>
<connor> you mean the chicken breast burger yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah chicken breast </connor>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> i had great nando's when i was done i </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] missed the chips were kind of </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] the coleslaw was not as good as i </joey>
<connor> remembered i don't know it was uh i </connor>
<connor> don't know if my tastes have changed </connor>
<joey> maybe nando's isn't just as good as </joey>
<joey> europe maybe that nando specifically i </joey>
<connor> need to try more </connor>
<connor> because i had kfc and that was fantastic </connor>
<connor> i had uk </connor>
<garnt> the second biggest thing i noticed which </garnt>
<garnt> was i've really really missed japanese </garnt>
<connor> food service you know it's yeah </connor>
<connor> so many times i'd go to restaurants and </connor>
<garnt> like half the tables still had the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> from the previous customers on it yeah </connor>
<garnt> and i was like oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah that just like isn't a thing in </joey>
<joey> japan like that shit's gone immediately </joey>
<connor> yeah oh yeah they won't even let you in </connor>
<joey> the restaurant i mean sometimes they'll </joey>
<joey> take the plate away while you're still </joey>
<garnt> at the table yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like i i think you know </garnt>
<garnt> be after after being there for like two </garnt>
<garnt> weeks or something you you've had like </garnt>
<garnt> all the food that you missed from being </garnt>
<garnt> in japan and after that you go back to </garnt>
<garnt> your usual eating routine and you're </garnt>
<garnt> just like man like you forget how good </garnt>
<garnt> japanese food is and just like japanese </garnt>
<garnt> restaurants in general because like you </garnt>
<garnt> order anything here even if it's off </garnt>
<connor> ubereats or you go to a random </connor>
<connor> restaurant and it is it is just like </connor>
<connor> really good food standards and i just i </connor>
<connor> just forgotten how many british </connor>
<connor> establishments were just really really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] mediocre right and </connor>
<connor> like after you </connor>
<connor> after like the novelty wears out of yes </connor>
<connor> i'm having all these things that i've </connor>
<connor> missed being out of being out of the uk </connor>
<connor> after that wears off you're like </connor>
<connor> damn japanese food is just better </connor>
<connor> it is just so so much better </connor>
<connor> and uh yeah i've really felt that in my </connor>
<garnt> last week in the uk where i just like i </garnt>
<garnt> just missed having good food on the </garnt>
<garnt> daily i don't know do you have any </garnt>
<joey> japanese food around no no i didn't have </joey>
<connor> any japanese some food some of my </connor>
<joey> friends wanted to and i looked at them </joey>
<connor> like no </connor>
<joey> they're not having japanese food it's </joey>
<joey> like the first time i ever went to la </joey>
<joey> and they took me to little token i was </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i came from big token </connor>
<joey> episode of the simpsons when they go to </joey>
<connor> japan they go to america yeah </connor>
<garnt> no no come on </garnt>
<garnt> yeah cause like what i didn't understand </garnt>
<connor> because i just realized this is you know </connor>
<connor> the uk is also island nation like japan </connor>
<connor> but japanese japan has really spoiled me </connor>
<connor> with good seafood and just you know </connor>
<joey> fresh seafood that you can find yeah </joey>
<joey> right everywhere basically and just like </joey>
<joey> getting good seafood in the uk so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] difficult and i don't know why </joey>
<connor> it is because we're an island nation </connor>
<connor> that is smaller than japan you know </connor>
<connor> you know our coastline should be easier </connor>
<connor> to get to why why is it so hard to find </connor>
<connor> against the traffic yeah yeah yeah why </connor>
<connor> is it so hard to find good seafood oh </connor>
<garnt> that is not just like fish and chips you </garnt>
<connor> know yeah yeah i did have a good lobster </connor>
<connor> actually did you yeah that was good but </connor>
<joey> how much did you pay for it you don't </joey>
<connor> want to </connor>
<connor> that's the thing right like it's </connor>
<garnt> probably like if you want good food you </garnt>
<joey> probably have to pay arduous amounts of </joey>
<joey> money you you do you </joey>
<joey> it was like a seafood pasta yeah and i </joey>
<joey> was really craving lobster because i was </joey>
<joey> like i didn't really get lobster in </joey>
<joey> japan and i really wanted like a creamy </joey>
<garnt> did we get lobster in the uk uh yes </garnt>
<connor> if you can pay for it it's quite </connor>
<connor> expensive okay </connor>
<connor> for like </connor>
<connor> not frozen canned stuff yeah and it was </connor>
<joey> really good and it was it was probably </joey>
<connor> the most i depend on a single dish in </connor>
<joey> the uk and i i was it was something </joey>
<connor> ridiculous like 30 40 or something </connor>
<connor> but man was the lobster good that was so </connor>
<joey> worth it </joey>
<joey> yeah every once in a while having like a </joey>
<joey> something like that like treating </joey>
<joey> yourself to something kind of that </joey>
<joey> expensive is very nice but yeah </joey>
<joey> definitely something i felt so guilty </joey>
<joey> for when i was looked at the bill i'm </joey>
<connor> like i literally had a pastor </connor>
<connor> i'm like filing a mortgage i'm like </connor>
<joey> holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah i do something similar in hawaii i </joey>
<joey> had i had a fifty five dollar </joey>
<connor> possibility it was like once </connor>
<joey> in </joey>
<connor> again it was another seafood pasta i </connor>
<joey> don't know what is about seafood pasta </joey>
<joey> but like there was so it was like the </joey>
<joey> entire cast of the little mermaid on </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] parcel like there was so </joey>
<joey> much seafood on it yeah and i was like </joey>
<connor> okay i now i can see why also 55 i'll </connor>
<connor> never do that again yeah i don't know </connor>
<connor> how australia is but i noticed that the </connor>
<garnt> fancy restaurants in japan are cheaper </garnt>
<garnt> than the fancy restaurants in the uk oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because in japan right you can go to a </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant and you can you can buy a </garnt>
<garnt> bottle of wine and it's yeah even though </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's obviously more expensive that </garnt>
<connor> would be buying it wholesale it's still </connor>
<connor> not that big bad like you can if we went </connor>
<connor> out together we could split a bottle of </connor>
<connor> wine and it comes to like 20 bucks each </connor>
<garnt> right for like </garnt>
<garnt> maybe i i noticed wine in the uk was way </garnt>
<connor> cheaper </connor>
<connor> someplace i went to like the the lowest </connor>
<connor> price bottle was like 150 and i was like </connor>
<joey> i want wine what kind of bougie-ass </joey>
<connor> place are you going to not even not even </connor>
<connor> like not even like that bougie places </connor>
<garnt> like these were like but the wine was </garnt>
<garnt> bougie </garnt>
<connor> i think i don't know i don't know maybe </connor>
<garnt> i should [ __ ] me for trying to eat good </garnt>
<garnt> no because i remember like i remember </garnt>
<connor> going to like tesco's and co-op to buy </connor>
<joey> like some wine and i recognized some of </joey>
<connor> the wine that was available over there </connor>
<joey> premium wines here in japan that is like </joey>
<garnt> 20 bucks plus they get for like a five </garnt>
<joey> or seven quid and like tesco's and i'll </joey>
<joey> just but i think that's just because </joey>
<joey> japan isn't really a wine drink that's </joey>
<garnt> that's exactly it and for the most part </garnt>
<connor> when i noticed wines that were available </connor>
<connor> you can get wines for like a much </connor>
<connor> cheaper price because if you're drinking </connor>
<garnt> wine in japan you you eating good you </garnt>
<connor> know you drink you drink you drink it as </connor>
<connor> well this this is the hard part i wanted </connor>
<connor> to have the good the </connor>
<joey> the wine that was way cheaper and nice </joey>
<joey> but i also wanted to drink all the beer </joey>
<joey> so i had to like it was very hard </joey>
<joey> haven't you again you can't do both you </joey>
<joey> can't mix and match otherwise you end up </joey>
<joey> in uh you're gonna be in a coma the next </joey>
<connor> day </connor>
<connor> i had a drink the next day so i make </connor>
<connor> sure that i was in peak condition at all </connor>
<garnt> times that was the biggest thing that i </garnt>
<connor> i forgot about which was </connor>
<joey> tactically choosing how much you drink </joey>
<joey> so you can survive and drink the next </joey>
<joey> day as well </joey>
<garnt> you can get ipas and stuff like that in </garnt>
<garnt> japan but like i i love like the craft </garnt>
<garnt> beer in the uk it's really nice i miss </garnt>
<garnt> having good ciders </garnt>
<joey> i don't know i just missed that so i </joey>
<joey> drank a lot i had tesco meal deal as </joey>
<connor> well </connor>
<joey> how was it was it good it was amazing </joey>
<connor> i was like all of this for three pounds </connor>
<garnt> get out of here he says after having his </garnt>
<garnt> lobster pasta yeah it goes straight to </garnt>
<connor> testosterone you know i bought that </connor>
<connor> lobster pasta for like 30 to 40 dollars </connor>
<garnt> i don't know how much it was and it </garnt>
<garnt> still didn't make me as happy as that </garnt>
<connor> three pound meal deal </connor>
<connor> and it was better it was honestly a part </connor>
<connor> of it tasted better i was like oh my god </connor>
<connor> i get an innocent smoothie it's like </connor>
<connor> three pound smoothie in this three pound </connor>
<connor> meal deal they're practically giving it </connor>
<garnt> away i was i was happy going back to </garnt>
<garnt> nando's that was like the biggest i'm </garnt>
<connor> home now i i am now home </connor>
<garnt> i had subway as well that was nice oh </garnt>
<garnt> subway i forgot i've forgotten how good </garnt>
<garnt> subway was outside of japan because </garnt>
<connor> subway in japan if you guys don't know </connor>
<connor> you can't toast the sandwich </connor>
<connor> you can't custom you can't pick your </connor>
<joey> bread no </joey>
<connor> i mean there's like there's like it's </connor>
<connor> two choices of bread i think what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] is the point if you can't pick your </connor>
<connor> bread and choose to toast it like i just </connor>
<garnt> i was so shocked when you couldn't toast </garnt>
<connor> your sandwich in japan yeah you what </connor>
<joey> that's like the best part of any i don't </joey>
<joey> even like subway that much that's </joey>
<joey> literally the drawing point off song </joey>
<garnt> yeah because i don't even like it </garnt>
<garnt> because we can like uber each subway </garnt>
<garnt> here and sometimes when these two don't </garnt>
<garnt> want to choose they order a subway and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like no if i'm not having my </garnt>
<garnt> subway toasted it is not a subway yeah i </garnt>
<connor> had a lot of fast food a lot of fast </connor>
<garnt> food yeah and i i'm surprised i'm not </garnt>
<connor> obese by the time i came back with the </connor>
<garnt> amount i drank and ate every time i saw </garnt>
<garnt> you in the holiday i think you had a bag </garnt>
<connor> of crisps </connor>
<connor> like i went to town on christmas i think </connor>
<garnt> you were like more crisp than man i was </garnt>
<connor> there was like one day where like we </connor>
<connor> were hanging out and there was just like </connor>
<connor> no food in this this like airbnb </connor>
<connor> but there was like family packs of </connor>
<garnt> crisps sorry like 20 packs of </garnt>
<garnt> i think your dinner that day was like a </garnt>
<garnt> hot dog and like five packs of doritos </garnt>
<connor> it wasn't five yeah it was like eight it </connor>
<joey> was like </joey>
<joey> it was okay </joey>
<garnt> people kill me </garnt>

<joey> americans watching but yeah no it was </joey>
<joey> fun i i had a great time i got to see </joey>
<joey> all the friends i wanted to see and yeah </joey>
<connor> that's good yeah a lot of things really </connor>
<connor> worked out nicely because i was asking </connor>
<connor> people like last minute to hang out and </connor>
<garnt> luckily everyone was able to yeah yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> think like i had enough rest days in </garnt>
<garnt> there well towards the end because </garnt>
<garnt> michael my body was just like i i i need </garnt>
<garnt> to like not touch alcohol for like a </garnt>
<garnt> month after this and which is great </garnt>
<garnt> because we've had quarantine since then </garnt>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah tell us about the the hotel </joey>
<garnt> experience so that's what i want to know </garnt>
<garnt> okay no no </garnt>
<connor> this this experience doesn't start from </connor>
<garnt> the hotel it starts from the point where </garnt>
<garnt> we get off the plane it starts before </garnt>
<connor> that it start before we've left the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] country it's already oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's already </garnt>
<connor> me and connor had two very different </connor>
<connor> experiences </connor>
<connor> uh leaving the country and getting back </connor>
<connor> in the country yeah so i mean how should </connor>
<connor> we do this how do we split this up so we </connor>
<connor> just i have to go by section by section </connor>
<connor> okay so first of all the most annoying </connor>
<connor> part </connor>
<connor> which is uh </connor>
<connor> to get even on the plane you need a </connor>
<connor> negative covert test form now okay i am </connor>
<garnt> making a video about my quarantine hotel </garnt>
<garnt> thing so there'll be in-depth stuff </garnt>
<garnt> about that if you're interested by the </garnt>
<garnt> way but but i'll give you the i i want </garnt>
<garnt> to talk more about it because i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> want to bog down that video we're just </garnt>
<garnt> complaining for nine hours so we're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna complain </garnt>
<garnt> so so this whole thing is like confusing </garnt>
<garnt> right so </garnt>
<garnt> normally if you want a negative test </garnt>
<garnt> most test providers would give you a </garnt>
<joey> form say hey you're negative take this </joey>
<joey> and then everyone will accept it </joey>
<joey> normally problem is japan doesn't work </joey>
<joey> like that japan trend just decided we </joey>
<joey> gotta do things a little bit different </joey>
<joey> we're doing it our way yeah it turns </joey>
<garnt> like how about it's literally our way or </garnt>
<connor> the highway yeah right it's like how </connor>
<connor> about we just give you a form that you </connor>
<connor> need to fill out the very specific way </connor>
<connor> that we want it filled out and this just </connor>
<connor> sends fear down anyone who knows japan </connor>
<connor> because you know they're not playing </connor>
<connor> games yeah i have heard that </connor>
<connor> some some airlines will let you on with </connor>
<connor> the negative test and you don't need </connor>
<connor> that one but why would you risk it so </connor>
<joey> i was [ __ ] myself because i was like </joey>
<joey> how the [ __ ] do i fill out this form so </joey>
<joey> this form uh needs to be signed and </joey>
<joey> stamped by a doctor it can't be it can't </joey>
<joey> be a nurse it has to be a doctor the </joey>
<joey> test can be administered by a nurse but </joey>
<joey> has to be signed and stamped by a doctor </joey>
<connor> right right </connor>
<connor> so but most testing facilities don't </connor>
<connor> have a doctor who's going to stamp or </connor>
<connor> sign it for you so then now you have to </connor>
<connor> find a place that has a doctor that will </connor>
<connor> stamp it turns out like none of these </connor>
<connor> test centers have doctors that are </connor>
<connor> willing to sign or stamp things for you </connor>
<connor> right yeah so manage to find </connor>
<connor> i found after i basically i </connor>
<garnt> i went to the uk government website and </garnt>
<garnt> got the email of every single test </garnt>
<garnt> provider they recognized and sent out a </garnt>
<garnt> mess email to all of them this was a big </garnt>
<garnt> mistake because then what ended up </garnt>
<garnt> happening was it was one thread </garnt>
<garnt> and it was it was </garnt>
<garnt> replying to each other no no no no no no </garnt>
<connor> no it was a blind carbon copy so they </connor>
<garnt> weren't each other but for me it was one </garnt>
<connor> thread so i i sent this email off and </connor>
<connor> within about 10 minutes i realized the </connor>
<connor> mistake that i'd made because i had 15 </connor>
<joey> replies in one thread and i couldn't </joey>
<joey> keep track you basically opened a forum </joey>
<joey> post yeah i basically opened a forum </joey>
<joey> post </joey>
<joey> directly to the person and so i got like </joey>
<connor> 50 responses in the first day of you'll </connor>
<connor> be like this is okay but then some of </connor>
<connor> them were like yes this is totally fine </connor>
<connor> but they didn't </connor>
<connor> like say yes to everything so so they i </connor>
<connor> had to then call up places that said yes </connor>
<connor> and i walked them through it i was like </connor>
<connor> are you sure this is okay and and one of </connor>
<connor> them was like yeah that's no problem </connor>
<connor> we've done it all the time that's </connor>
<connor> totally we've had people go to japan all </connor>
<joey> the time from our facility and i'm like </joey>
<joey> great okay so i booked on with them 150 </joey>
<joey> pounds right it's like 200 right yeah </joey>
<joey> damn all right so but </joey>
<joey> i know japan i i i know that i should i </joey>
<garnt> should have a backup just in case </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> i don't [ __ ] trust like that this is </garnt>
<garnt> i should cause you have to get it 72 </garnt>
<connor> hours before so if i [ __ ] this up uh i'm </connor>
<connor> i'm panicking to try and find something </connor>
<connor> so i booked two yeah i booked another </connor>
<connor> test but </connor>
<connor> i this this place said book a test with </connor>
<connor> us and then when you get your results </connor>
<connor> three hours later take those results and </connor>
<connor> book a doctor appointment and then get </connor>
<connor> the doctor to sign and stamp it all </connor>
<connor> jesus so i did that too yeah so i had </connor>
<connor> that first so i went to this testing </connor>
<connor> facility at 8 am i they shoved a thing </connor>
<connor> up my nose i'm dying </connor>
<connor> and then i get my results at 11am yeah </connor>
<connor> and it's negative and i'm like great </connor>
<connor> great so then i go to the doctor and </connor>
<connor> perfect they they sign it all they stamp </connor>
<connor> it all it was all super easy but i had </connor>
<connor> to pay individually for both those </connor>
<connor> things so it's like 150 pounds for the </connor>
<connor> test again right or no 90 for that one </connor>
<connor> and then 90 for the doctor's appointment </connor>
<connor> jesus so this is already like 400 500 </connor>
<garnt> bucks yeah just on the test yeah um i'm </garnt>
<connor> not not counting the amount you have to </connor>
<connor> pay for the test to get in the country </connor>
<connor> as well </connor>
<connor> you have to pay for like </connor>
<connor> like you have to like a lot of things </connor>
<connor> people don't consider is like i spend a </connor>
<connor> lot we both spend a lot on just tests oh </connor>
<connor> yes so many tests because because you've </connor>
<joey> got to obviously get tested before you </joey>
<joey> fly out of japan to the uk and then you </joey>
<joey> have to get 150 bucks which it was not </joey>
<connor> 150 bucks and then you have to pay for </connor>
<connor> another test when you land in the uk as </connor>
<connor> well which is also about 100 bucks yeah </connor>
<connor> lots of tests so many goddamn tests yeah </connor>
<garnt> like if you're thinking traveling is </garnt>
<garnt> just you just have to consider the cost </garnt>
<garnt> of the airline that's not a thing </garnt>
<connor> anymore which are also there they've </connor>
<connor> increased the prices on the flights that </connor>
<connor> they know people are flying so like the </connor>
<connor> direct flight from japan to london it </connor>
<connor> was very expensive compared to what it </connor>
<garnt> normally would be </garnt>
<garnt> um well you also looked very i did also </garnt>
<garnt> book very like but even then it was </garnt>
<garnt> still more expensive normally um </garnt>
<garnt> and so yeah so i got this paper and i </garnt>
<garnt> was like great i have this this japanese </garnt>
<garnt> document signed the way i think i sent a </garnt>
<garnt> message to rayna scully who'd also done </garnt>
<garnt> traveling abroad and i was like i sent </garnt>
<connor> her a picture of the signed document i'm </connor>
<connor> like does this look okay and she's like </connor>
<connor> it looks great and i'm like okay good </connor>
<connor> but i had the next appointment the next </connor>
<connor> day for the people who are like yeah </connor>
<connor> dude it's all okay and i should get it </connor>
<connor> i'll get it signed there and all that </connor>
<connor> but to me it didn't make sense a little </connor>
<connor> bit because they i was like how are you </connor>
<connor> gonna sign all this stuff </connor>
<connor> when i have to wait three hours for the </connor>
<connor> results yeah right so i turn up to this </connor>
<connor> this test the next day because i'd </connor>
<connor> already paid for it so i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i mean i'll get another test why </connor>
<connor> not let me know um i </connor>
<connor> i go there and i'm like okay so you need </connor>
<connor> to fill up this formula like no </connor>
<connor> what do you mean like no we don't fill </connor>
<connor> out that form i'm like would you </connor>
<connor> i called you up and you said that you </connor>
<connor> could fill out this form and they're </connor>
<connor> like no no no we don't do that we will </connor>
<connor> give you a form i'm like </connor>
<joey> yeah but you that's that's not that's </joey>
<joey> not good enough for japan i told you i </joey>
<joey> told you this yeah on the phone call and </joey>
<connor> you said it was no problem and they were </connor>
<joey> like no we're not doing that did you not </joey>
<joey> read the forum yeah </joey>
<joey> and then yeah </joey>
<joey> the thread and so then a woman a woman </joey>
<joey> came out of the office and she was like </joey>
<joey> oh no no no come on you're going to go </joey>
<joey> to japan she's like oh yeah come with me </joey>
<joey> come to me </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> and so i go there and i'm like all right </joey>
<joey> so can you fill this out no no i'm not </joey>
<joey> gonna fill it out and i'm like wow why </joey>
<connor> aren't you gonna fill it out she's like </connor>
<connor> oh because the form i'm gonna give you </connor>
<connor> is gonna be enough anyway it's gonna </connor>
<connor> have your passport information on it and </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> i'm like all right </connor>
<connor> but i already knowing that i had </connor>
<connor> the signed document put me at ease i </connor>
<connor> probably would have been very </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable if i was in that situation </connor>
<connor> yeah and didn't have a backup and i'm </connor>
<connor> glad i didn't because i got my test </connor>
<connor> results after you know filling out this </connor>
<connor> form and doing </connor>
<connor> they they were like we promise it'll be </connor>
<connor> fine we promise this form will be enough </connor>
<connor> right yeah and so i'm like okay fine all </connor>
<connor> right fine so i get my results back </connor>
<connor> later it's got even less information on </connor>
<connor> it and no stamp no doctor signature than </connor>
<connor> like the other test result i got to take </connor>
<connor> to the doctor which wasn't even the real </connor>
<connor> one right so they've given me this piece </connor>
<connor> of [ __ ] form and then i went to the </connor>
<connor> website i should have done this before </connor>
<connor> like and the reviews were like terrible </connor>
<connor> for this clinic </connor>
<connor> and then i found out it was a clinic but </connor>
<connor> it was like a weird modern </connor>
<connor> medicine-esque clinic </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> but but it was a legitimate covert </connor>
<connor> testing they they were laughing right </connor>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<connor> not for official documents i'm guessing </connor>
<connor> yeah so then i was like all right </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna i'm gonna see </connor>
<connor> because now i have two forms yeah when i </connor>
<connor> when i go to the airport i'm like i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna give them the [ __ ] one first and </connor>
<connor> see if they accept it yeah and they </connor>
<connor> probably thought i was [ __ ] weird for </connor>
<connor> doing this as well so i give them the </connor>
<connor> form and then they look really confused </connor>
<connor> they looked really uncomfortable and </connor>
<connor> they brought like some staff over and i </connor>
<connor> knew they were about to tell me like you </connor>
<connor> can't get on the flight with this yeah </connor>
<connor> and i was like and before they said </connor>
<connor> anything to me i was like by the way i </connor>
<garnt> have another form just in case and they </garnt>
<joey> looked at me like what would you mean oh </joey>
<garnt> i have like another test with the form </garnt>
<joey> filled out and they looked at me like </joey>
<joey> i'm like i was doing something really </joey>
<joey> bizarre i imagine it would be they were </joey>
<joey> like why didn't you just give us it was </joey>
<joey> like why did this guy do like a bait and </joey>
<connor> switch because if i paid 150 bucks for </connor>
<connor> this i wanted to make sure that it was </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> this man limit testing the system right </garnt>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<joey> i wanted to see it's all right here's </joey>
<connor> the full patch </connor>
<connor> i wanted to see if i had been ripped off </connor>
<connor> and i i realized now i played paper </connor>
<garnt> please the other day and i feel like oh </garnt>
<garnt> this is what they did in paper please </garnt>
<garnt> some people just wouldn't give their </garnt>
<connor> passport or something </connor>
<garnt> but yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> so um </garnt>
<garnt> testing for bugs </garnt>
<garnt> they didn't tell me they weren't gonna </garnt>
<garnt> accept it but yeah </garnt>
<connor> they were like bringing managers over </connor>
<connor> and stuff after i had them this form and </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> don't let's let's not worry let's not </connor>
<connor> kick me out here's the real one here's </connor>
<connor> the real yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah because like i i talked to like a </garnt>
<garnt> few people who had traveled to the home </garnt>
<connor> country and back to japan before i even </connor>
<connor> flew and that's how i knew about this </connor>
<connor> quarantine hotel that we were going to </connor>
<connor> have to stay in yeah we'll get to that </connor>
<connor> but uh they every one of them told me </connor>
<connor> you need to get this form this form that </connor>
<connor> the japanese government give you signed </connor>
<connor> doesn't matter what any clinic says </connor>
<connor> doesn't matter </connor>
<connor> what they promise if you don't have this </connor>
<joey> form you're not gonna get you're not </joey>
<joey> gonna guaranteed to get back in right </joey>
<joey> right and so you have to look for a </joey>
<joey> specific clinic that can fill out this </joey>
<joey> exact form with a doctor </joey>
<joey> which is a lot harder to find than you </joey>
<joey> originally think it is right it's really </joey>
<joey> difficult yeah it's there's there's a </joey>
<joey> big difference between getting a </joey>
<joey> positive covert test which is all you </joey>
<joey> need to get out of japan but getting </joey>
<connor> back into japan you need to have this </connor>
<connor> exact form in order to get back in japan </connor>
<connor> um and luckily connor kind of went a few </connor>
<connor> days before me so </connor>
<joey> i i had like my own clinic booked and </joey>
<joey> hearing about his second experience i'm </joey>
<garnt> just like yeah i'm just gonna go for the </garnt>
<garnt> proven way and uh yeah let connor be my </garnt>
<connor> uh beta tester yeah </connor>
<connor> it was just like it was so stressful i </connor>
<joey> was just trying to like </joey>
<joey> just trying to get a goddamn piece of </joey>
<joey> paper signed yeah and it was like </joey>
<joey> impossible </joey>
<joey> but you know luckily i managed to do it </joey>
<joey> i don't know how it would be in the us </joey>
<joey> um i just know that getting doctor </joey>
<joey> appointments in the uk is quite </joey>
<joey> difficult unless you're spending money </joey>
<joey> like a lot of money um so and again it's </joey>
<joey> kind of come under a lot of criticism </joey>
<connor> rightfully so because traveling even </connor>
<connor> though it you know obviously it's a </connor>
<connor> luxury in general but like they've made </connor>
<connor> it ridiculously expensive to travel like </connor>
<connor> like yeah like we i've already spent </connor>
<garnt> like 600 500 bucks on covert tests alone </garnt>
<garnt> yeah same thing which i you know i'm i'm </garnt>
<connor> lucky enough to afford that but like </connor>
<connor> it's pretty [ __ ] that it's that much </connor>
<connor> yeah you know i mean like and it's yeah </connor>
<connor> it's it's weird it's it's annoying so </connor>
<connor> then yeah i got on the plane and then i </connor>
<garnt> almost felt too easy because i got </garnt>
<garnt> through checking and it was super easy </garnt>
<garnt> like was it easy for you as well yeah it </garnt>
<connor> was very easy show them the paper they </connor>
<garnt> were like yeah have have fun </garnt>
<garnt> yeah once once you get once you show the </garnt>
<connor> paper which was the same for me like </connor>
<connor> going out the country once you show the </connor>
<connor> paper and everything's accepted then </connor>
<connor> it's like it's it's the most stressless </connor>
<connor> experience i've had in an airport </connor>
<connor> because it's [ __ ] empty because no </connor>
<connor> one's traveling so you're like </connor>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
<connor> security or anything you just walk </connor>
<connor> straight in </connor>
<connor> um and it's just it's just a breeze i've </connor>
<garnt> never had like after everything got </garnt>
<garnt> accepted i've never had a </garnt>
<garnt> more pleasant experience in an airport </garnt>
<garnt> and i never i never thought you could </garnt>
<garnt> have a good experience in an airport </garnt>
<garnt> until until like until now </garnt>
<connor> it was really chill yeah i had a great </connor>
<connor> time at the airport it was i charge all </connor>
<connor> my devices i was like there was in my </connor>
<connor> terminal i think i counted there was </connor>
<connor> like 20 people in the whole waiting area </connor>
<connor> wow it's like the the whole thing yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so you had like you know your whole </connor>
<connor> section to yourself it was really nice </connor>
<garnt> pretty good yeah but then uh but then it </garnt>
<garnt> came to coming back into japan and we </garnt>
<connor> always obviously talked about the </connor>
<connor> documents </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> that was just the start of the process </connor>
<connor> right because you get off the plane and </connor>
<connor> obviously you have to present the same </connor>
<garnt> documents and everything like that </garnt>
<garnt> um and they put you they put you into </garnt>
<garnt> this like this queue of just checkpoints </garnt>
<connor> and there's like eight checkpoints </connor>
<joey> that's before immigration </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] out so yeah eight checkpoints </joey>
<connor> before you can even get to what is </connor>
<garnt> normally the annoying part yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah and i </connor>
<connor> you kind of like you you go in and you </connor>
<joey> give you they present you these </joey>
<joey> documents right and then they give you a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] tag right that you have to put </joey>
<joey> over your hand </joey>
<joey> to identify you </joey>
<connor> that's exactly it so you're literally </connor>
<joey> like being cattle being herded through </joey>
<joey> it's how it's how they know you're going </joey>
<joey> to the quarantine hotel they put this </joey>
<joey> large </joey>
<connor> thing on your hands yeah like this </connor>
<garnt> they literally they literally tag you </garnt>
<connor> right i'm like </connor>
<garnt> and i took it off for a second and </garnt>
<joey> someone shouted at me because i wanted </joey>
<garnt> to get my coat off and i took it off and </garnt>
<joey> they were like like two men came over </joey>
<joey> like shouting and like panicking at me </joey>
<connor> and pointing at us put it back on and i </connor>
<connor> was like what the [ __ ] man like give me </connor>
<garnt> a [ __ ] second </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so like you have to they give you </garnt>
<connor> about like 17 million documents that </connor>
<connor> they will just like check a call like </connor>
<connor> across like this journey that you take </connor>
<connor> because and and the thing is like you </connor>
<connor> present this document they check it </connor>
<connor> great go to the next checkpoint they ask </connor>
<connor> for the same document </connor>
<connor> and they check it you go to the next </connor>
<connor> point and for some reason like this </connor>
<connor> these few documents that you you have </connor>
<connor> get checked </connor>
<connor> a total about like five times </connor>
<connor> like by by different checkpoints even </connor>
<connor> though nothing changed between you </connor>
<connor> walking from point a to point b right </connor>
<connor> there's like eight stops right so the </connor>
<connor> first stop is they </connor>
<connor> so this is also a thing right no one </connor>
<connor> told me this you have to keep your </connor>
<joey> boarding card </joey>
<joey> normally on airplanes i just like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] the moment i'm on the plane i </joey>
<garnt> just like put the boarding card in my </garnt>
<connor> pocket scrambled up or something yeah </connor>
<garnt> but that's really because you don't need </garnt>
<garnt> it anymore you're on the plane you do </garnt>
<garnt> you the luggage the luggage tags what'd </garnt>
<garnt> you do with the luggage tags because </garnt>
<garnt> that's normally on your card oh no they </garnt>
<connor> normally put that on your passport or </connor>
<connor> something oh really oh yeah but the </connor>
<connor> luggage tags i know i know my bag i've </connor>
<joey> never had to use it i i always hold on </joey>
<joey> to it until i'm out at the airport oh </joey>
<connor> the luggage tags i keep but normally the </connor>
<joey> boarding card i would like to scramble </joey>
<joey> in my pocket or something oh really tell </joey>
<joey> me no one told me you needed it because </joey>
<joey> you never need it at an airport right i </joey>
<joey> just hold on to it just in case yeah </joey>
<joey> just in case you can't throw it away i'm </joey>
<joey> not like on the plane [ __ ] tearing it </joey>
<garnt> up but like yeah i don't think about it </garnt>
<joey> much i kind of just yeah whatever but </joey>
<garnt> yeah you needed it so when you get off </garnt>
<garnt> the plane they ask for like your </garnt>
<garnt> passport your boarding pass and the </garnt>
<garnt> documents now i printed off all the </garnt>
<garnt> documents that the japanese government </garnt>
<garnt> told me to have yep turns out that some </garnt>
<garnt> of them they just give you on the plane </garnt>
<garnt> anyway yep so i didn't need to print </garnt>
<garnt> them out so i did i didn't even end up </garnt>
<joey> using my version i used the ones that </joey>
<joey> they printed out for me right uh because </joey>
<joey> it was like smaller and the one i </joey>
<joey> printed out was a4 and it was like a we </joey>
<joey> i yeah i didn't understand so so you </joey>
<joey> have these two documents one of them is </joey>
<joey> a declaration saying that you're a good </joey>
<joey> boy and you won't leave your house and </joey>
<joey> you won't break quarantine rules and if </joey>
<joey> you do they'll deport you okay um and if </joey>
<joey> you're not ominous at all yeah and if </joey>
<joey> you're a japanese national i think they </joey>
<joey> will do criminal charges or something </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't know how much they're </joey>
<connor> enforcing it um and another one was uh </connor>
<connor> you have to circle the countries you </connor>
<connor> came from you've been in the past 14 </connor>
<connor> days yeah and then you sign your name </connor>
<connor> and stuff and then they always check </connor>
<connor> this and they put like they put a lot of </connor>
<connor> your information on the sheet i didn't </connor>
<garnt> realize which sheet was going to be </garnt>
<garnt> important yeah so i didn't i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> either so yeah the first check is they </garnt>
<connor> check those documents and the next one </connor>
<connor> is the wellness wellness check where </connor>
<connor> they take your temperature and then you </connor>
<connor> have to do a cover test immediately at </connor>
<connor> the airport okay so you use like a pcr </connor>
<connor> test not like an antigen test as well so </connor>
<joey> the difference between a pcr test is you </joey>
<joey> have to like take your spit yeah whereas </joey>
<connor> with an antigen test i think you can </connor>
<joey> shove the thing in your nose </joey>
<connor> and it's like it's like an instant </connor>
<connor> almost an instant like response with the </connor>
<connor> antigen test with the pcr it takes like </connor>
<connor> an hour you need a centrifuge for it so </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> the other way around the pcr test is the </joey>
<joey> one up your nose i think the antigen </joey>
<garnt> test </garnt>
<joey> no i i i think you can i'm i mean i took </joey>
<connor> bikes </connor>
<garnt> all i know is that they put it in a </garnt>
<joey> centrifuge that's yeah yeah yeah like </joey>
<joey> that's that's how they tested it </joey>
<joey> i think that's why they can do it fast </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> so you you get like asked oh you're </joey>
<joey> feeling okay uh you know they check your </joey>
<joey> temperature again i don't know what </joey>
<joey> happens if you have a high temperature i </joey>
<joey> assume they just like put you down like </joey>
<joey> they just like shoot you on the spot i </joey>
<joey> don't know like i don't </joey>
<joey> grab the pillow </joey>
<garnt> like like </garnt>
<garnt> come out and just take you away like i i </garnt>
<connor> don't know what happened </connor>
<joey> nobody so you get melted into </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah like if you anytime i asked </garnt>
<connor> anyone questions i got like looked at </connor>
<joey> like a [ __ ] weirdo why is this cow </joey>
<connor> talking </connor>
<joey> okay before we go on to uh i'll explain </joey>
<joey> more of the flow i don't know okay i'll </joey>
<joey> do it after so um you go to the wellness </joey>
<connor> check and then you need to do a cover </connor>
<connor> test immediately the problem is right i </connor>
<connor> was really dehydrated and i need to </connor>
<connor> start spinning yeah yeah and i couldn't </connor>
<connor> spit anything i was just spitting air </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> and on the wall they had pictures of </connor>
<connor> plums and lemons to help you </connor>
<connor> to help you to help you get some saliva </connor>
<joey> and i'm like this is not helping </joey>
<joey> why did they not just give you a plumber </joey>
<joey> no because you're not meant to like eat </joey>
<joey> or drink anything before you do it </joey>
<connor> because that all dilutes like a result </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> yeah you do that you someone takes your </connor>
<connor> test you know they all look at you like </connor>
<garnt> you're the devil </garnt>
<joey> like like but the thing is the thing is </joey>
<joey> like you're you're in a room right where </joey>
<connor> uh you're just full of a bunch of people </connor>
<connor> spitting yeah it's really [ __ ] weird </connor>
<connor> and they like spitting into this </connor>
<joey> container which is like which is pieces </joey>
<joey> of plums </joey>
<joey> yeah which is like which is like you </joey>
<joey> know you don't really it's not really </joey>
<joey> like the nicest thing to watch people </joey>
<joey> spitting into this glass </joey>
<joey> this container right and sydney had like </joey>
<connor> sydney after being on his flight for </connor>
<connor> like 12 hours felt a bit queasy yeah you </connor>
<connor> know and i could just i could just hear </connor>
<connor> her in like the uh in the container next </connor>
<connor> to me because she was feeling queasy </connor>
<joey> before she had to do it and her seeing </joey>
<joey> people spitting around </joey>
<garnt> she was just like </garnt>

<garnt> a bit sick see that's just yeah a </garnt>
<garnt> stranger spit just be like </garnt>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] weird and uh that sounds so </joey>
<connor> post-apocalyptic yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> you do the spitting thing you give it to </connor>
<connor> someone uh they check the documents that </connor>
<connor> you have the the right uh covid barcode </connor>
<connor> on your thing and then you go to a place </connor>
<connor> where they make you give your email and </connor>
<connor> then they they send you an email and </connor>
<garnt> they make sure you got it right and </garnt>
<garnt> that's okay that's fine and then they </garnt>
<garnt> make you install these apps i i </garnt>
<garnt> pre-installed them but then i had a </garnt>
<garnt> problem this app was so [ __ ] jank </garnt>
<garnt> when i selected my birth date as july it </garnt>
<garnt> would randomly just go back to june oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah that's something that happened </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah and i had to </joey>
<joey> reinstall the whole app and the internet </joey>
<joey> was [ __ ] and it wasn't installing for </joey>
<connor> some reason and they came over and they </connor>
<connor> were like oh here's a pocket wi-fi i'm </connor>
<connor> like no i've got 4g it's fine i don't </connor>
<connor> know this app is just dog [ __ ] i don't </connor>
<connor> know going on it like didn't install and </connor>
<garnt> that it's this really [ __ ] weird </garnt>
<garnt> thing that's watching you fill out this </garnt>
<connor> this app as well and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> sorry it's all right man you can you can </connor>
<connor> help someone else i'm all right i can do </connor>
<connor> this i can apparently the first time but </connor>
<connor> i can fill it out yeah and they make you </connor>
<connor> make sure that your google maps thing is </connor>
<connor> on and i was like yeah it's on already </connor>
<connor> it's always on there like can we check </connor>
<connor> and i'm like all right sure so i showed </connor>
<connor> them they're like okay good good nice </connor>
<connor> nice nice good </connor>
<connor> yeah and then once i got that installed </connor>
<joey> you go to the waiting area to get your </joey>
<joey> covert test results </joey>
<joey> which takes a couple of hours right no </joey>
<joey> no no mine took 30 minutes how long did </joey>
<joey> yours take um </joey>
<garnt> waiting mine took about an hour okay </garnt>
<connor> yeah mine's about 30 minutes but then i </connor>
<connor> and then you get get put into the bus </connor>
<connor> waiting area mm-hmm yeah and that was a </connor>
<joey> long time i waited to be shipped off to </joey>
<joey> the butchers basically basically and </joey>
<joey> they've gotten it's weird because </joey>
<joey> they've got they've </joey>
<connor> laid you out like you're sitting on a </connor>
<connor> bus yeah do they do that for you as well </connor>
<connor> yeah they're in a corner and you're all </connor>
<connor> sitting like you are on a bus it's like </connor>
<garnt> it's like a dress rehearsal it's like </garnt>
<joey> you're on a bus </joey>
<joey> it's like what they do in school </joey>
<garnt> that's exactly where where like you have </garnt>
<joey> like this teacher who leads you onto the </joey>
<joey> bus and you have to sit in like the </joey>
<garnt> exact same way you sat down and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like what is this </garnt>
<connor> yeah and and then you know once you've </connor>
<connor> got all that then okay so this whole </connor>
<connor> process this part took like three hours </connor>
<connor> yeah and then you can go through </connor>
<connor> immigration right which which takes a </connor>
<connor> while again yeah but luckily because </connor>
<connor> there's no uh no um people traveling </connor>
<connor> it's a little quicker yeah um but yeah </connor>
<garnt> it does just take yourself yes so you're </garnt>
<garnt> if you if you fly back in japan at the </garnt>
<garnt> moment uh regardless of how quickly or </garnt>
<joey> how many people are like flying in with </joey>
<joey> you you're going to be in the airport </joey>
<joey> for around three to four hours i was </joey>
<joey> there for five before you get to </joey>
<joey> immigration </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> before you can even get your bags </joey>
<joey> because i was i was there wondering am i </joey>
<connor> even gonna get gonna get my bags today </connor>
<connor> yeah like what's happening with that so </connor>
<connor> yeah so you're basically after your 12 </connor>
<connor> hour journey which is what we had 12 13 </connor>
<connor> hours on a plane you have to draw </connor>
<connor> another four hours in an airport being </connor>
<connor> herded </connor>
<connor> um through this through the system which </connor>
<connor> like it kind of felt like this dystopian </connor>
<connor> society yeah </connor>
<connor> where you were just treated like cattle </connor>
<connor> like a piece of meat being hurted </connor>
<connor> through herded through uh you you you </connor>
<garnt> know you were there to be processed </garnt>
<connor> which is weird man because i don't know </connor>
<connor> what happens if you just don't follow </connor>
<joey> along yeah it was just really weird and </joey>
<connor> uh very strange you are you are treated </connor>
<connor> almost like uh a disease rather than a </connor>
<connor> person yeah yeah um which you know i i </connor>
<garnt> don't give a [ __ ] about it's whatever </garnt>
<joey> but it's just weird um waiting for my </joey>
<garnt> bags to take so long because you have to </garnt>
<garnt> because obviously when you get your bags </garnt>
<garnt> in the airport you can just go yeah </garnt>
<connor> because we're all on the same bus i'm </connor>
<connor> all dirty travelers uh we have to all </connor>
<connor> wait till everybody's gone through and </connor>
<connor> everybody's got their bag and then you </connor>
<connor> can start going through the bag checking </connor>
<connor> yeah so you still you kind of once </connor>
<joey> you've got your bag you still gotta wait </joey>
<joey> and then i don't know if this happened </joey>
<joey> to you they bring out like search dogs </joey>
<joey> and stuff yeah and they checked </joey>
<joey> everything </joey>
<joey> i was like oh my bro i'm i don't think </joey>
<joey> the dog can smell covered can it like </joey>
<joey> what what is this i'm like this is a </joey>
<joey> joke and they like they were like i </joey>
<joey> didn't like interrogate you about what </joey>
<joey> you brought in no they were asking me </joey>
<joey> like do you have any food and i was like </joey>
<connor> i mean i got like i got some snacks and </connor>
<connor> they're like what what's what is it what </connor>
<connor> is it with snacks and i'm like it's like </connor>
<connor> a nature bar and they're like does it </connor>
<connor> contain meat i'm like no it's a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> nature bar i don't know like it was just </connor>
<connor> weird they were like grilling me about </connor>
<connor> like these cereal bars i had and i was </connor>
<connor> like it's a [ __ ] cereal bar what do </connor>
<joey> you mean look at it it sounds like </joey>
<garnt> typical australian customs yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean illustrate yeah it makes </connor>
<connor> sense right um and yeah we finally got </connor>
<connor> through it and i was talking to this old </connor>
<connor> japanese man because he lived in the uk </connor>
<connor> for like 20 years and he was like he was </connor>

<joey> for you yeah you get on the bus we had </joey>
<joey> to wait 30 minutes for it to [ __ ] go </joey>
<joey> yeah and then because it was peak </joey>
<joey> traffic hours at this point it took an </joey>
<connor> hour and a half to get to the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hotel </connor>
<connor> so not fun but where was your hotel uh i </connor>
<connor> can't remember where my hotel was but it </connor>
<joey> was a different blindfolded me in the </joey>
<joey> box </joey>
<joey> honestly i got i got in the bus and i </joey>
<joey> just like [ __ ] conked out </joey>
<connor> i could yeah yeah it was like squid </connor>
<joey> gaming because you know music </joey>
<garnt> you know they they didn't they didn't </garnt>
<garnt> need to gasp me i [ __ ] like </garnt>
<joey> congratulations you're here on </joey>
<joey> quarantine day one yeah they took us </joey>
<joey> only half of you will survive </joey>
<connor> they took us all the way from haneda </connor>
<joey> airport which is like very south of </joey>
<joey> tokyo yeah to ryogoku </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like an hour and a half </joey>
<connor> away it was like north north tokyo yeah </connor>
<connor> and i've never been to goku before and </connor>
<connor> it was literally we were staying right </connor>
<garnt> on top of the sumo stadium yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um okay mine was like 20 minutes </garnt>
<connor> away from the airport [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> and so yeah we'll get we'll get into how </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] good your treatment was gone and </connor>
<connor> uh so i get to this hotel and i [ __ ] you </connor>
<connor> not there is like 40 armed guards at </connor>
<connor> this hotel for like 20 of us it was </connor>
<connor> ridiculous </connor>
<connor> it was literally like 40 armed guards </connor>
<connor> and like all they did is just watch you </connor>
<connor> just get off this bus right and they </connor>
<connor> they are watching you the whole time but </connor>
<connor> again presumably i don't know why like </connor>
<connor> this seems excessive </connor>
<joey> i don't even think the prison system has </joey>
<connor> that many [ __ ] no no </connor>
<joey> these hotels have been completely </joey>
<joey> converted into covid uh hotels right </joey>
<connor> they're close to public and only there's </connor>
<connor> one right in shinjuku sanchome right i </connor>
<connor> walked past it and i saw all the guards </connor>
<connor> and with all the facebooks yeah and um </connor>
<connor> yeah and it was just weird you had to </connor>
<connor> wait </connor>
<connor> again you have to wait for [ __ ] sake </connor>
<connor> to wait another 30 minutes finally you </connor>
<connor> get to a table where a woman talks to </connor>
<connor> you and uh she was explaining what you </connor>
<connor> couldn't couldn't do but her english was </connor>
<connor> really bad and obviously again actually </connor>
<connor> i know this is my fault i don't speak </connor>
<connor> japanese uh but i i was like um i asked </connor>
<connor> her a question and she just got really </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> what she like didn't understand and i </connor>
<connor> was like oh um maybe i can ask someone </connor>
<connor> else and i felt really bad but then </connor>
<garnt> someone else came over who spoke like </garnt>
<connor> perfect english and i was like right so </connor>
<garnt> come on what's going on what am i doing </garnt>
<garnt> here man and also this whole time during </garnt>
<garnt> this whole thing i kept asking everyone </garnt>
<connor> at every single checkpoint do you know </connor>
<connor> how many days i'm spending in this hotel </connor>
<connor> because they said three days right when </connor>
<connor> does three days start when would you </connor>
<joey> think it would start like the moment you </joey>
<joey> get to the hotel right now right that's </joey>
<joey> day zero let's stay there but </joey>
<joey> here's the thing that's orientation </joey>
<joey> at every single checkpoint i asked </joey>
<joey> people which day does it start </joey>
<joey> and everyone said a different thing so i </joey>
<connor> didn't know and how long i'm staying in </connor>
<connor> this hotel for until the like at that </connor>
<connor> thing where she says hey you can you </connor>
<connor> will get a test on this day and then if </connor>
<connor> it's negative you can leave that is when </connor>
<connor> i found out how long i'm staying in this </connor>
<connor> hotel for yeah and uh yeah so if you get </connor>
<connor> an extra test you can leave but yeah it </connor>
<connor> was [ __ ] oh my god it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> terrible just getting there not even to </connor>
<connor> mention the hotel oh my god yeah because </connor>
<connor> what was your room like </connor>
<garnt> so it's a nice room and like apple </garnt>
<garnt> hotels although you stayed in the apple </garnt>
<garnt> hotel room yeah did you not i didn't </garnt>
<connor> stay in apple hotels </connor>
<connor> hotel is a chain of uh business hotels </connor>
<connor> yeah also very famous for having a very </connor>
<connor> funny book in them have you heard of </connor>
<connor> this book </connor>
<connor> what it's a it's um a revisionist book </connor>
<connor> of japanese history </connor>
<garnt> um </garnt>
<garnt> that is uh quite </garnt>
<connor> uh what's the word racist that's the </connor>
<connor> word that's right </connor>
<garnt> it's it's like it was a really famous </garnt>
<garnt> book and it caused a lot of controversy </garnt>
<connor> before the olympics like the chinese </connor>
<connor> team refused to stay in the hotel </connor>
<joey> because of this oh yeah i heard about </joey>
<connor> that because this book is like it would </connor>
<garnt> say that like things that japan did </garnt>
<garnt> never happened and stuff like that right </garnt>
<garnt> so it was a very it's kind of a somewhat </garnt>
<garnt> weird controversial and the owner is a </garnt>
<garnt> controversial figure of apple hotel i </garnt>
<garnt> think as well anyway stay in a just a </garnt>
<garnt> fun little history um so this hotel i </garnt>
<garnt> had one of the rooms and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like it's a business hotel so you're not </garnt>
<garnt> supposed to like be in there all day the </garnt>
<garnt> idea is that you go you travel to like </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere in japan you do your business </garnt>
<joey> in the the day and then you sleep at </joey>
<joey> night it's just used to sharing yeah </joey>
<connor> because i've got everything i've stayed </connor>
<joey> in the app hotel as well um probably </joey>
<joey> like they're all very similar styles </joey>
<joey> yeah extra i remember like there's only </joey>
<joey> enough space in there for a bed yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah and like and like there's no room </connor>
<connor> to walk at all it is very much like a </connor>
<connor> prison cell yeah because you do have a </connor>
<connor> tv right but the tv's right like you you </connor>
<connor> can probably kick the tv with how close </connor>
<connor> it is to the bed because it's it's like </connor>
<connor> it has like enough space to contain a </connor>
<garnt> human being in it right and that's what </garnt>
<connor> it's designed yeah so i'm 5 10 and my </connor>
<joey> feet were just at the end of the bed </joey>
<joey> yeah so if you're like six five yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah bro you're [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> i i show it off in the video a lot that </joey>
<joey> i filmed but the </joey>
<joey> you get this room </joey>
<connor> and there's about um two steps </connor>
<connor> horizontally and like two steps vertical </connor>
<connor> of walking room </connor>
<connor> so that's all the room you have you're </connor>
<connor> not allowed to leave the room obviously </connor>
<connor> yeah um and if you do try and leave the </connor>
<connor> room there is an armed guard outside who </connor>
<connor> will shout at you if you even open your </connor>
<connor> door for long longer than like five </connor>
<connor> seconds uh because i spoke to an irish </connor>
<connor> guy who was there and he said he wanted </connor>
<connor> to get some fresh air in his room </connor>
<connor> because you can't open the window you </connor>
<connor> can't even crack it open all right like </connor>
<connor> the window doesn't open at all yeah so </connor>
<connor> if you want any fresh air like you you </connor>
<connor> can't yeah so it's kind of </connor>
<connor> at least by the second day my room </connor>
<connor> started to smell </connor>
<connor> not good </connor>
<joey> so i understand that he wanted to leave </joey>
<joey> his door open apparently like two guards </joey>
<joey> came over and like told them to close </joey>
<connor> the door and if you do it again they'll </connor>
<connor> like do something </connor>
<joey> and then we never saw him again </joey>
<connor> but all right and now so you spent three </connor>
<connor> days there right if you get a negative </connor>
<connor> test you get to leave yeah all right the </connor>
<connor> scary thing was is the moment i landed </connor>
<connor> and i got into my hotel i got an email </connor>
<connor> from the ministry of health telling me </connor>
<garnt> that somebody on my flight tested </garnt>
<garnt> positive for kovid oh [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> so if i got kovit i would have to stay </garnt>
<garnt> in that hotel for 14 days [ __ ] so that i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know when they change your sheets </garnt>
<garnt> or do anything like that so they don't </garnt>
<garnt> change your shoes right right but like i </garnt>
<connor> was like accumulating a lot of trash i </connor>
<connor> mean like meals and stuff adds up and </connor>
<connor> the bottles and stuff adds up can you </connor>
<connor> get rid of that no i only the meal they </connor>
<garnt> they didn't collect bottles or they they </garnt>
<garnt> took yours </garnt>
<garnt> we'll get into that we'll get into that </garnt>
<garnt> and like </garnt>
<garnt> okay the room itself is nice like it's a </garnt>
<garnt> good hotel except the pillow the pillow </garnt>
<garnt> oh my [ __ ] god this this pillow this </garnt>
<garnt> pillow is meant as for sadists it's one </garnt>
<garnt> of those concaved like medical pillows </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so your neck is like this </garnt>
<connor> right because it's supposed to like </connor>
<connor> stretch your neck out yeah that is not a </connor>
<connor> i do not want to sleep on that when i </connor>
<connor> have jet lag and i'm trying to just </connor>
<connor> fight for my life to get eight hours of </connor>
<connor> sleep here and so i told gone i was like </connor>
<connor> bring her to paint your own pillow </connor>
<connor> because these pillows suck but you </connor>
<connor> didn't have a hotel so yeah you didn't </connor>
<joey> need it but yeah definitely the worst </joey>
<connor> thing was not being able to walk or have </connor>
<connor> fresh air yeah and i thought </connor>
<joey> okay at least even even in prison they </joey>
<joey> get one hour of outside time a day right </joey>
<joey> yeah can i come out can i have one hour </joey>
<joey> of outside time please i want some some </joey>
<joey> walking but it's only three days so it's </joey>
<joey> not matter yeah it's it was [ __ ] but it </joey>
<joey> had to be done right and then the meals </joey>
<joey> were crap right yeah so you guys sent me </joey>
<joey> pictures of them oh yeah i got i i </joey>
<connor> posted one of them and i was like this </connor>
<connor> is the saddest breakfast ever and it </connor>
<connor> caused like a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> argument </garnt>
<connor> i don't eat breakfast or something i </connor>
<connor> don't eat breakfast right and uh this </connor>
<connor> this breakfast right had like french </connor>
<connor> fries uh sliced ham which is fine but </connor>
<connor> hot like </connor>
<connor> those uh single cheese slices sliced in </connor>
<connor> half one small tomato one piece of </connor>
<connor> broccoli a quiche or an omelet i still </connor>
<connor> didn't know what it was um </connor>
<connor> i really really hard croissant bread </connor>
<connor> roll and cinnamon roll and three pieces </connor>
<connor> of macaroni </connor>
<joey> for breakfast i think in-flight meals </joey>
<connor> are better than that well that's the </connor>
<connor> thing is that people are like this looks </connor>
<connor> amazing i'm like think about it this is </connor>
<connor> breakfast i just want like cornflakes or </connor>
<connor> something i don't want i don't want this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] what is this i don't want cold </connor>
<connor> french fries that's another thing all of </connor>
<garnt> this stuff was very cold all the meals </garnt>
<garnt> you get are cool it's cold and they uh </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have a microwave yeah there's </garnt>
<garnt> no way to heat it up yeah it would have </garnt>
<garnt> been nice of a microwave so i can heat </garnt>
<garnt> them up because some of them were nice </garnt>
<garnt> there was one where they made like jerk </garnt>
<connor> chicken rice and that was good but most </connor>
<garnt> of them were really ice cold </garnt>
<connor> not that good um but that that that one </connor>
<joey> breakfast oh my god that made me like so </joey>
<joey> depressed i was like this </joey>
<joey> this is it and everyone's if your </joey>
<joey> situation isn't already depressing and </joey>
<joey> everyone was like it's so privileged con </joey>
<joey> it's like look at it this is not a </joey>
<joey> balanced breakfast in any capacity no </joey>
<connor> one should have cold french fries for </connor>
<connor> breakfast i was like what's wrong with </connor>
<connor> you guys because they were like in my </connor>
<connor> country that would be amazing i'm like </connor>
<garnt> what country tell me your country may </garnt>
<garnt> have made mainland like sweating now </garnt>
<connor> every because if they're like you know </connor>
<connor> whenever i've been to countries that are </connor>
<connor> you know are not as as wealthy as other </connor>
<garnt> countries they normally have the best </garnt>
<garnt> breakfasts yeah because they're always </garnt>
<joey> home cooked and they're amazing they're </joey>
<joey> like really cheap really filling like </joey>
<joey> you know i had like sri lankan breakfast </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] was the best [ __ ] i'd ever had </joey>
<joey> for breakfast it was like a curry thing </joey>
<joey> i would kill for that over some shitty </joey>
<joey> corn flakes or oatmeal are you kidding </joey>
<joey> me yeah i got so annoyed about this </joey>
<connor> whole thing and everyone would call me </connor>
<joey> privilege but it sounds like god had a </joey>
<garnt> much better time i okay so so like so </garnt>
<garnt> like i was prepared i was prepared for </garnt>
<connor> prison i was like because i i i talked </connor>
<connor> to other people who traveled before and </connor>
<connor> had a very very similar experience to </connor>
<connor> connor um where it was it did feel like </connor>
<connor> you were like just stuck in a prison </connor>
<connor> cage and you can leave your room um </connor>
<connor> i i knew about the cold meals as well </connor>
<connor> and like the one advice everyone gave me </connor>
<connor> before traveling was </connor>
<connor> pack snacks yeah i brought a lot of </connor>
<connor> snacks </connor>
<connor> right so </connor>
<connor> like because like i i'd seen the meals </connor>
<garnt> so i'll just like </garnt>
<garnt> all i knew is that most places had a </garnt>
<garnt> kettle so i was like all right i know </garnt>
<garnt> what i'm gonna do </garnt>
<garnt> i filled up an entire carry-on case </garnt>
<connor> we've just it was just instant ramen </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> i posted a picture on like twitter </joey>
<joey> why did you need 20. </joey>
<joey> because me okay so like before flying </joey>
<connor> off </connor>
<connor> um i tell my mom mom i'm probably gonna </connor>
<connor> need snacks </connor>
<connor> if anyone knows asian mums they will </connor>
<connor> over pack the food for [ __ ] and she's </connor>
<connor> gonna be like okay here's what you need </connor>
<connor> for the quarantine maybe you might need </connor>
<connor> a bit more if you're missing home and </connor>
<connor> you want a bit more ramen but you know </connor>
<connor> what you know i've got a few spare why </connor>
<connor> don't i pack that as well and i'm in the </connor>
<connor> suitcase and i just see a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> mountain of instant ramen there </connor>
<connor> and i'm just like i can survive nuclear </connor>
<connor> winter now man i'm [ __ ] sorted like </connor>
<connor> let let alone for quarantine yeah like </connor>
<connor> yeah so i had like just a whole like i </connor>
<connor> had like like a normal suitcase and then </connor>
<connor> just i carry on that was just full of </connor>
<connor> food and snacks prepared for this prison </connor>
<connor> experience i was going to get i was </connor>
<connor> going to go through um and so you know i </connor>
<connor> had exactly the same experience with </connor>
<connor> connor going on the bus and everything </connor>
<connor> calmed down the bus and woke up don't </connor>
<connor> know where i was just like [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] squid game like </connor>
<connor> where am i oh my god okay i'm ready i'm </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm ready for </connor>
<connor> i'm ready to for the prison experience </connor>
<connor> to start so i get off </connor>
<connor> and uh first thing is that you know uh </connor>
<connor> you get chauffeured in i didn't have any </connor>
<connor> armed guards just like a bunch of like </connor>
<garnt> the people who worked at the hotel who </garnt>
<garnt> were obviously like dexter there was no </garnt>
<garnt> security there was security but they </garnt>
<garnt> weren't armed they were just people who </garnt>
<garnt> it looked like they were just people who </garnt>
<garnt> worked in the hotel just like with a </garnt>
<connor> full like hazmat suit on basically oh </connor>
<connor> yeah that's totally different okay so so </connor>
<garnt> um so here's a hack if uh </garnt>
<garnt> here's a life hack that i i learned </garnt>
<connor> going through this process is if you're </connor>
<connor> if you're traveling with someone they </connor>
<connor> will give you extra privileges and extra </connor>
<connor> rooms yeah because because connor </connor>
<connor> traveled by himself i did and i was </connor>
<connor> traveling with sydney so </connor>
<connor> uh when they sat us down and uh </connor>
<connor> gave us gave us the whole spiel of love </connor>
<connor> oh you can't do this you can't drink </connor>
<garnt> alcohol you go you can't leave your room </garnt>
<garnt> can't open your window yada yada um and </garnt>
<garnt> then i was just like oh i mean me and </garnt>
<garnt> sydney are together can we get a bigger </garnt>
<garnt> room please because my god like your </garnt>
<garnt> room contained a double bed but i </garnt>
<connor> wouldn't know it was a semi double a </connor>
<connor> semi dump semi double </connor>
<connor> there is no way i could stay with </connor>
<connor> another person in that room so me and </connor>
<connor> sydney were deciding should we just you </connor>
<connor> know say we're separate in case we can </connor>
<connor> you know in case they do put us in the </connor>
<connor> same room um but i'm just like let's </connor>
<connor> let's see what they say we say we're </connor>
<connor> together and so i said oh i'm with </connor>
<connor> sydney can we uh stay together please </connor>
<connor> and they were like okay we'll we'll see </connor>
<connor> what we can do and uh so they go off </connor>
<connor> they go off they talk to like their </connor>
<connor> supervisor or something they come back </connor>
<connor> and then they tell us oh yeah i think we </connor>
<connor> can get you a uh we can we we can get </connor>
<joey> your room uh suited for two people and i </joey>
<joey> like that at this point the suite is </joey>
<joey> open at this point i didn't know what it </joey>
<joey> meant right so i i'm like doubling down </joey>
<joey> to be like um is this room big enough </joey>
<joey> for two people because </joey>
<joey> uh like if it is not big enough for two </joey>
<joey> people to stay in for possibly two weeks </joey>
<joey> if we test positive for covid you know </joey>
<joey> god forbid but if it is not big enough </joey>
<joey> then we would rather have separate rooms </joey>
<garnt> yeah and then they go off they go off </garnt>
<garnt> they'll like </garnt>
<garnt> chat chatting again uh to the supervisor </garnt>
<garnt> and then they come back and they'll go </garnt>
<garnt> they get they they go </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm i'm really sorry and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> okay maybe we do need to get two rooms </garnt>
<garnt> and we're like yeah i'm really sorry </garnt>
<garnt> all the king-sized beds are gone this </garnt>
<garnt> one only has a queen-size bed </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> can you say that again and they were </garnt>
<joey> like yeah unfortunately all the </joey>
<joey> king-size sweets are gone so we're gonna </joey>
<joey> have to put you in the queen </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry the room only has three </joey>
<joey> jacuzzis the queen-size suite are you </joey>
<joey> okay with that and i'm like </joey>
<joey> yes i like to look at the city are you </joey>
<joey> okay with that and see like i think </joey>
<garnt> that's good i think that's good </garnt>
<garnt> i'm sorry i'm sorry </garnt>
<garnt> and so uh we get we get taken to our </garnt>
<connor> room did anyone like take you to your </connor>
<garnt> room no okay we had like a guard behind </garnt>
<garnt> us okay so it's like smacked your ass </garnt>

<connor> so we've been lugging them around the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] airports and it's like heavy as </connor>

<garnt> the fact that i could send like a video </garnt>
<garnt> tour of our room right yeah </garnt>
<connor> we live in a society we live in a </connor>
<garnt> society and uh yeah we i mean we had a </garnt>
<joey> lot of the same experiences but i mean </joey>
<joey> did you have a laundry surface in your </joey>
<joey> hotel oh [ __ ] no no </joey>
<joey> no </joey>
<joey> so so what we were allowed to do so uh </joey>
<joey> we had we had a receptionist right so </joey>
<joey> when we walk into the room we notice uh </joey>
<joey> we noticed we noticed that there's only </joey>
<connor> one pillow and we're like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what do we do well there's only one </connor>
<connor> pillow we can't contact anyone so i'm </connor>
<connor> just like there there's this they gave </connor>
<connor> us like a hotline in case anyone um </connor>
<connor> in case anyone like developed symptoms </connor>
<connor> or anything like that yeah um that you </connor>
<connor> can phone </connor>
<connor> but then there's a small print that says </connor>
<connor> you can phone this this this hotline for </connor>
<connor> any other requests that you may need </connor>
<connor> during your stay as well and so </connor>
<connor> we called them up and uh they were just </connor>
<connor> like oh </connor>
<connor> how was your condition and i was like </connor>
<connor> everything's fine um there's only one </connor>
<connor> pillow in my room unfortunately and </connor>
<connor> there's two people staying here can we </connor>
<connor> get another pillow and they were just </connor>
<connor> like yeah yeah sure don't worry about it </connor>
<connor> we'll have someone deliver </connor>
<garnt> we'll have someone deliver a pillow to </garnt>
<garnt> you like like normal hotel service and </garnt>
<garnt> then so we get another pillow we start </garnt>
<garnt> checking in we start looking at the </garnt>
<garnt> instructions and then we can see uh we </garnt>
<garnt> see that we can order things to our room </garnt>
<garnt> like we can order amazon and we're going </garnt>
<garnt> to order deliveries </garnt>
<connor> as well they said i could do that but </connor>
<connor> they had like a very uh weird list of </connor>
<joey> stuff you weren't allowed to order like </joey>
<connor> burgers and pizza and chicken </connor>
<joey> like food certain foods but it wasn't it </joey>
<connor> was really oddly written that i didn't </connor>
<connor> really understand it and you couldn't </connor>
<connor> get certain things like amazon delivered </connor>
<garnt> they said that you couldn't yeah we so </garnt>
<garnt> we we actually were able to get amazon </garnt>
<garnt> deliveries to our room we couldn't get </garnt>
<garnt> overseas we couldn't get hot food that </garnt>
<garnt> was like that was like the only thing </garnt>
<garnt> that we couldn't get which was hot foods </garnt>
<connor> so we can get amazon deliveries we can </connor>
<connor> get anything that would help our stay be </connor>
<connor> more pleasant </connor>
<connor> um we had like a laundry service where </connor>
<connor> they would come collect laundry at 7am </connor>
<connor> and they would like deliver it deliver </connor>
<connor> it back to our room </connor>
<garnt> we had like a garbage service that would </garnt>
<connor> they would pick up garbage every morning </connor>
<joey> i had my garbage in my room </joey>
<joey> we also had a masseuse just like like </joey>
<joey> yeah they they would like give us new </joey>
<connor> garbage bags every day </connor>
<connor> so we could fill it up </connor>
<connor> and honestly our food aside from like </connor>
<garnt> being cold was pretty damn [ __ ] good </garnt>
<connor> we got like a kind of we got your food </connor>
<garnt> it looked way better than mine yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> got like a [ __ ] decent bento every </garnt>
<garnt> day i mean this is some this is like </garnt>
<garnt> some of this [ __ ] was better than </garnt>
<garnt> matsuya you know like </garnt>
<garnt> and like how what what was like the </garnt>
<garnt> water situation in your place did they </garnt>
<connor> go yeah so so you can ask for more </connor>
<connor> bottles of water you only got one bottle </connor>
<connor> of water okay with every meal </connor>
<connor> and i ran out because i was a thirsty </connor>
<connor> boy yeah i asked for more and they said </connor>
<connor> oh sure we'll deliver it they never </connor>
<garnt> delivered it yeah it just didn't turn </garnt>
<garnt> out so so so when we went in oh uh so i </garnt>
<garnt> i want to say our place also had a mini </garnt>
<joey> fridge as well oh mine did as well did </joey>
<joey> yours as well okay i think most hotels </joey>
<joey> just like it just never got cold though </joey>
<joey> it was like it's just a container yeah </joey>
<joey> so it made it like less than room </joey>
<joey> temperature which i was like i guess </joey>
<connor> that's good but like i mean what am i </connor>
<connor> going to do come and make them replace </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] fridge yes </garnt>
<garnt> so like we realized water would be like </garnt>
<garnt> a very important resource to [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> survive as as it is they said you can </joey>
<joey> use tap water but you know obviously </joey>
<joey> of you know just like [ __ ] in japan so </joey>
<joey> it does </joey>
<joey> um so we go in and there are there is </joey>
<joey> two bottles of water which is standard i </joey>
<connor> guess for every hotel stage i didn't </connor>
<joey> even have that you didn't no okay so </joey>
<connor> they gave us they started off with two </connor>
<connor> bottles of water and then we opened the </connor>
<joey> mini fridge and it was a mini fridge </joey>
<joey> full of bottles of water [ __ ] off </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> mine wasn't even on i didn't turn it on </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> at the start of our journey we had like </joey>
<joey> eight bottles of water which was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> brilliant and every time they delivered </joey>
<garnt> meals which was like three times a day </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um which was like they gave us more </garnt>
<garnt> food that then i needed because like by </garnt>
<garnt> the time i i had like the breakfast was </garnt>
<garnt> massive and by the time lunch was being </garnt>
<connor> delivered yeah i often didn't eat </connor>
<connor> breakfast because i wasn't hungry yeah </connor>
<garnt> by the way by the time lunch delivered i </garnt>
<garnt> was still full from breakfast so i had a </garnt>
<joey> little bit of lunch and then like by the </joey>
<joey> time dinner came i like i was like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> i was eating like a [ __ ] king i don't </connor>
<joey> know like </joey>
<connor> it was it was it was a great it was a </connor>
<joey> great the dichotomy that we faced this </joey>

<garnt> yeah and like where you were you just i </garnt>
<joey> couldn't even play games or watch [ __ ] </joey>

<joey> like lying there checking twitter and </joey>
<joey> just like should i do something no i'm </joey>
<joey> too tired why because i can't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> walk so i'm just i'm literally just </joey>
<joey> lying sitting down all day he's just </joey>
<garnt> and it makes you feel [ __ ] awful like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't i don't know it was terrible i </garnt>
<joey> know i'm sound like you're a little </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] and i'm sure everyone's going to </connor>
<joey> say that but i mean i like no i i saw </joey>
<garnt> the photos of some of the photos i'd </garnt>
<garnt> thought the same way it's one of those </garnt>
<garnt> things where when you see it and hear it </garnt>
<connor> you're like doesn't sound too bad but </connor>
<connor> then when you do it you're like oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> this is really [ __ ] depressing yeah </connor>
<garnt> meanwhile me and sydney were just like </garnt>
<garnt> playing games on like the big screen tv </garnt>
<garnt> in the living room and i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> it's [ __ ] [ __ ] brilliant i'm like </garnt>
<joey> let's pull out the ps5 we packed it </joey>
<connor> i didn't have a game console i tried </connor>
<joey> playing uh some games on my laptop but i </joey>
<joey> immediately was like oh this is just not </joey>
<connor> comfortable yeah it's not comfortable </connor>
<garnt> doing this yeah i don't know and the the </garnt>
<connor> smell of my room was so goddamn bad it </connor>
<garnt> was all the food yeah it was like </garnt>
<connor> coagulating in the air yeah and we'll </connor>
<garnt> sweat yeah but then like after reading a </garnt>
<garnt> few more posts and after like talking to </garnt>
<garnt> various people i think your health your </garnt>
<garnt> hotel quality experience is literally </garnt>
<connor> down to chance well yeah because there's </connor>
<connor> three buses </connor>
<connor> when i noticed there's three bus lines </connor>
<connor> and they all take you to a different </connor>
<connor> hotel and whichever one you go to uh you </connor>
<garnt> get a different experience yeah i think </garnt>
<garnt> i think our hotel was not just a </garnt>
<connor> business hotel it was like it was </connor>
<connor> actually like a four-star hotel yeah and </connor>
<connor> they put us in which </connor>
<joey> sounds like it yeah which i'm just like </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] i got your luck man the lords </garnt>
<connor> are on your side </connor>
<connor> you know what i will say i know i i this </connor>
<connor> is kind of this i don't know i don't </connor>
<connor> make any more squid game jokes but this </connor>
<connor> was yeah when i got on the bus that we </connor>
<connor> all came on there was like half the </connor>
<connor> people on the bus </connor>
<connor> right which means that half of them got </connor>
<connor> coveted </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] hell it was weird first round </joey>
<joey> elimination </joey>
<joey> the irish guy was there who i spoke to </joey>
<joey> and the old man was there </joey>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<joey> so i saw that guy without his mask on in </joey>
<connor> front of like seven armed guards </connor>
<garnt> i was like damn man </garnt>
<garnt> what day did you travel on was it a date </garnt>
<garnt> what day </garnt>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> what would you mean like was it like a </connor>
<connor> saturday like a friday and it was all </connor>
<connor> the same it was all it was it was all it </connor>
<garnt> was because what i will say is that i uh </garnt>
<garnt> like i traveled like right i traveled on </garnt>
<garnt> like a weekday so like not many people </garnt>
<garnt> were traveling so i feel like i was </garnt>
<connor> traveling on a </connor>
<connor> friday maybe i don't know i mean yeah </connor>
<garnt> friday's like a peak time for people to </garnt>
<connor> travel i'm not sure you know i have to </connor>
<connor> have a look but yeah it was um because </connor>
<garnt> like if you travel on the weekend i </garnt>
<garnt> think more people travel on the weekend </garnt>
<garnt> because i feel like </garnt>
<connor> the worst hotels are for the are like </connor>
<connor> when there are too many people traveling </connor>
<connor> that it kind of like bleeds out yeah </connor>
<connor> because yeah i think we'd like there </connor>
<connor> we didn't have too many buses right </connor>
<connor> which is why like we i think we had like </connor>
<connor> one or two buses um and they all went to </connor>
<connor> the same place yeah so i i feel like </connor>
<connor> once that hotel started getting filled </connor>
<connor> out i mean if you think about it why </connor>
<joey> would you need to drive one and a half </joey>
<joey> hours for like because we flew in </joey>
<joey> through hanada which is like south right </joey>
<joey> yeah there's no reason to drive to a </joey>
<garnt> hotel in the [ __ ] north well they </garnt>
<connor> drove to the hotel and they drove us </connor>
<garnt> back to the airport yeah and then when </garnt>
<garnt> you get to the airport you have to have </garnt>
<garnt> a </garnt>
<joey> weird specific uh taxi you can't get a </joey>
<joey> normal taxi yeah can't book a normal </joey>
<joey> taxi it has to be a quarantine approved </joey>
<joey> taxi yeah right um and the problem is </joey>
<joey> that i didn't know what time we were </joey>
<joey> leaving no so how what time i should </joey>
<joey> tell this taxi i couldn't figure it out </joey>
<connor> so i didn't know so i i just i guess now </connor>
<connor> to wait for two hours at the canada and </connor>
<connor> but the thing was right is that so this </connor>
<connor> whole period has just been in quantity </connor>
<garnt> yeah right they drop you off at canada </garnt>
<garnt> and they're like [ __ ] off </garnt>
<garnt> no no one checks you no one makes sure </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone just went went off and i </garnt>
<garnt> was like where's everyone going does </garnt>
<garnt> everyone know where they're going </garnt>
<garnt> i spoke to the irish guy who had um </garnt>
<garnt> who'd done it a few times and he was </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah you can just like chill around </garnt>
<connor> the airport and wait i'm like well i can </connor>
<connor> just go to like the cafe and like </connor>
<connor> interact with people he's like yeah if </connor>
<connor> you want to and i'm like that doesn't </connor>
<connor> seem right i didn't i just i stood in </connor>
<joey> like a corner waiting yeah away from </joey>
<joey> everyone i was like don't come nearby </joey>
<joey> i'm sick </joey>
<connor> but i mean yeah i got it was [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> weird and it was literally like that </joey>
<joey> dude who's been in jail life for most of </joey>
<joey> their life trying to simulate back into </joey>
<joey> society right i thought they were gonna </joey>
<connor> name me i'm one of those like </connor>
<connor> people talking to me that's weird </connor>
<joey> yeah man it was it was [ __ ] weird and </joey>
<joey> uh not very fun experience and it got </joey>
<joey> rid of it now for uk travelers oh really </joey>
<garnt> have they got rid of it have they i </garnt>
<garnt> think no no they haven't okay oh they've </garnt>
<garnt> just they probably will see they reduced </garnt>
<joey> the quarantine time before we flew </joey>
<joey> uh i mean before we flew off to england </joey>
<joey> it was six days in quarantine hotel and </joey>
<joey> then they got halved two three days </joey>
<connor> six days in that hotel which is like six </connor>
<connor> days [ __ ] [ __ ] why couldn't he why </connor>
<joey> couldn't he be sick he would have been </joey>
<connor> around </connor>
<joey> a shiver at that thought another day </joey>
<joey> there </joey>
<joey> was nerve wracking because the day i had </joey>
<joey> to do my test </joey>
<joey> they called me up and they said hey um </joey>
<connor> when you get your results if they're </connor>
<connor> negative you have to leave them right </connor>
<connor> away </connor>
<connor> so you have to pack just in case you're </connor>
<connor> you're </connor>
<connor> that you're leaving yeah yeah but i </connor>
<connor> didn't know and because someone on my </connor>
<connor> plane had been infected </connor>
<connor> there's a good chance that i could have </connor>
<connor> got it and uh yeah luckily i didn't but </connor>
<joey> like they called me up they're like your </joey>
<joey> test results are native please leave the </joey>
<joey> room as soon as possible and like </joey>
<joey> everyone's leaving and i was like what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] i gotta get out of the room </joey>
<joey> which is weird it was really a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> experience don't recommend ign's 10 out </connor>
<garnt> of 10 though yeah i i wouldn't recommend </garnt>
<connor> that experience i would </connor>
<connor> my experience wasn't that bad oh yeah </connor>
<connor> you've got a free sweet hotel really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i remember conor like messaging me </connor>
<connor> every day like i could i knew connor was </connor>
<connor> like trying to say </connor>
<connor> i was like trying to drag something </connor>
<joey> negative about me and i'm just like i </joey>
<connor> mean am i [ __ ] get gone </connor>
<joey> tell me about it tell me i was like </joey>
<joey> honestly it's just it's pretty good </joey>
<joey> actually i'm i'm having a good time </joey>
<joey> like you mentioned the next day being </joey>
<joey> like maybe this this day we'll get to </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm sure something bad happens </connor>
<joey> i went on twitter as well the day i </joey>
<connor> checked in </connor>
<connor> and a [ __ ] video from zed the musical </connor>
<connor> artist </connor>
<connor> was this [ __ ] had like a </connor>
<connor> penthouse suite somewhere like literally </connor>
<connor> a penthouse suite yeah a bedroom </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> an insane view look at this </connor>
<connor> this is crazy </connor>
<connor> i'm ready </connor>
<connor> for the quarantine let's get it and bear </connor>
<connor> in mind japan isn't even giving out </connor>
<connor> visas right now to anyone but somehow he </connor>
<joey> got in you've got to pay us away in </joey>
<joey> japan in japan and he got a visa to get </joey>
<connor> in somehow because he's doing a concert </connor>
<connor> but somehow they made an exception and </connor>
<connor> people were not happy because there was </connor>
<connor> tons of people in the comments being </connor>
<joey> like uh zed you know that like students </joey>
<joey> haven't been able to enter japan in two </joey>
<joey> years yeah the [ __ ] and he's off here </joey>
<garnt> showing his suite and zed didn't even </garnt>
<connor> have to do a quarantine for two weeks </connor>
<garnt> only three days </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so after the quarantine hotel you </garnt>
<connor> still have to quarantine at home for </connor>
<connor> about two weeks four four four four </connor>
<joey> years i'm trying to cancel you for </joey>
<joey> privilege yeah i was like that's a real </joey>
<connor> privilege i made a i made a joke because </connor>
<connor> he gave a room tour that was like two </connor>
<connor> minutes long of like all the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> different rooms he had and all the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> he'd been sent he'd been sent like </connor>
<connor> everything you'd ever need someone </connor>
<connor> sounded like a gaming pc for his </connor>
<connor> quarantine and i was like this is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] stupid this is the stupidest </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i've ever seen </connor>
<connor> and uh i made a i made a parody video </connor>
<connor> yeah i was like hey guys here's my room </connor>
<joey> tour and i just turned the camera and </joey>
<joey> it's just like the room yeah and that's </joey>
<garnt> the whole room yeah and i was just </garnt>
<garnt> joking </garnt>
<connor> i was just joking about like how like </connor>
<connor> how like the difference compared to </connor>
<connor> rooms and then people got angry at me </connor>
<connor> being like you should be happy that you </connor>
<connor> even were able to enter japan you know </connor>
<connor> people haven't been able to enter japan </connor>
<connor> for two years the privilege your show </connor>
<connor> i'm like what the [ __ ] is this </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] that was so annoying this </joey>
<joey> can't get adopted so i deleted the </joey>
<joey> tweets i was getting pissed off with the </joey>
<joey> replies i was like what the [ __ ] are </joey>
<joey> these reply and they're like why are you </joey>
<joey> blaming me don't blame me for lip for </joey>
<joey> being a resident in a country and </joey>
<joey> getting back in blame the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> country for banning any form of visas </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] yeah exactly they feel </joey>
<joey> like taking it out on me i was like i </joey>
<connor> was getting so annoyed well i mean those </connor>
<joey> are humans those people couldn't [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> tweet to the japanese government right </joey>
<connor> yeah i was like </connor>
<connor> they were like you're so lucky that you </connor>
<connor> can re-enter japan like i'm lucky that i </connor>
<connor> can re-enter the country i [ __ ] live </connor>
<connor> in what the [ __ ] do you mean shut the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] up </joey>
<garnt> like what this is absurd like don't </garnt>
<joey> don't don't try and say that i'm lucky </joey>
<garnt> that is pretty unfair we're all we're </garnt>
<connor> all unlucky that the government has some </connor>
<connor> shitty rules on this like don't don't </connor>
<connor> take it out on each other that's why i </connor>
<connor> got annoyed about it because </connor>
<connor> people are attacking other people who </connor>
<connor> are able to get into the country instead </connor>
<connor> of i don't know blaming the people who </connor>
<connor> are making the rules and these arbitrary </connor>
<connor> rules between countries yeah like in </connor>
<connor> america right some some states have to </connor>
<connor> quarantine but others don't yeah and so </connor>
<joey> there's this whole weird thing where </joey>
<connor> it's like why i mean it's all one </connor>
<joey> country right yeah but it's yeah it's </joey>
<joey> the same in australia as well like most </joey>
<joey> of the states the like i mean australia </joey>
<joey> had that the [ __ ] worst though like </joey>
<joey> victoria i think was locked down for </joey>
<joey> like 280 days in a row yeah something </joey>
<joey> like that like no interstate thing like </joey>
<joey> my sister was like yeah i can't i'm not </joey>
<joey> allowed to travel more than 10 </joey>
<joey> kilometers from my house yeah otherwise </joey>
<connor> i get fined but like but like there's </connor>
<connor> nothing stopping you from just </connor>
<joey> if you live in like so one of the </joey>
<joey> countries that was banned was like texas </joey>
<joey> you could just fly from the state the </joey>
<joey> state yeah the states the state was </joey>
<joey> country </joey>
<joey> wishes uh the state of texas was like </joey>
<connor> one country that you would have to </connor>
<connor> quarantine in yeah um go to the hotel </connor>
<connor> for but there were other states you </connor>
<connor> didn't have to go to the hotel for how </connor>
<connor> weird so like why wouldn't you just </connor>
<connor> drive over to the next state and fly </connor>
<joey> from there and just say that you've been </joey>
<joey> there because there's no way they can </joey>
<joey> validate that they can check that right </joey>
<joey> so to me it just felt really like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] weird that but like covert has </joey>
<joey> shown that the the rules are not to do </joey>
<connor> with what's practical it's political </connor>
<joey> ties and yeah all those things if we've </joey>
<connor> learned anything and that's what is </connor>
<connor> shitty is that it sometimes feels like </connor>
<joey> you're just caught up in some inter uh </joey>
<joey> international [ __ ] politics of </joey>
<joey> countries that don't like each other and </joey>
<joey> countries that do like each other yeah </joey>
<joey> pretty much favoring i mean the uk did </joey>
<connor> it a lot too with countries as well </connor>
<connor> they've been pretty bad for it um it was </connor>
<joey> just a mess and i hated it and it's [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> well at least you guys got to you know </joey>
<garnt> sit here with me yeah yeah i mean i mean </garnt>
<joey> i mean like look at us you guys you guys </joey>
<joey> made it you made it i mean like for the </joey>
<joey> longest time we were </joey>
<joey> like literally trapped in this country </joey>
<joey> because we couldn't fly out for the </joey>
<connor> longest time </connor>
<connor> and it's just been it was only recently </connor>
<connor> that the rules got changed that people </connor>
<connor> who are already residents can fly out </connor>
<connor> and then fly back in yeah you know </connor>
<connor> and i mean now we're just waiting for </connor>
<connor> the actual you know people who are </connor>
<connor> waiting on visas because i you know i </connor>
<joey> can only imagine that that that does </joey>
<connor> suck you know because like like we were </connor>
<joey> really lucky to be able to get our visas </joey>
<joey> before all this happened otherwise we </joey>
<joey> would have literally trash taste would </joey>
<connor> have never happened yeah right if we </connor>
<connor> would had applied for our visas </connor>
<connor> literally a few months after we got our </connor>
<connor> visas yeah </connor>
<joey> we uh we would still be waiting now to </joey>
<garnt> like even get our visas to move to japan </garnt>
<connor> you know it's actually crazy to think </connor>
<connor> about and japan faced a lot of criticism </connor>
<connor> when the </connor>
<connor> when the chronovirus started because </connor>
<connor> they they banned um </connor>
<garnt> only japanese nationals were allowed </garnt>
<garnt> back in yeah right which is like okay i </garnt>
<garnt> guess that makes sense but then they </garnt>
<garnt> also didn't allow uh green card holders </garnt>
<garnt> permanent residents um really yeah so if </garnt>
<garnt> you're married if you </garnt>
<joey> uh if you're like me you're british and </joey>
<joey> you're married to a japanese woman and </joey>
<joey> then you went and then you came back in </joey>
<joey> though the my like if i was married to </joey>
<joey> japanese person they'd be allowed in but </joey>
<joey> i wouldn't be allowed in oh [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<connor> i need a few people who that came under </connor>
<joey> a [ __ ] ton of criticism rightfully so </joey>
<joey> because if you're because if someone's a </joey>
<joey> permanent resident of your country </joey>
<joey> that's literally like where their whole </joey>
<joey> life is you can't just say like no but </joey>
<joey> they did and they faced a lot of </joey>
<joey> criticism which they did eventually </joey>
<joey> change but they've still been banning </joey>
<garnt> visas and like i feel really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> sorry for these these students who had </garnt>
<garnt> their life on pause who wanted who had </garnt>
<garnt> their whole like basically two years </garnt>
<garnt> lined up in japan yeah they've just been </garnt>
<garnt> banned from entering japan like they've </garnt>
<garnt> been just been waiting yeah and they </garnt>
<garnt> haven't </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't make sense to me that they </garnt>
<connor> wouldn't allow some system even if it's </connor>
<connor> complicated and even if it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> stupid and tedious to get in if you're a </connor>
<connor> student yeah like i don't understand why </connor>
<connor> that why they haven't changed the rule </connor>
<connor> on that it's just japan being japan you </connor>
<joey> know yeah it's because japan thinks that </joey>
<joey> like oh the foreigners you're more </joey>
<joey> likely to get it if you're a foreigner </joey>
<connor> which is just not true yeah you know </connor>
<connor> it's just one of those things where you </connor>
<connor> know you can go through enough </connor>
<connor> precautions and you can do enough tests </connor>
<connor> to make sure that like 99 of the time </connor>
<connor> you'll get it so that it's it's good and </connor>
<connor> it works but i don't know to me it just </connor>
<connor> i just i can't fathom it while they're </connor>
<connor> banned </connor>
<connor> issuing any visas at all it really </connor>
<joey> doesn't make sense to me yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know it's dumb as [ __ ] yeah and like </joey>
<garnt> after going through that quarantine </garnt>
<connor> experience like i i don't believe any </connor>
<connor> anyone who's flying in is like spreading </connor>
<connor> co-fit </connor>
<garnt> people my god they have this [ __ ] on </garnt>
<garnt> lock down man yeah honestly um i mean </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you need there's like two tests </garnt>
<connor> when you get here and your test before </connor>
<connor> obviously somehow someone did get </connor>
<connor> covered on my flight but they were that </connor>
<joey> was caught and then if you test positive </joey>
<connor> in the three days you know you have to </connor>
<joey> yeah i understand it can still slip </joey>
<connor> through yeah but also it feels like such </connor>
<connor> diminishing returns at this point </connor>
<connor> to keep this rule in place you know i </connor>
<garnt> mean it's whatever i'm sure everyone </garnt>
<garnt> will have a personal opinion about it </garnt>
<connor> and that stuff i understand allowing </connor>
<garnt> tourists in obviously i get that this is </garnt>
<connor> uh which is which is opening the </connor>
<connor> floodgates but then there's people who </connor>
<garnt> are like literally waiting on a working </garnt>
<connor> order </connor>
<connor> it breaks my heart man i really feel </connor>
<connor> sorry for these people who had their </connor>
<joey> life lined up to come here and they've </joey>
<joey> just been just hanging around waiting </joey>
<joey> really i do feel so sorry for them yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's so [ __ ] it's really [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> well hopefully soon i mean the the cases </joey>
<joey> are going down a lot nowadays yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> i saw an article today that was like </connor>
<joey> japan's uh drop in covert cases baffles </joey>
<joey> experts </joey>
<joey> but also i heard that japan isn't </joey>
<joey> testing as much so i mean yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but i mean it's also because like most </joey>
<joey> young people now are finally [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> back yeah </garnt>
<garnt> have we missed anything since we've been </garnt>
<joey> gone um i mean the country's opened back </joey>
<connor> up again i mean in terms of like the the </connor>
<garnt> lock down quite unquote i mean i've </garnt>
<connor> yeah so like </connor>
<connor> beginning of uh october they were like </connor>
<connor> oh yeah so uh everything's just good now </connor>
<connor> yeah oh everything's open you can drink </connor>
<connor> alcohol if you want everyone's like we </connor>
<connor> can drink are you are you sure </connor>
<joey> because you said that last time </joey>
<connor> yeah we did that last time we could only </connor>
<garnt> do it for a week before you shut that </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] down again </garnt>
<garnt> it was just like the floodgates were </garnt>
<garnt> open everyone went out drinking and then </garnt>
<garnt> a week later everyone's just like well </garnt>
<garnt> that was </garnt>
<joey> that was a good time experts are like </joey>
<joey> yeah that's a bad idea let's not do that </joey>
<connor> the japanese government managed to do </connor>
<connor> something that i think they've never </connor>
<joey> done before </joey>
<joey> test the patience of their population </joey>
<joey> and piss them off yeah i've never seen </joey>
<joey> people get so actually angry about [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah which doesn't happen yeah but </joey>
<joey> people actually got so angry about them </joey>
<connor> keep extending the lockdown yeah because </connor>
<joey> they're so [ __ ] wishy-washy as well </joey>
<connor> they're like they're like oh yeah so uh </connor>
<connor> the cases are going down it's not zero </connor>
<connor> but it's going down so maybe we can open </connor>
<connor> it up again </connor>
<connor> and then the and then it goes back up </connor>
<connor> and they're like </connor>
<joey> well surprised that's a baffle surprise </joey>
<joey> pikachu </joey>
<joey> how did this happen it was going down </joey>
<joey> and the olympics just like blew it over </joey>
<joey> oh oh god yeah </joey>
<joey> oh my god just like i watched a video </joey>
<joey> about all the [ __ ] ups of the olympics </joey>
<connor> and it was insane yeah having it all in </connor>
<connor> one video yeah the sheer amount of </connor>
<connor> people that got fired off the olympic </connor>
<connor> committee is insane it was like half of </connor>
<joey> them yeah and then the amount of </joey>
<connor> controversy the olympic it was insane i </connor>
<joey> was like this is [ __ ] so [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> weird oh my god i mean so far it seems </connor>
<connor> to be going all right um i mean the </connor>
<connor> other day i was at a at a park </connor>
<connor> and with some of my friends and someone </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<joey> we should do a bold gamer move we should </joey>
<joey> drink a beer in this park and i was like </joey>
<joey> it felt like it felt like someone just </joey>
<joey> offered me cocaine i was like no no </joey>
<joey> that's a good idea i think someone's </joey>
<connor> watching this this doesn't feel right </connor>
<connor> i did it it was very liberating but </connor>
<joey> he [ __ ] the police yeah i was like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] the police they can't stop us now </joey>
<joey> but um yeah i mean i don't know it's i'm </joey>
<joey> just waiting again for like next week </joey>
<joey> for the government to be like change </joey>
<joey> their minds like yeah psych it's it's </joey>
<garnt> locked down again well the real question </garnt>
<joey> is is karaoke open because that's that's </joey>
<connor> is that everything that's how you know </connor>
<connor> lockdown's actually ended once the </connor>
<joey> karaoke opens that's like the equivalent </joey>
<joey> of like when the british pubs are open </joey>
<joey> so the karaokes are open uh restaurants </joey>
<connor> now go past eight o'clock you can order </connor>
<connor> alcohol basically everything's back to </connor>
<connor> normal well some of the restaurants are </connor>
<joey> still clothed </joey>
<connor> some restaurants yeah it's kind of </connor>
<joey> confusing now which is basically it's </joey>
<joey> basically most restaurants because i </joey>
<garnt> actually like phil the day filming this </garnt>

<garnt> for a bit like can i just stop i'm </garnt>
<garnt> getting really tired </garnt>
<garnt> but it was fun it was fun i i sleeping </garnt>

<joey> um i was generally just quite tired from </joey>
<connor> streaming all day yeah i mean it's it's </connor>
<joey> i kind of just conked out i tuned in </joey>
<joey> right at the beginning and then again </joey>
<joey> right at the end and it was like looking </joey>
<joey> at two different people i was like wait </joey>
<connor> is this this time </connor>
<joey> i was starting to get some like really </joey>
<joey> big uh like bags under my eyes i could </joey>
<joey> see that because i i think like i wasn't </joey>
<joey> sleeping like eight hours because it's </joey>
<joey> very hard to because yeah when you wake </joey>
<connor> up you want to check make sure </connor>
<connor> everything's okay </connor>
<connor> and uh people uh could have had the </connor>
<connor> ability to [ __ ] with my lights the whole </connor>
<connor> time yeah so people were like making my </connor>
<connor> house a rave while i was sleeping yeah </connor>
<connor> you know that what's that what's that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that meme edit where it's like </connor>
<joey> the outside of the house and you can </joey>
<joey> hear the music inside and the lights oh </joey>
<joey> yeah it was literally like that </joey>
<joey> but i just played trash taste episodes </joey>
<garnt> while i slept oh wow that was what i did </garnt>
<joey> easy content right now racking up those </joey>
<joey> views baby i thought right when i was </joey>
<joey> sleeping i assumed because when i was </joey>
<joey> streaming i had about uh 10 to 14k </joey>
<joey> viewers concurrent yeah which was more </joey>
<connor> than i normally have i was very </connor>
<connor> impressed i thought when i was sleeping </connor>
<connor> it would go down to like okay </connor>
<connor> there was like 7 000 people watching </connor>
<garnt> this yeah i i i was like i saw that </garnt>
<connor> because i was like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what have you been doing because i was </connor>
<connor> like going through jet lag and i'm like </connor>
<connor> let's see what connor's up to he's like </connor>
<joey> seven thousand people watching me sleep </joey>
<joey> i was like [ __ ] hell man i don't want </joey>
<joey> 7k normally i </joey>
<joey> my normal streams get like that and i </joey>
<joey> was like why am i i'm getting more </joey>
<connor> sleeping what the [ __ ] they're like </connor>
<joey> sleeping with you like i don't know it </joey>
<joey> was i know it's like it's like i'm </joey>
<connor> sleeping next to her you know it was </connor>
<connor> weird waking up and seeing like people </connor>
<connor> had subscribed like paid to sub to me </connor>
<connor> while i was sleeping yeah i'm like right </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i should just sleep on stream all </connor>
<connor> the time i get paid to sleep [ __ ] me </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm kidding it's weird though so i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like why did someone give me 50 subs </garnt>
<connor> while i was sleeping it's like 300 quid </connor>
<connor> more than that i think actually it's a </connor>
<joey> lot of money i'm like what the [ __ ] the </joey>
<joey> most generous tooth fairy in the world </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah right </joey>
<connor> i was like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> what is this what's going on </joey>
<connor> but it was weird and i'd have like weird </connor>
<garnt> moments where i would wake up but i </garnt>
<garnt> don't remember waking up and i would see </garnt>
<garnt> clips of me waking up and i was like i </garnt>
<connor> don't remember that i don't remember </connor>
<joey> that i saw a clip of you i don't know if </joey>
<joey> you were half asleep or not but you just </joey>
<joey> like flipped off the camera </joey>
<joey> oh that was halfway through your sleep i </joey>
<connor> was trying to sleep right and then </connor>
<connor> people just went ham with my lights all </connor>
<joey> right and they just started changing it </joey>
<joey> every second and then i was just like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] you guys </connor>
<connor> um yeah it was fun though i really </connor>
<connor> enjoyed it i didn't think uh it was </connor>
<joey> something i ever thought i'd be </joey>
<joey> interested in but i thought [ __ ] it i'll </joey>
<joey> try it and uh i obviously had a lot of </joey>
<joey> fun i'd recommend you guys try it out no </joey>
<joey> i'm good i'm good man i like i like my </joey>
<garnt> privacy i i can barely stream i can </garnt>
<garnt> barely stream as it is people want </garnt>
<connor> people always tell me they're like you </connor>
<connor> guys should do a trash tasting or you </connor>
<connor> just take it and turn streaming and then </connor>
<connor> like i was like oh it could work </connor>
<garnt> something sometimes i mean i i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> if if we did it as a group it would be </garnt>
<joey> easier yeah like by myself [ __ ] [ __ ] you </joey>
<connor> do shifts like we're together sometimes </connor>
<joey> but then [ __ ] i mean i've done like long </joey>
<connor> streams with other people yeah you know </connor>
<connor> that go for like 15 to 20 hours i </connor>
<joey> couldn't do it by myself i couldn't do </joey>
<connor> it by myself yeah yeah i don't know i i </connor>
<connor> i didn't have like many guests come on i </connor>
<joey> just had uh iron mouse play with me </joey>
<connor> which was great it's fun when you have </connor>
<connor> someone else to talk </connor>
<joey> yeah because that's the thing is like if </joey>
<joey> you have someone else to bounce off of </joey>
<joey> right then you don't have to be like so </joey>
<connor> he was likely talking to china the </connor>
<connor> reasons why i decided to do it um so i </connor>
<garnt> had not been streaming for like a month </garnt>
<garnt> before i left for the uk and so i didn't </garnt>
<garnt> stream for a month or all so i didn't </garnt>

<garnt> he's your content producer now yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's well it's a really good uh it's a </garnt>
<garnt> really good um balance because we kind </garnt>
<garnt> of started it together because uh </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't we were just like okay i won't </garnt>
<garnt> pay you for editing fees but you get 50 </garnt>
<garnt> of whatever it makes and then uh we </garnt>
<garnt> thought we'd be in the red for a while </garnt>
<garnt> uh or we thought he'd be in there for a </garnt>
<garnt> while but luckily yeah it took off and </garnt>
<garnt> now it's doing really really well and uh </garnt>
<garnt> it's killing it and some of the videos </garnt>
<garnt> get like more views than my videos yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i saw that one of them got like two </garnt>
<connor> million views now what the [ __ ] should i </connor>
<garnt> put this on my main channel </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah they're doing really well it's </garnt>
<connor> uh it's cool it's it's weird yeah i </connor>
<joey> don't know it's uh i mean we also met </joey>
<garnt> mudan in uh the uk as well yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah got a call we're gonna catch up </joey>
<connor> with him uh somehow he found two days </connor>
<garnt> out of his schedule to uh program </garnt>
<connor> himself out of editing and uh we flew </connor>
<connor> all the way from estonia to come hang </connor>
<garnt> out with us yeah my god my god he is a </garnt>
<garnt> machine i i i didn't realize this </garnt>
<connor> i didn't appreciate this until like </connor>
<joey> actually speaking to him in person </joey>
<joey> where he is he is insane i've never seen </joey>
<connor> someone with like a like a more strict </connor>
<garnt> work ethic than he does oh yeah right </garnt>
<connor> that man never quits yeah i'm surprised </connor>
<joey> he still has like emotion </joey>
<joey> because like you have to like throw </joey>
<connor> humanity away to keep up with him he had </connor>
<connor> his videos in full time speed yeah he </connor>
<joey> watches the video </joey>
<joey> i was like how do you i don't think </joey>
<garnt> human brain </garnt>
<connor> i am convinced he's just jacked into the </connor>
<connor> matrix because how do you edit in four </connor>
<connor> times speed like you don't do that with </connor>
<joey> a mouse and keyboard you do that like in </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] ghost of the show </joey>
<joey> basically you like jack yourself in and </joey>
<garnt> like he edits the video in his mind </garnt>
<garnt> that's that's all i i'm convinced he's </garnt>
<connor> the one with premiere pro he does </connor>
<joey> editing speed runs on his on his twitch </joey>
<connor> channel yeah he edits like my whole of </connor>
<connor> my videos in like four hours yeah </connor>
<garnt> because because like i remember i </garnt>
<garnt> remember talking to him when we were </garnt>
<garnt> catching up because he was with us and </garnt>
<garnt> like with a bunch of our mates as we </garnt>
<garnt> were like all catching up um and i was </garnt>
<garnt> talking to him and he was and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> oh so you're editing for like trash </garnt>
<connor> taste our specials um off dark connor's </connor>
<connor> channel conor's second channel and some </connor>
<connor> of joey's videos and i've heard some of </connor>

<joey> now it is yeah we really like we've and </joey>
<joey> like i had a lot of uh like friends </joey>
<garnt> living here from since i've known in </garnt>
<garnt> like high school in uni who were like i </garnt>

<joey> take care of my two kids i'm just like </joey>
<joey> have we really gotten to that stage now </joey>
<joey> i've really gotten to that page because </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> it was just my birthday like about a </joey>
<connor> week ago um and i was like it's it's </connor>
<connor> time to get to that point i mean you can </connor>
<joey> relate god because you're older than me </joey>
<joey> but like i feel it's around you're a </joey>
<garnt> boomer </garnt>
<joey> thanks for singing me out yeah we're </joey>
<joey> going you're a bit </joey>
<joey> but like i feel i don't know at least to </joey>
<joey> me like around 27 is because i just </joey>
<joey> turned 27 yeah it's get it starts to get </joey>
<joey> to the point where it's not so much like </joey>
<joey> oh yeah it's my birthday it's more like </joey>
<garnt> oh it's my birthday yeah </garnt>
<connor> i've been like that for a while yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah it's 8 15. yeah it's not like </joey>
<joey> it's not you know there's no like just </joey>
<connor> that kind of like childish excitement of </connor>
<joey> like getting older anymore yeah it </joey>
<connor> slowly starts to turn into that oh god </connor>
<joey> i'm getting older yeah stage you know </joey>
<joey> are you i guess does it happen when you </joey>
<connor> get 30 is that when that happens um i </connor>
<garnt> don't know like for me that's the only </garnt>
<joey> 30 year old </joey>
<connor> as the only 30 year old here i remember </connor>
<connor> like it didn't didn't really hit me </connor>
<connor> until i was uh 29 i guess </connor>
<connor> and so like ev every every year uh so </connor>
<connor> every year like we uh we </connor>
<connor> when when i lived in england we had like </connor>
<connor> this massive like party where we get to </connor>
<connor> catch up with all of our friends in </connor>
<connor> england so we'd like so we have this </connor>
<connor> party every year yeah um and i remember </connor>
<connor> it truly hit me because we were at this </connor>
<connor> party uh and we're there for a few days </connor>
<connor> so i was having a shower in the morning </connor>
<joey> and then </joey>
<joey> i kind of it kind of just hit me that </joey>
<joey> this is the last time i'm gonna have </joey>
<joey> this catch up before i'm 30 in my 20s </joey>
<joey> and then i just had this like full-on </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] existential crisis in the shower </joey>
<garnt> where like i mean i take long showers i </garnt>
<garnt> i i take long showers anyway but like it </garnt>
<connor> was just me </connor>
<connor> that day that was a long shot </connor>
<garnt> that was like even for me that was a </garnt>
<garnt> long [ __ ] shower i think i think </garnt>
<garnt> sydney like thought i got kidnapped or </garnt>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<garnt> like i was just standing there just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> like i didn't know how to process that </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just i just it was just like </garnt>
<garnt> i think i took like an hour-long shower </garnt>
<connor> and then [ __ ] hell well your hands </connor>
<connor> must have been sponged oh yeah they were </connor>
<garnt> they were the whole body </garnt>
<joey> and then like off that shower which is </joey>
<joey> completely fine </joey>
<garnt> i was ready for my 30s afterwards um i </garnt>
<joey> also knew that i was like getting to </joey>
<connor> that point because i uh </connor>
<connor> me and like a bunch of my friends who </connor>
<joey> were all vaccinated so safe but uh we we </joey>
<connor> rented out this like log cabin yeah like </connor>
<joey> the mountains in chiba and it was like </joey>
<connor> really nice because you know i hadn't </connor>
<connor> really had it like a nightlife for about </connor>
<connor> a month since everything was like closed </connor>
<connor> down it was like there's no point going </connor>
<connor> out to like restaurants or anything like </connor>
<joey> that at night so it's finally nice to </joey>
<joey> actually you know [ __ ] get out and </joey>
<joey> yeah change of environment stuff like </joey>
<joey> that especially with your friends and i </joey>
<joey> knew i was also getting to that point </joey>
<joey> because uh all i received was some </joey>
<joey> pieces of clothing two bottles of wine </joey>
<joey> and a bottle of whiskey </joey>
<joey> and i'm like oh i'm getting to the point </joey>
<joey> where like i see a bottle of whiskey and </joey>
<joey> i'm like pog champion </joey>
<joey> just because like after a certain age </joey>
<joey> you normally have everything you want </joey>
<joey> yeah right i mean like anything i'd want </joey>
<connor> is like yeah you want to buy me a </connor>
<connor> porsche </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's just like a gift that a mate </joey>
<joey> doesn't already have it's either like in </joey>
<joey> in an an acceptable price range it just </joey>
<joey> doesn't really exist it just gets bigger </joey>
<joey> and bigger it's either like you buy you </joey>
<joey> you buy them like a new job or a new car </joey>
<joey> or a new house well what do you want you </joey>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> but uh </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean like i'd say another thing </joey>
<joey> that happened to me in the uk that </joey>
<garnt> you've just reminded me of is </garnt>
<garnt> i i went to the uh went to the tescos to </garnt>
<connor> uh get my bottle of wine then they asked </connor>
<connor> me how old i was i never get id'd ever </connor>
<garnt> and then </garnt>
<garnt> then i was just like oh i'm 20 </garnt>
<garnt> no wait </garnt>
<connor> i had a moment like that too and someone </connor>
<connor> asked me how old i was like 23 oh [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> 25. </joey>
<connor> yeah i legitimately forgot at one point </connor>
<connor> how old i was turning i was like am i </connor>
<connor> turning 27 or 28. yeah [ __ ] i don't </connor>
<joey> remember i had to like do math in my </joey>
<garnt> head to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i i'd literally like forgotten </garnt>
<garnt> that i had turned 30 because like i had </garnt>
<garnt> not been asked for id since i turned 30. </garnt>
<connor> yeah and uh so so yeah i i by like </connor>
<connor> muscle memory i just started saying 20 </connor>
<connor> something and then like i had like this </connor>
<connor> darren brown moment where i just forgot </connor>
<connor> the number and i was like resource music </connor>
<connor> plays </connor>
<connor> oh no i'm i'm 32. and they were like </connor>
<connor> we see some id </connor>
<connor> and i was like oh my god i get to show </connor>
<connor> my id again oh my god i never get id'd i </connor>
<connor> wish i got a dude really yeah because i </connor>
<connor> don't get id here but yeah i've i've </connor>
<garnt> never i've never gotten a goat i've </garnt>
<connor> never got an id'd </connor>
<garnt> in um in japan for some reason i started </garnt>
<garnt> getting id'd again when i went back to </garnt>
<connor> the uk i think i think i look older than </connor>
<connor> you sometimes i think what do you mean </connor>
<joey> sometimes sometimes sometimes i think </joey>
<joey> most days i think i think most people </joey>
<joey> who watch who tune in to trash days for </joey>
<connor> the first time wait what's the oldest </connor>
<joey> one everyone thinks that i'm older than </joey>
<joey> i am yeah which is fair enough yeah just </joey>
<garnt> means and everyone thinks god's like 20. </garnt>
<joey> cause i'm [ __ ] miserable that's right </joey>
<garnt> i'm always complaining i can't wait til </garnt>
<joey> i'm 50. i'm going to complain about </joey>
<connor> everything it's the beard man it's the </connor>
<joey> beard no no you have a good beard too </joey>
<joey> yeah but the thing is if i shave this </joey>
<connor> off i look 17. well i look like a child </connor>
<connor> like there's plenty of trash days </connor>
<connor> episodes where i don't have a beard </connor>
<connor> right and i i i look at it i'm like whoa </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's just like you shave your </garnt>
<garnt> beard instantly you just like lose five </garnt>
<joey> years </joey>
<connor> like 10 i think i think maybe </connor>
<joey> like a 12 year old </joey>
<joey> whereas i feel if god came to a trash </joey>
<joey> taste recording with a beard like ours </joey>
<joey> he'd look like a [ __ ] like </joey>
<garnt> i've had like a five o'clock shadow </garnt>
<joey> before and uh yeah i don't know how that </joey>
<joey> looks </joey>
<joey> i don't know i just don't like it when </joey>
<joey> my beard's too long you just throw an </joey>
<joey> age man just just feels like i feel </joey>
<connor> something </connor>
<connor> yeah you could you could kill it or you </connor>
<joey> could kill it i can kill it maybe i'll </joey>
<garnt> try one day yeah one one one randomly </garnt>
<garnt> maybe my mid 30s is </garnt>
<connor> next time we have like like a break when </connor>
<connor> we don't record trash taste i'll just </connor>
<connor> let my beard grow out and it'll just be </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> like the dichotomy of like one trash </joey>
<joey> taste episodes for the for the audience </joey>
<joey> to be like </joey>
<joey> what happened during this week </joey>
<garnt> wow you're really aged during this week </garnt>
<garnt> didn't it </garnt>
<joey> god just like does some doctor strange </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> or some nonsense or something like that </garnt>
<connor> oh my god </connor>
<garnt> i feel like a beard could weirdly suit </garnt>
<garnt> you </garnt>
<garnt> i know um i i'm just not a big fan of </garnt>
<joey> beards on me personally i don't know </joey>
<joey> it's i i also like </joey>
<connor> there's there's this like patch where a </connor>
<connor> beard like can't grow on my on my chin </connor>
<garnt> as well so i don't know how weird that </garnt>
<joey> would look if i grow it out there's a </joey>
<joey> bit of patchwork as well around the </joey>
<garnt> place because like the reason the reason </garnt>
<garnt> i have this patch is because as a kid uh </garnt>
<connor> when i was a kid i got uh well it's not </connor>
<connor> that big of an exciting story but my </connor>
<connor> chin got cut open </connor>
<connor> uh because i </connor>
<joey> was on the playground fell on uh hit a </joey>
<joey> kid fell on the floor and then might </joey>
<joey> split </joey>
<connor> oh [ __ ] get my chin open um and so </connor>
<garnt> uh once that got closed up there's just </garnt>
<garnt> this patch on my chin that just won't </garnt>
<connor> grow hair so i've always found it like a </connor>
<garnt> sticker just stick something just grab </garnt>
<connor> something just take something we'll just </connor>
<joey> just grow it out and just like kind of </joey>
<joey> bumble </joey>
<joey> yeah break it </joey>
<joey> bread it into the middle so it just </joey>
<joey> comes down like that </joey>
<connor> maybe i'll probably will one day um </connor>
<joey> i don't know if we should get into anime </joey>
<joey> i watched an anime </joey>
<joey> i forgot we're an anime podcast </joey>
<joey> what did you watch </joey>
<joey> squid game </joey>
<joey> yeah i watched </joey>
<joey> high rise invasion </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is that exactly what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] is that i watched high-rise </joey>
<garnt> invasion on netflix is that </garnt>
<joey> is that an actual anime i said look it </joey>
<joey> up the google it's got a japanese </joey>
<joey> i've never heard of this anime before so </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah so so what happened was is that i </connor>
<joey> was like i was like i told myself i'm </joey>
<garnt> gonna watch the first anime i see on </garnt>
<joey> netflix </joey>
<garnt> why what the [ __ ] is this and i've never </garnt>
<joey> seen this and so i watched it right and </joey>
<joey> and uh i was pleasantly surprised i </joey>
<joey> quite enjoyed it really it wasn't it </joey>
<joey> wasn't amazing but it was it was good </joey>
<joey> fun </joey>
<joey> yeah that's and so when i when i when i </joey>
<connor> started watching it it was the it felt </connor>
<connor> like the most 6.6 show </connor>
<connor> it was just good i had a fun time good </connor>
<connor> fun time it was very interesting and </connor>
<garnt> stupid at times and dumb but interesting </garnt>
<garnt> you should guys should uh check it out </garnt>
<garnt> should we explain the plot to you please </garnt>
<garnt> go go on sure whoa connor explaining </garnt>
<joey> i'll leave it on your heart believe it </joey>
<joey> or not this is gonna be the most scuffed </joey>
<joey> plot explanation of </joey>
<joey> any animation where are you still right </joey>
<joey> so this main character forgot her name </joey>
<joey> riley wakes up on the top of a high-rise </joey>
<joey> building and you you can you can't </joey>
<joey> go down the stairs of the high-rise you </joey>
<garnt> can only cross like wooden bridges to </garnt>
<garnt> get to other high-rise buildings right </garnt>
<garnt> right and there's these dudes that are </garnt>
<garnt> wearing these masks that are like budget </garnt>
<garnt> um anonymous looking masks yes smiley </garnt>
<garnt> masks and they're trying to kill you </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and they're trying to they're not </garnt>
<garnt> trying to kill you they're trying to get </garnt>
<garnt> you to jump off the building by making </garnt>
<connor> you have such despair but that goes out </connor>
<connor> the window within like 10 seconds and </connor>
<connor> people they're starting to kill you </connor>
<connor> right so it's one of those things it's </connor>
<connor> one of those things where they build it </connor>
<connor> up to be like a really big plot point </connor>
<connor> they're like they want to make you feel </connor>
<connor> despair and jump yourself and then </connor>
<joey> immediately they just come up to you </joey>
<joey> they're like you jump off paris </joey>
<connor> these masks people just start killing </connor>
<joey> everyone and then it was like wait so </joey>
<joey> that wasn't that wasn't important </joey>
<joey> but then just people </joey>
<joey> and then these </joey>
<connor> masks are like controlling people and </connor>
<garnt> we're trying to find out what's going on </garnt>
<connor> and there's some other </connor>
<garnt> uh they're all issac so it's all all </garnt>
<garnt> these characters </garnt>
<joey> all these characters why didn't you say </joey>
<joey> so earlier </joey>
<joey> all these characters come from a </joey>
<joey> different world they wake up on </joey>
<joey> high-rise buildings and have to go from </joey>
<garnt> different high-rise and there's like </garnt>
<garnt> masks that control them and it's kind of </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] but it's it was it was interesting </connor>
<garnt> enough i had a fun time i i you know </garnt>
<connor> what it was nice watching a show and not </connor>
<garnt> caring if it was going to be good or bad </garnt>
<connor> yeah i enjoyed it and the dub was very </connor>
<garnt> good very good </garnt>
<garnt> the dichotomy because i i think like </garnt>
<garnt> this was this was the longest stretch </garnt>
<garnt> where i went not watching an anime at </garnt>
<connor> all and uh actually picked up a jrpg </connor>
<connor> that uh i like got [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like tales of her eyes yeah is it was it </connor>
<connor> good it was [ __ ] amazing man why did </connor>
<connor> you have to say that now i have to get </connor>
<joey> it it's it's like it's it's the first </joey>
<joey> time i played a jrpg and like i'm just </joey>
<joey> like and actually completed it oh no i </joey>
<connor> like i like i like not only i've not </connor>
<connor> only completed it i think i'm like close </connor>
<connor> to 100 </connor>
<connor> as well my god like it's the only </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] jrpg where i i cared about it so </connor>
<joey> much and i didn't want the journey to </joey>
<joey> end that i </joey>
<joey> 100 100 percented the [ __ ] fishing </joey>
<joey> mini game okay i caught that that's how </joey>
<joey> you know i caught every fish in this </joey>
<garnt> game so i could see every skit that </garnt>
<garnt> there was available </garnt>
<connor> in the game okay </connor>
<garnt> how many hours have you put in this game </garnt>
<garnt> uh at the moment about 80 hours </garnt>
<garnt> so like for jrpg length that's actually </garnt>
<connor> that's not too bad that's not too bad </connor>
<joey> it's like especially for a hundred </joey>
<connor> percent run that's nice that's pretty </connor>
<connor> short </connor>
<connor> in like the past two weeks right yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean what else was he going to do </joey>
<garnt> in quarantine man </garnt>
<garnt> no but it's it's uh i mean like one </garnt>
<garnt> thing that really surprised me is that </garnt>
<garnt> it really got me to care about </garnt>
<garnt> game mechanics i'm just like i'm i'm </garnt>
<garnt> here for the story and characters yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then i just got really absolutely </garnt>
<connor> fans found out that games games can be </connor>
<garnt> good </garnt>
<garnt> and then i just got really absorbed into </garnt>
<garnt> the combat system of this game and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like how did you trick my how did </garnt>
<garnt> you trick my non-gamer brain into caring </garnt>
<garnt> about this [ __ ] right because because </garnt>
<garnt> like i've played so many tales games and </garnt>
<garnt> the reason i got it and tales was </garnt>
<garnt> because it had like a real-time combat </garnt>
<connor> system yeah and that was i played uh </connor>
<connor> brazilia and i didn't like </connor>
<garnt> yeah and that was in the time where i </garnt>
<garnt> only really got into </garnt>
<joey> tails games because </joey>
<joey> every other jrpg was turned back com </joey>
<joey> turn-based combat with random encounters </joey>
<joey> and tails was like no no no no how about </joey>
<joey> you have a real-time battle system with </joey>
<joey> enemies that you can see when you get </joey>
<joey> into a battle right and then that kind </joey>
<joey> of like as time gone on that became more </joey>
<joey> normalized in a lot of jrpgs like you </joey>
<joey> know you see the modern final fantasy </joey>
<joey> and it's basically just an it's an </joey>
<joey> action rpg with some turn-based systems </joey>
<joey> implemented into it and so for the </joey>
<connor> longest time i still play tails games </connor>
<connor> but they weren't they didn't grab me as </connor>
<connor> much as say back in the old school days </connor>
<connor> where this was the only type of jrpg </connor>
<connor> there was that had this type of system </connor>
<connor> and so i i like my love for the channel </connor>
<connor> series had like waned a bit </connor>
<connor> so when i got tales of a rise i only got </connor>
<connor> it because people were just like yeah </connor>
<connor> it's a new tales game and i'm like i'm a </connor>
<connor> tales fan maybe i'll just play this like </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm i'm a tales fan </connor>
<garnt> i'm gonna ignore that for a second i'm </garnt>
<connor> sorry i'm sorry i'm glad you said it </connor>
<joey> before i did </joey>
<connor> i just kept saying tales and i just kept </connor>
<joey> thinking i was in my head i was i was </joey>
<connor> just imagining [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> so like i'm a big tales </connor>
<connor> like if i wasn't in quarantine i </connor>
<connor> wouldn't have played it and then on the </connor>
<connor> first day i just like i played it for </connor>
<connor> like a good 10 hours and i was like oh </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> oh no i'm invested </connor>
<connor> if there's one thing you don't want to </connor>
<connor> be invested in it's the jrpg because you </connor>
<connor> just have to basically write off like </connor>
<joey> two three weeks of your life </joey>
<joey> if that happens pretty much and it was </joey>
<joey> like it's been such a long time where </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> you know like when you're so absorbed </joey>
<connor> into a game that every waking moment </connor>
<connor> you're not playing the game you you're </connor>
<connor> either playing the game or you're </connor>
<connor> thinking about playing the game i missed </connor>
<connor> that feeling yeah yeah and it was </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] great and uh the combat system </connor>
<connor> in this is like closer to something like </connor>
<connor> devil may cry than it is like previously </connor>
<connor> like you can you can you can do like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ridiculous amounts of combos in </connor>
<garnt> this game right can i kind of can i go </garnt>
<garnt> for the game mechanics do you care about </garnt>
<connor> the game mechanics at all um sure i mean </connor>
<connor> it's better than you talking about aero </connor>
<connor> game </connor>
<garnt> i'd love to hear how you like it okay so </garnt>
<connor> most tales games that i played before </connor>
<connor> it's just like [ __ ] button mashing </connor>
<connor> like you press yeah that's what i didn't </connor>
<connor> like about it yeah the last time i </connor>
<connor> played it yeah and you can get through a </connor>
<connor> lot of this game through just button </connor>
<connor> mashing and then like it there's there's </connor>
<connor> this really weird difficulty curve where </connor>
<connor> the later part parts of the game you </connor>
<connor> like before in every tails games you can </connor>
<connor> just get away with like tapping one </connor>
<connor> button tapping special attack anything </connor>
<connor> like that but then they've built they've </connor>
<connor> layered so many different systems onto </connor>
<connor> this combat system from like previous </connor>
<connor> tales games that you can you you realize </connor>
<connor> you can just start layering [ __ ] over </connor>
<connor> like things over things everything's </connor>
<connor> everything so they introduce you to you </connor>
<connor> like you already have you can only do a </connor>
<connor> certain amount of moves for before your </connor>
<connor> character goes back into a rest state </connor>
<connor> right so you can you can only do like </connor>
<joey> three basic attacks and enough </joey>
<joey> enough basic enough special attacks </joey>
<joey> before your meter runs dry but then if </joey>
<connor> you juggle the enemy you add more basic </connor>
<joey> attacks on on top of that right and then </joey>
<connor> on top of that you have </connor>
<connor> group you have group attacks as well </connor>
<connor> where people in your party can also join </connor>
<connor> in on an attack and then what i didn't </connor>
<connor> realize is that tails added this system </connor>
<connor> where you can switch to another person </connor>
<connor> mid like like mid battle so you don't </connor>
<connor> have to pause the game to switch to </connor>
<connor> another character you can literally it's </connor>
<connor> the top of one button you can switch to </connor>
<connor> another person so you base you can </connor>
<connor> basically chain combos end combo with </connor>
<connor> one person then switch to like do a </connor>
<connor> special attack with another person </connor>
<garnt> switch to that person </garnt>
<garnt> and so the system awards </garnt>
<garnt> awards people who are able to change </garnt>
<garnt> really good combos because if you get </garnt>
<garnt> your combo meter long enough then you </garnt>
<connor> can do basically a finishing attack yeah </connor>
<connor> right it looked kind of like genting a </connor>
<garnt> little bit yeah that's that's the thing </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically like it did it was a lot </garnt>
<garnt> like engine except having except not </garnt>
<garnt> having just one person but having four </garnt>
<connor> people yeah </connor>
<connor> that your chain when you're playing </connor>
<connor> against him from how much yeah that </connor>
<garnt> you've changed </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but there's a lot it's like way </garnt>
<garnt> more in depth than genji i would say it </garnt>
<garnt> is it does have </garnt>
<connor> some similarities to the gentian combat </connor>
<connor> system but it's like way more in-depth </connor>
<connor> and you can </connor>
<garnt> get combos that are like way longer than </garnt>
<connor> genji you get like 100 hit combos </connor>
<connor> sometimes the only thing that i found </connor>
<connor> really funny and </connor>
<connor> i don't know if this is the whole game </connor>
<connor> but i was watching someone stream it on </connor>
<connor> twitch and they were fighting this </connor>
<garnt> dragon </garnt>
<garnt> and during this fight every single </garnt>
<garnt> character was saying their voice lines </garnt>
<garnt> at every single point yeah and i was </garnt>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is this i can't hear </connor>
<connor> anything everyone is just screaming in </connor>
<connor> their own attacks yeah is that that </connor>
<joey> happening all the time </joey>
<joey> yeah pretty much that's pretty standard </joey>
<joey> for a job but i couldn't hear anything i </joey>
<joey> couldn't hear what anyone was saying </joey>
<joey> because everyone was shouting their </joey>
<connor> attacks i was like what is this i mean </connor>
<joey> it's the same with like uh like </joey>
<joey> xenoblade as well right like when you </joey>
<joey> when you're fighting that [ __ ] i can't </joey>
<joey> watch because that's </joey>
<joey> it xenoblade annoys me watching </joey>
<connor> xenoblade because i'm just hearing </connor>
<connor> everything </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> at the same time </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> do you know you like that no i can't </joey>
<joey> because i can't hear what everyone's </joey>
<connor> saying it's just noise you don't have to </connor>
<joey> hear what they're saying i i i can't if </joey>
<joey> i wanted to i can't hear it it's not </joey>
<joey> it's not like they're giving like </joey>
<connor> important information i just wish that </connor>
<connor> it was like i don't know when i was </connor>
<joey> watching as a i don't know from a </joey>
<joey> viewing experience it was very annoying </joey>
<joey> at least right from a gaming news </joey>
<joey> probably he didn't give a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> i think i think if you're i think if </connor>
<connor> you're watching it yeah as a viewer it </connor>
<joey> might get a little bit annoying because </joey>
<joey> that's the only thing you're focusing on </joey>
<joey> yeah but again it's not like they're </joey>
<joey> gonna be like they're gonna drop like </joey>
<joey> huge narrative plot points as they're </joey>
<joey> going </joey>
<joey> i'm your dad </joey>
<joey> i know i was just like this is too loud </joey>
<garnt> shut up </garnt>
<garnt> because like on top of that as well </garnt>
<joey> sometimes uh sometimes the characters </joey>
<joey> will have conversations </joey>
<joey> as they're screaming as they're </joey>
<joey> screaming their attacks </joey>
<joey> i mean there's there is a lot of things </joey>
<joey> going on i love that i love that about </joey>
<joey> tales yeah this kind of campaign that's </joey>
<garnt> that's the anime side that i live for </garnt>
<garnt> you know yeah there's something super </garnt>
<joey> campy about it that i love it it's like </joey>
<garnt> one person is like being like hey that </garnt>
<garnt> was a good shot and the other one's like </garnt>
<joey> ah </joey>
<connor> he's like all right you're not listening </connor>
<connor> sounds pretty cool though </connor>
<garnt> like a little better uh combat system </garnt>
<garnt> than before yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i don't i don't trust people who prefer </garnt>
<connor> um turn-based combat over that i'm just </connor>
<connor> like what's wrong with you who hurt you </connor>
<joey> i mean </joey>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> i didn't say anything </joey>
<connor> except for persona we haven't figured </connor>
<joey> out a way to make it fun so we keep </joey>
<connor> using the same shitty thing because we </connor>
<connor> know it sort of works but like no one's </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> right yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't like turn-based combat i don't </joey>
<joey> know i'm just used to it so much to the </joey>
<connor> point where i like but that's the thing </connor>
<connor> though i think that's that's that's why </connor>
<joey> people i get it if you didn't grow up </joey>
<joey> with it it's [ __ ] annoying yeah and i </joey>
<connor> i think it's just because it's one of </connor>
<connor> the it's a thing that we haven't figured </connor>
<garnt> out a better way and i still feel that </garnt>
<garnt> some games the whole real-time combat in </garnt>
<garnt> the way it's still kind of jank at times </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it sounds like it's it's good it's </garnt>
<garnt> really good like they finally figured it </garnt>
<garnt> out a little bit yeah it's it's really </garnt>
<garnt> good because because they teach you the </garnt>
<garnt> basics and then they don't teach you all </garnt>
<garnt> these like more advanced techniques that </garnt>
<garnt> you can do to like basically extend your </garnt>
<garnt> extend your combos and like make </garnt>
<garnt> flashier moves but they give you </garnt>
<connor> gameplay incentives like i said like if </connor>
<connor> you get a combo for long enough without </connor>
<connor> stopping it </connor>
<connor> then you can do a finishing move on an </connor>
<connor> enemy and like when the when the high </connor>
<connor> health it's harder than when they're low </connor>
<connor> health so the common meter builds up </connor>
<connor> faster when they're low health so like </connor>
<connor> when when you sometimes you start off a </connor>
<connor> battle </connor>
<connor> and depending on how well you can get </connor>
<connor> your combo off because when when you </connor>
<connor> kill one enemy with a finishing move </connor>
<connor> that makes it easier to do the next </connor>
<connor> enemy and the next enemy it's kind of </connor>
<connor> like a domino effect right so you can </connor>
<connor> you can depending on your the difficulty </connor>
<joey> if you start off a battle well you can </joey>
<joey> clear the enemy so fast or you'll you </joey>
<joey> can like get ko'd really easily </joey>
<joey> depending on like how well you start off </joey>
<joey> your how are you starting for your </joey>
<joey> attacks on your combos which is just </joey>
<joey> which is just something that i never </joey>
<joey> experienced before in a tales game </joey>
<joey> because tails was always i'm playing </joey>
<joey> because i like it and it's anime and </joey>
<joey> it's jr </joey>
<joey> and then the combat the combats here </joey>
<connor> just is just to </connor>
<connor> like forget making me forget about the </connor>
<connor> fact that i just hate grinding and </connor>
<connor> combats and like yeah i don't like </connor>
<connor> writing and turn-based battles but this </connor>
<connor> one was just it it's legit good game </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> i can see why </connor>
<connor> it's like the closest thing tails has </connor>
<garnt> got to like a mainstream release </garnt>
<garnt> because it is a legitimate game that i </garnt>
<garnt> think a lot of people who don't even </garnt>
<garnt> like jrpgs </garnt>
<garnt> would like um </garnt>
<joey> so yeah </joey>
<connor> i've been tempted ever since they </connor>
<connor> announced that i'm just like i can't do </connor>
<connor> it to myself do it i have so many </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] jrpgs lined up that i still need </garnt>
<connor> to play i still haven't played the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like uh near replicant i was </garnt>
<garnt> like the wrong place i bought that on </garnt>
<garnt> steam and it's just been sitting there </garnt>
<joey> i'll get </joey>
<joey> i'll get to it eventually and then </joey>
<connor> they're like okay there's five more </connor>
<connor> jrpgs i bought sega uh bass fish not </connor>
<connor> bass bass [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> it's like a bass fishing and i never </joey>
<joey> bought it i never </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> the sega genesis why </joey>
<joey> why not god </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<connor> fishing i think we should do a trash </connor>
<connor> taste special we do high score on sega </connor>
<connor> fishing bass fishing </connor>
<garnt> look at that game look at that can we </garnt>
<joey> just go real fishing i'd rather go i'd </joey>
<joey> rather just go real fishy and then play </joey>
<garnt> i also really want to play the new </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] nickelodeon fighting game </connor>
<connor> they actually made it into like a </connor>
<joey> serious like fighter yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> apparently someone's already figured out </joey>
<joey> that some characters are just [ __ ] of </joey>
<connor> course </connor>
<connor> we're gonna be getting patch notes for </connor>
<joey> days and tier lists yeah spongebob is </joey>
<connor> asked here patrick is detailed spongebob </connor>
<connor> bottom two behind bottom tiers </connor>

<connor> yesterday </connor>
<connor> i know you're going to see what of sora </connor>
<connor> getting uh confirmed for smash bros oh </connor>
<connor> yeah and the internet just </connor>
<joey> breaking i've never seen the internet </joey>

<connor> for those fans who like sora i was room </connor>
<connor> for </connor>
<joey> massachusetts broke down crying as if </joey>
<connor> like she lost a family member like does </connor>
<connor> nikki play smash </connor>
<connor> she does oh okay but i didn't know </connor>

<joey> like like like the older yeah but now </joey>
<connor> there's i know there's going to be just </connor>
<connor> like a whole like </connor>
<connor> of new smash players </connor>

<garnt> really care i yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i never </garnt>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<joey> i mean i was hyped just purely on the </joey>
<joey> base of like </joey>
<joey> just thinking to myself how the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like they must have thought for tooth </joey>
<joey> and nail with disney to get that maybe i </joey>
<connor> think i think i think maybe smash is big </connor>
<connor> enough where they would have been like </connor>
<joey> this oh yeah i'm sure like sakurai's </joey>
<joey> done enough now where he's just like </joey>
<connor> do you know who i am i mean i mean </connor>
<joey> releasing uh kingdom hearts on the </joey>
<connor> switch yes </connor>
<garnt> which is probably one of the biggest </garnt>
<garnt> reasons why yeah i mean like i was more </garnt>
<connor> surprised about minecraft steve yeah </connor>
<joey> that did break twitter yeah yeah that </joey>
<joey> broke twitter as well yeah because </joey>
<joey> because like sora i was just as as </joey>
<connor> someone who's not that invested in smash </connor>
<connor> or kingdom hearts i was like i see it </connor>
<connor> it's like because it wasn't that big of </connor>
<connor> a surprise for me where i was just like </connor>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] where did this come from </garnt>
<garnt> it was just like yeah i mean they had a </garnt>
<garnt> cloud on there they had uh </garnt>
<connor> see this is why i want a master chief </connor>

<joey> been like this is full for memes this is </joey>
<connor> i do not actually want i do not care if </connor>
<connor> he is in it or not but i just want the </connor>

<connor> basically </connor>
<connor> they took nickelodeon all the </connor>
<connor> nickelodeon characters and turned into a </connor>
<joey> spell it's like actually like </joey>
<joey> like a well-designed game yeah i've </joey>
<joey> heard okay i don't know i don't really </joey>
<joey> care i saw a video of some guy just </joey>
<joey> saying how broken spongebob was and </joey>
<joey> um and i never thought i'd see the word </joey>
<connor> spongebob needs to get nerfed </connor>
<connor> written in text by like i saw and i was </connor>

<joey> they can have i'm glad they have </joey>
<connor> something i wish i i wish i had </connor>
<joey> something that i got there i probably </joey>
<connor> know more about the kingdom hearts lore </connor>
<connor> just purely because of aki yeah because </connor>
<connor> i had to sit down and watch her play all </connor>
<joey> of kingdoms 3 and every turning point i </joey>
<joey> was like uh may i ask a question </joey>
<connor> several questions yeah i love the memes </connor>
<garnt> of like mickey mouse wearing like a </garnt>
<garnt> black hood i don't understand yeah i </garnt>
<joey> don't understand the context yeah </joey>
<joey> that's king mickey but like yeah but </joey>

<joey> hood and i'm like all right </joey>
<joey> i should just like and he gets into the </joey>
<connor> darkness and he fights enemies i don't </connor>

<joey> later all right </joey>
<joey> it's very weird when you just say that </joey>
<garnt> when i hear that out of context </garnt>
<connor> it's one of those memes that passed very </connor>
<joey> fast but i found it so funny and i i </joey>
<joey> realized i'm such a child that's sad </joey>
<joey> it's so funny </joey>
<joey> you're like crying </joey>
<connor> there's something in my eye </connor>
<connor> it's just so funny </connor>

<connor> breaking this matter </connor>
<connor> [Applause] </connor>
