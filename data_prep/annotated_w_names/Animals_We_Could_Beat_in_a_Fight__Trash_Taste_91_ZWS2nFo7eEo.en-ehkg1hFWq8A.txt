<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<garnt> - Hello you terrific, </garnt>
<garnt> thoughtful tremendously talented teens </garnt>
<joey> and welcome to the Trash Taste episode. </joey>
<joey> - Teens. </joey>
<garnt> - So I just wanted to
beat Joey's alliteration. </garnt>
<joey> - Now I know how stupid
it sounds. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Wait, did you think
it sounded not stupid? </connor>
<connor> No. </connor>
<connor> - How did you think it sounded? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't think it sounded that stupid. </connor>
<connor> - Joey did it. He's that was a good one. </connor>
<joey> - In my head, I was like damn got bars. </joey>
<joey> How come I didn't do that. </joey>
<joey> - Bars. </joey>
<garnt> - So yeah welcome to
the Trash Taste Podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today? </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt and with me again, are the boys, </garnt>
<garnt> Joey and Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's me, that's awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - How's your week been guys? </garnt>
<joey> - It's been all right. </joey>
<joey> I mean, we should be
asking you that question. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause you've had a...
- Are we here on a Thursday? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah we are here on a Thursday. </joey>
<joey> - So I know if you couldn't tell. </joey>
<connor> - So I know I've not
been putting Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> on the best of records recently. </connor>
<connor> We've put the streams, </connor>
<connor> we've delayed the streams two weeks </connor>
<garnt> because I unfortunately got COVID </garnt>
<garnt> and now we've had to delay
the stream for two days now </garnt>
<garnt> because I got stuck in a snowstorm </garnt>
<garnt> because I was up in Hakaido. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man I can't get a dog. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I am playing Gaon life </garnt>
<garnt> and I am losing on every
role I swear to God. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, no, that's exactly how it felt </garnt>
<garnt> because I was up in Nokado </garnt>
<garnt> just on a trip with me and Sydney </garnt>
<joey> for a good four five days. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And we were scheduled to
come back on the Monday. </joey>
<joey> And if anything happened on the Monday, </joey>
<joey> I could have come back Tuesday morning </joey>
<joey> to record Trash Tastes </joey>
<joey> because my entire life is planned </joey>
<joey> around Trash Tastes, recordings. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure your guys are
lives days now as well. </joey>
<joey> - Pretty much yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And unfortunately on Monday I woke up, </joey>
<joey> checked my flight. </joey>
<joey> My flight was canceled. </joey>
<joey> I was all right, whatever. </joey>
<joey> It's okay we can expect that to happen. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes I look on the
site to rebook my flight </joey>
<joey> and every single flight
for the entire day is </joey>
<joey> just canceled was canceled, canceled. </joey>
<joey> So,
- How bad was the storm? </joey>
<joey> - It was really, really bad. </joey>
<joey> It was, </joey>
<joey> I've obviously not had much experience </joey>
<connor> in cold weather and snow. </connor>
<joey> So this was the first
time (laughing) I never, </joey>
<joey> this was the first time I'd ever been, </joey>
<joey> I guess caught in a snowstorm. </joey>
<joey> And I remember when during the snow storm, </joey>
<joey> we had to take a taxi to the airport. </joey>
<garnt> Cause all of the trains
had stopped running. </garnt>
<garnt> So it wasn't just planes. </garnt>
<garnt> We were looking at, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> can we take, </garnt>
<garnt> the Shinhan or the train
back from Hakaido to Tokyo? </garnt>
<garnt> Nope everything was gone. </garnt>
<joey> - Which says a lot with Hokkaido. Right? </joey>
<connor> Because Hokkaido is one of those places </connor>
<connor> where it snows so often </connor>
<connor> that even just a little bit of snow </connor>
<connor> or a substantial amount of snow, </connor>
<connor> it's still yeah. </connor>
<connor> We'll just power through it. </connor>
<joey> Un Tokyo where it's 10
centimeters of snow, </joey>
<joey> stop the trains, stop everything. </joey>
<garnt> - Rather UK can't imagine man, </garnt>
<joey> the UK can't imagine. </joey>
<joey> I remember we constantly go through grit, </joey>
<joey> shortages in the UK because </joey>
<garnt> we're just so ill prepared for </garnt>
<garnt> just the tiniest bit of snow. </garnt>
<connor> - They always do the exact same speech. </connor>
<joey> Every time the snow, they were </joey>
<joey> why aren't the buses running? </joey>
<joey> The buses were running during world war II </joey>
<connor> and now they stop </connor>
<connor> cause of a bit of snow. </connor>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> They do this every single time. </connor>
<joey> They say, how dare the buses stop. </joey>
<joey> - The absolute state. </joey>
<joey> It's what is another country attack? </joey>
<garnt> Or because nature attacks, </garnt>
<garnt> which all do you think is scarier </garnt>
<connor> nature for sure. </connor>
<connor> - Nature definitely. </connor>
<connor> - So I remember I remember
during the snowstorm, </connor>
<connor> I had to go outside for just a few seconds </connor>
<garnt> to go from my hotel front door, </garnt>
<connor> to the taxi in the road in front of me, </connor>
<connor> simple one to two minute walk, </connor>
<connor> And we've all done it. </connor>
<joey> And I remember thinking
it's just a bit of snow. </joey>
<joey> It's just a bit of wind.
I've handled that before. </joey>
<joey> I go out and then I've never feltnature </joey>
<joey> is just beating the outta me just as soon </joey>
<joey> as I stepped out the door. </joey>
<joey> Because this snow I'm </joey>
<joey> I felt snow before. </joey>
<joey> It's I felt snow before. </joey>
<joey> - It's soft, it's fluffy. </joey>
<joey> - It's soft it's fluffy. </joey>
<joey> No, this snow was ice man. </joey>
<joey> The wind had turned this
soft, fluffy snow into </joey>
<joey> into a WMD or something that. </joey>
<garnt> my face literally, </garnt>
<garnt> I felt my face was
getting cut from the brief </garnt>
<garnt> moment that I didn't have my hood up. </garnt>
<connor> - Look the weekend album. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
And seeing her caught in </garnt>
<garnt> a Pokemon attack. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah basically it this was
literally just blizzard. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) I could feel the hail, </garnt>
<joey> just beating the outta my face. </joey>
<joey> - That one 20 PowerPoint. </joey>
<joey> - Oh and it was even
worse for Sydney as well. </joey>
<joey> Cause for some reason, </joey>
<joey> Sydney decided that she
shouldn't bring any footwear </joey>
<joey> to her Hakiddo other than heels. </joey>
<joey> So it was boots. </joey>
<joey> But it was boots with heels on them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That yeah, I know. </joey>
<joey> - What! </joey>
<joey> - What was she expecting up in Hokkaido? </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's just been so
long since she's seen snow. </garnt>
<connor> That she has forgotten what, </connor>
<garnt> other environment just (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - Wisconsin right? </garnt>
<joey> Doesn't it snow up in Wisconsin. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it does. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I was just , </garnt>
<garnt> I remember asking her, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember telling her, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never seen snow this in my life. </garnt>
<joey> And she was </joey>
<joey> oh, it's it's been a long time. </joey>
<joey> And I was </joey>
<joey> so it's been a long time for you. </joey>
<joey> And yet you are still so ill prepared. </joey>
<joey> - You less prepared. </joey>
<joey> - You are so ill prepared
for this weather. </joey>
<joey> But yeah we just weren't obviously </joey>
<joey> we weren't expecting it to be that </joey>
<joey> harsh weather conditions
to be that harsh so hard. </joey>
<connor> And yeah we had to stay in Hakaido </connor>
<connor> basically we were living out of an </connor>
<connor> airport hotel for two days. </connor>
<connor> Cause we woke up the next day. </connor>
<connor> I remember cause I messaged these guys. </connor>
<connor> Guys were gonna have to possibly delay </connor>
<connor> the recording by an hour or two maybe </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna get an early flight. </connor>
<connor> It's all gonna be good. </connor>
<connor> It's only the weather forecast. </connor>
<connor> It's only scheduled for
the snow to be really bad </connor>
<connor> on this day. </connor>
<connor> I wake up, I look out my window, </connor>
<connor> the Blizzard's still going and I'm guys, </connor>
<connor> so guys, okay. </connor>
<connor> I can make it back. </connor>
<connor> I swear to God. </connor>
<connor> I can make it back. </connor>
<connor> The flights aren't council yet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I remember trying to reorganize </connor>
<connor> with these guys to be </connor>
<connor> okay, I'm gonna make it back on this hour. </connor>
<connor> I can make back to the
studio at this hour. </connor>
<connor> We can record. </connor>
<connor> We can still stream. </connor>
<connor> It's all good. </connor>
<connor> It's fixed guys. </connor>
<connor> We can still do Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> And hour passes and then every
flight is canceled again. </connor>
<connor> And in the defeated manner
I text these boys going </connor>
<garnt> sorry, boys I let you down. </garnt>
<joey> - Wasn't so much you that let us down. </joey>
<connor> It was the weather. </connor>
<connor> It wasn't your fault. </connor>
<connor> - (laughing) Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just fight through it. </connor>
<garnt> Don't just walk back. </garnt>
<joey> It's walkable. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause we've been through
Hakaido few times before </garnt>
<garnt> and I swear to God, every
time you go to Hakaido, </garnt>
<garnt> you're playing Gacha with
the planes then. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Cause a lot of planes get
canceled very frequently. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously not in this kind of state </garnt>
<garnt> where literally the entire
airport was shut down, </garnt>
<garnt> but you're normally playing Gacha </garnt>
<garnt> when you go to Hera </garnt>
<garnt> because one or two planes
will normally get canceled </garnt>
<garnt> or scheduled all heavily, heavily delayed. </garnt>
<joey> - But then that's when you
discovered why airport, </joey>
<joey> which is the airport in
Hokkaido is so well equipped. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. It is actually should I say </garnt>
<joey> Airports is one of the best airports </joey>
<joey> I've been to in the world. </joey>
<joey> I think really just, just, </joey>
<joey> I mean just with how many restaurants </joey>
<garnt> and how many resources are there. </garnt>
<joey> - It's basically a shopping
mall inside the airport. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah basically. </garnt>
<joey> Cause the airports that
stick out to me are airports </joey>
<joey> Singapore airport which is just </joey>
<joey> that's an amazing airport. </joey>
<connor> The Hakaido airport is mall </connor>
<connor> with an airport attached to it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where most of the stuff you see </connor>
<connor> is before you go into the departure zone, </connor>
<connor> whereas most airports
it's the departure zone, </connor>
<connor> which really has all of the restaurants, </connor>
<connor> all of the shops and all
the everything, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> In Jato, I mean there's
even a cinema there as well. </connor>
<joey> - Which there was. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I did you watch something? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't, the only film were playing was </connor>
<connor> the Kyon movie. </connor>
<connor> - Do this, just go watch it. </connor>
<connor> Just go watch. </connor>
<connor> - I am actually gonna go
watch it this weekend, </connor>
<connor> which is the only reason why </connor>
<connor> I didn't watch it when I was in Hakaido. </connor>
<connor> - I see. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah it wasn't, </connor>
<connor> too bad because of the airport. </connor>
<connor> Then luckily I was able to </connor>
<joey> get a hotel at the airport. </joey>
<joey> It was just more annoying </joey>
<joey> because obviously I wanted to be back. </joey>
<joey> I wanted to be working, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean there's not really
much to say about it. </joey>
<joey> I mean I'm sure this is
every other day for a </joey>
<garnt> Canadian, I remember there's. </garnt>
<joey> - Gonna be a million people
in the comments being whoa. </joey>
<joey> Imagine living with sort of
that every day of the week. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because I remember bring. </connor>
<garnt> - Your own slate dogs. </garnt>
<connor> How responsible you had gone. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It was just weird. </connor>
<connor> Just because I'm just used to, </connor>
<joey> no matter what happens, </joey>
<joey> there's always kind of a plan B </joey>
<joey> that you can fall back </joey>
<joey> on a possible plan B, </joey>
<joey> but it was just, </joey>
<joey> the roads were closed. </joey>
<garnt> Airports were closed. </garnt>
<garnt> Trains were closed. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was literally stranded. </garnt>
<joey> - You basically experienced quarantine. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah basically I was basically
stranded at the airport </garnt>
<garnt> and there was no plan B. </garnt>
<garnt> There was no services I could
call to get myself out of </garnt>
<garnt> there to a place where I could
get some public transport to. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you go around getting
the shopping carts to get some </connor>
<connor> money together so you could buy a burger. </connor>
<joey> - Collecting plastic cans. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So yeah. </joey>
<connor> I basically just lived
the terminal except sorry. </connor>
<joey> Unfortunately I wasn't Tom hack. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause I think one of the
craziest weather phenomena </garnt>
<garnt> I've been caught up in was </garnt>
<joey> when I was in Vegas and
they have dust storms there. </joey>
<joey> - Dust storms. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So basically just
think of a sandstorm, </joey>
<joey> but instead of the sand coming in from a. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never even been in the sandstorm. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I haven't been in a sandstorm, </joey>
<joey> but I've been in a dust storm </joey>
<garnt> and it happens pretty frequently in Vegas. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the difference between sand dust? </garnt>
<connor> - I thought it was a sandal at first. </connor>
<connor> But then everyone, all my friends were oh, </connor>
<connor> it's a dust storm coming. </connor>
<connor> - It's a different vernacular. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe or it's maybe it's not just sand. </connor>
<connor> Maybe it's sand, another
crap, mixed into it. </connor>
<connor> But basically I was driving
around in Vegas, just </connor>
<connor> with a bunch of friends </connor>
<connor> and then on the radio, </connor>
<connor> cause he had the radio on
it just suddenly switches on </connor>
<connor> and it is oh there's a
dust storming coming. </connor>
<connor> So please evacuate kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> And I was my pants. </connor>
<joey> I was what the is a dust storm? </joey>
<joey> And then, but everyone else there, </joey>
<joey> the locals just oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> it happens pretty frequently. </joey>
<joey> Let's just go to a
restaurant gets on to eat. </joey>
<joey> Oh wow. </joey>
<joey> So we go into this and then
the dust storm hits. Right. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, yeah,
just think of a typhoon. </joey>
<joey> Right. So it's just really insane winds, </joey>
<connor> but you can't see outside. </connor>
<connor> - The whole windows are. </connor>
<connor> - Nothing. </connor>
<connor> It's just all sand. </connor>
<joey> It's just it's a blizzard, </joey>
<joey> but instead of white, </joey>
<joey> it's just grayish brown. </joey>
<joey> - It's a survival game. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But what's more terrifying
in my opinion than a blizzard </connor>
<joey> is the fact that in a dust storm </joey>
<joey> it can cause static electricity. </joey>
<joey> So basically you have thunder
strikes at ground level </joey>
<joey> because of all the particles
rubbing together. Right. </joey>
<joey> So every now and then it'll
just be blowing and then </joey>
<joey> you'll just hear this
boom sound from outside. </joey>
<joey> And I'm the is happening. </joey>
<joey> It's oh that's just the electricity. </joey>
<joey> I was why are you saying it? </joey>
<joey> oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's my friend. </joey>
<joey> so saying it so casually. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. So </connor>
<connor> - That's really interesting. </connor>
<connor> - So that entire time
I was my pants while, </connor>
<connor> we were in this ramen shop. </connor>
<connor> Of course they were oh Joe's Japanese. </connor>
<connor> Let's just go to a restaurant. </connor>
<connor> I'm yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I'm here all the way in Vegas to go </garnt>
<joey> eat some subpar Japanese food I bet. </joey>
<joey> So we were so basically I was stuck inside </joey>
<garnt> a Roman shop called Narato. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you serious? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not even fronting
it's it was called Narato. </joey>
<garnt> I mean they did their best, oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> The walls had Narato, did they? </garnt>
<joey> - And some of you could have been named </joey>
<connor> after the location. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> It was and the ramen, it was very obvious. </joey>
<joey> They tried to replicate the Narato </joey>
<garnt> amen as best as they could, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - To not that great levels immediately, </garnt>
<connor> I think it was the most three outta </connor>
<connor> 10 RO I've ever had. </connor>
<connor> So I was great. </connor>
<connor> I'm stuck inside this restaurant called </connor>
<connor> Narrato eating us. </connor>
<connor> - All this poor restaurant
getting destroyed. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think it exists anymore. </connor>
<connor> Isn't the thing. </connor>
<garnt> So I'm and if it does
exist, sorry, you're that. </garnt>
<joey> - Is the most perfect moment of </joey>
<garnt> LO's going this guy's
Japanese, you side me. </garnt>
<connor> - The perfect place that
the episode Simpsons. </connor>
<joey> And they go to America town in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah basically. </connor>
<connor> - Dude I mean the first thing, </connor>
<connor> the first thing I ate
when I went to America </connor>
<connor> for the first time, </connor>
<connor> which was the first ex I ever went to, </connor>
<connor> my friends took me a little Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> And I was bro. </connor>
<joey> - Every yeah, every time you I've got ax, </joey>
<connor> everyone to get a little Tokyo. </connor>
<joey> - I just came from big Tokyo. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I didn't need to go.
- A smaller variant of it. </joey>
<joey> And then I had, again, some subpar Ram </joey>
<joey> in little Tokyo, I was yeah, great. </joey>
<joey> The fan, this is the
LA experience I wanted. </joey>
<connor> - The only time I've ever seen a natural </connor>
<connor> phenomenon of is </connor>
<connor> I saw sun in the UK One time. </connor>
<connor> - You were oh I. </connor>
<joey> - Holy shit. </joey>
<joey> - I've seen fire tornado in Australia. </joey>
<joey> - What the is a fire tornado. </joey>
<connor> - We have breezes in the UK gust of wind. </connor>
<garnt> - So you have tornadoes. </garnt>
<joey> And you have Bush fires. </joey>
<joey> So what happens when a
tornado enters a Bush fire, </joey>
<garnt> You basically get this
spiraling, pillar of fire. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's terrifying. </garnt>
<joey> - It's awesome to look at from a distance. </joey>
<joey> - These, settlers must
have been so confused </joey>
<joey> when all this was happening. </joey>
<connor> They're what the is happening? </connor>
<joey> - British that's what the British saw the. </joey>
<connor> first time in Australia. </connor>
<joey> They're what the fuck is that? </joey>
<joey> - The first time they
found the swamp in Florida, </joey>
<joey> they're what? </joey>
<garnt> - Bit humid in here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Australia is just a real
life island in one piece, </garnt>
<joey> - A fire in Ireland. </joey>
<joey> - It's an island on the
grand line at this point. </joey>
<garnt> Because the survival instincts
you need in this island, </garnt>
<garnt> that that's taken out most the pirates </garnt>
<connor> in one piece at this point. </connor>
<connor> - Imagine being the
Geris to write the guide. </connor>
<connor> They Chan back to people
who are gonna come again. </connor>
<connor> So by the way, </connor>
<connor> you're not gonna believe this, right. </connor>
<garnt> how it suns sometimes, right? </garnt>
<garnt> that all the time. </garnt>
<joey> - All the time. </joey>
<connor> - And sometimes I don't
know how this happened. </connor>
<connor> There was just fire tornado. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know what a tornado is. </connor>
<joey> We never even seen one of them. </joey>
<connor> There's a tornado. </connor>
<joey> - It says, but it's such
a weird thing as well, </joey>
<joey> because it's not I kind of described it, </joey>
<connor> there's a Bush fire and
then a tornado comes long </connor>
<connor> and eats up the fire. </connor>
<connor> It's also the fire is so
strong that it basically </connor>
<connor> creates an up current that starts to spin. </connor>
<joey> And then it just creates
this pillar of fire that just </joey>
<joey> crashes through just, just sounds. </joey>
<joey> It's really cool to see. </joey>
<joey> - It just sounds a anime
attack at this point. </joey>
<joey> Where, </joey>
<joey> - I was like </joey>
<garnt> is there a Pokemon battle
happening over there? </garnt>
<joey> And someone did fire spin. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - There's two jujitsu being
combined together in Narato. </garnt>
<connor> - This stomach after having
that narrower Ram. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's cut on. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I did it. </joey>
<joey> I did see actually there recently, </joey>
<joey> the UK or at least London went through </joey>
<joey> a pretty bad storm. </joey>
<joey> - Bad storm, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Which I dunno how bad it was. </connor>
<joey> 'cause when I see, when I see UK. </joey>
<connor> - It looked really bad. </connor>
<joey> It looked really.
- Bad cause when I see, but </joey>
<joey> when you see UK headlines yeah. </joey>
<joey> And you see </joey>
<joey> oh UK go through a bad storm </joey>
<joey> and the strongest wind scene. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm just is it </garnt>
<garnt> obviously it's going to be bad for the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> but how bad is it on a global scale? </garnt>
<connor> - There, is videos about picking up people </connor>
<garnt> and throwing them. </garnt>
<connor> - Seriously. Oh. </connor>
<connor> - Hell yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Cause when I saw the headline, </connor>
<joey> I thought it was just the
British over exaggerating as </joey>
<joey> no dude, as you guys, usually there's </joey>
<joey> my friend's too pay fell off. </joey>
<joey> It's an absolute travesty. </joey>
<joey> - It's so strong. </joey>
<connor> - I saw severe people get thrown around. </connor>
<connor> I was oh my God. </connor>
<connor> rip, if you're trying to
open that car door, man, </connor>
<garnt> you're trying to get that close. </garnt>
<connor> - Never have. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Cause this. </connor>
<connor> So this just shows how unused we are to </connor>
<garnt> these kind of weather systems
and whether phenomena. </garnt>
<connor> Cause we're me </connor>
<connor> and Connor are ina group chat </connor>
<garnt> of the our friends in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> And sometimes, they're still meeting up </connor>
<connor> and they're still planning, </connor>
<connor> meetups and everything that. </connor>
<connor> And I saw in this group chat that, </connor>
<garnt> that they had planned a meetup
or to hang out on this day. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember right up
to the last moment people </garnt>
<joey> were just oh yeah, I'll
see you guys in an hour. </joey>
<joey> I'll see you guys an hour. </joey>
<joey> We're still meeting in an hour and people </joey>
<joey> I'll see you in an hour. </joey>
<joey> I, and then you just
see you just see this, </joey>
<joey> the replies going, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Let's maybe not meet up today. </joey>
<joey> Maybe that's not the best idea. </joey>
<joey> But the thing is, </joey>
<joey> if this was one of the worst storms that </joey>
<joey> UK has gone has gone through, </joey>
<joey> I am also really used to the
idea that no matter what, </joey>
<joey> you can still go out and have a pipe, </joey>
<joey> you can still go out and have a pipe. </joey>
<connor> No matter. </connor>
<connor> - The pub has been canceled. </connor>
<connor> - So that's how I knew that
this storm was the real deal. </connor>
<garnt> If my mates were not going
to the pub to meet up </garnt>
<garnt> because of this storm, gone down. </garnt>
<joey> - The pub isn't closed, then
that means I can still go. </joey>
<joey> - Right. No matter what. </joey>
<joey> - It is basically that, Oh God. </joey>
<garnt> That is another third
of UK people severely </garnt>
<garnt> unprepared for, weather systems. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
Because I remember, </joey>
<joey> when I first met my first British person, </joey>
<joey> from the UK who exist. </joey>
<joey> They exist I was oh my
God, you guys exist. </joey>
<joey> But second of all, they're always oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> we have nothing going on in the UK. </joey>
<joey> No bad weather, no dangerous animals. </joey>
<joey> Know nothing I'm Don really real. </joey>
<joey> I found that hard to believe as </joey>
<joey> someone who came from the </joey>
<connor> polar opposite of that. </connor>
<connor> Just call it. </connor>
<connor> I came from doom. </connor>
<connor> I came from hell basically the under one. </connor>
<joey> Because it's do you guys really not? </joey>
<joey> what is the most dangerous
thing that floods flood. </joey>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> I was about to say floods.
- We got a lot of rivers. </joey>
<joey> So obviously when it rains a
lot, it can flood back. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Depending on where you are in the </joey>
<connor> UK there aren't floods. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. what if you're
nowhere near the rivers. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Then you don't get anything. </connor>
<joey> Occasionally you. </joey>
<joey> - Guys get a lucky. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. We've had hurricane scares before, </connor>
<garnt> at least in my lifetime, </garnt>
<garnt> but nothing that actually
manifests anything felt </garnt>
<connor> - A hurricane. Right? </connor>
<joey> - It was just a bit of strong wind. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Gust. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's that was pretty much it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I mean, we don't have
a lot to fear in the UK, </joey>
<joey> which is why whenever I travel
abroad, whenever I, well, </joey>
<joey> sorry, I lost my train of thought. </joey>
<joey> Whenever I travel a abroad, bored. </joey>
<connor> - A abroad. </connor>
<joey> - Whenever I travel abroad, I got it. </joey>
<joey> I got it this line, there you go. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes it just surprises
me about some of the things </joey>
<joey> you have to be careful of
just because in the UK, </joey>
<joey> we don't have to be careful
of anything with camping, </joey>
<joey> you have to be careful about bears or, </joey>
<joey> starting a forest fire, </joey>
<joey> which to me starting a forest fire was </joey>
<joey> so outside a perception of what, </joey>
<garnt> of disasters that could
happen from just one person. </garnt>
<garnt> But if you think about it yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Of course it makes sense. you see, </garnt>
<garnt> you look at Australia
being on fire California, </garnt>
<garnt> half the year being on. </garnt>
<joey> - Fire. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Our country was on fire
for nine months straight </joey>
<joey> because of one guy starting a fire. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. To me that's just so outside </garnt>
<garnt> of my perception of what could </garnt>
<garnt> possibly go wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Of one stupid person doing a stupid thing, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, all the
trees are wet in the UK. </connor>
<connor> It was very hard to get. </connor>
<connor> Even I remember when we were camping, </connor>
<garnt> it was even hard to get
trees that weren't too </garnt>
<garnt> D really to burn. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jeez. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, you could come in with a </garnt>
<connor> flame thrower and it would </connor>
<connor> probably be put out by the day. </connor>
<garnt> - The flame will run out gas. </garnt>
<joey> - It's very rough. </joey>
<joey> I don't think we've ever
seen anywhere, in nature, </joey>
<connor> on fire in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<garnt> I don't think so. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, fire's just not </garnt>
<connor> - It's hard to get it
started. Yeah. It's very. </connor>
<connor> - Hard to get nature fires. </connor>
<garnt> Aren't a thing that we have
to be careful about in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yet one of the biggest
UK hits was fire starter. </garnt>
<connor> So, that's bit ironic. </connor>
<joey> - It's cause they, </joey>
<joey> had so much time while </joey>
<joey> they were making the fire starter. </joey>
<joey> - They, part, I make a song about it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God, you do the fire. </joey>
<garnt> I'll make I'm. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why it's an achievement. </joey>
<joey> Cause it's easy to be a fire
starter anywhere else in </joey>
<joey> the world, in the UK. </joey>
<joey> It's a medal. </joey>
<joey> - I'm a Fire starter it's You manage that. </joey>
<connor> - On some forest fires natural, </connor>
<joey> there's that needs to happen
sometimes to clear a lot </joey>
<joey> of the dead trees and stuff. </joey>
<connor> And then see a lot of
them recently are not. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. So we have controlled Bush fires </joey>
<joey> in Australia that happens </joey>
<joey> pretty frequently because we also have, </joey>
<joey> I don't know the details about it, </joey>
<joey> but we have this specific </joey>
<joey> is it breed I don't know. </joey>
<connor> what the word for it is of tree or sapling </connor>
<connor> where breed it's a type of eucalyptus. </connor>
<connor> I think where the, </connor>
<connor> seeds from the tree, right. </connor>
<connor> Need to be put into a fire in. </connor>
<connor> - Order for. </connor>
<connor> - It to open up.
- So to keep the forest alive, </connor>
<connor> they actually have to burn these seeds </connor>
<joey> and basically start a </joey>
<joey> Bush fire for that area of
the bushland to grow in, </joey>
<connor> which is the most backwards thinking </connor>
<joey> that nature has ever done. </joey>
<connor> - I imagine if the dead trees pile up </connor>
<joey> and then it's as </joey>
<joey> hot as it is in Australia. </joey>
<joey> It'll naturally catch. </joey>
<connor> - On. Oh, fire. </connor>
<connor> We get natural bush fires all the time. </connor>
<garnt> Just cause of how hot
and powerful the sun. </garnt>
<connor> - Australia literally is
the last dungeon area. </connor>
<garnt> even nature is high level
in Australia what the. </garnt>
<connor> - Randomly just start up. </connor>
<joey> - It's literally the desert level. </joey>
<connor> Andres of the rather
the breath of the wild. </connor>
<joey> - Breath of time. </joey>
<connor> - It's literally the desert level </connor>
<connor> and breath of the wild where </connor>
<connor> if you don't have the right equipment, </connor>
<joey> you are forever just gaining damage from. </joey>
<connor> - Song. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think in Israel, </connor>
<connor> I think as well, I can't remember. </connor>
<connor> I might have been on one of those generic </connor>
<joey> videos where you learn about. </joey>
<joey> You didn't know, you
wanted to learn about, </joey>
<joey> and then you learn about
it and you're eh, okay. </joey>
<joey> I YouTube you mean every YouTube? </joey>
<joey> Mainly videos if always that. </joey>
<joey> So I think it was </joey>
<joey> because the US for so
long was actively stopping </joey>
<joey> all the fires. </joey>
<joey> It turned out that a lot of
the branches needed to just be </joey>
<joey> set ABL so that they
could get rid of them. </joey>
<joey> And then it could go back in the system, </joey>
<joey> it turns into Ash. </joey>
<joey> So they had a buildup
of a lot of dead trees </joey>
<joey> and stuff that. So when
the fire, I did start, </joey>
<joey> it went crazy </joey>
<joey> and it should be nearly as big as it was. </joey>
<connor> - I mean yeah, we.
- I think I could be. </connor>
<connor> - Wrong on that. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> we have so many controlled </connor>
<connor> Bush fires just because </connor>
<connor> we do have just at least in my area, </connor>
<connor> we have a lot of wildlife
and nature reserves </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But sometimes, unfortunately they're not, </connor>
<connor> some of those fires aren't controlled 100% </connor>
<connor> of the way </connor>
<connor> and that's what causes
Bush fire scares and right. </connor>
<connor> You're up bush fires sometimes. </connor>
<joey> So I think that's why we have
a lot of that just because </joey>
<joey> we're trying to maintain the nature. </joey>
<joey> And then sometimes nature's what? </joey>
<joey> I'm a go ham a little bit. </joey>
<connor> And then they go ham. </connor>
<garnt> - And controlled fire
in the UK is from trying </garnt>
<connor> to boil your water. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It's oh God. </garnt>
<joey> - As an Australian, </joey>
<garnt> what is your guess fear
over there in terms of </garnt>
<connor> nature wise, what'd, </connor>
<connor> you have to be careful
about the most emotion. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, the people scam me the most. </connor>
<connor> - That's such a video game, movie thing. </connor>
<joey> - It's not the emotion. </joey>
<joey> - Worry about kid. </joey>
<connor> It's the people, </connor>
<connor> humans are the scariest of them. </connor>
<joey> All the humans were
the monsters all along. </joey>
<connor> - You can predict a black
widow can't predict. </connor>
<connor> - A human guns don't kill people. </connor>
<joey> People kill people. </joey>
<joey> - In terms of wildlife. </joey>
<connor> I'm usually pretty okay with insects </connor>
<connor> and snakes and spiders. </connor>
<joey> If I know it's not going to kill me. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you ever had a
big scare yourself of </garnt>
<garnt> you've encountered something you're oh, </garnt>
<garnt> this could actually. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah many times. </joey>
<connor> I've the health bar comes
on the bottom of the screen. </connor>
<joey> - Many times I remember </joey>
<connor> I was actually this close to
basically dying at one point </connor>
<connor> because I was this close to
being by bitten by one of the </connor>
<joey> most venomous ants in
the world, venomous ants. </joey>
<connor> So we not only so Australia, </connor>
<connor> so people outside of Australia </connor>
<connor> think that Australia's just </connor>
<joey> venomous spiders and snakes
that's but we have fair. </joey>
<joey> We have a lot of venomous insects </joey>
<joey> and we have this one ant species </joey>
<joey> called the bulldog ant and
it is supposedly the most </joey>
<joey> venomous ant in the world. </joey>
<joey> And I almost got bitten by
one when I was 10 years old. </joey>
<garnt> - I think dark dark horse
is way more balanced than </garnt>
<joey> Australia. At least it has a hip box. </joey>
<garnt> You can see. </garnt>
<garnt> - So basically I was camping, </garnt>
<connor> that's where most of the accidents happen. </connor>
<connor> So you got. </connor>
<connor> - The campfire, right? </connor>
<connor> - That makes sense. Yeah.
No, I was camping the bonfire </connor>
<joey> and I was sitting on. </joey>
<joey> - I lit the bonfire. </joey>
<joey> - I thought I was in the
safe zone and I wasn't, </joey>
<joey> - The one enemy before
I could teleport. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I was kind of sitting
around the fire with, </joey>
<joey> my family and my mates. </joey>
<connor> And I was maybe 10, 11 years old. </connor>
<connor> And we were ina really, </connor>
<connor> really deep rainforest area. Right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. So it was basically
we just found a flat, </connor>
<connor> it wasn't even a registered
campsite basically. </connor>
<connor> It was just oh, we found
a flat piece of ground. </connor>
<connor> Let's just, start a fire here, </connor>
<joey> as long as it's control, it's what. </joey>
<garnt> - The way he just said, you. </garnt>
<joey> - Didn't say let's make this all campsite. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's not a fire. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean a responsible firefighter. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. A small fire. </joey>
<connor> Let's start a fire here. </connor>
<connor> - Let's hunker down here
for the night, right? </connor>
<joey> Let's so we set up the camp there and </joey>
<joey> my dad started of the fire </joey>
<garnt> and we were getting all cozy up. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was sitting on the
it's giant slab of rock. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. It was very smooth. </garnt>
<garnt> And asa 10 year old, </garnt>
<garnt> you just wanna climb. Right. </garnt>
<connor> It's so it's, </connor>
<connor> I found lots of little rocks to </connor>
<connor> and big rocks to kind of climb around. </connor>
<joey> And I was sitting and
I was kind of sitting </joey>
<joey> with my mate as well. </joey>
<joey> And my hand was rested back this. </joey>
<joey> Right. Okay. </joey>
<joey> And I kind of legs out. </joey>
<joey> Kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> And I was just chilling and every </joey>
<connor> and then I felt something
crawl onto my hand. Right. </connor>
<connor> And I looked down and it was an ant, </connor>
<connor> but I was oh, </connor>
<connor> that's a big ant. </connor>
<connor> - But how big are we talking that. </connor>
<joey> - That's quite big. </joey>
<garnt> - That's pretty funny. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, that's still an ant. </joey>
<joey> Yeah still an ant's. </joey>
<garnt> It's just this. </garnt>
<joey> - This pitch black T just kind
of rolling onto my finger. </joey>
<garnt> And then yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I kind of put my hand up </garnt>
<garnt> and was looking at it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then my friend who
was next to me just gased </garnt>
<garnt> and then immediately swatted my hand away </garnt>
<garnt> and swatted this ant off me. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was what the? </garnt>
<connor> I was looking at this cool ant. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, why.
- Why would you do that? </garnt>
<connor> And he was dude, would've died. </connor>
<joey> you do know what that thing is. </joey>
<joey> And then he told me and
he showed me what it was. </joey>
<joey> And I was well, thank
you for slapping my hand. </joey>
<joey> Glad I didn't die young. </joey>
<connor> - Does it, does it
definitely kill you? Or is it </connor>
<joey> - I mean it can kill. </joey>
<joey> They say the venom is
powerful enough to kill </joey>
<joey> an adult in 15 minutes. </joey>
<joey> So as a 10 year old, </joey>
<joey> probably would've been instant kill. </joey>
<joey> - Yes what's the coyote
Peterson video of him. </joey>
<joey> - Sting test. (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - Kill me. </joey>
<joey> - The next level of. </joey>
<garnt> - It's in the OG YouTube days, it's </garnt>
<garnt> will it blend 20, 30 YouTube? </garnt>
<joey> Will I die? </joey>
<joey> Will I die? </joey>
<garnt> Let's find out. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm for this I'm about
to enter the death zone </joey>
<joey> with the dudu guys. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So yeah. </joey>
<connor> So my friend saved my life </connor>
<connor> and now I know that we have these ants. </connor>
<connor> Cause when you're a kid in Australia, </connor>
<joey> you are always, told be
careful of the snakes, </joey>
<joey> be careful of the spiders because </joey>
<joey> we do have a lot of non venomous kinds. </joey>
<joey> But that's not the ones you
have to walk out for obviously </joey>
<joey> I've been bitten by a snake once, </joey>
<joey> but it wasn't venous. </joey>
<joey> It just really hurt. So
that, I mean, that's fine. </joey>
<connor> It was just a little nip on the finger. </connor>
<connor> So it's whatever, what, doesn't kill you. </connor>
<joey> What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger. Right. </joey>
<joey> - They must have sent
the craziest from the UK. </joey>
<joey> If I was there, </joey>
<connor> one of the first people in Australia </connor>
<connor> and all my friends just </connor>
<connor> it's bitten by an end and
we're laughing jovial. </connor>
<connor> And then he just dies. </connor>
<connor> I'm like we're leaving, this place. </connor>
<joey> Get back on the boat. </joey>
<connor> We're leaving. </connor>
<connor> - Oh little cute little lamp Boom. </connor>
<connor> - It's just I get back, pack the back up, </connor>
<connor> pack it up. </connor>
<connor> - That's why they send the prisoners that. </connor>
<garnt> - That's it's literally </garnt>
<garnt> the dark continents in hunt. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - That's when you play
the ground is LA it's </joey>
<joey> everybody off the ground. </joey>
<garnt> - History is the UK. </garnt>
<joey> I don't think I'd have the
courage to do anything in </joey>
<joey> Australia cause they're no, </joey>
<joey> the more I read the more I'm just I just, </joey>
<joey> I guess I just won't go
outside cause it's great. </joey>
<joey> The beaches sound great. </joey>
<joey> Why I read about stone fish. </joey>
<joey> Right? And then I'm just oh, </joey>
<garnt> - A stone fish. </garnt>
<joey> - Just don't step on the way. </joey>
<garnt> - So a stone fish is a fish
that looks exactly a stone. </garnt>
<joey> It's very ugly fish. </joey>
<joey> - It's a very a bottom dweller fish. </joey>
<joey> - But it's fins have razor sharp needles </joey>
<joey> that if you step on it, </joey>
<joey> it's apparently one of the
most painful experiences, you. </joey>
<connor> - Can have your from an animal. </connor>
<connor> - Any of your friends stepped on one. </connor>
<joey> - I've had a friend step on one] </joey>
<joey> and he, I mean he obviously
went to the hospital for it. </joey>
<joey> He didn't die, but. </joey>
<joey> - Well that's the plus, but I mean. </joey>
<connor> - Didn't die. </connor>
<connor> - Is it venomous or is it painful? </connor>
<joey> - It's just extremely voice. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, if you, it could
cause anaphylactic shock </garnt>
<garnt> and kill you if you're unlucky. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the most venous fish known. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. It's the most venous
fish known on earth. </garnt>
<garnt> And so even if I don't, </garnt>
<joey> even if you don't die, </joey>
<joey> you're going to have
a very, very bad time. </joey>
<joey> - You're just gonna
experience a lot of pain. </joey>
<connor> - If you're experiencing enough. </connor>
<garnt> - Pain cause of the pain. </garnt>
<connor> Is it sharp or is it got some poison? </connor>
<joey> - It's Probably got some toxins
in it or something, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It can kill you by the way. </joey>
<connor> - It can kill you if you're. </connor>
<connor> Just pull up the Glock
shoot your own foot. </connor>
<joey> Just stop it from going
through the cut it off. </joey>
<joey> - Off John Wicked </joey>
<connor> - I mean I think, </connor>
<connor> but things stone fish and all that are. </connor>
<connor> - Are they super common
or is it super rare? </connor>
<joey> - No, it's very, very rare. </joey>
<joey> This video is sponsored by Harry's. </joey>

<connor> I am a Sigma male </connor>

<joey> - Back to the video. </joey>
<joey> One thing you mostly have to worry about. </joey>
<joey> If you go to the beach in
Australia is the jellyfish. </joey>
<garnt> - I was gonna say the second
thing that terrifies me. </garnt>
<connor> - Well we have a ton of
those in the jellyfish. </connor>
<garnt> - Not to take jellyfish though. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, but the ones that
areextremely painful. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, because we, </connor>
<garnt> you are probably seeing
your box jellyfish, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I've never seen that in the waters. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never heard of anyone
getting stung by that, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's the one that can kill you. </garnt>
<garnt> And people have. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Where it puts you in
so much pain that you drown. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause you have zero control over your. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. It basically
paralyzes you immediately. </joey>
<connor> - Have people survived. </connor>
<joey> - People have survived. </joey>
<joey> But I mean it's a very uncommon way. </joey>
<joey> Sorry it's a very rare
way for anyone to die. </joey>
<garnt> I think only maybe two or
three people die a year </garnt>
<garnt> from it or something. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's very rare considering
the amount of people </garnt>
<garnt> who go into the ocean in Australia, </garnt>
<garnt> it's you gotta be really unlucky. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jellyfish just scare me. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I mean I've been stung by a, </garnt>
<connor> the other kind of jellyfish
that's way more common is they </connor>
<connor> call blue bottle jellyfish. </connor>
<connor> And they're not toxic or anything. </connor>
<joey> they won't kill you, </joey>
<joey> but it hurts a lot when you get stung by. </joey>
<connor> - My friend got stung by
one where we were swimming </connor>
<connor> in some ocean. </connor>
<joey> In the UK. </joey>
<joey> - And the trick in the
Australia is if you have a mate, </joey>
<joey> who's been stung by a blue bottle. </joey>
<joey> You pee on it. </joey>
<connor> - The, I think this is one of
those rumors though. Isn't it? </connor>
<connor> This is just right by Jojo fans. </connor>
<connor> I don't think it actually does. </connor>
<connor> - I think the actual way to do it is </connor>
<connor> you gotta pull vinegar or something on it, </connor>
<connor> but may some having your
mate on you feels relieving. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It's some kinda
alkaline that you actually </connor>
<garnt> have to put it on. </garnt>
<joey> - When you say it out loud, </joey>
<joey> it does feel like a scene from Jojo. </joey>
<joey> Doesn't it. </joey>
<joey> - You've been stung by a stand. </joey>
<joey> The only thing Go. </joey>
<joey> - To the fact the treatment
is hot water apparently. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that makes sense. </joey>
<connor> P just hot water from. </connor>
<connor> - The body scold my leg, poor. </connor>
<joey> - Boiling that's 36 degrees right there. </joey>
<joey> Dark like that. </joey>
<joey> That's warm as fuck. </joey>
<connor> - This is why this isn't
a problem in the UK. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's always got a hot
firmness ready for the teeth. </connor>
<joey> They voting to just </joey>
<connor> - Get the teeth firm. </connor>
<joey> - Put on could make it worse. </joey>
<joey> - Actually. Oh really? </joey>
<joey> Depending on how I see Wells of </joey>
<joey> sorry for peeing on your leg. </joey>
<joey> That one time. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I remember we were swimming </garnt>
<garnt> and a bunch of the jellyfishes washed up. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's normal. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh yeah. I've seen that in the UK as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Clashed them bunch of them washed up </garnt>
<garnt> and this little 10 year old didn't </garnt>
<connor> know what they were. </connor>
<joey> I think I was 12 dived. </joey>
<joey> - Into it. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Just picked one up </joey>
<joey> and well you can pick them up by the head. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. No.
- He picked it up by. </joey>
<joey> - The 10. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. That's probably
immediately started crying </joey>
<joey> and screaming and. </joey>
<joey> Oh. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There was, I remember
there was loads of them. </joey>
<connor> I remember I got really freaked out. </connor>
<connor> Cause I was </connor>
<connor> what the is that? </connor>
<connor> This is not how they were in finding Nemo. </connor>
<connor> That's why I remember. </connor>
<connor> I didn't think there was any
fish fighting. The weird fish. </connor>
<connor> - There was, yeah, that was jellyfish </connor>
<joey> and find what's weird. </joey>
<joey> - Fish? What fish. </joey>
<joey> - Freaked me out so much
more than animals do </joey>
<connor> - Is fish, not animals. </connor>
<garnt> - No fish, fish or fish right? </garnt>
<garnt> Animals are animals. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jelly, fish isn't an animal. </garnt>
<garnt> I know it's an animal, but what. </garnt>
<connor> - Off? what? </connor>
<connor> The is going on with fish? </connor>
<joey> - I mean it, another brain and doesn't. </joey>
<connor> - Have jellyfish is just God's spunk. </connor>
<connor> That's just what it, they are it. </connor>
<garnt> - Fights back. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean that's the closest way. </garnt>
<joey> I, the ocean sperm cell. </joey>
<garnt> - It is the ocean sperm cell. </garnt>
<garnt> - You look at that Mr. </garnt>
<connor> Incredible meme where he is smiling </connor>
<connor> and GRE you getting more sad. </connor>
<connor> It's you look at dogs. </connor>
<joey> You're yes. And then you get outta horses. </joey>
<joey> You're yes. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Then you get so rats. </joey>
<joey> You're okay. </joey>
<joey> And then you start
getting these weird fish. </joey>
<connor> Then you're what the geeky fish. </connor>
<connor> Then you start getting </connor>
<connor> to the real weird fish
ones are all no eyes </connor>
<connor> and just all teeth. </connor>
<connor> And you what the is I putting down there? </connor>
<connor> It's like some creature. </connor>
<connor> - It is legit. </connor>
<connor> The what's going on with fish. </connor>
<joey> - What's going on? </joey>
<joey> - What, who's what is an episode of Feld? </joey>
<joey> Who's in charge. </joey>
<garnt> What is that with fish? </garnt>
<garnt> - Who's in charge the
evolution down there. </garnt>
<connor> It's out of control. </connor>
<connor> - You guys heard about
the immortal jellyfish. </connor>
<joey> - No, I listening. </joey>
<joey> So there is a species of jelly fish </joey>
<joey> that scientists believe are immortal </joey>
<joey> they cannot be killed by time by old age. </joey>
<joey> So obviously they can still
be cured by external forces, </joey>
<joey> meat and whatever. </joey>
<joey> - But that's brilliant. </joey>
<joey> But it's believed by scientists </joey>
<joey> that they are in a sense. </joey>
<joey> Immortal okay and that
scares the outta me. </joey>
<joey> That's just because
nothing should be immortal </joey>
<joey> nothing alive should be </joey>
<joey> immortal that's just a survivor
stand from past season. </joey>
<connor> - Oh they just have no age. </connor>
<joey> That is literally just the stand. </joey>
<connor> Can't die. </connor>
<connor> - Apparently they reckon
that aging is process it </connor>
<garnt> cells and stuff. </garnt>
<connor> It's on purpose. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not bullshitting right, Ashley? </connor>
<garnt> There isn't something
called immortal jellyfish. </garnt>
<joey> - Apparently it just
regresses into a pollen form </joey>
<joey> and then it go comes back against. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. So it's literally
just a single cell, </joey>
<joey> organism kind of deal where it's just </joey>
<joey> forever just recreating itself basically. </joey>
<joey> - So a car accident. </joey>
<joey> Just turn back into a
baby and group back old. </joey>
<joey> - Again, that's a Benjamin button. </joey>
<garnt> - Stadium that is actually
just a superpower. </garnt>
<garnt> That's pretty. </garnt>
<garnt> That's cool dude. </garnt>
<garnt> But could you imagine though, </garnt>
<connor> if humans were able to
somehow study that enough. </connor>
<connor> And be we're. </connor>
<joey> - Trying, I think. </joey>
<joey> - And being all right, </joey>
<joey> this might actually be
the key to immortality. </joey>
<connor> - What's the point of being
immortal if you get to 60 </connor>
<connor> and you're useless at 60 </connor>
<connor> and you're what are you gonna
do for another 100 years? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, that's why they come
progress in age as well. </garnt>
<connor> Cause they just Get to
a point where they're </connor>
<joey> I can't do sports anymore. </joey>
<connor> Time to go back. </connor>
<connor> - Let's just say we can keep you alive. </connor>
<connor> Till 200 but after 50 you start </connor>
<joey> you start degrading </joey>
<joey> and then 70 you're kind of useless, </joey>
<connor> Well I'm saying, </connor>
<connor> I'm not saying all people
are useless by the way, </connor>
<joey> but you personally can't do what you want. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> Is the point of you
being another 130 years </joey>
<joey> now the 100 years? </joey>
<joey> what's are you gonna do? </joey>
<connor> Just catch up with the
rest of Game of Thrones. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I remember, </joey>
<connor> in future drama episodes. </connor>
<connor> when they have all those old
celebrities from centuries </connor>
<connor> that go just as heads in Europe. </connor>
<joey> And I remember one of
my friends was oh man, </joey>
<joey> it wouldn't it be cool if
we humanity got to that, </joey>
<joey> that point in technology. </joey>
<joey> I'm no, what do you want? </joey>
<joey> That would be horrible. </joey>
<joey> You'd just be sitting on a
shelf for the rest of human. </joey>
<garnt> the rest of yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Time, rest of time. </garnt>
<joey> Rest of time, just doing what? </joey>
<joey> How do you have fun? </joey>
<joey> How'd just, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> You just head in a jar, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll don't know. Perfect. </garnt>
<joey> Beatboxing or something
that's that's all you can do </joey>
<connor> as a head. </connor>
<connor> - Just there's that trick right? </connor>
<connor> With the cherry stem where you can tie up, </connor>
<connor> what else you gonna do? </connor>
<joey> - Wow this perfect a Jojo. </joey>
<connor> - Learn languages, I guess. </connor>
<joey> - For the rest of time, learn
every language in the world. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. Probably or just, or
just watch out, think about it. </garnt>
<garnt> There is a few things you can do </garnt>
<joey> or just watch Pokemon in your mind. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> The ultimate life back. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, what are you doing? </garnt>
<joey> I'm just watching the
6,003 run of Pokemon. </joey>
<garnt> I guess it's a really
philosophical question of if you </garnt>
<garnt> could be immortal would
you want to be immortal </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't want to be
maybe I wouldn't want to </joey>
<joey> die at say 80 or 90 or whatever, </joey>
<joey> but there's a point where
I would my body to keep up. </joey>
<garnt> - With what I want to
do. Right. Okay. Well on. </garnt>
<joey> - Well then different question. </joey>
<joey> How old, if you could choose, </joey>
<joey> how old would you want to be when you die? </joey>
<joey> - I, to me, it depends
on how functional I am. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. Cause I, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I've met 90 years old, </connor>
<joey> 90 year olds who are
still in tip top shape. </joey>
<joey> And I've also met, 60 year olds </joey>
<connor> who have trouble doing things that I would </connor>
<connor> want to do do as well.
- My fifties Man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it depends on
how lucky you get rid. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, some of my friends, </garnt>
<connor> they're some of their
dads 55 already getting </connor>
<connor> dementia and stuff. </connor>
<connor> It's scary. I would hate to get there, </connor>
<connor> especially if my kids are young, </connor>
<connor> I don't want them to feel yeah, </connor>
<joey> they gotta help me out. </joey>
<joey> - I think the cool dancer was my granddad, </joey>
<joey> apparently in his twenties, , </joey>
<joey> from his twenties, he was like </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna die at age 80. </joey>
<joey> Just no cap. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna die at age 80. </joey>
<joey> And for the longest time I was </joey>
<connor> why would you say that from a young age? </connor>
<connor> And he's because it gives me a time limit </connor>
<connor> to do all the things I want </connor>
<connor> to do before I die. </connor>
<connor> And so it's self the motivating. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And this is how much of
a Chad, my granddad was. </connor>
<joey> He died exactly at a 80. </joey>
<connor> And he was literally I'm, </connor>
<connor> I'm good, man. </connor>
<connor> - I'm good to go. </connor>
<connor> I allowed ask how. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you died from lung cancer but. </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna say that this man, well, </connor>
<connor> how did it go there? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, the thing is though, I think. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds did everything
in one of the, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - He was literally on
his 80th birthday, he was </joey>
<joey> I can go now with no regrets. </joey>
<connor> - Just waiting for the clock to. </connor>
<joey> - Ready to pull, ready to pull the plug. </joey>
<joey> - So but I thought that was so cool. </joey>
<connor> Because there's that
very common philosophy of </connor>
<connor> if you became immortal
you would do nothing </connor>
<garnt> because you'd have no rush.
- You'd have no drive to. </garnt>
<connor> - You have no drive to do
the things you wanna do. </connor>
<joey> Because you can do it whenever you want. </joey>
<joey> So I, yeah. </joey>
<connor> that's my reasoning for
why I wouldn't wanna be. </connor>
<connor> Immortal also I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna see everyone around me die. </connor>
<joey> That should be so funny. </joey>
<garnt> Well, if you live in a
society where everyone can </garnt>
<garnt> choose how, when they. </garnt>
<joey> - So if we were living
in an immortal society, </joey>
<joey> is that what. </joey>
<garnt> - You're saying in society? </garnt>
<garnt> We if we lived in a society. </garnt>
<joey> - Then I think we just
regress to the stone age </joey>
<garnt> at that point. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause no one would wanna do anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean for me, personally, </garnt>
<garnt> I find the badass people
are the people who live </garnt>
<joey> till the late, their late ages </joey>
<joey> and they they seem fit. </joey>
<joey> They seem able, </joey>
<joey> and then one day they just
decide to their body just </joey>
<joey> decides all right, peace out. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. that's the way I would want to go. </joey>
<connor> I don't want the 10. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think everyone wants to go that. </garnt>
<joey> But life is brutal. </joey>
<joey> - It is I think it's the teal Osama, </joey>
<joey> the guy who basically popularized manga, </joey>
<joey> he died while drawing
manga in the hospital then. </joey>
<joey> And I'm that's so badass. </joey>
<joey> The fact that this man, </joey>
<joey> literally till the
moment he died was doing </joey>
<connor> what he wanted to do. </connor>
<connor> - God's gonna be doing that final 10 pole. </connor>
<joey> - I need one more. </joey>
<connor> Just he gets 10 SRSS and he's Connor's. </connor>
<garnt> - Gonna be on jump king 20. </garnt>
<joey> - On the final jump. </joey>
<connor> - It gets to the top credits. </connor>
<garnt> - No, but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause my grandma right
now is still alive. </garnt>
<garnt> And she's in her late nineties right now. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember when I
introduced her to Sydney </connor>
<connor> for the first time </connor>
<connor> and I remember I was telling Sydney, oh, </connor>
<connor> she's in the nineties. </connor>
<connor> - I think you've
definitely told this story. </connor>
<connor> - If I told this Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> I think you have okay. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I don't know, have I. </connor>
<joey> - I don't unfortunate Do a cliff notes. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. So yeah. </joey>
<joey> My grandma squeezed took
Sydney's hand and squeezed it. </joey>
<joey> She squeezed it so hard
that Sydney was rith in pain </joey>
<garnt> for a good hour. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause of how hard she squeezed it Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah that was a cliff
notes with the story. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I think maybe I have
told this on Trash Taste. </garnt>
<joey> - So basically your
grandma's a gig get shot. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you not heard the story? </garnt>
<joey> I think so. </joey>
<joey> - Seem familiar, I can't see. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you can't tell </joey>
<connor> if I've told you this
at a bar or something, </connor>
<connor> I've on the podcast. </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately we talk a lot. </connor>
<garnt> Unfortunately we do talk a lot. </garnt>
<joey> - I saw a recent comment on
one of the Trash Taste episodes </joey>
<joey> being it's so impressive. </joey>
<joey> How the boys still to find topics that </joey>
<joey> they've never talked. I don't. </joey>
<garnt> - Even know I'm yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I don't even know. </joey>
<joey> - I just talk. </joey>
<connor> And sometimes we get caught out for it. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - It's whatever. </garnt>
<connor> - Definitely been talking
about up fish in the ocean. </connor>
<joey> I know that. Have we? </joey>
<joey> No, we haven't. </joey>
<joey> - Oh we haven't. No haven't. </joey>
<connor> - There's so many up little fishes. </connor>
<garnt> - What's the animal that
scares you the most. </garnt>
<connor> - Man. No, Jerry mars. </connor>
<joey> - I think, those tea lists of animals </joey>
<joey> that I could take in a fight.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> I just think a deer would just me up. </joey>
<joey> - I mean they could. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I think I'd have more chance
of being able to outwit a </connor>
<connor> bear or something or being able to. </connor>
<connor> - Know about that. </connor>
<connor> - I would rather take on the deer than </connor>
<garnt> the bear much. </garnt>
<connor> What's not deer's the one with the ma. </connor>
<joey> - Barky has taught me anything
don't fuck with bears. </joey>
<connor> - Which are the ones
with the massives there, </connor>
<joey> the deers they all deers. </joey>
<joey> - Deer moose I don't know.
- I know, maybe moose, </joey>
<connor> but there's some of them
caribou I've seen some of </connor>
<connor> them that are insane. </connor>
<connor> They well, I mean, moose are insane. </connor>
<joey> how big, people imagine moose and they're </joey>
<joey> oh yeah that's just a big deal. </joey>
<joey> Right, I'm no, they're. </joey>
<joey> They're huge Insanely huge it's scary. </joey>
<connor> - I even though I think I
there's a 0.1% chance that I </connor>
<connor> could live with a bad encounter. </connor>
<connor> I at least think that Ia idea. </connor>
<connor> I'd have zero if it wanted to kill me, </connor>
<joey> I feel it would just. </joey>
<joey> - Chase what. </joey>
<connor> - What logic are. </connor>
<joey> - You this? </joey>
<joey> - The way it looks. </joey>
<connor> Are you the way it looks at me? </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - I'll be talking. </joey>
<joey> - You're talking about
the deer from princess Mo. </joey>
<joey> - Okay they gotta look
in their eyes dears. </joey>
<joey> They gotta look in their eye
that says I'm out for blood </joey>
<connor> and I'm not gonna be happy. </connor>
<garnt> - What you talking about? </garnt>
<joey> Deer's the cutest. </joey>
<joey> All the times. Have you never been in a, </joey>
<connor> You can feed the deers. </connor>
<joey> - They're no, </joey>
<connor> Those are wimp, deers. </connor>
<connor> Chad. Chad deers. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen those deer? </connor>
<connor> Is when they're wrestling
each other formating purposes. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Do they let's just say
if one of these deers </joey>
<connor> thought I was gonna
steal its GF, I'm done. </connor>
<connor> it's I'm dead. </connor>
<joey> - Think you can say that
about most animals though. </joey>
<garnt> if you were if you tried
to steal a,(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> If you wanna go to a frat party, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure you'd feel the same
way this guy's gonna me up. </joey>
<garnt> - I remember there's there's stories. </garnt>
<garnt> - What logic are you? </garnt>
<connor> This there's absolutly zero logic. </connor>
<connor> Just the way it looks. </connor>
<connor> - So are you saying that you
can't take on a male deer, </connor>
<joey> but you could take on say a male elephant </joey>
<connor> Or a male giraffe. </connor>
<joey> - What would we say? </joey>
<joey> Take on an elephant. </joey>
<joey> Are you saying beating it? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, you were
saying tear a list of animals. </joey>
<connor> I could beat in a fight, right? </connor>
<joey> - Let in the fight or survive. </joey>
<joey> I reckon I could get away maybe. </joey>
<garnt> - For a bear. </garnt>
<garnt> And let's say you're a cave man. </garnt>
<connor> And you need to take on one
of these animals, survive. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm trying to kill it. </garnt>
<garnt> Am I trying to run away? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're trying to survive. </garnt>
<garnt> - I, yeah. Okay. I
think, I don't know why. </garnt>
<connor> I just fell a deer could
chase me to the end. </connor>
<connor> The, I fell a bear might get most. </connor>
<connor> - Animals. No, a bear will
get bored after a while, </connor>
<joey> it'll get bored. </joey>
<connor> I feel a deer clearly. </connor>
<joey> - Never encountered a bear in his life. </joey>
<connor> - Let's say I climb a 20 foot tree. </connor>
<connor> I know bears and climb trees, </connor>
<connor> but I reckon the deer
somehow would just jump up. </connor>
<connor> me up Naruto style something. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> I'm just scared of these deers, man. </connor>
<garnt> These big deers that are tigers liars. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you have a. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't even I'll take a tiger wrong. </connor>
<joey> - Did you have a childhood
trauma grab deer or. </joey>
<garnt> - Is this just the British in you talking? </garnt>
<connor> - Do we even have deers? </connor>
<garnt> - Of course we have deers in England. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you sure about that? </joey>
<joey> Don't look at me. </joey>
<joey> - Do we have deer? </joey>
<joey> No the big deers with the analysts. </joey>
<joey> - What's the difference. </joey>
<joey> - What are the, </joey>
<joey> ones with the horns that are not, </joey>
<connor> they're all kind of spiky. </connor>
<connor> - Are you talking about caribou? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know what
they're called. Regular. </joey>
<connor> - Deal of spike handle. I know. </connor>
<garnt> - Spike handles the ones with weird shape. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm talking about Bambi, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> The ones with no horns aren't scary. </connor>
<connor> Why would they be scary? </connor>
<connor> They have no horns gone. </connor>
<connor> Horns are scary. </connor>
<joey> - But they also do. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not scared of rhinos. </joey>
<joey> - I'd be terrified of a rhino. </joey>
<joey> Are you kidding me? </joey>
<connor> - Just ride it. </connor>
<connor> Don't on country. </connor>
<connor> It I get on the back of a rhino, right? </connor>
<connor> What's it gonna do fall the gram. </connor>
<connor> I'll just jump off it in it. </connor>
<joey> - What about a Ram? </joey>
<connor> - A Ram I've been with a Ram. </connor>
<connor> I befriended the Rams. We will. </connor>
<joey> - So you don't find Rams scary? </joey>
<connor> - No they just kinda little Ram. </connor>
<garnt> They just kinda drama Queens. </garnt>
<garnt> You can talk to them. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can talk. </garnt>
<connor> You can't, you can't really can't. </connor>
<connor> - Can't with the deer these one? </connor>
<joey> - This just regular whitetail gear. </joey>
<connor> It's just a deer, right? </connor>
<connor> - Those would you up. </connor>
<connor> It's just a male. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously you pale bro. </connor>
<connor> You'll be in the tree that. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not get up the not
saying they won't you up, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'd rather take on that than a bear. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why as well, because when
you see you think it's cute, </garnt>
<garnt> right? You think, oh, it's cute. </garnt>
<connor> And then it stabs you. Right? </connor>
<connor> A bear you're not getting
anywhere near that. </connor>
<connor> You're cautious, right? </connor>
<connor> It's about the perception. </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm not going anywhere near a </connor>
<connor> thing that has horns that. </connor>
<connor> - Well, they taste good though. </connor>
<connor> So I'd understand why you might. </connor>
<connor> - Go near it. </connor>
<connor> So if bears tasted good, would you. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe we'd have to. </connor>
<connor> I fell a, okay. </connor>
<joey> This is, why is a sense of danger? </joey>
<joey> Dictate how good the animal tastes? </joey>
<joey> - Listen, this is one of
those things where it's just </joey>
<joey> it's gonna make me look
stupid, this argument, </joey>
<connor> but it's just pure, gut. </connor>
<connor> this is no logic whatsoever. </connor>
<connor> This is just my gut for. </connor>
<joey> - So wait is dear, T for you STI scary. </joey>
<connor> - STI will you up and
you didn't expect it. </connor>
<connor> Bear is at, cause I know, </connor>
<connor> I know it's gonna me up, </connor>
<garnt> but also it might not. </garnt>
<garnt> It might get bored. It
might just leave me alone. </garnt>
<connor> - What but way are you getting this idea? </connor>
<garnt> That deers are so aggressive? </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen videos, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Videos of bears
being aggressive probably. </connor>
<garnt> - Because some dumb is
provoking a deer, right? </garnt>
<connor> yeah, of course gonna get off. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I just think that bears are, friendly. </connor>
<connor> - Cause my experience with most deers, </connor>
<connor> even ones that is that you goin a 50 again </connor>
<connor> in a 50 meter radius. </connor>
<joey> - Immediately not I am not
trying to make any sense. </joey>
<joey> This is all just gut. </joey>
<garnt> - You're not, you're. </garnt>
<joey> - Not making sense. </joey>
<connor> I know it doesn't I know
this doesn't make any sense. </connor>
<connor> - Why we're trying to glean
some senses out of it, </connor>
<connor> but time guess is scary. </connor>
<connor> But also the tiger king seemed
he had a good hand of it. </connor>
<connor> So maybe. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it is </connor>
<connor> he slapped them with his
stick and theyover him. </connor>
<connor> So maybe if I just give him
a little, get off, stop that. </connor>
<joey> - Stop that was the problem with all </joey>
<joey> the pre that you said
weren't they weren't oh, </joey>
<garnt> I'll use the. </garnt>
<joey> - Slap message. </joey>
<connor> You didn't have a big enough stick. </connor>
<garnt> obviously everyone most dangerous bear. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it the red one? </garnt>
<joey> The red bear is that. </joey>
<joey> - Black grizzly bear. Isn't it? </joey>
<joey> The black one. </joey>
<connor> - Black one. </connor>
<connor> - Polar bears. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Polar bear. </joey>
<joey> - There was story from that. </joey>
<joey> I think Brian blessed, Don Brian blessed. </joey>
<joey> There's a very famous British guy. </joey>
<joey> He's this really famous
British guy who has yes. </joey>
<joey> It's the most booming voice this, right? </joey>
<connor> Yes and apparently he
was in the Arctic filming </connor>
<connor> something and a polar bear came up </connor>
<connor> and I think that he either punched the </connor>
<connor> polar bear in the face or he
screamed at the polar bear </connor>
<connor> and it ran away skit this story. </connor>
<connor> So I'd to think that I could, </connor>
<connor> if it is true that you could
scare a polar bear from </connor>
<connor> shouting at it. </connor>
<joey> I think I'll be. </joey>
<connor> - All right Well, I mean, Bucky has 50. </connor>
<connor> - Bucky has taught me that
the best way to beat a bear is </connor>
<joey> to punch it in the nose. </joey>
<connor> - I heard that you
could punch it in Theon, </connor>
<connor> the grizzly bear point. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Well, if you're
fast enough, right? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, not fast enough. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, at that point. </garnt>
<joey> - You, like it. </joey>
<joey> - You could just, at that point, </joey>
<garnt> you're kind of playing GA with your life. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the same thing with sharks, right? </joey>
<joey> If you punch a shark in the nose, </joey>
<joey> then it'll just be is that. </joey>
<joey> - Is that true? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I would try. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gonna try it, but </joey>
<joey> nature's the wall. </joey>
<joey> - Slows punch the water. </joey>
<joey> - Punch literally giving
them a weak point. </joey>
<garnt> I punch the shark for massive punch it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where are you gonna punch a deer? Huh? </garnt>
<connor> You can't punch it anyway. </connor>
<connor> It's got big spikey things. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel you could </garnt>
<joey> Dodge at the last moment. </joey>
<joey> - You can devil back that. </joey>
<connor> - No, the bear is too big. </connor>
<connor> The bear is too slow. </connor>
<connor> You can Dodge the bear. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, you talking
about bears are fastest. </garnt>
<garnt> What have you. </garnt>
<connor> - Seen the bear? Huh? </connor>
<connor> This is the most dumb
conversation we've ever had back. </connor>
<connor> I'm at the corner. </connor>
<garnt> You're so if you see your bear, </garnt>
<joey> a grizzly bear, you are
not running away from that. </joey>
<joey> - You can't outrun a bear. </joey>
<connor> - But the best tactic is that
you can now run your mates. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe I can shout at it. </connor>
<connor> Ask it kindly to talk it's nah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. Let's have, </connor>
<connor> why don't we ask
survivors of bears, right? </connor>
<connor> What they did to survive the bear. </connor>
<connor> - I'd like to ask how
many bears survivors do </connor>
<connor> There's gotta be a few out there. </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure there. </joey>
<connor> - Survivor dear survivors. </connor>
<connor> There are zero. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because no one talks about it. </joey>
<garnt> Cause everyone becomes dear. </garnt>
<connor> Cause they know if they talk, </connor>
<joey> The deer's gonna come back for some. </joey>
<joey> - The deer comes back with his family. </joey>
<joey> - You'd Beni, you'd be snitching. </joey>
<joey> - Talking up it's how many
horror movies are there </joey>
<garnt> with deers as the main monster. </garnt>
<connor> - People are too scared to
talk about deers open the next, </connor>
<garnt> when's the next deer coming
out in the Godzilla trilogy </garnt>
<joey> or whatever, man. </joey>
<joey> - DI's also dear king Kong converse, </joey>
<joey> king Kong and Godzilla versus deer. </joey>
<joey> They need to tag team the
ultimate monster deer, man. </joey>
<connor> It can go run super fast launch
itself in with those hooks. </connor>
<connor> you're done Gigi. </connor>
<connor> - So would you say the deer
is the most powerful animal? </connor>
<joey> - It is the most powerful animal. </joey>
<joey> - Spiritually. </joey>
<joey> - If we were to animal battle Royal, </joey>
<joey> would you pick deer? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Who would you pick for an animal battle? </joey>
<joey> Royal animal kingdom. Battle royal. </joey>
<joey> I'm definitely polar bear for. </joey>
<connor> - Sure. I feel you are
going for low hanging crew. </connor>
<joey> I feel there's probably
something stronger. </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm trying to win. </connor>
<connor> - I feel there's probably better animals. </connor>
<connor> I maybe if you asked TSSU guy I'm Boris. </connor>
<connor> I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, the only reason
I say this is because </connor>
<connor> I literally saw a video where a polar bear </connor>
<connor> tried was starving. </connor>
<connor> Had to eaten for a while. </connor>
<connor> So he was trying to hunt
and he comes across these, </connor>
<connor> this group of wares. </connor>
<joey> I dunno what the proper word is. </joey>
<joey> The a herd Ori Sai. </joey>
<joey> And he literally tried
totried to take a bite out </joey>
<joey> of any wars. </joey>
<joey> And the hides were so thick that he, that </joey>
<joey> he couldn't grab on. </joey>
<garnt> And the wars just shook him off. </garnt>
<garnt> And he tried with several war wars </garnt>
<connor> and he just failed. </connor>
<garnt> So maybe it's wars that are at
the top of the figure chain. </garnt>
<garnt> And we just never thought about. </garnt>
<connor> - The honey badger. </connor>
<joey> That one's a scary one that one's like a, </joey>
<joey> I think the polar bear would
destroy the honey badger. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, man, honey. </connor>
<connor> - I mean human versus honey badger. </connor>
<connor> The honey badger is probably gonna win. </connor>
<connor> - But cause I don't wanna
with a honey badger. </connor>
<connor> - What is a honey badger? </connor>
<connor> - It's a Badger that eats honey. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - No it's. </joey>
<joey> - Yes it is primarily honey. </joey>
<joey> I thought it it yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because isn't the whole, that crazy. </connor>
<connor> Isn't the whole thing of
it with a honey badger. </connor>
<joey> Is that its height is
so thick that a beasting </joey>
<connor> literally can't penetrate it. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno. That's why
they're so that crazy. </connor>
<joey> - I remember I read something. </joey>
<connor> - About man shrimp, Manti shrimp. </connor>
<joey> - I know Manti. </joey>
<joey> - About it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. My God that. </joey>
<garnt> That's what nature's cool. </garnt>
<connor> - See fish, it's always fish. </connor>
<joey> what's going on? </joey>
<joey> - Man, shrimp is the bulky of the sea. </joey>
<joey> - Why does this fish
have a cannon for an arm? </joey>
<joey> what's going on with that? </joey>
<connor> - So it's not big. </connor>
<joey> I'm just gonna throw a fist
and create a Sonic. Boom. </joey>
<joey> - What happened with evolution? </joey>
<connor> What's go I'm telling you
man evolution in the sea is. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what's going on. </joey>
<joey> When is the next stage above that? </joey>
<joey> It's oh I throw a punch
and a nuclear fusion happen </joey>
<joey> With my fist. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, if you
sliced up a Manti strip, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it could possibly create a vacuum. </garnt>
<garnt> That Sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> The air and sucks his opponents in. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what Bucky should
have done instead of imagining </joey>
<joey> a human size praying Manti. </joey>
<joey> He should imagined a
human size Manti shrimp. </joey>
<joey> We had a real challenge. </joey>
<joey> - Human size Manti shirt. </joey>
<joey> Bear's dead one shot oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> It's gonna be the one punch man. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> Why we talk to you about this again? </joey>
<joey> - One punch man of the sea. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> One thing that I always there's </joey>
<joey> I think this is YouTube videos </joey>
<connor> where people kind of go
to nature and they're save </connor>
<connor> the animals that are
being hunted or something. </connor>
<connor> I other animals. </connor>
<connor> Right. And then they ask
David borough questions. </connor>
<connor> do you ever feel you should
help the animal that's </connor>
<connor> being hunted and stuff? </connor>
<connor> And he's no, it's literally nature. </connor>
<connor> Why would I interfere? </connor>
<connor> Don't understand why people
always make these videos being </connor>
<connor> today we're gonna save
the fish from being eaten. </connor>
<connor> It's that's literally the point fish. </connor>
<garnt> - It's literally called a food chain. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're just sympathetic cause </garnt>
<connor> we're at the top. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly, if we're in the middle of that, </joey>
<garnt> see you dude. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm trying to save my own life now. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think caveman
really worried about </garnt>
<garnt> what nature was doing. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause we were trying our best to survive. </garnt>
<joey> - As well. </joey>
<joey> That's a Seagul being </joey>
<joey> what I'm gonna save these fish today. </joey>
<joey> Cause I feel bad. </joey>
<joey> It's no, they don't give a. </joey>
<joey> They're gonna eat. </joey>

<joey> - You're not number one humans. </joey>
<connor> - We are we've killed everything. </connor>
<connor> We're awful trust. </connor>
<garnt> Not even yourself. </garnt>
<connor> - What's the strongest
animal you genuinely </connor>
<connor> wholeheartedly think you could, </connor>
<connor> beat in a fight. </connor>
<joey> - What define beat in a fight. </joey>
<joey> - Face to fish. </joey>
<joey> Because the animal are gonna be </joey>
<joey> oh there's no. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah bring into
submission kind of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> what are we talking about? </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, </joey>
<garnt> - Or run away, the animal runs away. </garnt>
<connor> - Or it, or knock it. </connor>
<garnt> - Out's a fight of fight to the death. </garnt>
<connor> - Fight for some reason you're. </connor>
<garnt> - In a ring. </garnt>
<connor> Are we allow tools? </connor>
<connor> - No, just your bare. </connor>
<connor> - Just your bare fist. </connor>
<connor> And whatever's laying around on. </connor>
<connor> - The ground. All right. </connor>
<garnt> I got it. </garnt>
<garnt> Realistically dog human. </garnt>
<connor> Why are you. </connor>
<connor> - Fighting a dog chair? </connor>
<connor> - Human or human? </connor>
<connor> - So's dog leader STRs. </connor>
<joey> - Not that I would. </joey>
<joey> - No a big if we're not counting humans, </joey>
<joey> a big dog is probably the max I can go. </joey>
<joey> Cause even then it's scary. </joey>
<connor> - A big dog would beat you up. </connor>
<joey> - Actually I mean a big dog. </joey>
<garnt> - Really big dog. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. It could really hurt me. </joey>
<connor> - Stick on a Wolf. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it'll be hard, </connor>
<connor> but I feel if you are fighting to. </connor>
<connor> - The movie, for sure. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I feel you could take on a Wolf. </connor>
<connor> Not it's not a guaranteed win. </connor>
<connor> But that's on the edge of
what I imagine if I was </connor>
<garnt> fighting for my life is. </garnt>
<joey> - Is 100% success rate. </joey>
<joey> No, but could I possibly get
a WARF into a choke hold or </joey>
<joey> something go UFC on his then </joey>
<joey> maybe if I had the right techniques, </joey>
<joey> all I'm saying human war
versus war in the Oxycon </joey>
<joey> I'm just </joey>
<joey> learn some BJJ, learn some B Jay, </joey>
<joey> maybe you might have a
more fighting chance. </joey>
<connor> - I think your dad got. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I think your dead. </joey>
<joey> - Cause how small do you think a Wolf is? </joey>
<connor> It's pretty big. </connor>
<connor> - You could take on a sheep. </connor>
<joey> Maybe you're gonna beat up a sheep. </joey>
<joey> - Beat up a sheep. </joey>
<connor> Not that I would want to. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think the
sheep would even fight. </connor>
<connor> No I think she would just be just take me, </connor>
<garnt> Just take me away right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - What about you con what about you? </garnt>
<garnt> - What is the absolute
max that you would think </garnt>
<connor> okay, I could survive this. </connor>
<connor> - Catfish could take a catfish. </connor>
<connor> - A cat up. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, No. </connor>
<connor> - The actually big one. </connor>
<connor> I've seen videos, </connor>
<joey> people getting knocked out by catfish. </joey>
<connor> They jump out of the boat. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know. </connor>
<joey> I never really think at it. </joey>
<joey> I don't think about this either. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe a very, there's some tiny monkeys, </joey>
<joey> very small monkey. </joey>
<joey> Very small monkey. </joey>
<joey> Maybe they probably gimme a good fight. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Definitely. </joey>
<joey> It'd be three rounds at least of. </joey>
<joey> - Course con says monkey. </joey>
<joey> - It'd be monkey versus monkey. </joey>
<connor> - Wouldn't it? </connor>
<joey> - Of course some of the
weaker gene of monkeys. </joey>
<joey> - On the weaker ones, </joey>
<joey> - Species of monkeys. </joey>
<joey> - Could you take on a Chimp? </joey>
<connor> - Nerve chimps, chip. </connor>
<connor> Well chip or murdery. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. Why are birds so sassy? </garnt>
<joey> - What do you mean by sassy? </joey>
<garnt> - They just have attitude. </garnt>
<garnt> What so many I've seen, they. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fly I mean, come on. </garnt>
<joey> - I would be SASY to, if I would. </joey>
<joey> - Be an, if. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally looking
down at you. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> It's, but it's </garnt>
<garnt> you the birds are prey. </garnt>
<garnt> Aren't the sassy ones. </garnt>
<joey> It's the domesticated, the
small, the small, the bird. </joey>
<joey> - The parrots, right? </joey>
<joey> - The parrots it's powers
are sass as my God. </joey>
<joey> Well, so they freak me the cow. </joey>
<joey> Cause their voices. </joey>
<garnt> How do they do such an
accurate representation </garnt>
<garnt> of pretty much every sound. </garnt>
<connor> - Our family used to own a
couple of different species of </connor>
<connor> a cockatiel anda Laura KES and stuff that. </connor>
<joey> And yeah. Sorry. </joey>
<connor> Something Keer recommended yesterday. </connor>
<connor> That was par was key. </connor>
<connor> Witness it murder trial as woman </connor>
<connor> is convicted of killing husband. </connor>
<connor> - There's 11 Million views. </connor>
<joey> - Well, what is the Paris? </joey>
<joey> Just she did it. </joey>
<joey> - Talking to par helped finger a killer. </joey>
<joey> - You heard right. </joey>
<connor> - Over five year old. </connor>
<joey> Mark Durham. </joey>
<joey> - Was found shot to death at his home. </joey>
<joey> - That's crazy.
His wife was also found. </joey>
<joey> - Shirt with a gunshot with this. </joey>
<connor> Par was they were both victims. </connor>
<joey> I mean, that's pretty cool. </joey>
<joey> I mean yeah cuzmy, </joey>
<joey> my parrot used to replicate sounds </joey>
<joey> that we would teach him. </joey>
<joey> But he would also just pick
up sounds through osmosis. </joey>
<garnt> I've told this story how smash? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you haven't told this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. So we used to own this te, </garnt>
<connor> which is do what a Cockatiel is? </connor>
<garnt> So it's sassy as. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, sassy mother. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, cause they're parrots. </garnt>
<garnt> Sothey replicate a lot of things. </garnt>
<garnt> Sowe taught it to whistle </garnt>
<garnt> the Adams family theme song. </garnt>
<garnt> So every, we'd wake up in the morning </garnt>
<connor> and it'd just be, </connor>
<connor> whistling the Adams fan and everyone was </connor>
<connor> oh that's so cute. </connor>
<connor> But then other times the sassiness </connor>
<connor> would pull through on </connor>
<connor> this and he would replicate Sam on that. </connor>
<connor> Confused the out of us. </connor>
<connor> So he perfected the
sound of the microwave. </connor>
<connor> Not just he would replicate
the buttons, presses perfectly. </connor>
<connor> So he'd be beep beep </connor>
<connor> - Beep but then </connor>
<connor> when it's finished and it goes beep. </connor>
<connor> - Beep it would replicate that perfectly. </connor>
<connor> So many times. </connor>
<connor> I'd be in the living room
and I would hear that </connor>
<connor> and I would walk into the living into </connor>
<connor> the kitchen thinking that </connor>
<connor> someone was there. </connor>
<connor> No one's there. I'm oh
my God, it's a ghost. </connor>
<connor> And then I realized it's
my it's my sassy bird. </connor>
<connor> And also it would
replicate the phone ringing </connor>
<connor> and show that. </connor>
<connor> - They're really smart. </connor>
<connor> And it would also replicate
my mom saying good morning. </connor>
<connor> So it'd be it'd just be </connor>
<joey> - I'd love it to go. Yeah. Can. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's what I should have taught it. </joey>
<joey> If I ever get another
Laura kid, I'm gonna, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna teach it to go. </joey>
<joey> Just to see how well it
could replicate that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - I remember there's some
YouTube video where people </connor>
<connor> mix it badly and they put
beeps in it for some reason. </connor>
<connor> And when I'm in the other
room and It he videos playing </connor>
<connor> and I hear a beep, </connor>
<connor> I'm what's happening in my kitchen. </connor>
<connor> What's I hate people who
do use beeps really loud </connor>
<connor> beeps in their YouTube video. </connor>
<connor> Just shouldn't do it. </connor>
<garnt> - I dunno I was gonna, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought you were gonna go a
different direction with that </garnt>
<joey> conversation cause I was
gonna talk about base boosted, </joey>
<joey> monster zinc memes. </joey>
<joey> - How are you going to transition to that? </joey>
<joey> - I wanna hear how this. </joey>
<joey> - Happened because you were
talking about people putting </joey>
<joey> sounds in YouTube videos and stuff that. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just yeah, I get it. </joey>
<joey> Ion a tangent. </joey>
<joey> I still think the funniest thing, </joey>
<joey> one of the funniest videos
is just people who take the </joey>
<joey> bass boosted monster zinc theme. </joey>
<joey> - You love. </joey>
<joey> - It and throw it into
someone sleeping or something </joey>
<joey> to me that is just peak comedy. </joey>
<joey> I dunno. I just wanted to </joey>
<joey> bring back the monster
zinc bass boosted memes </joey>
<joey> thats all I literally. </joey>
<connor> - Had nothing to do with the conversation. </connor>
<garnt> And I was playing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your mind is just here about
bass music, monster thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was playing fived chess, </garnt>
<garnt> trying tolerate these two things. </garnt>
<garnt> - You were playing fived chess. </garnt>
<garnt> We were playing checkers over here. </garnt>
<garnt> So not even the same game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyway enough about animals. </garnt>
<garnt> What have you guys been
up to in the past week? </garnt>
<connor> - I built a PC and it didn't work. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah I saw you a
Twitter thread on that. </joey>
<joey> That was pretty sad. </joey>
<joey> - So what happened with that? </joey>
<joey> - So I was building it live, </joey>
<joey> which was more stressful than less time, </joey>
<connor> I think less time because we, </connor>
<connor> did it three times rip Gar he went first. </connor>
<connor> Joey went first. </connor>
<garnt> - I went first. </garnt>
<garnt> So doing it live was really
annoying cause I was actually </garnt>
<garnt> reading chat when I just
shouldn't have read chat. </garnt>
<connor> Because chat kept saying yes or no. </connor>
<connor> I'd be is this the right thing to do? </connor>
<garnt> Half says yes. </garnt>
<garnt> Half says no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well shouldn't you
already know you've built. </garnt>
<joey> - It used to be the PC master, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah you've already
built a PC live one camera. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I pretty just done it, </connor>
<connor> but I just kept getting confused </connor>
<connor> and then when I get confused, </connor>
<connor> I get nervous. </connor>
<joey> Cause I'm live and I'm what
if I do something wrong? </joey>
<joey> And then everyone sees that I did wrong. </joey>
<joey> Cause people are laughing. </joey>
<joey> So I wasn't. </joey>
<connor> - That the whole point. </connor>
<joey> - On, but I wasn't really worried </joey>
<joey> when it was my turn doing it </joey>
<garnt> live cause I'd already
seen two people build it. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was really easy. </garnt>
<connor> Right.
- Last she'd been more stress. </connor>
<connor> There was a speed run as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And but it was okay. </connor>
<garnt> It was okay. </garnt>
<connor> I still some things up. </connor>
<connor> I had the MDOT two. I
had trouble with a guy. </connor>
<joey> - That MDOT two man. </joey>
<connor> - You flock with that. </connor>
<joey> I built this whole thing. </joey>
<joey> I spent five hours doing it cause I, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I up and was wasting a lot of time </joey>
<joey> and doing much of other </joey>
<joey> stuff and I was preoccupied. </joey>
<connor> So I finally built it to
five hours. Eh, turn on. </connor>
<joey> - Did you find out why or why? </joey>
<joey> So it's working now. </joey>
<connor> I have it. </connor>
<joey> So the next day I gave up, </joey>
<joey> it was1:00 AM and I tried to boot it </joey>
<joey> and it wasn't working. </joey>
<joey> And I was all right, fine. </joey>
<joey> I'll give it a go tomorrow. </joey>
<joey> I'll have a clear head. </joey>
<connor> I'll try all the problems. </connor>
<connor> I basically took it all apart
and rebuilt it all again, </connor>
<connor> going very carefully through it all. </connor>
<connor> And the same era kept happening. </connor>
<connor> And I was what? </connor>
<connor> I even took the CPU
out, put it all back in, </connor>
<connor> made sure I did all that. </connor>
<joey> Right, I just could not
figure out what was happening. </joey>
<joey> Cause it wouldn't go to the boot screen. </joey>
<joey> It was just black screen. </joey>
<connor> But everything, everything
was whizzing and </connor>
<connor> glowing and all that. </connor>
<connor> And I was oh. So then
I'm talking to gigabyte </connor>
<connor> and I'm Hey, what's happening? </connor>
<connor> Why isn't it working? </connor>
<connor> Everything is working. </connor>
<joey> Why is happening? </joey>
<joey> - And so essentially, because
I got a new specification, </joey>
<joey> it was a motherboard that is
a DDR five Ram motherboard </joey>
<connor> right now to those who don't
know anything about PCs, </connor>
<connor> basically every now and then </connor>
<connor> they upgrade it and they're Hey, </connor>
<connor> why don't we just change the
connectivity to with everyone? </connor>
<connor> And it does make it faster as well, </connor>
<connor> but they change the specifications. </connor>
<connor> You have to buy specific things. </connor>
<connor> Now this Ram slot that
was called DDR five. </connor>
<connor> I was oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> I'll go on Amazon and buy DDR five Ram. </connor>
<connor> Well, apparently that's not </connor>
<connor> what you're allowed to do with DDR </connor>
<connor> five because it's new. </connor>
<connor> Oh, motherboards have a
set list of specific DDR, </connor>
<connor> five Ram that works with it. </connor>
<connor> So not all Ram. </connor>
<connor> So previously I think DDR four, </connor>
<connor> all Ram basically worked
with all DDR four, </connor>
<connor> I think kind of. </connor>
<connor> I've never mostly, nearly all of it. </connor>
<connor> It was ubiquitous you'd have
to try real hard not to do it. </connor>
<connor> So then I was oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> Is that the issue? </connor>
<connor> It must be. </connor>
<connor> So I ordered this new Ram
plugged it in, worked perfectly. </connor>
<connor> So I wasted two days. </connor>
<connor> I was a hold extra day
trying to fix this thing </connor>
<connor> for no reason. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the thing about
building PCs sucks to me. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm never building. </connor>
<connor> - Another one. To me I feel to me, </connor>
<connor> the hardest to me, </connor>
<joey> the hardest part is actually
selecting the parts. Right. </joey>
<joey> Because building a PC, we said, </joey>
<garnt> it's frustrating, but you can it's, </garnt>
<connor> you can get through it. </connor>
<garnt> It's Lego. </garnt>
<garnt> - PC picker as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you actually to. </garnt>
<connor> - Check for compatibility issues? </connor>
<connor> And it also wasn't compatible. </connor>
<connor> It was yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's all good. </connor>
<connor> So it's all good. </connor>
<garnt> Go ahead. </garnt>
<connor> - Go ahead. </connor>
<connor> You got your, I. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's things that. </connor>
<connor> That scare me cause I
remember the first PC I built, </connor>
<connor> the biggest thing that went
wrong was that I had bought a </connor>
<connor> motherboard that was not
compatible with the CPU because I </connor>
<connor> bought a, I bought an Intel CPU. </connor>
<connor> So I was just okay, </connor>
<connor> this me being a PC building Virgin. </connor>
<connor> I was, I got, I bought the motherboard. </connor>
<connor> I saw it was Intel compatible. </connor>
<connor> Not knowing at the time that </connor>
<garnt> there are different types of </garnt>
<garnt> CPUs and different types of chips. </garnt>
<garnt> - That happened to me as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I had the motherboard as well. </garnt>
<garnt> The cooler doesn't fit, </garnt>
<connor> but I just kind of shoved it in place </connor>
<connor> and it now it's working. </connor>
<joey> - That's that's scary. </joey>
<connor> - It's working. </connor>
<connor> - Was, this the first
PC you built in Japan </connor>
<garnt> or just the first one ever. </garnt>
<connor> - Third in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I built four PCs in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did 20 mine? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, five. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you still somehow
found a way to it up. </garnt>
<connor> - Again I went to PC park
picker and it said it was okay. </connor>
<connor> So I had faith in PC park picker
cause in the previous four </connor>
<connor> times I've never had an issue. </connor>
<connor> But what happened was is that
the cooler they sent me was </connor>
<connor> one that was a bit older. </connor>
<connor> So it didn't include </connor>
<connor> the adapter bracket to Mount the CPU. </connor>
<connor> But this thing had sliders. </connor>
<connor> So I kind of slid them in the middle, </connor>
<connor> which they were, they, </connor>
<connor> you could tell that
things didn't wanna be, </connor>
<connor> and then I screwed it on. </connor>
<connor> But it works it all feels good. </connor>
<connor> It all feels secure. </connor>
<garnt> Did you call Chris? </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't. </connor>
<joey> - Could have done in 15 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Helped you everyone was call Chris. </joey>
<connor> I'm what? </connor>
<connor> So he can tell me how
his McDonald's takes. </connor>
<joey> - Can he talk about his Mac? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's pretty. </connor>
<joey> I sure he did a live stream yesterday </joey>
<connor> and he was just eating McDonald. </connor>
<connor> - I saw that and I was Chris, </connor>
<connor> this is not what I
normally eat for breakfast. </connor>
<connor> And I was what live? </connor>
<connor> Sorry, Chris, have you. </connor>
<connor> - Speaking of breakfast? </connor>
<connor> So since okay as you guys, </connor>
<connor> as you guys know, </connor>
<connor> I've been ona little
bit of a diet recently, </connor>
<garnt> because gained a lot of weight. </garnt>
<garnt> When I went back to England. </garnt>
<joey> - I wouldn't exactly say recently
you've been on a diet for </joey>
<joey> a while now. </joey>
<joey> - Cause here's what happens. Right. </joey>
<joey> I go on a diet fora month, </joey>
<joey> have a week holiday either with the boys, </joey>
<joey> with Sydney pig out a bit
sounds gain on gain a bit </joey>
<joey> more weight so I'm still </joey>
<garnt> I go back to the diet after I'm back. </garnt>
<garnt> It's this sounds </garnt>
<connor> - A healthy lifestyle. </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's a diet. </connor>
<garnt> I think you should eating healthy. </garnt>
<connor> - That's not a diet. </connor>
<joey> - I am eating healthy, </joey>
<joey> but I am definitely taking
in less calories than </joey>
<joey> it would take to maintain weight. </joey>
<joey> So I'm not this isn't a speed run, </joey>
<joey> but it's a slow lose weight gain a </joey>
<joey> little bit back. </joey>
<joey> - It's a slow run. </joey>
<joey> - It's a slow run. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, the reason is when </joey>
<joey> I went back to then literally in </joey>
<joey> September or something, </joey>
<joey> I gained a ton of weight because </joey>
<joey> I ate and I drank every day. </joey>
<joey> And I thin kit was the
first time that I could </joey>
<joey> physically feel my body had gained weight </joey>
<joey> so much that I remember, </joey>
<joey> I saw a few comments
of the before and after </joey>
<joey> Trash Taste recording after </joey>
<joey> I came back Trash Taste recording. </joey>
<joey> I think you can see that. </joey>
<joey> I definitely, I definitely did. </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't say Overweight
or anything close to that, </joey>
<joey> but you could definitely see, </joey>
<joey> I did gain a little bit of weight. </joey>
<joey> So I've been working to,
since that won holiday, </joey>
<joey> working to lose that weight. </joey>
<joey> And now that I'm taking in
lower calories every day, </joey>
<joey> I'm doing things that
I wouldn't normally do, </joey>
<joey> having breakfast because normally I just, </joey>
<joey> normally I, what are. </joey>
<joey> - You off functioning member of society. </joey>
<joey> - Now? I know. </joey>
<joey> Right. I know. </joey>
<joey> Right. I never. </joey>
<joey> - Eat breakfast getting on his
high horse. I eat breakfast. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So because I'm
taking less calories, </joey>
<joey> I've been getting hungry in the mornings. </joey>
<joey> And so I'm oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> Maybe, it's time to start
being a normal person. </joey>
<joey> everyone else in society
and start having breakfast. </joey>
<joey> people people to talk about. </joey>
<joey> - You been enjoying it? </joey>
<joey> - So yeah, cause. </joey>
<joey> - That doesn't sound you're enjoying it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's not so much I'm enjoying </joey>
<joey> it so much as I'm eating </joey>
<joey> because my body craves something
inside my stomach because. </joey>
<joey> - That's usually what hunger is. </joey>
<connor> - That is what hunger is. </connor>
<connor> - I don't get hungry at all when. </connor>
<connor> - I wake out. </connor>
<connor> No I mean, either. </connor>
<joey> - I never used to how
I start having salads </joey>
<garnt> and low calorie meals every day. </garnt>
<joey> And then I started getting
hungry in the morning. </joey>
<joey> It's weird. </joey>
<joey> I only feel hungry in the
morning when I'm on a trip. </joey>
<garnt> But when I'm at home, I don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually no on a trip, </garnt>
<garnt> even on a trip. </garnt>
<garnt> No really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Except if it's McDonald's
breakfast that's the only </garnt>
<connor> breakfast I always got time. </connor>
<connor> - No one of them vacation. </connor>
<garnt> I'm four meals a day sounds. </garnt>
<garnt> - About right. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Let's just eat. </joey>
<connor> Let's should eat. </connor>
<connor> Exactly, why stop? </connor>
<connor> I wake up at7:00 AM in a hotel room. </connor>
<joey> I'm why am I so hungry? </joey>
<joey> That's not normal. </joey>
<garnt> - So me and Sydney have
been starting to eat cereal. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember as I've
added cereal to my diet, </garnt>
<joey> if you've been following my Twitter, </joey>
<garnt> you'd know what I'm about to say. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember eating the cereal one day </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just oh no, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm about to have a food take. </garnt>
<joey> - And brace yourselves. </joey>
<garnt> - I think I'm about to
have an opinion guys. </garnt>
<garnt> And I realize, I think cereal
is better without milk. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh God he said it. </garnt>
<joey> Oh, he said it and. </joey>
<joey> - I'm 50 50 on this. </joey>
<connor> He said it. I like it with and without. </connor>
<garnt> - And I remember just eating one day </garnt>
<joey> and I just said it casually to Sydney. </joey>
<joey> And she looked at me I
just murdered someone. </joey>
<joey> She just dropped the spoon. </joey>
<joey> - She dropped the spoon in the milk. </joey>
<joey> - Is that really that bad of a take? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, apparently it is. </garnt>
<connor> - weer bits in the UK as a kid. </connor>
<connor> I used to just eat those dry. </connor>
<joey> - I think, because. </joey>
<joey> - I can understand that because
when you put that in milk, </joey>
<joey> it just turns into wet cardboard. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But I think it's better without milk. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that that's what angers people's. </garnt>
<connor> - It's my mood, some days I want cause </connor>
<connor> it's a challenge having to
eat cereal without milk. </connor>
<joey> It is, </joey>
<joey> - It's like you're eating Scooby snacks. </joey>
<connor> - Well your dental workout is insane. </connor>
<garnt> - Well I hate it when
you pour the milk in. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the timer starts. </garnt>
<connor> - Just pour less than you
need. Just pour less milk. </connor>
<connor> I just pour less than I need. </connor>
<connor> - How much milk are you putting in? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I'm putting in the
normal amount of milk, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's well clearly or not.
- You're not. </garnt>
<garnt> It's getting wet. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, it's getting soggy. </garnt>
<connor> I hate soggy cereal. </connor>
<connor> - You should put a little
bit in and then mix it, </connor>
<connor> force it through the milk technique. </connor>
<garnt> - But I also think that
waters it down as well. </garnt>
<garnt> You're having cinnamon
crunch or something and then </garnt>
<garnt> you I want the cinnamon crunch. </garnt>
<garnt> I want the crunch and
the cinnamon together. </garnt>
<garnt> But you put the milk in. </garnt>
<garnt> - You wouldn't putting
more milk water down. </garnt>
<garnt> Wouldn't putting more milk water. </garnt>
<garnt> - Out there no that's what I'm saying. </garnt>
<joey> I don't want any milk in
there cause It's the taste of </joey>
<garnt> cereal as it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - But if you just put a little
bit of milk, we just a we. </garnt>
<joey> - Bit it, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It brings out the flavor. </joey>
<joey> - Literally put the bare
minimum milk if I do. </joey>
<connor> And then I just keep rinsing
it through the milk. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's exactly what I did. </connor>
<connor> So that by the time you finish it, </connor>
<joey> you only have a tiny pool of milk. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you think it tastes better
with the milk in it though? </garnt>
<connor> - I just cause most of the
time when it's in no milk, </connor>
<connor> I'm tired by the end of eating. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, not that I, </joey>
<connor> not that I really eat cereal
a lot of cereal anymore, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, every time I do fell a cereal, </connor>
<connor> I just it's it's milk. </connor>
<connor> - I just is cereal that good for you? </connor>
<joey> I just feel cereal is </joey>
<joey> you don't need it that much. </joey>
<joey> - Oh it depends on the cereal. </joey>
<joey> - It depends on the cereal. </joey>
<joey> - A bowl of fruit loops. </joey>
<joey> Isn't gonna be </joey>
<joey> - Brand is pretty good. Right? </joey>
<joey> I brand flakes. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Brand flakes good. </connor>
<connor> But then I bought this brand
flakes in Japan and it had </connor>
<connor> fruit in it. </connor>
<connor> And so I was oh, okay, this sounds nice. </connor>
<connor> It's got dried. </connor>
<connor> I like that. </connor>
<connor> And then I look at the
back of the package, </connor>
<joey> I'm like a normal serving
contains 50 grams of sugar. </joey>
<connor> What are they putting in this. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why I
stopped eating cereal. </connor>
<connor> Not just because I started
to not get hungry in the </connor>
<connor> mornings as I got older. </connor>
<joey> It's so bad for you. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of it is depends. </joey>
<garnt> - The cereal you, it depends
on the cereal that you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Buy. I mean, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I'm sure, if you're
eating a bowl of weetbix, </joey>
<garnt> weetbix, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Then yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously that's got a
lot of, health benefits, </garnt>
<garnt> but also I don't wanna start
my morning with wet cardboard </garnt>
<joey> in my mouth. </joey>
<joey> I just don't wanna start a morning that. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm sorry maybe you
just hate weebix joking. </garnt>
<joey> - I do I hate it. </joey>
<joey> I feel maybe there's just no saving, </joey>
<garnt> even with milk or without milk, </garnt>
<garnt> it just tastes </garnt>
<joey> - To you I'm going to
be so non Australian. </joey>
<joey> When I say this, </joey>
<joey> I hate weetabix. </joey>
<joey> It's it's and people are yeah, just </joey>
<joey> but you can just add sugar or yogurt or </joey>
<connor> other things into it. </connor>
<connor> I then that kind of takes
away from the health benefit. </connor>
<connor> - Just gimme the yogurt. </connor>
<garnt> Just I try. </garnt>
<joey> Just, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll just eat a top of yogurt. </garnt>
<garnt> That's fine see, for me,
cereal has always been, </garnt>
<garnt> even now as I see it's always, </garnt>
<garnt> I've always felt that it
feels like a snack. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause to me people have told
me that they can't get full </garnt>
<joey> having cereal without milk. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just well, to me, </joey>
<joey> I'm not even that hungry in breakfast, </joey>
<joey> to me cereal's just a quick
snack before we get to lunch. </joey>
<garnt> That's your chat in. </garnt>
<connor> - In my lifetime. </connor>
<connor> I think I've eaten more cereal
past 1:00 AM than I actually </connor>
<joey> have in the morning. </joey>
<joey> it is the most perfect midnight snack to. </joey>
<connor> - I really don't like eating
cereal in the evenings. </connor>
<joey> - Well what about later night? </joey>
<joey> As a midnight snack? </joey>
<garnt> - No I always is actually really good. </garnt>
<connor> - At midnight. </connor>
<joey> I wish Id it </joey>
<garnt> cause then I feel that opens
a lot of possibilities to </garnt>
<garnt> my midnight snacking options. </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately I. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dunno well, you snack
at midnight then what? </garnt>
<garnt> What's your go to midnight snack. </garnt>
<garnt> - I try to avoid it. Obviously
it all costs crisps crisp. </garnt>
<connor> - But I mean what wrong
with that? Which one with. </connor>
<joey> - It's just the most British
thing you've ever said. </joey>
<joey> - I love Chris. </joey>
<joey> - I should've seen this one coming up. </joey>
<joey> I was like searching
through the recesses of </joey>
<joey> my mind to think I know Connor. </joey>
<joey> What would he say? </joey>
<joey> And I'm of course it would be.
- Chris. I can love Chris. </joey>
<joey> - You eat that as a meal though? </joey>
<joey> - No sometimes For. </joey>
<connor> - Now seen, I've seen sweet. </connor>
<garnt> I've seen you eat Doritos as a meal. </garnt>
<connor> Don't lie to me. </connor>
<connor> There's no other choice doritos. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, man. </joey>
<connor> There's always a choice that choice. </connor>
<joey> - Doritos I don't feel good about it, </joey>
<connor> but I do it. Why? </connor>
<joey> - They're good but I couldn't, </joey>
<connor> no matter how full I get
from eating just a burritos. </connor>
<connor> I can't in my head. </connor>
<joey> I can't process that as this is my meal. </joey>
<joey> I do it and it doesn't feel a meal, </joey>
<joey> but I'm just so full that it's </joey>
<joey> this will last till morning. </joey>
<joey> So I mean I'm sure it will. </joey>
<joey> - And then in a lot of pain, </joey>
<joey> but it's pretty good. </joey>
<joey> - I've been there. </joey>
<joey> Don't worry I've been there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I'm not a big cereal guy. </joey>
<connor> I've don't eve neat. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you eat it as a kid?
Cause I can't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I used to eat it a lot
as a kid and I don't remember </garnt>
<garnt> the exact point that I
stopped eating cereal. </garnt>
<connor> - I swapped to toast
when I was a kid halfway </connor>
<connor> through school, I must have
decided that I preferred toast. </connor>
<connor> So I'd eat four pieces of toast. </connor>
<joey> - I think I had a very brief period </joey>
<joey> from to toast and then it </joey>
<joey> just very quickly went
from toast to nothing. </joey>
<connor> - But I feel like toast and
cereal are in the same category </connor>
<joey> of not very good nutritional value, </joey>
<joey> but it's not the worst thing in the world. </joey>
<connor> It's not bad, but it's also not great. </connor>
<joey> - Actually the moment I, </joey>
<joey> I actually know the moment
I switched from toast to no </joey>
<joey> breakfast was when I started
having coffees in the morning. </joey>
<connor> - No tea for me tea. </connor>
<connor> Just having a piece of
toast with a hot drink. </connor>
<joey> You can't beat it. Not even
that for me, it was just </joey>
<connor> just replace the toast
with a cup of coffee. </connor>
<connor> - Wait what? </connor>
<connor> - I do that now. </connor>
<connor> - I do that now as well.
But from I'd say for me, </connor>
<joey> maybe 17, 18, I was just yep. </joey>
<joey> Coffee that's all I need. </joey>
<connor> - I Woody toast in Japan, </connor>
<connor> but the bread sucks. </connor>
<connor> And the other place you get
good bread from is bakeries. </connor>
<connor> - And they're stupidly expensive. </connor>
<connor> - It's 50 bucks for a slice of bread. </connor>
<joey> - What irks me about a lot
about the normal Japanese </joey>
<joey> bread that they sell supermarkets. </joey>
<connor> It's just how thick it is. </connor>
<joey> - It's insane. </joey>
<joey> It could barely fit my toaster. </joey>
<connor> - That's true I'm not gonna lie. </connor>
<connor> I think this is gonna make
me sound privileged as. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I don't wanna cut the bread. </connor>
<connor> I wanna just Chuck that in the toaster. </connor>
<connor> I've just woken up. Right? </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna have to get the bread board </connor>
<connor> out the bread knife out. </connor>
<connor> Oh, it's too thick. </connor>
<connor> Oh, I've caught it badly. </connor>
<connor> I just want the perfect slide. </connor>
<connor> This is not a privilege thing. </connor>
<connor> This is just a. </connor>
<garnt> - Absolutely a privilege thing. </garnt>
<joey> - What are you on? </joey>
<joey> - This is why they say the best invention </joey>
<joey> since slice spread. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally a human revolution. </joey>
<connor> Don't you just want to
just, do you really? </connor>
<connor> Do you really. </connor>
<connor> - Want what slice spread
really? That revolutionary. </connor>
<connor> I want that the, well the yeah. </connor>
<joey> I wanna know why I've
never thought about the, </joey>
<garnt> actually the history of that saying it. </garnt>
<connor> - Literally takes 10 seconds. </connor>
<joey> - To, but it's not, </joey>
<connor> it's not the act of cutting it. </connor>
<joey> It's the cleaning up. </joey>
<connor> I have to clean up a
breadboard, a bread knife. </connor>
<connor> Now just for one slice of bread. </connor>
<connor> if I just have the slice bread, </connor>
<connor> I Chuck that in have. </connor>
<joey> - What about if you just buy
the loaf of bread, for example, </joey>
<joey> the unco loaf of bread. </joey>
<joey> No, on that day you
slice it up preemptively. </joey>
<joey> You put it back in the bag
and now you've got sliced. </joey>
<connor> - No you. </connor>
<joey> - Can't do that. </joey>
<joey> That's I did that. </joey>
<joey> - No, that's up. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't really relate. </garnt>
<garnt> - You speed run it going bad. </garnt>
<connor> - No, cause I. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't think
I've ever bought breads. </garnt>
<garnt> That's not been pre sliced now
that I about it in my life. </garnt>
<joey> See, at least wow. </joey>
<joey> Privilege is showing. </joey>
<connor> They call me privilege
for slice of my bread. </connor>
<connor> At least I've done the
legwork I've been there. </connor>
<connor> I've been in the trenches
slice of my own bread. </connor>
<joey> - I've lived that life. </joey>
<joey> - I've lived a life of I've.
- On that now. </joey>
<garnt> - it's aside, baguettes or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> I've never actually sliced my own wow. </joey>
<joey> Loaf of bread. </joey>
<joey> Call me privilege. </joey>
<joey> - Ed it's upper classes, season writing. </joey>
<joey> - This is the opposite of </joey>
<joey> people from England
have never cooked their </joey>
<joey> own rice or something me and Asian. </joey>
<joey> I've never sliced my own bread before. </joey>
<garnt> - So there is a bakery
near me that I really </garnt>
<joey> but the loaf of bread
is six bucks I think. </joey>
<joey> - How big half is standard. </joey>
<connor> - Sizes only that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Okay. </connor>
<connor> Half a standard size. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure it's great. </connor>
<connor> I just don't wanna pay six bucks for half, </connor>
<joey> half my life. </joey>
<connor> - I've had. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Because my, and I have to cut it. </joey>
<joey> - Ron. Oh, me. </joey>
<joey> - For six bucks, </joey>
<joey> I'm not cutting that. </joey>
<connor> That's ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> - For, I mean, I thought that as well, </connor>
<connor> but then at my previous
place we lived right next to </connor>
<connor> this really high end
bakery anda full loaf, </connor>
<connor> this big was nine bucks or something, </connor>
<joey> which is ode, still. </joey>
<garnt> - Still expensive. </garnt>
<connor> And I thought it was just
a scam being oh, just, </connor>
<connor> this is just Japanese people. </connor>
<joey> - People it's this is
just Japanese people. </joey>
<joey> Not knowing good bread. </joey>
<joey> But then and I bought it and I had it and </joey>
<joey> I had to slice it myself. </joey>
<joey> God forbid I had to
slice it myself and yeah. </joey>
<joey> I made toast with it and I'm okay, </joey>
<joey> I can see why this is nine bucks. </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> It was amazing. </connor>
<connor> It was very good brand. </connor>
<connor> But it was not no, amount. </connor>
<joey> I wouldn't pay nine bucks for that. </joey>
<joey> Outside of Japan is what I'm saying. </joey>
<connor> - Why would you pay for inside Japan? </connor>
<joey> - Because every other
bread in Japan sucks. </joey>
<joey> - It's fair enough. And it's
look, don't get me wrong. </joey>
<joey> I'm not buying this every day
for me, this loaf of bread. </joey>
<joey> I would this $9 loaf of bread </joey>
<joey> I would buy was maybe once
every couple of months. </joey>
<garnt> - How good was that? </garnt>
<garnt> In terms of bread in general, </garnt>
<garnt> this $9 bread compared to if you. </garnt>
<joey> - Were, it was good. </joey>
<joey> it was better than any super get bread. </joey>
<connor> I would buy in Australia or anywhere </connor>
<connor> outside of Japan. </connor>
<connor> So it was oh.
- I've had the same bread. </connor>
<connor> Cause I bought it. </connor>
<connor> It was good. </connor>
<connor> It was really, really good. </connor>
<connor> I was okay, this actually tastes here. </connor>
<garnt> This is actually some top tier. </garnt>
<joey> this is some a. </joey>
<garnt> - How does it compare to
say the bread in Europe? </garnt>
<connor> - I think the bread that I had in France </connor>
<garnt> in Germany was better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, yeah </garnt>
<connor> - Obviously that's, </connor>
<garnt> I'm asking how much better was
it than this top tier bread, </garnt>
<garnt> top tier $9 bread that we have brought. </garnt>
<connor> - In the know, marginally, </connor>
<joey> it got to that taste
where it was just good. </joey>
<joey> it was very good. </joey>
<joey> But then that the one in
Germany or France will cost </joey>
<joey> one Euro 50 or two Euro. </joey>
<joey> - Obviously. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's not even, I mean, opposite. </connor>
<connor> So with rice, right? </connor>
<connor> And if you're having rice in Europe, </connor>
<joey> then obviously the one in
Japan's gonna taste better just </joey>
<connor> - cause you know, in
the UK it was what we're </connor>
<connor> pound for Warton? </connor>
<connor> Was it Warton is the toast
bread. I love that toast bread. </connor>
<garnt> - It is very good bread.
Oh that I would know it. </garnt>
<connor> - And even in the UK, right. </connor>
<connor> When you buy. </connor>
<connor> - The animals when you buy the loaf bread </connor>
<connor> at the supermarket, </connor>
<connor> the one that isn't cut, </connor>
<garnt> can you cut it for me? </garnt>
<connor> - I'll put it in. </connor>
<garnt> You can buy uncut bread
at the supermarket. </garnt>
<connor> - We have bakery. </connor>
<connor> We have bakeries. </connor>
<joey> And where bakeries in the supermarkets. </joey>
<joey> - Gone do what a bakeries? </joey>
<joey> - There's a bakery. Right? </joey>
<joey> And then when you get your pastries, </joey>
<garnt> whatever, they all sell loafs of bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ive pastries I've never
seen a loaf of bread. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. They have it. </connor>
<joey> And if you want the loaf of
bread, uncut, you can buy. </joey>
<joey> Who does that? </joey>
<joey> Who ask for that?
- A lot of people do. </joey>
<joey> Cause a lot of people if
they're making their own stuff, </joey>
<joey> then it's not a big deal
that they're cutting it. </joey>
<joey> Cause they want it fresh. </joey>
<joey> Cause the moment you cut it, </joey>
<joey> the time is ticking. </joey>
<connor> It's already going bad, right? </connor>
<connor> That's why you don't want
to cut the whole bread. </connor>
<connor> Then put it back in. </connor>
<connor> Cause then those slices </connor>
<joey> that might have tasted a bit fresher. </joey>
<connor> Two, three days are gonna be rock solid. </connor>
<joey> Did you never put your
bread in the freezer? </joey>
<connor> - What! </connor>
<connor> - No cause that's the way to make bread. </connor>
<connor> Long lasting that's what
we used to in Australia. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure if you cryogenic
it last longer as well. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, this is not. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the did you just say Joey? </garnt>
<connor> - That's an American thing. </connor>
<joey> We don't do that in Europe. </joey>
<joey> - It's up. We do it in Australia as well. </joey>
<joey> - That's up. </joey>
<joey> - We do it in, </joey>
<joey> we do it in south. </joey>
<joey> Gets to preserve. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly. It's the 1000 degrees. </connor>
<garnt> - It's to make the bread last longer. </garnt>
<garnt> That's putting ice in beer. </garnt>
<garnt> You, the you just don't do. </garnt>
<connor> - And You gotta understand the
loaf for bread in the UK and </connor>
<joey> in Europe it's bought on the day intended </joey>
<joey> to all be used on that day. </joey>
<connor> It's not supposed to be, </connor>
<connor> obviously you can have it a day over. </connor>
<joey> That's not a big deal, </joey>
<joey> but you don't freeze the bread's because </joey>
<connor> because the Australian loves the bread. </connor>
<connor> There's 20 slices. </connor>
<joey> So even a family, </joey>
<joey> can't go through it ina day. </joey>
<connor> How big is this bread this, </connor>
<garnt> - But just buy a small. </garnt>
<connor> - This a lover bread's </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no. </connor>
<garnt> It's this big or 20 slices in it. </garnt>
<garnt> So obviously 20. </garnt>
<joey> - Slices does it taste as. </joey>
<connor> - Good I want an image of this. </connor>
<connor> I image exactly. </connor>
<connor> I need an image of Australian bread. </connor>
<joey> - But yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What you, I don't believe this. </joey>
<connor> It's the big foot of
bread. This can't be real. </connor>
<joey> - So just to make the
bread last little bit, </joey>
<connor> little bit longer because you don't wanna </connor>
<connor> have loafs of bread every day. </connor>
<connor> Especially if you're
living in my household, </connor>
<garnt> which was kind of half rice, half bread. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not </garnt>
<connor> This I'm not even the bread guy. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, that's the size of the UK one. </garnt>
<joey> - But they're way thinner. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, they're needier.
- Yeah. But anyway, so yeah. </joey>
<joey> To make the bread last longer, </joey>
<joey> we would use the slices </joey>
<joey> we needed to use on the day we buy it. </joey>
<joey> And then we, </joey>
<joey> it would immediately go to
the freezer because the last, </joey>
<joey> an extra two, three weeks, </joey>
<garnt> and then you just, </garnt>
<joey> and if you wanna a slice </joey>
<joey> and if you wanna a slice
of bread, you grab it. </joey>
<joey> obviously it's frozen because
it's been in the freezer, </joey>
<joey> you throw it into the toaster
instantly defrosted taste. </joey>
<garnt> - Just, I'm not even the bread guy. </garnt>
<garnt> And I would never put myself
down to such savagery as </garnt>
<garnt> putting a bread in the freezer. </garnt>
<joey> - Well I'm sorry you hire privileged. </joey>
<joey> People could buy bread
whenever you wanted. </joey>
<joey> My family was saving money. </joey>
<joey> - Your family had a
financial advisor show. </joey>
<connor> What you talking about? </connor>
<connor> - And our financial advisor
was freeze your bread. </connor>
<joey> - We gotta change somethings around here. </joey>
<joey> - You want, do you want that? </joey>
<joey> Do you want that new apartment? </joey>
<joey> You better freeze your God bread boy. </joey>
<joey> - Asian mentality. </joey>
<joey> - Put everything in the
freezer last longer. </joey>
<connor> Save money, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - No, I think this is. </connor>
<connor> Just your excuses for living like savages. </connor>
<joey> - We're Australian. </joey>
<joey> - If it was something oh, </joey>
<joey> we don't want the spiders to get it. </joey>
<joey> Well that too. </joey>
<connor> No because you get a bread bin. </connor>
<joey> - No, because the bread bin would be </joey>
<garnt> annihilated by the ants. </garnt>
<garnt> What? Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Cause we are in Australia. </joey>
<joey> You can't escape from the wildlife. </joey>
<joey> You leave the door open
for one second too long. </joey>
<joey> Your house is. </joey>
<joey> Over rid by ants in summer. </joey>
<garnt> - The one thing that makes me
not proud to be Thai is one </garnt>
<connor> thing that they do. </connor>
<connor> And I just said it, </connor>
<connor> they put ice in their beer disgusting. </connor>
<connor> And it's, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I see the logic because obviously it's </connor>
<connor> 30, 35 degree weather. </connor>
<connor> Beer's gonna get warm. </connor>
<garnt> Beer's gonna get warm a lot faster. </garnt>
<garnt> But even me, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just no, no ice. </garnt>
<garnt> My beer please. </garnt>
<garnt> No we're not gonna go down. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that an option you
can get at any restaurant. </joey>
<joey> - They normally or is
that a backyard thing? </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> By default in Thailand
in a lot of restaurants, </garnt>
<garnt> especially if it's open air, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You order a beer. </garnt>
<garnt> They take a cartel. </garnt>
<garnt> They give you the beer </garnt>
<garnt> and they give you a glass and they </garnt>
<garnt> put ice in it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they pour the beer
in the glass for the ice. </garnt>
<garnt> And you have you specifically
ask in a lot of places for </garnt>
<garnt> them not to do that. Right. </garnt>
<connor> - It's probably trying to hide the beer. </connor>
<joey> - Is there anything
worse than watered down? </joey>
<garnt> Thai beer water. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nightmare I mean, you see, </garnt>
<joey> you do that with a charm beer </joey>
<joey> and it's just like this beer
was already watered down </joey>
<joey> and you're watering it down even more. </joey>
<joey> - Beer flavored water at that. </joey>
<connor> - Point. Sorry you oven washing this. </connor>
<joey> - German's had a heart
attack listening to that. </joey>
<garnt> the Fu but I've never, </garnt>
<garnt> put bread in the freezer. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll say that we've never
put bread in the freezer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey man, you. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not doing that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not saying you should. </connor>
<connor> I was just saying that's what we did. </connor>
<joey> And I thought it was normal. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you have to put eggs in the fridge? </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember where
I heard it from where </garnt>
<garnt> if you have to put some
things in the fridge or some </garnt>
<connor> things are fine being left. </connor>
<garnt> - It depends on the country
and how it's cleaned. </garnt>
<garnt> I believe in some places in Europe, </garnt>
<garnt> they recommend you not to fridge the eggs. </garnt>
<connor> Can you Google this? </connor>
<connor> If I'm recall correctly, </connor>
<connor> I think we didn't keep
our eggs in the fridge </connor>
<garnt> when I was growing up. </garnt>
<connor> I don't think we did. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think we did either. </garnt>
<connor> - In Japan you're
supposed to keep the eggs </connor>
<connor> in the fridge or I don't think it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you have to, or yeah, </joey>
<joey> you have to keep it in the fridge. </joey>
<joey> - European countries say you do not have. </joey>
<joey> - To keep that's right. </joey>
<joey> That's right really that's right. </joey>
<joey> Cause I don't, we had it in a cupboard. </joey>
<joey> - Really? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Oh, that's weird. </joey>
<joey> And in America I think
they put it in the fridge. </joey>
<joey> I think, I dunno about Japan.
- I don't know. </joey>
<joey> As someone who's was just born of </joey>
<joey> just kind of, </joey>
<joey> every time I went shopping with my mom </joey>
<joey> and we'd buy eggs. </joey>
<joey> The moment she'd open the front door, </joey>
<joey> she'd be like eggs in the fridge now. </joey>
<joey> - Apparently it's illegal to what </joey>
<joey> eggs in Europe so got stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Illegal so you're putting
the fridge actually gonna grow. </joey>
<joey> - Back to your, what? </joey>
<joey> The egg police are gonna
rock up to my door, </joey>
<connor> but you're ah. </connor>
<connor> - Police I think it means for that </connor>
<connor> transporting it and stuff. </connor>
<joey> Not that you go home. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we don't. </connor>
<connor> We kept them in the cupboard. </connor>
<garnt> I remember that. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah bread. We've never
put in the fridge eggs. </connor>
<joey> We've never put in the fridge potatoes. </joey>
<joey> I don't think we've ever. </joey>
<garnt> - No potatoes were in the pantry for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I think if
you put in the fridge, </garnt>
<garnt> it grows sprouts right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Or some thing that. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> I know potatoes. </joey>
<garnt> You're not supposed to put
in the fridge and onions. </garnt>
<garnt> I think. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I feel rules different
with a different country. </garnt>
<garnt> I go to cause in Thailand, </garnt>
<connor> it's just 90% of everything
goes in the fridge. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's so much hotter there. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously it's hot. </connor>
<connor> It goes in the fridge. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah hot and humid is not the best in. </garnt>
<connor> - Well that's the best, </connor>
<connor> best temperature and
conditions for bacteria. </connor>
<joey> So yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - But other things you
shouldn't chocolate, </joey>
<joey> you're not supposed to put in the fridge. </joey>
<garnt> - I know I putting
chocolate in the fridge. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, why do you. </garnt>
<joey> - Why, I think it's </joey>
<joey> because if you put
chocolate in the fridge, </joey>
<joey> then it turns white. </joey>
<connor> And that just means that it's gone bad. </connor>
<connor> - What I've never seen I
chocolate in the fridge. </connor>
<connor> This sounds some I love have
my chocolate hard into yeah. </connor>
<connor> - White stuff is not that
the chocolate done out. </connor>
<joey> It's just some other. </joey>
<joey> - Stuff, what is that? </joey>
<connor> Some other stuff I'm worried. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I always heard chocolate. </connor>
<connor> I always heard you shouldn't
put chocolate in the fridge for </connor>
<joey> too long or you could, </joey>
<joey> you can't let it in the fridge. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Maybe that's just me. </joey>
<joey> - It's either sugar or
fat, but it's not that the. </joey>
<joey> - Chocolates. Oh, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I definitely prefer
my chocolate in the fridge. </garnt>
<garnt> There's two states of chocolate that are </garnt>
<garnt> my favorite one is just
in the fridge it's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> You get a nice, nice crunchy bite of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And the second stage would
where it's a cheaper chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> When it's perfectly room temperature, </garnt>
<garnt> but not melted. </garnt>
<joey> - When you put in your
mouth, it easily melt. </joey>
<garnt> - You put it in your
mouth and it doesn't melt, </garnt>
<connor> but it just dissolves in your mouth. </connor>
<garnt> That's that's my second favorite. </garnt>
<connor> I don't of chocolate. </connor>
<connor> - It's not that. It's it
gets all over your gums. </connor>
<connor> You're when it's, you don't. </connor>
<garnt> - Even need to chew at that point. </garnt>
<joey> You put it, melt. </joey>
<garnt> - Just disintegrate.
- I don't want it to do. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a, don't it sit? </joey>
<joey> - I when it's cold, you can chew into it. </joey>
<connor> And its naps apart and breaks into </connor>
<joey> nice chocolate bites. </joey>
<joey> - I that I don't that too much </joey>
<joey> because I've had some instances </joey>
<joey> where I'm what's gonna break first, </joey>
<joey> the chocolate or my teeth. </joey>
<garnt> I don't wanna find out. </garnt>
<garnt> - There are some chocolates
that are way too hard. </garnt>
<connor> For that there are some, </connor>
<connor> I mean the caramel bars I've
never put in the fridge. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my gosh. </garnt>
<connor> - If you put hard caramel on the fridge, </connor>
<connor> goodbye teeth, your teeth. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just literally
jaw break is just eating. </garnt>
<joey> - Rocks at that point. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. What about ice cream? </joey>
<joey> Do you do you like your ice
cream? hard or soft serve? </joey>
<garnt> Do you like biting into your ice cream? </garnt>
<garnt> Hard yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> lollies, do you </garnt>
<garnt> - That's on ice cream then. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's I guess. </connor>
<joey> - That's an ice block. </joey>
<connor> Your ice cream hard or soft? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, you've had feasts right where it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's an ice cream on, feast where it's </garnt>
<garnt> got a chocolate in the middle </garnt>
<garnt> and it's ice cream around it. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, you mean oh, that's more of a, oh, </connor>
<connor> that's not so much ice cream though. </connor>
<connor> That's more of ice cream bar. </connor>
<connor> I'd say it's more of a cause
it's got a layer around it. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause I know a lot of
people they cannot take. </garnt>
<connor> they cannot chew on hold things or really </connor>
<joey> cool things At all. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. Can you not? </connor>
<garnt> No, I love it too much. </garnt>
<garnt> Where if I start chewing ice. </garnt>
<connor> - I always hear you're </connor>
<connor> you'll be talking to someone you'll hear </connor>
<joey> you just look at it's ground. </joey>
<connor> I'm not guy it's gone. </connor>
<connor> It's God's not even looking. </connor>
<joey> You just staring off to the distance, </joey>
<joey> doing it crunching. </joey>
<joey> - I love crunching on ice God. </joey>
<joey> - It's the best texture. </joey>
<connor> I love it. </connor>
<connor> I dunno why I just, yeah. </connor>
<joey> It's not good for my teeth at all no. </joey>
<joey> I've been told by my dentist </joey>
<joey> and pretty much everyone around </joey>
<joey> me to not do that, </joey>
<joey> but there will be times where, </joey>
<garnt> I literally have to
consciously not put ices </garnt>
<garnt> in my drinks now </garnt>
<garnt> because I do it so much
that everyone's advised </garnt>
<garnt> me to not do it.
- Is that the real reason </garnt>
<joey> why you don't put ice in your beer? </joey>
<joey> - I don't wanna ice, man the beer. </joey>
<joey> - Have you been in the social situation </joey>
<connor> or you're drinking your
drink and then you're right. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna, I'm going to take this ice. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna put it in my mouth. </connor>
<connor> But the cubes a little too big </connor>
<connor> and your mouth's really cold, </connor>
<connor> but it's in your mouth. </connor>
<connor> And it's in there. </connor>
<connor> It's in one of your cheeks and </connor>
<joey> your thing is freezing. </joey>
<joey> And you have that moment where you're </joey>
<garnt> if I you're talking to someone, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't wanna look weirdo. </garnt>
<garnt> You're if I bite into this, </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna look weird. </garnt>
<garnt> But if I swallow this, </garnt>
<garnt> I might choke and look weird. </garnt>
<garnt> So what do I do? </garnt>
<connor> I need to reply in 10 seconds
and they stop speaking. </connor>
<connor> Do I spit the ice back in the
drink and looks like weirdo? </connor>
<connor> Cause if I go, </connor>
<connor> so you were safe. </connor>
<joey> Have you been in that situation? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, many times. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like my go-to option is normally </joey>
<connor> just pray that you can
swallow this without dying. </connor>
<joey> Just pray. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<joey> No, my option is to just
start crunching on that. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, that's. </garnt>
<joey> - The least weird one. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That is. </joey>
<garnt> - The least weird one. I've
never had an issue because </garnt>
<connor> I'm constantly crunching. </connor>
<connor> - Anyway, I can't crunch it. </connor>
<garnt> I'm always definitely worried </garnt>
<garnt> that they're just gonna think I'm a </garnt>
<joey> weirdo when I spit it
back in, but I can't. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Cause if you spit it back in, </joey>
<joey> they're what the? </joey>
<joey> - Spitting it back in
biggest is the worst. </joey>
<connor> Not, but my teeth can't bite into. </connor>
<joey> - It, but I also don't wanna be that guy. </joey>
<joey> Who's so I've been in situation before. </joey>
<joey> - Keep throwing an ice. </joey>
<joey> - Where I'm all right, boys, here we go. </joey>
<connor> This might be it. </connor>
<garnt> I might be dead. </garnt>
<garnt> - But how many ice cubes have
you swallowed in your life? </garnt>
<connor> uncountable, uncountable. </connor>
<connor> - Moments, over 10. </connor>
<connor> - That a lot normally I would just try and </connor>
<joey> - Kind of what's your. </joey>
<joey> - We kind of try and
move it around to get it </joey>
<joey> to a swallowable size. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> Or maybe not as. </joey>
<connor> - Fast as you can or maybe just get it </connor>
<connor> so that it doesn't have harsh edges. </connor>
<garnt> - You swallowed ice cubes with hard edges. </garnt>
<connor> - Where they're full, cute. </connor>
<garnt> - No way. </garnt>
<garnt> No way. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would be so terrified to. </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally the technique, </garnt>
<garnt> but the problem is that this
is where the technique fails is </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm normally doing
this after I've drank it. </garnt>
<garnt> So now I can't use water
to assist it flowing </garnt>
<garnt> when I swallow. </garnt>
<garnt> So I have to just swallow a dry ice cube. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was saying that </garnt>
<garnt> you just take a swig of
water or something that </garnt>
<garnt> will help that would help melt it a bit. </garnt>
<connor> - I just swallow it and yeah, </connor>
<connor> one time I think I had a
really big scare one time. </connor>
<connor> Cause got stuck, </connor>
<connor> but I remember I had to play it. </connor>
<joey> Cause I was I don't wanna make
them do a, he maneuver on me. </joey>
<connor> So I would just kind of keep </connor>
<connor> Keep trying to swallow
it before I take a breath </connor>
<connor> and then eventually it
went down and oh my God, </connor>
<joey> my esophagus was in so much pain. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And by the way, </joey>
<joey> never risk your life for a bit of social </joey>
<garnt> or witness just, </garnt>
<garnt> I should have just spatted out. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, it was, </garnt>
<garnt> it was terrifying. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just chewing it a. </garnt>
<connor> - Real, I could feel it. </connor>
<connor> Cause it was so big. </connor>
<connor> I could feel it going down
and then getting stuck </connor>
<joey> a little bit sometimes. </joey>
<joey> And then waiting. </joey>
<joey> And then obviously it was </joey>
<connor> cause obviously my body's really warm. </connor>
<connor> So it would slowly dissolve. </connor>
<garnt> - So You just gave you
esophagus freeze burn or. </garnt>
<connor> - It hurt so much. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't do that. </garnt>
<joey> The lengths that British person
will go to not be awkward in </joey>
<joey> the social circumstance, just. </joey>
<joey> - Spit it out at appointment just. </joey>
<joey> - Just spit it out. </joey>
<joey> - What I was playing the most. </joey>
<garnt> - I will say if I didn't
love chewing on ice so much, </garnt>
<garnt> I would probably do the same thing. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna, </connor>
<connor> I would rather potentially risk
having a choking incident as </connor>
<connor> opposed to having 10 seconds
of social awkward interaction. </connor>
<joey> That's what I really, yeah. </joey>
<connor> That's the British and me, </connor>
<joey> we just can't we can't do it. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, man. </connor>
<connor> just yeah. </connor>
<joey> It's it's. </joey>
<joey> - Can't yeah, it's gonna be weird. </joey>
<connor> Speeding your ice back
your drink or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But I don't know how many
situations can you think of where </connor>
<joey> you've say been to dinner
with some other person, right? </joey>
<connor> Or what's the first date. Right? </connor>
<joey> First date with someone. </joey>
<joey> - First day, for example. </joey>
<connor> Right? If you're on a first
day with someone, right? </connor>
<joey> How many times have you gone
to a restaurant with say </joey>
<connor> another, a lady. </connor>
<joey> Right. And she's gone anyway. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. And then that, at that point, </connor>
<joey> your head's no. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, I, part of me partly would be </connor>
<joey> - When is, when is spitting. </joey>
<joey> - Ice back in your glass? </joey>
<joey> The game changer. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not gonna lie. </connor>
<connor> It's one of probably the least
attractive things you can do. </connor>
<connor> It looks very unattractive. </connor>
<connor> Don't you think? </connor>
<connor> So someone should. </connor>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<connor> I think something that's less attractive. </connor>
<connor> - You choking on an ice? </connor>
<connor> - You go no on a date. </connor>
<connor> That's good show. </connor>
<garnt> No, I wouldn't. </garnt>
<connor> I've actually been in the
situation four actually. </connor>
<garnt> Not and I haven't swallowed it. </garnt>
<garnt> I've just, I just remembered.
- It's on a date you want, </garnt>
<connor> they wanna know that you
swallow and your wellness. </connor>
<connor> - Show I wanna. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God are you.
- They didn't even notice it. </joey>
<garnt> They didn't even know
that you just swallowed. </garnt>
<joey> - And they probably would've. </joey>
<connor> They can see my Adams, </connor>
<connor> apple and marching times. </connor>
<connor> I'm I do it. </connor>
<connor> My chest is </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's the tissue technique. </garnt>
<connor> It's the tissue technique. </connor>
<garnt> - Because not for a big ice cube. </garnt>
<garnt> They're gonna see your
tissue on the table. </garnt>
<connor> No, it's gonna be a. </connor>
<connor> - You don't put it back on the table. </connor>
<connor> You go for the tissue. </connor>
<garnt> You pretend you're just
wiping your mouth or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just you salt. </garnt>
<garnt> The I'm gonna, </garnt>
<garnt> - You've gotta be salt because
now they're gonna think, oh, </garnt>
<joey> this guy just choked out a massive Louie. </joey>
<connor> - In front of me. </connor>
<connor> - This ice cube, this, this ice cube. </connor>
<garnt> - Are you talking when you,
when you exude an exude, </garnt>
<joey> when you take out on ice cube
out your mouth, you don't go. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> God, this was, this was maybe a what? </garnt>
<garnt> - How big of the ice cube were we talking? </garnt>
<garnt> - This is a four centimeter cubes. </garnt>
<connor> A four by four by four
by four centimeters. </connor>
<joey> Let's say that's a big. </joey>
<joey> - Ice cube. </joey>
<connor> - Dude.. </connor>
<joey> That's what I'm talking. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> No if it's that size, </connor>
<connor> I never take the risk of putting. </connor>
<connor> - It in my mouth. I'm not
putting it in my mouth. </connor>
<connor> - I was dumb. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I. </connor>
<connor> - Did cause caus eat that point, </connor>
<joey> right at that point you
probably would've hardly </joey>
<connor> even drank your drink. </connor>
<garnt> - Huh? I'm the speed. </garnt>
<joey> It's gone let say it's a bang in cocktail. </joey>
<connor> it's an absolute winner. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I love the cocktail so much. </connor>
<connor> Or maybe, I wanna order a bunch more. </connor>
<connor> I wanna try for more. </connor>
<connor> So I drink it all and the ice cubes </connor>
<connor> are still fully formed because. </connor>
<garnt> - At that point, </garnt>
<joey> the ice cube just doesn't feel nice. </joey>
<joey> Three if. </joey>
<joey> - You can feel the
edges on the ice cube it </joey>
<garnt> doesn't feel nice in your mouth. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought when you say,
when you swallow ice cubes, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought you were talking about </garnt>
<connor> when you buy a drink at
McDonald's or something. </connor>
<connor> - Are you swallowing whiskey rocks? </connor>
<connor> - No. No. It was I can't
remember which one it was </connor>
<connor> - You're literally swallowing, whiskey, </connor>
<connor> - Ice cube. It, it was a
Fullon formed ice cube. </connor>
<connor> it was a nice ice cube. </connor>
<connor> That's why I wanted to put
it in my mouth because I was, </connor>
<connor> I remember, I honestly, I was. </connor>
<connor> - But I can get this down. </connor>
<joey> - I was, yeah. I'd been
training for a while. </joey>
<connor> I was I was 19. </connor>
<joey> I was, thinking I was fancy probably. </joey>
<connor> I don't know what I
remember the exact scenario. </connor>
<connor> I remember this specific scenario. </connor>
<joey> The reason why I was so
committed to potentially dying, </joey>
<joey> to avoid social awkwardness. </joey>
<joey> It was because I was a first
date and I was very nervous </joey>
<joey> and she was very attractive. </joey>
<connor> I really wanted this to go well. </connor>
<joey> - And so you were I'm a eat this ice cube. </joey>
<connor> - And so some reason I
think the 19 year old, </connor>
<connor> was tapping into the fit 15, </connor>
<connor> 12 year old to me that was
that ice cube looks real </connor>
<connor> because sometimes you see an ice cube </connor>
<connor> and you just put it in your mouth. </connor>
<connor> Cause you are of course. </connor>
<garnt> Cause you're dumb when
you're a kid and you want, </garnt>
<connor> of course I, now I have no desire. </connor>
<connor> - It really depends. Okay. </connor>
<joey> It really depends as someone
who has eaten a lot of ice </joey>
<joey> cubes in my life, an ice cube. </joey>
<joey> - As the ice cube cone I saw here, </joey>
<joey> so many different factors. Right? </joey>
<joey> Because sometimes, sometimes it's big, </joey>
<connor> but for some reason it's hollow inside. </connor>
<connor> So you can take a good, </connor>
<joey> you can Sometimes its
just completely solid. </joey>
<joey> It's just a solid block
of solid block of ice. </joey>
<joey> And there is not here is no
biting down on that unless </joey>
<garnt> it's at least a little bit melted. </garnt>
<joey> At all. </joey>
<garnt> And at that point it's gonna
take at least one or two </garnt>
<garnt> minutes, regardless of the social, social. </garnt>
<joey> - Situ I started doing the
grinding technique awful. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. It's awful for my teeth, </connor>
<joey> but I take one bite and I'm oh okay. </joey>
<joey> This isn't a hollow one. </joey>
<joey> No, all right. </joey>
<connor> Switch to space. </connor>
<connor> Two grinding technique. </connor>
<connor> - I remember it was quite a hefty boy. </connor>
<joey> It was a waity boy. </joey>
<connor> Hence why again? I wanted
to put it in my mouth. </connor>
<connor> It looks, it looked. </connor>
<joey> - I want all the Trash Taste saids </joey>
<joey> of this taken outta context. </joey>
<connor> - It looked too good not
to allow it to go to waste. </connor>
<garnt> So I had to of. </garnt>
<garnt> - Course, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me it's the opposite
for me. If it's perfectly, </garnt>
<garnt> the edges are perfectly rounded. </garnt>
<garnt> That's peak ice. </garnt>
<garnt> That's peak ice to put in your
mouth that is peak ice to put </garnt>
<garnt> in your mouth and it cause it all. </garnt>
<connor> - Straight away with the giant balls, </connor>
<joey> the whiskey car's. </joey>
<garnt> - No joke every time I get
recommended a video of one </garnt>
<joey> of the waiters, shaving ice. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. It's one it's the most
satisfy rooms in my life. </joey>
<garnt> - Whole need to say, </garnt>
<joey> I don't wanna put it in my
mouth cause I don't wanna die. </joey>
<joey> Oh yes I, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I've learned my lesson. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not with that. </garnt>
<connor> It was all. </connor>
<garnt> - Also clear ice, superior ice, </garnt>
<garnt> superior ice to the
frosted ice that you get </garnt>
<connor> where it's clear outside </connor>
<connor> and frosted in the middle. </connor>
<garnt> There's trashed here, ice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Isn't that? </garnt>
<connor> Get that out. This is
just level one bartending. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean just I think difference to chew, </garnt>
<connor> to chew on well to chew on. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. Sorry I'm just this
is my five year old brain. </joey>
<connor> - This is right now my
favorite crayons taste level of </connor>
<joey> conversation. It's I like the maroon one. </joey>
<joey> - I like cherry red because
it's got the word te. </joey>
<garnt> - Ju prefer ju prefer cube dice. </garnt>
<connor> Or how do you feel about. </connor>
<connor> - Don't have a. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<garnt> Cause I know a lot of
people who hate crush dice. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yes. Okay. </connor>
<connor> Actually. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I do hate crush. </connor>
<joey> - I really crush. </joey>
<garnt> - I crushed dice. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Why did you it's a slushy. </joey>
<garnt> - You get okay so you, </garnt>
<joey> everyone knows my soda take right where I, </joey>
<joey> I like it. </joey>
<joey> That's the wrong one. </joey>
<joey> I just, I it where, </joey>
<joey> you take a little bit of the fizz out and </joey>
<joey> to me crushed dice has
more of a surface area to, </joey>
<garnt> just to just make soda, </garnt>
<garnt> the perfect texture, the perfect flavor. </garnt>
<connor> If you drink it with out a straw, right? </connor>
<garnt> - No it is great because
if you drink it with, </garnt>
<garnt> without a straw, </garnt>
<joey> then you get a lot of crushed
dice and you can chew it. </joey>
<joey> - It's perfect. </joey>
<garnt> - You get the best of both worlds. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just this is you're yeah. </connor>
<joey> I don't they bring extra, </joey>
<joey> extra colors in the crown
package, which can eat. </joey>
<connor> - One of them To draw. </connor>
<joey> This wants to eat. </joey>
<connor> - This is I don't want </connor>
<connor> to taste the ice slush in my mouth. </connor>
<connor> I want to taste the drink being cold. </connor>
<joey> This is why when we go
to Denny's in Japan, </joey>
<joey> I hate their Iceman machine. </joey>
<garnt> The ice is always the the shaved ice. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. And you drink it and you just get </connor>
<connor> a mouth full of shaved ice. </connor>
<connor> When you gotta do that
technique where you're </connor>
<connor> - I won putting it in my mouth. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> I like it when it's at
the bottom of the glass </joey>
<joey> and then you do this and then just, oh my. </joey>
<connor> - But it's the last
little bit where you get. </connor>
<garnt> - Flavor it's basically
just shaved ice it bit more. </garnt>
<connor> - The bottom it stay at the top. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean you go gotta drink it. </garnt>
<garnt> You go I mean it depends </garnt>
<connor> because have you've hung out with me. </connor>
<connor> So you've seen how much shave. </connor>
<joey> - Hung out with. </joey>
<joey> - You've seen how much
shaved dice I put into there. </joey>
<joey> Minimum the minimum amount of shaved ice. </joey>
<connor> I put into a cup. </connor>
<garnt> If I have the choice is half the cup. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the minimum for me. </garnt>
<connor> - This is right. When Gar
goes to the moody theater, </connor>
<connor> he's wow, look how much value I'm going? </connor>
<joey> I've drank four drinks today. </joey>
<joey> He's no, can't you've drank. </joey>
<joey> - Buy this man buys chips and goes can. </joey>
<garnt> - To me the saddest sight
I've I ever see in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> Is when you go to a shaved
ice machine and people put </garnt>
<connor> a bit in a tiny bit, </connor>
<connor> 5% of the cup. </connor>
<joey> - I do 1% most I put any. </joey>
<joey> - And then you, </joey>
<joey> fill up with the soda, right? </joey>
<joey> I'd rather people put no in, </joey>
<joey> because you fill out </joey>
<joey> with the soda, the saddest sight. </joey>
<joey> It's just seeing one
or two bits of ice just </joey>
<garnt> floating around in the
soda that's doing nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally do nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> Why would you put ice in? </garnt>
<garnt> If it's all the ice you're gonna put in. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not even in a cap. </garnt>
<joey> I've never given a. </joey>
<joey> I've never been seething
rage me God damn it. </joey>
<garnt> - I have cause you can't
even chew on the ice. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why next. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why it doesn't matter. </garnt>
<joey> Cause it's gonna probably gonna melt. </joey>
<connor> - I'm the point I'm gonna
predict God's next take. </connor>
<connor> He thinks that soup should be
exclusively eaten with straws. </connor>
<connor> - No, I don't. </connor>
<joey> I don't think. </joey>
<connor> - It's just a drink. </connor>
<joey> - Isn't it? </joey>
<connor> He's a drink. </connor>
<connor> Super a drink quick. </connor>
<connor> So less rusty. </connor>
<joey> - Less rusty Curry is a drink. </joey>
<connor> - I want clown take you
to come out with next. </connor>
<connor> - I'm collecting them right now. </connor>
<connor> Just gimme more food to infinity. </connor>
<joey> - Stones of Taste Christ. </joey>
<connor> - Taste can be whatever I want them to be. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's only a
Southeast Asian thing. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where you can </garnt>
<garnt> you buy a soda at a stand or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno if I've told this story before, </garnt>
<garnt> but you buy a soda at stand or something </garnt>
<garnt> and then they will </garnt>
<garnt> serve it to you in a plastic bag. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that Southeast? Is that so yes. </garnt>
<joey> Yes can they. </joey>
<garnt> - So can they not afford
plastic containers </garnt>
<joey> or is this an artistic choice? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know why it is right. </garnt>
<joey> But I remember the first time, like. </joey>
<joey> - That's as weird as a Bag.
Then I remember the first time, </joey>
<joey> because I thought this was a normal thing. </joey>
<joey> Because when I was a kid, </joey>
<joey> I'd go to a </joey>
<joey> Thailand every year and one of especially </joey>
<joey> hot day you'd you'd go
to a stand you'd order, </joey>
<joey> a soft drink. </joey>
<joey> And what happens is they
will have a glass bottle </joey>
<joey> and then they will. </joey>
<garnt> That, but that. </garnt>
<garnt> So what happens is they
will have a glass bottle, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever soda you order, </garnt>
<garnt> they'll uncap it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they'll take a plastic bag out, </garnt>
<garnt> just put in that ton of vice
in the bag and just pour </garnt>
<garnt> the soda into the bag. </garnt>
<connor> I'll give it to you. </connor>
<garnt> - Doesn't sound that bad. </garnt>
<joey> - Actually. That's actually quite cool. </joey>
<joey> - Give you a Comly large straw. </joey>
<joey> - They just give you a straw. </joey>
<connor> - They give you a TWI straw with. </connor>
<joey> - So what happens? </joey>
<joey> Let's say you're well. </joey>
<joey> this is a lot of soda. </joey>
<garnt> how much we talking? Is it
a normal can doing 30 mil? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Normal can, right? </connor>
<connor> Let's say you are halfway
through the can. You're oh, </connor>
<joey> I wanna just put it down for a second. </joey>
<joey> - Can put it down when
you hang up, my drink. </joey>
<connor> - Do have to find a hanger. </connor>
<joey> - How do I put. </joey>
<joey> - It down? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So a lot of restaurants
will have these little, </joey>
<joey> little hangers on the table or something. </joey>
<joey> That's actually. </joey>
<joey> - Kind of cool. </joey>
<garnt> - You could.
- Just hang below the table. </garnt>
<joey> - You could just hang the soda on. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So if you wanna be excuse me. </joey>
<joey> - Anyway. </joey>
<joey> - And Laurie drivers in
Singapore would have hope. </joey>
<garnt> - That's true. </garnt>
<garnt> I complete for got about, </garnt>
<joey> they got the hooks as. </joey>
<joey> - Well. Okay. </joey>
<joey> Question then cause we were
talking about chewing on ice. </joey>
<connor> How the do you chew the
ice from a plastic back? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, he shovels it with. </connor>
<connor> - His hands you just
grab it with your hand </connor>
<joey> because you can't you
can't do this. Right. </joey>
<joey> - When you're after you've done drinking, </joey>
<joey> so you take the plastic, you get, </joey>
<joey> you can actually just
take one by one and just </joey>
<joey> and or you take the straw and you just </joey>
<garnt> so you scoop a little bit up also. </garnt>
<connor> - These brand new plastic
bags or these reuse from </connor>
<connor> the guys, grocery shopping. </connor>
<connor> - You combine. </connor>
<connor> - You got the Al bag bro. </connor>
<connor> I'm using little bro. </connor>
<garnt> - I've never really thought
about that until yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I wanna knowhow clean that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I'd be very concerned
if he just whips outsome </connor>
<connor> crushed one from somewhere I'm </connor>
<garnt> - Found a part of Southeast Asian culture </garnt>
<garnt> that we don't normally talk about. </garnt>
<joey> I realize cause. </joey>
<garnt> - It's is a good drink. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's I surely. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know this is complete
nostalgia talking, </garnt>
<connor> but I like the way that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Amount of plastic in a bag
is enough to make one cup. </connor>
<joey> No. What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> surely you can make a cup from one bag. </joey>
<connor> - It's thinner. </connor>
<joey> It's thinner, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but plastic bags are. </connor>
<connor> - What I, no, </connor>
<connor> what I wanna know is </connor>
<joey> why do they not just give you the bottle? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Why that, because
you're on the ice. </connor>
<joey> - Why do they have to, </joey>
<joey> to grab the bottle and
empty it into a bow? </joey>
<garnt> Why can't they just give you the bottle? </garnt>
<garnt> - I believe because they
just recycle the bottles. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay. So they send them back off. </joey>
<joey> I believe that's. </joey>
<garnt> That's sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - That's you can get a lot
of drinks in south Asia. </joey>
<joey> They come a tub. </joey>
<joey> So they scoop it up. </joey>
<connor> - Into, but surely the plastic. </connor>
<connor> The plastic use on all those plastic. </connor>
<connor> You could just convert into one cup. </connor>
<connor> There's a lot of plastic
in one plastic bag. </connor>
<connor> As, as the turtles. </connor>
<garnt> Well know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no. I don't I think, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think a lot of
Southeast Asian countries at the </garnt>
<garnt> moment have much awareness
about plastic and trying to </garnt>
<garnt> reduce the amount of plastic. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I'm just generally curious. </garnt>
<garnt> How, why it was. </garnt>
<connor> - Sized back. </connor>
<joey> I just genuinely think that
that's just how it's been. </joey>
<joey> some dude was just one day was just </joey>
<joey> what if we put it. </joey>
<garnt> - I dunno, plastic back. </garnt>
<garnt> - That still be hilarious. </garnt>
<joey> It's a spread. </joey>
<joey> I could be show ignorance with that, </joey>
<connor> but I'm just surely there's a better way. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure there is. </joey>
<connor> But there is obviously
we are very wasteful </connor>
<joey> with our cups and stuff. </joey>
<connor> We line Starbucks cups, wax </connor>
<joey> and maybe they just, </joey>
<connor> I dunno, maybe they just don't give a. </connor>
<joey> They're just I just want my drink. </joey>
<connor> I don't care what it's in. </connor>
<connor> - I guess, I would be </connor>
<joey> - Well, maybe they, </joey>
<joey> are thinking in a recycling manner </joey>
<joey> where after they finish the drink, </joey>
<joey> they'll be right after the supermarket. </joey>
<joey> Just what? </joey>
<connor> Fold it inside out. </connor>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<connor> - Brand new there we go. </connor>
<connor> - All my groceries. So right. </connor>
<connor> So you have a car, right? </connor>
<connor> The just cup holders is useless. </connor>
<garnt> You just or is it just </garnt>
<connor> - We don't use car. </connor>
<garnt> So you just hanging it up
on the what's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro God forbid you
get a bump in that car. </garnt>
<connor> You go is. </connor>
<connor> - Coke all over. </connor>
<connor> You just go over a patchy bit. </connor>
<connor> Your coke is coming out sake. </connor>
<connor> I should have tied it up. </connor>
<connor> - She a double, no, that. </connor>
<connor> - You just ordered your
triple latte from Starbucks </connor>
<connor> and you're going up the mountain road. </connor>
<joey> - It's oh, just Christ. </joey>
<joey> Well no, what's the
worst is what if you are, </joey>
<joey> just walking along and then you happen to </joey>
<garnt> Nick onto something. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the there's a tear in the bag </garnt>
<garnt> and you and you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are spilling out. </garnt>
<joey> Then you're just. </joey>
<connor> - You got a shotgun that has
happened before you just. </connor>
<garnt> - It's something about a cup. </garnt>
<connor> I think we got it right. </connor>
<connor> A few thousand years ago. </connor>
<joey> I think we got it right? </joey>
<joey> - Comfort invented for a reason. </joey>
<joey> - I think the cup is pretty good. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna sound an. </joey>
<joey> I'm not trying to be your culture. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not saying it's the next
best thing after slice bread </connor>
<joey> or anything, but it's pretty good. </joey>
<joey> - Sure the cup came before the wheel. </joey>
<connor> that was we had made it good. </connor>
<garnt> Right then man, the
cylindrical can, right. </garnt>
<connor> That, was the best invention. </connor>
<connor> Right, I've seen that YouTube video. </connor>
<connor> I think everyone I've seen that. </connor>
<garnt> - 13 Million views. </garnt>
<garnt> That guy going that's a pretty
neat invention actually. </garnt>
<connor> It's the pressure is designed. </connor>
<connor> Okay. We, again.
- We get it. You watch. </connor>
<garnt> - YouTube. Yes. </garnt>
<connor> Speak of YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Show, British. </connor>
<connor> - Speak of YouTube. </connor>
<connor> I've been YouTube. </connor>
<connor> I've been watching a few
more YouTube shorts recently. </connor>
<joey> Even I know every time I go on a </joey>
<joey> YouTube shorts binge </joey>
<joey> it's bad for my health. </joey>
<joey> there's it's to me
watching YouTube shorts. </joey>
<joey> So watching Tik Tok is the
equivalent of eating McDonald's </joey>
<joey> or eating fast food. </joey>
<joey> I know I shouldn't do, but sometimes, </joey>
<joey> sometimes just lying in bed </joey>
<joey> and you just scroll
through and you're you. </joey>
<joey> - Want that quick meal? </joey>
<joey> - And you're 30 minutes have pass. </joey>
<joey> And I've consumed nothing. </joey>
<joey> So I've fallen down to, </joey>
<connor> I fell down into this hole of life advice, </connor>
<connor> YouTube or hack YouTube shots. </connor>
<connor> Oh no, I've been there. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. And it's just </connor>
<connor> remember before where we went through </connor>
<connor> that life hack phase </connor>
<connor> of Buzzfeed videos. </connor>
<connor> Well the hack, </connor>
<connor> isn't actually a hack. </connor>
<joey> So I thought that died out. </joey>
<connor> But apparently that just
went to TikTok. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Right. Cause I remember I saw, </connor>
<connor> I saw a few career hacks
of things you can do in </connor>
<joey> to help you increase
your chances of getting </joey>
<joey> a job interview. </joey>
<joey> And there was this, </joey>
<joey> I think I saw that. </joey>
<joey> - And there's this to of this is how, </joey>
<garnt> this is how it goes. </garnt>
<garnt> The job interviewer offers
you a glass of drop of water. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw same thing yesterday ago. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> What is it? </joey>
<joey> The white guy. </joey>
<joey> Little yeah. </joey>
<joey> So the job interviewer
offers you a glass of water </joey>
<joey> and then you take the water </joey>
<garnt> and that's the hack because the hack is, </garnt>
<garnt> if you take the glass of water, </garnt>
<garnt> when it's offered to you, </garnt>
<garnt> they ask you a difficult
question and you just go, </garnt>
<garnt> Well, you see the thing is, </garnt>
<garnt> and the hack was because </garnt>
<garnt> you have a glass of water, </garnt>
<garnt> it gives you more time to
think about the answer. </garnt>
<joey> And I was the hack </joey>
<garnt> and I was just losing my mind that </garnt>
<garnt> you could call this career advice </garnt>
<joey> or 3000s and I'm who? </joey>
<connor> - This feels the only
time I ever see people </connor>
<connor> take a sip of water </connor>
<joey> road for the question
is the criminal trials. </joey>
<joey> when mark Zuckerberg was
being questioned on the, </joey>
<joey> by the it, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Every single question it'd be asked to go. </joey>
<joey> - He was using live hack, dude. </joey>
<connor> He was thinking about those answers. </connor>
<joey> - But I'm saying you don't
wanna look a criminal </joey>
<joey> when ask you a question
you don't wanna be going. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel a more logical thing would be </garnt>
<garnt> can I just take a bit of time
to think about this answer? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because you gotta seem confident. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd be that is a fantastic question. </joey>
<joey> - Think the way to appropriately. </joey>
<connor> - Answer that no, you, what
if you combine it right? </connor>
<connor> You gotta combine it with the water. </connor>
<joey> That's a fantastic, what. </joey>
<garnt> - What if the water doesn't
give you enough time? </garnt>
<joey> Are, you just Downing
an entire Jack of water? </joey>
<garnt> You're sitting there have
10 minutes just going. </garnt>
<connor> - They're gone what's
your favorite food is, oh. </connor>
<connor> - Well, what if or what if you are just </connor>
<connor> you get offed the water. Right. </connor>
<connor> And you're just really thirsty. </connor>
<joey> And then you get to that
really difficult question. </joey>
<joey> You're just what do I do now? </joey>
<joey> The TikTok never told. </joey>
<garnt> - Me, sir, you've gone
through three liters </garnt>
<garnt> of water during this interview. </garnt>
<connor> I are you feeling okay? </connor>
<connor> - I would just say 99% of
life hacks or some I just </connor>
<connor> immediately forget and never
remember and will never, </connor>
<garnt> ever practically use. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah absolutely so many of them, </connor>
<joey> especially when it comes to survival, </joey>
<joey> these kinds of hacks </joey>
<joey> or advice you see on TikTok. </joey>
<joey> I dunno if we've ever talked
about this on a podcast. </joey>
<joey> I think we've only talked
about it in private, </joey>
<joey> but the SHA financial advice, </joey>
<joey> which is an entire genre. </joey>
<garnt> My favorite which is an entire, </garnt>
<garnt> I think an entire genre of
video on TikTok and YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> shorts now where it's
justShaq, motivational, </garnt>
<garnt> life advice and half
it is just taking your </garnt>
<garnt> paycheck and apparently ripping and hard. </garnt>
<garnt> So Shaq, what's the difference between </garnt>
<joey> being rich and being wealthy. </joey>
<joey> It's when you're rich, you do this, </joey>
<joey> but the wealth you do this 1 millions. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you, Shaq. </joey>
<connor> I am no longer poor now. </connor>
<connor> - Shaqs I will. </connor>
<connor> - Poverty Shaq is a very
nice, guy's very generous. </connor>
<connor> He I'm sure the financial advice, </connor>
<connor> the problem is with a lot of
these financial advices on </connor>
<connor> TikTok and YouTube. </connor>
<connor> And again, I think Shaq is
somewhat guilty of this. </connor>
<connor> It assumes you are even
making enough money to save. </connor>
<connor> most people don't, aren't
able to save money. </connor>
<joey> Exactly cause we're right now. </joey>
<joey> Yeah most people spend all their paycheck. </joey>
<joey> That's how it is. </joey>
<joey> How do you then go to them </joey>
<connor> and you're just not saving enough. </connor>
<connor> You're just not saving enough that rent. </connor>
<connor> Maybe you can get rid of it. </connor>
<joey> - Who's living on minimum
wage and being oh, </joey>
<connor> - I didn't are there people
who spend irresponsibly? </connor>
<connor> Hell yeah, there are. </connor>
<connor> Is that the reason is
why everyone isn't rich. </connor>
<connor> No and no, </connor>
<garnt> It was just so weird falling
into this hole of just </garnt>
<garnt> the, you see these TikTok
with made up scenarios where </garnt>
<garnt> the perfect life hack for
that scenario will pop up. </garnt>
<connor> - It's always the same. </connor>
<connor> It's one guy is in this part of the frame </connor>
<connor> and he's so you want this? </connor>
<connor> And then another guy, </connor>
<connor> the other frame probably with glasses. </connor>
<connor> - Or something. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<joey> That's not how you do it. It's
literally, always like that. </joey>
<connor> And with the worst acting
and the worst script, </connor>
<connor> and then it's 20 million views and </connor>
<garnt> I'm quitting my job. </garnt>
<connor> - Terrible at my job. </connor>
<joey> And it's just an entire genre
that just takes place in </joey>
<joey> the damn universe. </joey>
<joey> it's just the extended
Darman universe where, </joey>
<joey> everything just works
up and cause of these </joey>
<garnt> because I drank water in
my job interview, the DCU. </garnt>
<joey> - The tar cinematic universe. </joey>
<joey> Oh wait, </joey>
<joey> the one that also just that
I've been getting a lot </joey>
<joey> recently off YouTube shorts
is the ones where the </joey>
<joey> ones where they take, </joey>
<joey> there's five minute
crowd off to life hacks. </joey>
<joey> And then there's always some dude, who's </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna find out if this is
actually legitimate or not. </joey>
<joey> And then they do. </joey>
<joey> And then they try themselves and </joey>
<joey> okay, what's legitimate for more. </joey>
<joey> - That's a thing. </joey>
<joey> That's a thing. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - I've seen. </joey>
<joey> - So many of those, so
many times where it's oh, </joey>
<joey> if you get a black marker, </joey>
<joey> you draw it on your hand </joey>
<joey> and then you take a
picture of it on flash. </joey>
<joey> Then it apparently zaps you some that. </joey>
<connor> And it's always some guy being no, </connor>
<connor> it's not factor or cap. </connor>
<connor> All right, let's try it. </connor>
<connor> Let's try and figure cap. </connor>
<joey> - My let's try and figure it out. </joey>
<connor> - My new favorite shorts or to
category is the tos that need </connor>
<connor> way more explanation
as to what's going on. </connor>
<connor> But the person doing
the video does not offer </connor>
<connor> any explanation as to </connor>
<connor> why they're doing the thing they're doing. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> There was one time I watched
this TikTok and it was a guy. </connor>
<connor> He was so here's how I made
a case to carry my iPad farm. </connor>
<connor> And then he makes the case </connor>
<connor> and me and all the other comments were </connor>
<connor> why do you have an iPad farm? </connor>
<joey> - I think I've seen that. </joey>
<joey> - With the long case. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> And he made this video just
explaining how he made a </connor>
<connor> case for his iPad farm. </connor>
<connor> And I was the whole time, </connor>
<connor> why did you have an iPad farm? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> He makes this iPad farm to test out. </garnt>
<joey> If he could make enough
passive income, that's. </joey>
<joey> - It? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - To justify making an iPad farm </joey>
<joey> and there are so many
layers to this TikTok </joey>
<joey> that I just want answers. </joey>
<joey> - To. I'm question. </joey>
<garnt> - How are you making this money? </garnt>
<joey> - First of all. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> what passive income revenue, </garnt>
<joey> - What new are you doing? What
is this app you are using? </joey>
<joey> - I know there's some
people who run Spotify farms </joey>
<joey> and have tons and tons of phones. </joey>
<joey> And you play the same
song on Luke Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> And then they get revenue from it. Oh. </joey>
<connor> But obviously you've used
a lot of electricity, </connor>
<connor> so it's kind of, there's
some things that, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's, again, there's
so many of these where </connor>
<connor> we are gonna do this thing or that </connor>
<connor> or you felt you just came
into the 90th episode of </connor>
<connor> a show and you're what is happening? </connor>
<garnt> And the people making the
videos don't think that </garnt>
<garnt> anyone might need context or something. </garnt>
<connor> - Just one line, let know. </connor>
<connor> Cause I know exactly what you mean though. </connor>
<connor> Cause they'll always start off the video. </connor>
<connor> We've just last time I made </connor>
<garnt> DDO that could fly or something that. </garnt>
<garnt> And you guys have been
asking me to make this, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm going to make it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just what missed. </garnt>
<joey> - Got so many comments saying </joey>
<joey> that you should make it Harvard. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm what have I missed
in the law of this? </garnt>
<garnt> how far back do I go? </garnt>
<joey> And the thing is it's impossible to </joey>
<joey> try to triangulate this </joey>
<joey> when you click on their
channel or something. </joey>
<joey> Cause it's just </joey>
<joey> it's not always in
chronological order either. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> YouTube shorts is </joey>
<garnt> there's so many different holes, </garnt>
<garnt> you can slip down into
YouTube shorts and TikTok. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's insane as well. </joey>
<joey> Because especially with
the YouTube shorts. </joey>
<joey> Cause I don't really use
TikTok, but with YouTube shorts, </joey>
<joey> it knows exactly what to recommend you </joey>
<garnt> next because it's oh, </garnt>
<garnt> you spent one extra second on
this one shack motivational </garnt>
<joey> Tik Tok that must mean you one 20 more. </joey>
<garnt> - That's why some to I'm if </garnt>
<garnt> I watch a video that for too long I'm </garnt>
<connor> Now the algorithm thing. </connor>
<connor> Now the algorithm thinks I this video </connor>
<garnt> and the next 10 videos will
be something to do with that. </garnt>
<connor> - I wish there was some
way to just tell YouTube. </connor>
<connor> I didn't like the video that they sent me, </connor>
<joey> but unfortunately they
removed the dislike. </joey>
<joey> - I know there's a lot of
talks of YouTube shorts </joey>
<joey> that watch and I'm I hated this video. </joey>
<joey> I wanna let them know. </joey>
<connor> I hated it without being an, </connor>
<connor> but I can't know. </connor>
<connor> So I just have to, </connor>
<connor> and I've already given them my watch time. </connor>
<connor> So I've for all YouTube notes, </connor>
<connor> that was the best experience in my life. </connor>
<joey> - The one that made me fall
down the Arabic hole for YouTube </joey>
<joey> shorts for me is I saw this one, </joey>
<joey> YouTube short of the founder of two Chan, </joey>
<joey> cause live streaming thing. </joey>
<joey> And he he's called hi Yuki. </joey>
<joey> Bu he's very, </joey>
<joey> cause he is the creator of two Chan. </joey>
<joey> He's a bit based in his opinions. </joey>
<joey> Gamer very controversial opinions. </joey>
<connor> - Using based in a negative. </connor>
<joey> - And based in a negative term. </joey>
<joey> And I just watched one because </joey>
<connor> I couldn't believe the answer. </connor>
<joey> And now my YouTube shorts are
just this Japanese dude saying </joey>
<joey> a lot of racist and controversial. </joey>
<joey> And I was I don't, </joey>
<joey> I didn't watch this because Id it. </joey>
<joey> I watched it </joey>
<joey> because I was trying to
process what the this guy was. </joey>
<connor> - Talking about well, </connor>
<joey> that's been a lot of criticism of YouTube, </joey>
<joey> Facebook and all these platforms. </joey>
<joey> They push you to the more
fringes of the content and yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I mean that's one of the parts that's not. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think one of the weirdest ones, </garnt>
<connor> I've the, one of the weirdest genres </connor>
<connor> I've seen that's popped up </connor>
<joey> recently is we've gotten to
the point where YouTube shorts </joey>
<joey> are now commentating on YouTubers. </joey>
<joey> Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> Where you'll beLu wig
just did this last week. </joey>
<garnt> You won't believe what he did. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just </garnt>
<joey> - I'm this why Sao doesn't take spar. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Right I was right, cool. </joey>
<joey> I guess it's Mr. </joey>
<joey> Be just sent chocolate
bar to every influencer, </joey>
<joey> it's new slash. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> I dunno, it's just so weird. </connor>
<joey> So weird it's just so weird. </joey>
<joey> Seeing all these new genres
and new types of content </joey>
<joey> pop up on, I guess a new, </joey>
<joey> for a new type of platform
and everything that. </joey>
<joey> But I don't understand it at all. </joey>
<joey> Do you think YouTube
shows gonna stick around? </joey>
<joey> Do you think it's gonna
get to a point where. </joey>
<joey> - It's going to be stuck around? So yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's gonna stick around
it's it's what it is. </joey>
<connor> But at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> the long form content
is still very valuable. </connor>
<garnt> Yes and that's what makes the money. </garnt>
<garnt> Of course yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Until TikTok find a way to
properly monetize that platform </garnt>
<connor> without paying their
creators way less than </connor>
<connor> what they deserve than. </connor>
<connor> I think long to long form
contents will be king for now. </connor>
<connor> That's us. </connor>
<connor> - That's show's we have
zero bias whatsoever. </connor>
<garnt> Absolutely zero bias. </garnt>
<connor> - Upload ridiculously long video to. </connor>

hours of content a week. </joey>
<joey> - But Hey, that's just a theory. </joey>
<joey> A Trash theory. </joey>
