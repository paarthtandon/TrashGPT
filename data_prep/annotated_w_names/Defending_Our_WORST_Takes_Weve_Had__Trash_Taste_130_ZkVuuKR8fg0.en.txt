<garnt> feels like it even though we've filmed a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch of episodes uh we've been away </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah well the last one you hosted </joey>

<joey> right that was that was really really </joey>
<garnt> soon right right guys how you guys been </garnt>
<garnt> what you been up to </garnt>
<garnt> I was thinking about it I'm like that's </garnt>
<garnt> a really [ __ ] good question so what </garnt>
<joey> have I done this week other than just </joey>
<joey> play Pokemon </joey>
<joey> I've been touching grass you've been </joey>
<joey> touching some virtual games I've been </joey>
<joey> touching some virtual five frames per </joey>
<connor> second grass yeah we all know we've </connor>
<garnt> already established you don't see frames </garnt>
<connor> you don't you can't sell this between </connor>
<garnt> six times that's why that's why you like </garnt>
<joey> them that's why people like people are </joey>
<connor> like oh the switch has performance </connor>
<connor> issues and this game runs like [ __ ] I'm </connor>
<connor> like what are you talking about </connor>
<connor> exactly the same oh my God the fact that </connor>
<connor> I've seen clips and so much [ __ ] I'm </connor>
<connor> like how could you not tell the </connor>
<joey> difference this is okay so yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> there was like there was rumors going </joey>
<joey> around being like Oh if you bought the </joey>
<garnt> physical copy then it runs a million </garnt>
<garnt> times more worse and it's a million </garnt>
<garnt> times more glitchy than the digital </garnt>
<garnt> version yeah so maybe that's why because </garnt>
<garnt> like mine was like I had a couple of </garnt>
<garnt> like because you know yeah I mean I had </garnt>
<garnt> a couple of like frame drops and [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like that and a lot of parts that were </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> struggling to load </joey>
<joey> um but I want having like a huge crashes </joey>
<joey> like some people would so maybe there's </joey>
<joey> some truth to that matter but um sorry I </joey>
<connor> think they sold 10 million copies in the </connor>
<garnt> first three days yeah are you serious </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's very successful it was a very </garnt>
<joey> highly anticipated series </joey>
<garnt> um yeah I mean I I just finished it </garnt>
<garnt> yesterday actually I know nothing about </garnt>
<joey> this because I don't really follow the </joey>
<joey> gaming sphere especially Pokemon yeah so </joey>
<joey> is this like a new Mainline game or is </joey>
<joey> this it's the ninth generation okay and </joey>
<joey> is it like 2D 3D 3D </joey>
<joey> um so so it's it's kind of like Legends </joey>
<joey> Arceus if you saw anything about that </joey>
<connor> except this time it's actually open </connor>
<connor> world unlike Arceus that was is an open </connor>
<joey> zone game and I'm like oh is that a </joey>
<connor> Sonic game it's like areas that are open </connor>
<garnt> but then I think that's been a lot of </garnt>
<connor> other games and we need a term for it we </connor>
<joey> were just like that's level yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like uh it's like Mario Odyssey right </joey>
<joey> where it's like you it's like once you </joey>
<joey> open up the world then you have free </joey>
<joey> range on the entire world and you can do </joey>
<joey> whatever the [ __ ] you want in that area </joey>
<joey> but in in order to open up the next Zone </joey>
<joey> you have to progress in the story right </joey>
<joey> right whereas this one is the actual </joey>
<joey> first proper open world where like the </joey>
<joey> entire map is actually open for you okay </joey>
<joey> and like the only like roadblocks of </joey>
<joey> like traversing through the world is </joey>
<joey> like you know you got to get your </joey>
<joey> Pokemon like surf so you can go on the </joey>
<joey> ocean or something like that but other </joey>
<joey> than that like places you can walk it's </joey>
<connor> fully open okay okay as somebody who's </connor>
<joey> played a [ __ ] ton of Pokemon and I don't </joey>
<joey> really feel that interested to play this </joey>
<joey> new one is there any reason I should </joey>
<joey> play the new one is there anything new </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<garnt> not for reasons you will care about </garnt>
<garnt> because let me guess story yeah </garnt>
<joey> story and music are probably the best in </joey>
<joey> any Pokemon game two things </joey>
<garnt> let me tell you about the story and the </garnt>
<connor> music it's it's incredible because the </connor>
<connor> gameplay changed at all okay so the game </connor>
<joey> okay so the gameplay Loop okay did you </joey>
<joey> play Arceus at all I did okay did you </joey>
<connor> like the gameplay Looper bosses yeah </connor>
<connor> okay then it's it's essentially the same </connor>
<connor> all the Pokemon are running around uh in </connor>
<connor> the open World um of course it's like I </connor>
<connor> would say Arceus was miraculously </connor>
<connor> somehow Less buggier in that sense </connor>
<connor> because there are moments where like </connor>
<connor> Pokemon will suddenly appear and then </connor>
<connor> you approach him and then they just </connor>
<joey> straight up disappear and so there's </joey>
<joey> like a great game I mean it's great to </joey>
<joey> stream because it's hilarious yeah </joey>
<joey> because the game is just so glitchy and </joey>
<joey> broken but like other than that like the </joey>
<joey> gameplay loop I would say is really good </joey>
<joey> and I I don't know this is like the big </joey>
<connor> argument when it comes to like every new </connor>
<connor> generation of Pokemon being like have </connor>
<connor> Pokemon designs gotten lazier or have </connor>
<connor> they gotten better that's like a </connor>
<connor> never-ending [ __ ] argument right like </connor>
<connor> more like you know from the brief like </connor>
<joey> pictures I saw of the new Pokemon they </joey>
<joey> look more like Digimon than Pokemon a </joey>
<connor> lot of people have said that they they </connor>
<joey> very much look like whoa okay I will say </joey>
<joey> though I think this is probably the one </joey>
<connor> generation where I think all three </connor>
<connor> starter Pokemon are just as popular as </connor>
<connor> one another okay because like you know </connor>
<connor> how like in like gen 1 for example it's </connor>
<connor> like clearly like you know uh </connor>
<connor> charmanderal Squirtle were like the top </connor>
<joey> two contenders it's like Bulbasaur I </joey>
<joey> sleep yeah you know and it was like </joey>
<joey> there's oh there was always one starter </joey>
<joey> where it's like I sleep or there was a </joey>
<joey> clear winner I feel in this generation </joey>
<joey> I've seen like almost an equal </joey>
<joey> dispersion of all three starters because </joey>
<joey> I think like all three of the designs </joey>
<joey> are really solid and like just again </joey>
<joey> like the gameplay kind of really cult </joey>
<joey> not doesn't really matter really like </joey>
<joey> what kind of study you pick at the end </joey>
<joey> of the day because it is an opal world </joey>
<joey> and you can go in any direction I want </joey>
<connor> them to make starters that aren't water </connor>
<connor> fire or grass </connor>
<connor> tell her they should do that just like </connor>
<connor> is it because of the is it because of </connor>
<connor> the the three colors that are </connor>
<connor> aesthetically pleasing is that why yeah </connor>
<joey> and why do we stick to it well I guess </joey>
<connor> it's also because of the OG like </connor>
<connor> triangle right yeah like you know what </connor>
<joey> is stronger than the other you know kind </joey>
<connor> of thing I guess so I feel like it could </connor>
<joey> be more exciting to yeah I agree to mix </joey>
<joey> up you know just I agree because they </joey>
<joey> all get two types anyway now yeah so </joey>
<joey> it's like all right well why don't we </joey>
<connor> just do all right well if it gets fire </connor>
<joey> later on or some [ __ ] yeah but I'm sure </joey>
<joey> you can like Traverse through the game </joey>
<connor> without using your starter at all yeah I </connor>
<connor> mean you normally can Pokemon's easy </connor>
<connor> enough now where you have to have one IQ </connor>
<joey> to yeah like it's it's I it's really </joey>
<garnt> hard to [ __ ] up it is it is I mean is it </garnt>
<garnt> is it worth getting back into Pokemon </garnt>
<joey> nowadays because </joey>
<joey> where did you stop I I stopped uh </joey>
<garnt> Pokemon Ruby that's which yes I know </garnt>
<joey> wrong I know I mean you did you did it </joey>
<joey> you did play Peak Pokemon in my yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah because I I played red and </garnt>
<joey> blue I played gold and silver then I </joey>
<joey> played Ruby and I was like okay I think </joey>
<joey> I'm done and that's fair I think and </joey>
<garnt> it's been like how many decades now yeah </garnt>
<connor> formula hasn't changed and it's gotten </connor>
<connor> easier yeah so I think the reason why </connor>
<connor> Pokemon has had a lot of longevity </connor>
<connor> amongst older people is that you add the </connor>
<connor> nuzlocker the challenges yeah yeah you </connor>
<connor> add a spin to it that makes it </connor>
<garnt> interesting for yourself yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> because the way I see the Pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> franchise in my mind it's it's kind of </garnt>
<joey> like the same way you know isekai is for </joey>
<connor> anime where it's it's it's iterations of </connor>
<garnt> the same idea </garnt>
<connor> well okay if you like it I don't know I </connor>
<connor> did more by that they're both pretty I </connor>
<joey> was gonna say something like it's a lot </joey>
<connor> like Game of Thrones where it's like if </connor>
<connor> you're like if you're like six seven </connor>
<connor> no in the sense of like how the fan base </connor>
<connor> Works where it's like okay if you're </connor>
<joey> already six or seven seasons in you </joey>
<joey> might as well just [ __ ] finish the </joey>
<connor> rest at that point </connor>
<garnt> what are you talking about </garnt>
<connor> are you talking about Joe </connor>
<connor> um what I mean is if you're it's it's a </connor>
<connor> lot like any long-form TV series where </connor>
<connor> it's got multiple Series right or </connor>
<connor> multiple Seasons we're like okay you </connor>
<connor> enjoyed the first couple of ones okay </connor>
<connor> maybe the third or fourth one slightly </connor>
<joey> stunned to go downhill but you're </joey>
<joey> already committed at this point you </joey>
<joey> might as well I don't agree with this I </joey>
<joey> feel like I haven't enjoyed every </joey>
<joey> Pokemon game some of the Pokemon games </joey>
<joey> in in my opinion have been quite [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like sun and moon was we're pretty mid </joey>
<joey> in my opinion sword and shield was dog </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] it wasn't dog [ __ ] it wasn't I </joey>
<joey> hated that it was oh I hated it </joey>
<connor> um X and Y was like yeah it was okay as </connor>
<connor> well um I can't remember a single </connor>
<connor> Pokemon from sword and shield except for </connor>
<joey> like the the two characters the sword on </joey>
<joey> the shield yeah </joey>
<connor> if you if you tell me to name any </connor>
<joey> Pokemon from that game I'm like </joey>
<connor> I'm the same though with like X and Y or </connor>
<connor> like sun and moon I'm like after that </connor>
<joey> point for me it's like after Gen 4 and </joey>
<joey> the recent one that I just played I </joey>
<connor> don't really remember it I didn't play X </connor>
<connor> and Y or son of shields that's why I </connor>
<connor> don't but I I don't I played the whole </connor>
<connor> game I don't remember any but also I I </connor>
<connor> wouldn't say it's like the Game of </connor>
<garnt> Thrones analogy I'd say it's more like </garnt>
<garnt> well it's it's independent Series right </garnt>
<garnt> so there's no ongoing no it's okay okay </garnt>
<joey> is not the same isakai Series right it's </joey>
<joey> not like we've done this is one guy in </joey>
<connor> the same world as a smartphone and </connor>
<connor> there's a different story with a </connor>
<garnt> different uh the cast of characters oh </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like your take it's like </garnt>
<garnt> iterations of the same kind of formula </garnt>
<connor> it's it's kind of like it's like no </connor>
<joey> because that would be like no </joey>
<connor> yes </connor>
<joey> is there like an ongoing story or </joey>
<joey> something no but but like Doctor Who is </joey>
<garnt> also in in the sense </garnt>
<connor> but Pokemon also has callbacks as well </connor>
<joey> like there are a lot of callbacks in the </joey>
<joey> newer Generations where you wouldn't </joey>
<joey> really really understand it I think </joey>
<joey> especially in terms of like the war </joey>
<garnt> which is in the same with Doctor Who </garnt>
<garnt> right where it's like you could just </garnt>
<garnt> like go straight into season 10 which is </garnt>
<joey> everyone who's the best doctor who have </joey>
<joey> you I've watched five to eleven who </joey>
<joey> doesn't well it kind of does separate </joey>
<connor> but then they do have they do have call </connor>
<joey> backs and mentions yeah I'm nervous I've </joey>
<connor> never seen the first couple of messes </connor>
<joey> like in terms of the Doctor Who I've </joey>
<connor> never seen like the first four seasons </connor>
<joey> to talk to her no no but I still enjoyed </joey>
<joey> all the seasons I watched because they </joey>
<joey> don't heavily depend on the callbacks </joey>
<garnt> like it's it's kind of like if you want </garnt>
<joey> to fully hunt it's like a trash taste </joey>
<connor> episode you know you don't have to watch </connor>
<garnt> the one before yeah but it's the same </garnt>
<garnt> thing no I mean I mean Doctor Who has </garnt>
<garnt> always had like one goal which is you </garnt>
<garnt> know for for the dogs which you know </garnt>
<garnt> find Gallifrey you know find find other </garnt>
<garnt> time Lords and stuff like that that's </garnt>
<garnt> there's always been like one Central </garnt>
<garnt> goal and then you've had like story arcs </garnt>
<garnt> that have like come and gone with </garnt>
<garnt> different characters and everything but </garnt>
<garnt> the core idea of the show as always </garnt>
<joey> remains kind of the same Pokemon's </joey>
<garnt> exactly the same what's the end goal to </garnt>
<connor> be the very best there are a couple of </connor>
<connor> Side characters that have their own </connor>
<joey> storylines before but at the end of the </joey>
<joey> day you're there to [ __ ] beat the </joey>
<connor> Elite Four and be the champion yeah </connor>
<connor> there's no need to play any Pokemon game </connor>
<garnt> prior time yeah yeah I get that even I </garnt>
<garnt> think like black and white black and </garnt>
<garnt> white two I don't even think their </garnt>
<garnt> stories aren't necessarily like yeah </garnt>
<joey> what I was trying to say is I got like </joey>
<connor> the reason I stopped playing was just </connor>
<connor> because I got kind of tired of the </connor>
<connor> formula and then I was just like is </connor>
<connor> there anything what I was trying to ask </connor>
<joey> is that is there anything new to like </joey>
<garnt> bring me back yes so aside from Arceus </garnt>
<garnt> which actually looks interesting yeah </garnt>
<joey> well Arceus is not even a Mainline game </joey>
<garnt> yeah like in terms of violent Scarlet </garnt>
<connor> the new one yeah what what I thought was </connor>
<connor> really really cool was like the the open </connor>
<joey> wall thing is of course one thing but </joey>
<joey> also now there are three branching </joey>
<connor> storylines that you can choose to do oh </connor>
<joey> okay and it's pretty cool and it's and </joey>
<connor> so it's like one of the story lines is </connor>
<connor> the BTA gyms beat the Elite Four become </connor>
<connor> the champion the standard one yeah and </connor>
<joey> and then there are two other storylines </joey>
<joey> that you can do that follow two separate </joey>
<joey> characters and then well I mean at the </joey>
<joey> end of the day </joey>
<joey> in order to get to like the final end </joey>
<joey> end you have to do all three story lines </joey>
<joey> anyway but you can do this storyline in </joey>
<joey> any order you want that's cool so you </joey>
<joey> can choose to be like I'm just gonna </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] Elite Four and become a champion </joey>
<joey> and then start this next one or what I </joey>
<joey> did was I did all three simultaneously </joey>
<joey> okay and so it's like okay so I just </joey>
<joey> defeated uh the fifth gym uh you know </joey>
<joey> instead of going to the sixth gym I'm </joey>
<joey> just gonna go do this next part of this </joey>
<joey> story right and so it's kind of like a </joey>
<joey> pick you're an adventure type of style </joey>
<joey> and that works really well in like the </joey>
<joey> open world setting yeah so now it </joey>
<joey> becomes like this fresh new thing that </joey>
<joey> you can do it's not just like uh I need </joey>
<joey> to make the best team and you know </joey>
<connor> become the best people criticizing the </connor>
<connor> the visuals of the game that they don't </connor>
<connor> look as good as up to par as other </connor>
<joey> Nintendo switch games okay so one thing </joey>
<joey> I I don't know if this is a hot take but </joey>
<joey> I personally don't have a problem with </joey>
<joey> like the way that the game looks because </joey>
<joey> I mean if you think about it that just </joey>
<joey> kind of how it works in the style of </joey>
<joey> Pokemon right like I can't imagine a </joey>
<joey> Pokemon game that has the graphics of </joey>
<connor> like a breath of the Wild Well I think </connor>
<connor> it's that I think they're just saying I </connor>
<connor> think a lot of criticism was was levied </connor>
<joey> at them because of like you know the </joey>
<joey> sceneries look really [ __ ] boring oh </joey>
<joey> yeah they do I've seen a lot of the </joey>
<joey> screenshots of the game like wow this </joey>
<connor> this looks so visually boring it is yeah </connor>
<joey> all the backgrounds and all the textures </joey>
<joey> look really bad but I think as well uh </joey>
<connor> you know unlike say like because you </connor>
<connor> know the one game a lot of people use to </connor>
<connor> compare his breath of the wild right </connor>
<connor> being like Oh breath of the wild had </connor>
<connor> like so much [ __ ] going on and you know </connor>
<connor> like the environment was actually like </connor>
<connor> interactive and really cool but like the </connor>
<joey> whole point of breath of the wild is to </joey>
<joey> interact with your surroundings whereas </joey>
<joey> in the Pokemon games it's not to </joey>
<joey> interact with the surroundings it's </joey>
<connor> interact with the Pokemon but I </connor>
<connor> understand that I I would be like wow </connor>
<connor> this Pokemon in this natural habitat on </connor>
<connor> this one one by one PNG texture like I'd </connor>
<joey> be like well you know yeah no could they </joey>
<connor> have done better absolutely yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like so they're getting they're getting </connor>
<connor> closer to like indie horror devs really </connor>
<connor> like we're just like we're just we're </connor>
<connor> just making one big texture game Frank </connor>
<joey> is doing this really cool thing where </joey>
<joey> they're bringing back the PS2 </joey>
<garnt> one thing that odds that has always </garnt>
<garnt> confused me about I guess like the </garnt>
<garnt> success of Pokemon like Mainline Pokemon </garnt>
<garnt> games right is that would you say that </garnt>
<garnt> there has been a Pokemon game within </garnt>
<garnt> like the last few years that you would </garnt>
<garnt> say is like an absolute must play kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like the kind of like killer app that </garnt>
<garnt> you'd see like breath of the wild or </garnt>
<garnt> like I like I've really really highly </garnt>
<connor> acclaimed game because really a lot of </connor>
<joey> people's favorite game is black and </joey>
<joey> white too A lot of people love that one </joey>
<connor> but again but the Nintendo DS era is all </connor>
<connor> I mean they're very my new changes each </connor>
<joey> one and improvements also also I think a </joey>
<connor> lot of Pokemon fans favorite to black </connor>
<connor> and white twos because it has one of the </connor>
<connor> best stories yeah </connor>
<connor> um but if you don't give a [ __ ] about </connor>
<joey> the story Pokemon games which a lot of </joey>
<joey> Pokemon players don't then it's like </joey>
<joey> it's there's not really there's no game </joey>
<joey> you have to play I think it's Pokemon is </joey>
<joey> just a juggernaut of advertising yeah oh </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and also it's easy like you as </joey>
<joey> a parent you don't have to think about </joey>
<connor> buying your Pokemon yeah as you as the </connor>
<joey> parent know what Pokemon is it's like </joey>
<joey> Mario you don't have to there isn't like </joey>
<garnt> a must play Mario game there are some </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] classes </joey>
<joey> are you saying that through Nostalgia </joey>
<joey> goggles or is that you saying that </joey>
<joey> through like Odyssey Still Remains as </joey>
<connor> like one of the best switch games and </connor>
<joey> like what like I I think it was like my </joey>
<connor> game of the year like the year was </connor>
<joey> released it was like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> incredible games they looked like Zelda </joey>
<joey> as well </joey>
<joey> completely revolutionized the gaming uh </joey>
<joey> the open world the open world genre </joey>
<joey> after it got released so there have been </joey>
<joey> like there have been like big IPS that </joey>
<joey> have that have had killer apps but for </joey>
<garnt> me it always confused me up about </garnt>
<garnt> Pokemon is that it sells like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> hot cakes it's it it breaks every kind </garnt>
<garnt> of record imaginable and then I look at </garnt>
<garnt> the game reviews and then every every </garnt>
<garnt> time a new game comes out it's like yes </garnt>
<joey> it's all right it's good it's because </joey>
<joey> it's because I feel Pokemon generally </joey>
<connor> are appealing to two types of player </connor>
<connor> bases the children and the old school </connor>
<connor> Pokemon fans right right they're not </connor>
<connor> trying to get like this new adult fan </connor>
<connor> base the who has never played Pokemon </connor>
<connor> before because they know there's no </connor>
<joey> Pokemon game that they can make that </joey>
<joey> will be like like a 20 year old you know </joey>
<joey> kid yeah who's never played a Pokemon </joey>

<joey> don't know personally I'm just like kind </joey>
<joey> of over Pokemon I'm like I kind of enjoy </joey>
<joey> it when there's a Nuzlocke or something </joey>
<joey> fun to do no and I and that's the thing </joey>
<connor> I totally get that which is why I always </connor>
<connor> find it frustrating when these [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> Pokemon fans are like no no I swear this </connor>
<joey> is the new this is the generation that </joey>
<joey> everyone has to play I'm like no they </joey>
<joey> don't because at the end of the day it's </joey>
<connor> a [ __ ] children's game they want to </connor>
<connor> say that I thought Pokemon fans hate </connor>
<joey> everything they do oh okay but Pokemon </joey>
<joey> fans are the type of [ __ ] who </joey>
<garnt> will be like you know first week of </garnt>
<garnt> violent scholar coming up being like </garnt>
<garnt> this game looks like [ __ ] and then a </garnt>
<garnt> week later they'll be like all right </garnt>
<joey> I'll give it a go </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's like I'll complain about </garnt>
<joey> everything yeah it's funny you're </joey>
<joey> talking about this because I've just </joey>
<joey> been I just finished drinking the finest </joey>
<joey> wine </joey>
<joey> the the finest top tier wine because I </joey>
<joey> think I might have breath of all the </joey>
<joey> blind yeah yeah I mean I think I might </joey>
<joey> have found like a game that's come into </joey>
<joey> like my new top 10 games of all time uh </joey>
<joey> because I just finished playing God of </joey>
<joey> War the new God of War oh and that is </joey>
<joey> it's it's like incredible yeah every </joey>
<joey> every sense of the words and I'm just </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> it's I I finished it like two days ago </connor>
<connor> and it's been a while since I've just </connor>
<joey> finished a video game I'm like I don't </joey>
<joey> know what to do with my life now what </joey>
<connor> like I just feel an emptiness and I just </connor>
<connor> looked at like other because after </connor>
<joey> playing God of War I was just like I </joey>
<joey> wanted to play some other games and I </joey>
<joey> just looked through my game list and I </joey>
<joey> was like none of this is doing anything </joey>
<joey> for me I don't know one of this excites </joey>
<connor> me no no this excites me anymore how how </connor>
<joey> on Earth do I become a gamer again you </joey>
<garnt> have the post not Clarity of games yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah I don't know what to do anymore I </joey>
<joey> don't know what you should do play </joey>
<garnt> Scotland </garnt>
<garnt> no that would that would just make it </garnt>
<garnt> worse because then I would just start </garnt>
<garnt> playing it I'm like this is this isn't </garnt>
<joey> good no dude because you you'll you'll </joey>
<joey> understand the story is really good how </joey>
<connor> long is it and the music's really good </connor>
<connor> as long as the PS5 been out for </connor>
<garnt> uh years two years two years two years </garnt>
<connor> because it came out really I thought it </connor>
<garnt> was like two and a half yeah I think </garnt>
<connor> it's like two and a half years yeah I </connor>
<connor> just realized I'm like I I have I've had </connor>
<garnt> a PS5 and I've only gamed on it like one </garnt>
<garnt> time bro God of War I I think you would </garnt>
<garnt> really like it do I need to play the </garnt>
<connor> previous God yes you do see that's the </connor>
<connor> problem is that I gotta go play the old </connor>
<garnt> one I'm like oh have you played any of </garnt>
<garnt> them it's it's all like the second one </garnt>
<garnt> basically </garnt>
<garnt> um you have you played stuff like the </garnt>
<garnt> last of us or Uncharted or stuff like </garnt>
<garnt> that because it's kind of like in the </garnt>
<garnt> same kind of vein where it is like kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like a cinematic experience </garnt>
<connor> yeah it looks really good yeah just I </connor>
<connor> don't know if I have the heart of me to </connor>
<connor> go and play the old one just to play the </connor>
<garnt> new one well actually like the old one I </garnt>
<garnt> think the old one is [ __ ] fan is a </garnt>
<joey> fantastic game by itself as well </joey>
<joey> um and by itself it's still a fantastic </joey>
<joey> game you're not losing anything by </joey>
<joey> playing the old one yeah the only thing </joey>
<joey> um like the old one Builds on these like </joey>
<joey> gameplay ideas and stuff like that and </joey>
<joey> one of the biggest criticisms of the old </joey>
<joey> one was there was just not enough </joey>
<connor> variation in one like the boss battles </connor>
<connor> and two enemy types </connor>
<connor> um and like and like kind of like the </connor>
<connor> gameplay itself and that's just because </connor>
<connor> with the first one they were completely </connor>
<connor> rebuilding the franchise </connor>
<connor> so I actually really liked you know the </connor>
<garnt> new like when they introduced like new </garnt>
<garnt> gameplay it's a bit slower a bit heavier </garnt>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's the perfect introduction </garnt>
<joey> to this new game which takes all of the </joey>
<joey> ideas from this old game and then Builds </joey>
<joey> on everything basically so so when </joey>
<joey> playing the old one you'll get like the </joey>
<joey> freshness of like oh this feels good </joey>
<joey> this feels good and then just as it's </joey>
<joey> about to get boring then then you finish </joey>
<joey> the game and then you can go to the new </joey>
<joey> one where all these new ideas start </joey>
<joey> getting iterated and added on and right </joey>
<joey> yeah I think it's like the perfect </joey>
<joey> Journey as well from playing like the </joey>
<joey> first one to the second one because one </joey>
<joey> the story is amazing in both games </joey>
<joey> um and I'm surprised that they I'm </joey>
<joey> surprised they only did two games </joey>
<joey> because I expected it to be a Trilogy of </joey>
<joey> sorts but no it's it's after two games </joey>
<joey> the entire story arc is ended now so </joey>
<joey> it's the entire story arc of uh of the </joey>
<joey> Nordic gods or this this Nordic Arc per </joey>
<garnt> se and yeah honestly one of the best </garnt>
<garnt> video game stories I've uh ever </garnt>
<connor> experienced damn now you got to finish </connor>
<connor> Alden ring so you can find out what game </connor>
<garnt> of the year is this year yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay here's the thing I even and even if </garnt>
<connor> I finish Elder ring I don't think it </connor>
<connor> could beat God of War for me because you </connor>
<connor> know you know me story story important </connor>
<joey> aspects of course there's another story </joey>
<joey> in Elden </joey>
<connor> tell me the story you know them again </connor>
<joey> there's a ring of some kind I guess </joey>
<joey> because okay here's here here's the </joey>
<joey> thing uh what playing God of War made me </joey>
<connor> realize and uh this is do you want to </connor>
<joey> play a movie huh is you wanna no no no </joey>
<joey> no no no no no no I would play depth </joey>
<joey> training but that's actually the </joey>
<joey> opposite actually the opposite it made </joey>
<joey> me realize okay I actually do really </joey>
<joey> care about gameplay </joey>
<joey> but but like okay so let me let me break </joey>
<joey> this down right so there are some very </joey>
<joey> much Elden ring Souls like bosses in God </joey>
<joey> of War that are really really </joey>
<joey> challenging </joey>
<joey> um but you really have to it's like a </joey>
<joey> side quest right so it's not the main </joey>
<joey> quest story it's optional boss so the </joey>
<connor> hardest bosses in the game have nothing </connor>
<connor> to do with the mainline story right </connor>
<connor> that's good and and basically God of War </connor>
<joey> was one of those games that I enjoyed so </joey>
<joey> much that I wanted to complete like I </joey>
<joey> 100 in the game which is only the second </joey>
<joey> game in my life that I've ever 100 which </joey>
<joey> just shows how much what's your first </joey>
<garnt> one huh my first one is uh tails game </garnt>
<connor> tails of symphony what the [ __ ] wait </connor>
<connor> you've never before that you'd never 100 </connor>
<garnt> of the game no I know what okay I'll </garnt>
<garnt> tell you I'll I'll get to that I'll get </garnt>
<garnt> to that because what happened is I would </garnt>
<garnt> complete the story and I'm like okay </garnt>
<garnt> done well I don't need to play this game </garnt>
<connor> anymore right you never thought wow this </connor>
<connor> game is fun I wonder if I should just do </connor>
<garnt> the rest of the game no no that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> my point right because what I really </garnt>
<garnt> liked about God of War is that you can </garnt>
<garnt> do like one one thing side quest side </garnt>
<garnt> quests are [ __ ] incredible they </garnt>
<garnt> have as much impact into your emotions </garnt>
<joey> and the story I feel like as much as </joey>
<joey> Mainline quest lines right that's that's </joey>
<joey> one thing that makes a really really </joey>
<joey> special game that's why everyone loves </joey>
<joey> The Witcher 3 and stuff like that God of </joey>
<joey> War has the same kind of philosophy </joey>
<joey> where you can do the mainline Quest but </joey>
<joey> the side quests are in my opinion just </joey>
<joey> as high quality as the mainline quests </joey>
<joey> so I wanted to do every single aspect of </joey>
<joey> this game </joey>
<joey> um and so by being really really high </joey>
<joey> quality it's a it tricked me into doing </joey>
<joey> the optional bosses right because </joey>
<joey> otherwise I would have no interest in </joey>
<joey> doing these optional hard bosses uh </joey>
<joey> because I'm like I'm here for the story </joey>
<joey> but because the quality of the story was </joey>
<joey> so high it tricked me into wanting to do </joey>
<joey> the optional bosses and in that process </joey>
<joey> I really really [ __ ] enjoyed my time </joey>
<joey> just challenging myself and just you </joey>
<joey> know doing like the whole Souls kind of </joey>
<joey> repeat Die Repeat die and after about 20 </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] tries you finally to get that </joey>
<joey> Boston like that feels [ __ ] great </joey>
<joey> yeah I know I wouldn't have done that if </joey>
<garnt> there wasn't a storyline to play through </garnt>
<garnt> right it's it's like I with gameplay in </garnt>
<joey> order for me like you wanted to be </joey>
<joey> immersed in rather than just tacked on </joey>
<garnt> at the end I need I need to know that </garnt>
<garnt> there's a payoff at the end right other </garnt>
<connor> than just an intrinsic well isn't the </connor>
<connor> payoff the [ __ ] away so you just can't </connor>
<connor> you're like you play a game and you're </connor>
<connor> the only point of playing the game is so </connor>
<connor> that you know the ending's good yeah so </connor>
<connor> I know that so I know that I get </connor>
<connor> rewarded with something most of the time </connor>
<joey> isn't the payoff the fact that you 100 </joey>
<connor> completed the game you like fighting </connor>
<connor> games right </connor>
<connor> I mean I mean I I do not like play a </connor>
<connor> game you're like oh this mechanics are </connor>
<connor> fun I want to keep playing this you're </connor>
<connor> like you're like I've got I hope this is </connor>
<garnt> paying off soon I I'll find out I think </garnt>
<garnt> fighting games are different because I </garnt>
<garnt> think competitive games are different </garnt>
<garnt> because you get the satisfaction of </garnt>
<garnt> beating a human opponent right whereas </garnt>
<garnt> whereas in you know Souls like games </garnt>
<garnt> I've really really enjoyed the bosses </garnt>
<garnt> but there's even though I feel really </garnt>
<garnt> really satisfied there's just there's </garnt>
<garnt> always this part missing where I want I </garnt>
<garnt> want to know I'm working towards </garnt>
<garnt> something I want to know I'm working </garnt>
<garnt> towards a storyline or you know </garnt>
<connor> self-improvement not a something you're </connor>
<connor> working towards is that not valuable </connor>
<garnt> that's that's why that's why I could </garnt>
<connor> never really get into competitive games </connor>
<connor> um well I mean like for like if I when I </connor>
<connor> played like Alden ring I'm like oh I </connor>
<connor> really enjoyed the aspect of </connor>
<connor> understanding the game mechanics and </connor>
<connor> getting better at doing it yeah I </connor>
<garnt> enjoyed that I enjoyed getting better at </garnt>
<garnt> it so you necessarily care about what I </garnt>
<joey> was getting I enjoyed that as well but </joey>
<joey> it's not the core reason I would ever </joey>
<joey> play a game okay because I that I I can </joey>
<joey> appreciate it but it's kind of it's kind </joey>
<garnt> of like you need you need to trick me </garnt>
<joey> into okay getting me to care about it </joey>
<garnt> you're gonna just get better at any kind </garnt>
<connor> of thing that allows me better like it </connor>
<garnt> would be something else there which is </garnt>
<garnt> why which is why I'm really I'm really </garnt>
<garnt> curious to see how you how you react to </garnt>
<garnt> God of War right because I think God of </garnt>
<garnt> War is like I've never seen such a </garnt>
<joey> perfect marriage of gameplay and story </joey>
<joey> that blends so seamlessly God of War got </joey>
<joey> me to care about gameplay because it's </joey>
<joey> so seamlessly Blended in with the </joey>
<joey> combats </joey>
<joey> it Blended so seamlessly in with the </joey>
<garnt> story that it actually got me to care </garnt>
<joey> about the gameplay so there's a chance </joey>
<joey> that Conor might actually care about the </joey>
<garnt> story I'm one I'm wondering if he could </garnt>
<garnt> do the impossible and get Connor to care </garnt>
<garnt> about the story because it got me to </garnt>
<garnt> care about the gameplay it got me to 100 </garnt>
<garnt> in the game I [ __ ] love the gameplay </garnt>
<garnt> love the mechanics it got me to learn </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's one of those gameplay </garnt>
<garnt> mechanics that's easy to pick up but </garnt>
<garnt> really really hard to master when you </garnt>
<garnt> get to like some of the really tougher </garnt>
<garnt> optional bosses and stuff like that </garnt>
<garnt> um and it got me to really care about </garnt>
<garnt> that which I would never usually spend </garnt>
<garnt> this many hours like learning learning </garnt>
<garnt> the mechanics of the gameplay um but I </garnt>
<garnt> did it because the story is amazing and </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted to grind through the story and </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted to experience as much of this </garnt>
<garnt> world and as much of these characters </garnt>
<garnt> um as I could that um Santa Monica </garnt>
<garnt> Studio have written and I've like built </garnt>
<garnt> up in this world I wanted to experience </garnt>
<garnt> and just spend more time with them and </garnt>
<garnt> that's why I wanted to grind through the </garnt>
<garnt> gameplay was because it was just such a </garnt>
<garnt> pleasure to spend time in this world and </garnt>
<garnt> the story I'm wondering if it could get </garnt>
<garnt> you to care about the story in the world </garnt>
<connor> building </connor>
<connor> I heard a story very complicated </connor>
<garnt> um first one is very simple and the </garnt>
<connor> second one I heard was very like </connor>
<garnt> complicated it's I I'm used to jrpg </garnt>
<connor> storylines this is like a simple app </connor>
<connor> storyline to be like oh what do you mean </connor>
<joey> you didn't read the full Wikipedia page </joey>
<connor> before starting this Arc and it's like </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is wrong with you I'm not </joey>
<joey> gonna go out and Google [ __ ] yeah just </joey>
<connor> let me play the game like if I got I </connor>
<garnt> want to watch Connor play 13 cents </garnt>
<connor> the game requires you to like study </connor>
<connor> outside of the game or read [ __ ] outside </connor>
<garnt> of the game then I think it's failed as </garnt>
<garnt> a game oh no like a story it's it's not </garnt>
<garnt> in fact I've way preferred the second </garnt>
<garnt> game because the story had the story was </garnt>
<garnt> a bit more complicated there were a lot </garnt>
<joey> more aspects Connor you forget God's a </joey>
<joey> fate fan yeah </joey>
<connor> it's not even it's not even complicated </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's it's like </connor>
<connor> I'm just think I'm just thinking because </connor>
<joey> like the first the first game was about </joey>
<joey> as simple as you can get okay let me let </joey>
<joey> me tell you the story of the first game </joey>
<joey> okay so so Kratos is a dad in this one </joey>
<joey> he has a wife his wife dies and his wife </joey>
<joey> says please spread my ashes on the </joey>
<joey> highest peak on the Realms and the first </joey>
<joey> game is them going to the highest realm </joey>
<joey> I've been spreading her ashes and that's </joey>
<joey> that's the game that's right that's how </joey>
<joey> yeah I like that yeah that's that's easy </joey>
<garnt> easy second game </garnt>
<garnt> um it's about time travel comes in </garnt>
<joey> multiple Dimensions so there's Kratos </joey>
<garnt> blue yeah </garnt>
<garnt> Super Saiyan Kratos yeah the second game </garnt>
<garnt> is more about well they don't want </garnt>
<garnt> Kratos doesn't want to go to war because </garnt>
<connor> he's even though he's the God of War he </connor>
<connor> doesn't really want to go to war and </connor>
<connor> then inevitably they find uh he ends up </connor>
<connor> going to war yeah that's a very </connor>
<connor> simplified version of the events but </connor>
<connor> that's basically what happens </connor>
<connor> they needed to find a reason for </connor>
<connor> conflict to happen and that's why I </connor>
<connor> think the second game is a bit more a </connor>
<connor> bit more like has more moving Parts but </connor>
<garnt> at the end of the day it's compared to </garnt>
<garnt> like some other movies or some other </garnt>
<garnt> stories I mean I I think the [ __ ] MCU </garnt>
<garnt> is more complicated than game uh than </garnt>
<garnt> the God of War so it's it's not a </garnt>
<connor> complicated the MCU is not complicated </connor>
<connor> out of design it's complicated because </connor>
<connor> they're trying to milk it and then yeah </connor>
<connor> it's getting out of hand yeah and also </connor>
<garnt> it's [ __ ] yeah like if you can follow </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] like Game of Thrones or most I mean </garnt>
<garnt> most TV shows God of War is not that </garnt>
<garnt> complicated at all he can be if you like </garnt>
<garnt> go into like the lawn like the World </garnt>
<garnt> building and everything like that but in </garnt>
<garnt> terms like the the core story it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> fine it's fine your monkey brain can </garnt>

<joey> that it's so good yeah it's so so good </joey>
<garnt> what's that it's um </garnt>
<joey> okay is it complicated no it's it's um </joey>
<joey> uh pre-call but it's sort of connect is </joey>
<connor> a Game of Thrones but it sort of is sort </connor>
<connor> of it's like 300 400 years before Game </connor>
<joey> of Thrones do I have to watch Game of </joey>
<connor> Thrones no no no no not at all it's </connor>
<joey> really good and it's got Matt Smith and </joey>
<connor> he's really getting it Matt Smith is </connor>
<connor> Great Net he's [ __ ] awesome I love </connor>
<garnt> Matt Smith he's so good I think I'm like </garnt>

<joey> and be like I'll come back to this it's </joey>
<garnt> it's it's okay it's so good it's so good </garnt>
<joey> oh God God forbid we have all this [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> going on [ __ ] but no like it's so good </connor>
<connor> that it's like I I would not be able to </connor>
<garnt> rest until I've continued watching </garnt>
<garnt> everything all right I mean it reminds </garnt>
<garnt> me of like early Game of Thrones We're </garnt>
<garnt> not gonna bring up this like can of </garnt>
<garnt> worms again right because </garnt>
<garnt> you didn't like early game you didn't </garnt>
<connor> actually like good television that was </connor>
<garnt> right you want [ __ ] it's it's it's it's </garnt>
<joey> not that I don't okay I'm I'm gonna I'm </joey>
<connor> gonna bring this back up because I </connor>
<connor> remember I remember when Charles I'm </connor>
<connor> remember when Charlie was talking about </connor>
<connor> remember when he filmed the Charlie </connor>
<connor> episode he was like yeah I think like I </connor>
<garnt> think like anime fans are pretty chill I </garnt>
<garnt> I think like film and TV fans are the </garnt>
<garnt> most toxic I was like ah I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> Charlie and then the [ __ ] episode </garnt>
<connor> came out your take was so colossally </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] that I think everyone across the </garnt>
<joey> board I don't even believe it I think </joey>
<joey> even people have never watched Game of </joey>
<garnt> Thrones late I don't it's probably not </garnt>
<garnt> because I I look back at it I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I still I still agree with that </garnt>
<garnt> take because </garnt>
<garnt> it's because I didn't even okay here's </garnt>
<garnt> the here's the thing that confuses me </garnt>
<garnt> right here's the thing that confused me </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't even say that I I didn't even </garnt>
<garnt> say that I thought the first like half </garnt>
<garnt> Game of Thrones was better I just said I </garnt>
<connor> preferred like the latter half of Game </connor>
<connor> of Thrones </connor>
<garnt> there's a big [ __ ] diff okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing okay go on explain </garnt>
<garnt> yourself I I will explain I will explain </garnt>
<garnt> myself okay I will explain myself I will </garnt>
<garnt> okay you're wrong okay so </garnt>
<garnt> uh I I think I mentioned this briefly in </garnt>
<garnt> a recent video I did but to me I value </garnt>
<garnt> stuff more like even if it's not </garnt>
<garnt> perfectly executed versus something that </garnt>
<garnt> might be highly claimed highly like very </garnt>
<garnt> very well executed that doesn't appeal </garnt>
<garnt> to me the reason the reason the latter </garnt>
<garnt> half of the Game of Thrones appealed to </garnt>
<garnt> me more than the early seasons of Game </garnt>
<garnt> of Thrones is in the early season Game </garnt>
<garnt> of Thrones great writing great </garnt>
<garnt> television okay but a lot of the stories </garnt>
<joey> in Game of Thrones it was it wasn't like </joey>
<joey> five stories that are in Connected there </joey>
<joey> were like five separate stories so you </joey>
<joey> had the stories going with he had the </joey>
<joey> story with King's Landing the story with </joey>
<joey> Daenerys the story up in the wall </joey>
<joey> they're all really interesting stories </joey>
<joey> but they were all like their own kind of </joey>
<joey> individual stories in that sense and </joey>
<joey> what really interests me and what I love </joey>
<joey> seeing in what I love what I value and </joey>
<joey> what I love seeing is different elements </joey>
<joey> kind of like colliding in together so I </joey>
<joey> the thing I was waiting for in Game of </joey>
<joey> Thrones was to see these separate </joey>
<joey> entities these separate elements yeah </joey>
<joey> start colliding in together right and </joey>
<joey> then I still really really appreciated </joey>
<joey> the first four seasons of Game of </joey>
<joey> Thrones but when I've really really </joey>
<joey> start to get interested was you know uh </joey>
<joey> when Tyrion you know got shipped off to </joey>
<joey> Daenerys and I was like oh okay we're </joey>
<joey> seeing one character interact with </joey>
<joey> another character and then and then </joey>
<joey> elements Stark lines together and I </joey>
<joey> found that interesting and then you know </joey>
<joey> when I'm not gonna say season eight was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] even close to me it was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> okay when I say I prefer the latter </joey>
<joey> Seasons everything but season eight </joey>
<joey> season eight was [ __ ] yeah but like </joey>
<joey> season six and season seven I would say </joey>
<garnt> they were they were a bit messy they </garnt>
<garnt> weren't well executed but they had </garnt>
<garnt> elements in them that I was waiting to </garnt>
<garnt> see for Game of Thrones this entire time </garnt>
<garnt> and just I I you know I can say that I </garnt>
<garnt> think the first four seasons were better </garnt>
<garnt> written but I can also say that even </garnt>
<garnt> though the latter seasons were more </garnt>
<garnt> metally executed had worse writing I </garnt>
<garnt> still I still see them as very very </garnt>
<garnt> entertaining television I still see them </garnt>
<garnt> I I think the reason people clown on </garnt>
<garnt> their late season so far so much is </garnt>
<garnt> because the first four seasons were so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] good right yeah I mean so I'll </connor>
<joey> explain this without spoiling anything </joey>
<joey> and without you know going into too much </joey>
<joey> detail </joey>
<joey> um so the the you mentioned that like </joey>
<joey> they're all individual stories about </joey>
<joey> because the way it works Jerry is that </joey>
<joey> Game of Thrones will like be like here's </joey>
<joey> here's this scene where it's happening </joey>
<joey> at this location right and then another </joey>
<joey> scene in this location across the other </joey>
<joey> side of the country yeah and so it was </joey>
<joey> like God said it was building up to that </joey>
<joey> stuff was kind of gradually they were </joey>
<joey> kind of intertwining yeah and the first </joey>
<joey> three or four seasons there's stuff </joey>
<joey> happening and it tended to be quite </joey>
<joey> insular but there would be stuff that </joey>
<joey> happened quite a lot that would have </joey>
<joey> Rippling effects and I think the reason </joey>
<joey> why people like Game of Thrones so much </joey>
<joey> was that if any other Rider had had </joey>
<joey> written it it you know they it would </joey>
<joey> have </joey>
<joey> that when something happened in Game of </joey>
<joey> Thrones it was very like Slow Burn and </joey>
<joey> minute how it would Ripple but but </joey>
<joey> everything was into consideration if </joey>
<joey> somebody did or said something it would </joey>
<joey> have such a like really subtle effect or </joey>
<joey> every single like </joey>
<joey> yeah there was every single interaction </joey>
<connor> was so carefully considered yeah and I I </connor>
<joey> what really pissed off a lot of fans is </joey>
<joey> that one after the like season four it </joey>
<joey> kind of went to like okay these </joey>
<connor> characters just fundamentally just </connor>
<connor> changed like they just weren't writing </connor>
<connor> them the same as they were in the first </connor>
<connor> four seasons they weren't as intelligent </connor>
<connor> they started becoming more dumbed down </connor>
<garnt> and also like travel became really </garnt>
<connor> really fast as well so before in in Game </connor>
<garnt> of Thrones I was traveling it would </garnt>
<joey> genuinely take like maybe a season for </joey>
<joey> someone to travel right yeah or maybe a </joey>
<joey> few episodes </joey>
<joey> um and even then that might have been </joey>
<joey> too fast right like yeah I it was it was </joey>
<joey> all very subtle and very very realistic </joey>
<joey> it was meant to be like a serious </joey>
<joey> political drama where if you said </joey>
<joey> something and pissed off the wrong </joey>
<joey> person maybe in a season no two when </joey>
<joey> they when they go to somewhere else it </joey>
<joey> might have a ramification right yeah </joey>
<joey> every single thing was taken into </joey>
<joey> consideration all the counter </joey>
<joey> interactions were so perfect and then in </joey>
<joey> season five six seven eight it started </joey>
<joey> getting dumber and dumber and dumber and </joey>
<joey> like you mentioned like like there's a </joey>
<joey> character called Tyrion who was </joey>
<joey> typically quite smart and he just </joey>
<joey> becomes a [ __ ] stupid idiot in like </joey>
<joey> the past in the past like three seasons </joey>
<joey> at the end he just becomes dumb and and </joey>
<joey> is com the complete different character </joey>
<joey> to what he was written as originally so </joey>
<joey> people were pissed off because all the </joey>
<joey> characters got stupider and and none of </joey>
<joey> the like the ramifications were </joey>
<joey> happening it was just kind of like duh </joey>
<joey> big fight happened now and then </joey>
<joey> characters would suddenly have a lot </joey>
<joey> more plot armor than before and some of </joey>
<joey> the characters shooting down to the </joey>
<joey> lowest common denominator yeah because </joey>
<joey> one of the one of the things that Game </joey>
<joey> of Thrones did really well if you </joey>
<joey> haven't seen it is that when a character </joey>
<joey> would be in a fight they had written it </joey>
<joey> so well that you genuinely didn't know </joey>
<joey> who was gonna live and die yeah like </joey>
<joey> there was the plot armor was never </joey>
<joey> transparent I was never like apparent </joey>
<joey> sorry and you never felt like someone </joey>
<joey> could 100 live just because they were </joey>
<joey> this character yeah because the first </joey>
<joey> season sets it up that hey you know </joey>
<joey> characters are gonna die right away like </joey>
<joey> characters that you thought were the </joey>
<joey> main person or characters you thought </joey>
<joey> were very important to the story will </joey>
<joey> die yeah and towards the end it was like </joey>
<joey> this is the main character they will not </joey>
<joey> die yeah and no matter what situation we </joey>
<joey> put them in you can be pretty sure that </joey>
<joey> then there's not going to be </joey>
<connor> consequences and I think so it became </connor>
<connor> less like a a very very thought out </connor>
<connor> written TV show and kind of went to a </connor>
<connor> triple A Hollywood movie where we know </connor>
<connor> the main guy wins at the end yeah and I </connor>
<joey> think that was the problem like it went </joey>
<joey> down to like a regular formula that </joey>
<connor> everyone's yeah because even the writers </connor>
<connor> they said like publicly they were like </connor>
<connor> hey we want to make it so that some like </connor>
<connor> a football player who doesn't care about </connor>
<connor> fantasy can enjoy right and it was like </connor>
<connor> okay so yeah the writers just fully </connor>
<connor> admit that they dumbed it down yeah like </connor>
<garnt> it just went dumb and yes those moments </garnt>
<garnt> that everyone was waiting for these big </garnt>
<garnt> fights and these big like collidings of </garnt>
<garnt> Worlds and all of these like kind of </garnt>
<garnt> rivalries coming out to play would have </garnt>
<garnt> been [ __ ] amazing if they were </garnt>
<garnt> written correctly oh no but they won but </garnt>
<garnt> obviously they were still it was still </garnt>
<garnt> as a fan who would probably watched Five </garnt>
<connor> Seasons a part of you is still like oh </connor>
<connor> this is still kind of cool like you're </connor>
<connor> still like this the battles you're like </connor>
<joey> it's kind of hard and do you think that </joey>
<connor> happened because like the fan base got </connor>
<joey> more like I guess more generalized </joey>
<garnt> because there's a few reasons so there's </garnt>
<garnt> a few reasons one is that they kind of </garnt>
<garnt> ran out of books to uh adapt yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> the books only went to about halfway you </garnt>
<connor> could see such a big shift in the </connor>
<connor> writing from when they just ran out of </connor>
<connor> materials because uh I believe Joe R </connor>
<connor> Martin gave him like gave them the </connor>
<joey> Baseline of where the story yeah </joey>
<joey> but not like the nuances right yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> so I you know I I look at this late </joey>
<joey> season of Game of Thrones and I'm like </joey>
<joey> where these character ends up where </joey>
<garnt> these characters end up make sense story </garnt>
<garnt> wise how they ended up there does not </garnt>
<garnt> make sense at all yeah you know a lot of </garnt>
<connor> things were also mentioned and then </connor>
<connor> never brought up again yeah and also </connor>
<joey> they had requested I can't remember it </joey>
<joey> was supposed to be 10 seasons yeah and </joey>
<joey> for some reason it ended up being eight </joey>
<joey> yeah and so they rushed to feel you feel </joey>
<joey> that it's eight like but even with how </joey>
<garnt> bad the writing was I I don't know if it </garnt>
<connor> even would have still been good by the </connor>
<garnt> end of it because it was so [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean I see I I don't I don't </garnt>
<connor> think it was [ __ ] I think like okay but </connor>
<connor> if season it was hot garbage dude see </connor>
<connor> okay season that hot Garbage I'd say </connor>
<connor> season five it was yeah five five to </connor>
<garnt> seven it's like a solid eight eight hour </garnt>
<connor> turn seven was not good seven was not </connor>
<connor> good I don't like seven either I think I </connor>
<connor> think five is where you start to see the </connor>
<connor> cracks six is where it starts to get </connor>
<garnt> worrying seven is where you're like oh </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's ruined and then eight is like oh </garnt>
<garnt> God oh God oh God it was so bad it was </garnt>
<garnt> really it was horrible could you imagine </garnt>
<garnt> that you've been with something for like </garnt>
<garnt> 12 10 years of your life and then right </garnt>
<joey> at the end they're like let's just [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it all up let's make it [ __ ] and and I </joey>
<joey> thought I genuinely thought I was like </joey>
<connor> I'm over Game of Thrones I'm done I </connor>
<joey> don't care about this world anymore yeah </joey>
<connor> I'm I I do not yeah and then House of </connor>
<joey> dragons started it's so good and it made </joey>
<joey> me realize just how amazing like the </joey>
<joey> world of Game of Thrones is and I'm sure </joey>
<garnt> people watching this don't give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> about Game of Thrones but generally the </garnt>
<garnt> world is so interesting I think it's one </garnt>
<garnt> of if not my favorite like fantasy world </garnt>
<garnt> it is it is I think the way it's been </garnt>
<joey> built up is so realistic and you could </joey>
<garnt> see some kind of parallels to the real </garnt>
<joey> world and how seriously politics is </joey>
<garnt> right no that's that's that's that's the </garnt>
<garnt> reason I got invested in the world of </garnt>
<garnt> Game of Thrones and that's the reason I </garnt>
<garnt> really still enjoyed the later Seasons </garnt>
<garnt> it's because you got to see different </garnt>
<garnt> aspects of this world collide together </garnt>
<garnt> and I just you know when you've when </garnt>
<garnt> you've watched enough things I've you </garnt>
<garnt> just come to realize you I know all my </garnt>
<garnt> tastes are you know I can still </garnt>
<garnt> appreciate good television but I know </garnt>
<garnt> what core elements appeal to me and </garnt>
<garnt> there are more core elements that appeal </garnt>
<garnt> to me in the later seasons of Game of </garnt>
<garnt> Thrones even if it was more messily </garnt>
<garnt> executed and I've just come to value </garnt>
<garnt> that more and I feel like there are a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of shows out there there are a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of I mean I [ __ ] like I thought of </garnt>
<garnt> course I would say this I [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> isekai right but like but like I'm sorry </garnt>
<garnt> but like there are enough games enough </garnt>
<garnt> shows enough movies that are out there </garnt>
<garnt> that might not be perfectly executed </garnt>
<garnt> might not have the best execution but I </garnt>
<garnt> still on a personal enjoyment level </garnt>
<garnt> still really really like even more so </garnt>
<garnt> than maybe some critically you can't </garnt>
<garnt> clip critically Acclaim shows in that </garnt>
<joey> same genre yeah because if to me like if </joey>
<joey> I were to use like an anime analogy for </joey>
<joey> me someone who's never seen Game of </joey>
<joey> Thrones it sounded like it started off </joey>
<joey> as like you know the the political </joey>
<joey> fantasy and you know very nuanced type </joey>
<joey> of heavily detailed world of something </joey>
<connor> like Kingdom yeah and then went to </connor>
<joey> something like fairy tale yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah it went it went where it's like </connor>
<joey> nothing makes sense but the main guy </joey>
<joey> wins and there's lots of big fights it's </joey>
<joey> just like it's insane when you when you </joey>
<joey> watch uh oh you read about how you know </joey>
<joey> very subtle things have happened in the </joey>
<joey> show you're like this is insane like the </joey>
<joey> level of detail yeah yeah and and </joey>
<connor> thought that's put into how all of these </connor>
<connor> worlds and characters interact is just </connor>
<joey> insane yeah </joey>
<joey> um it's Kingdom to fairy tale yeah it's </joey>
<joey> it's genuinely Game of Thrones showing </joey>
<joey> it yeah from the sounds of it yeah it's </joey>
<joey> probably why I enjoy it </joey>
<connor> but hopefully he finishes the books </connor>
<garnt> I mean like I would still have preferred </garnt>
<joey> the later Seasons with all these </joey>
<joey> elements compliance we with the same </joey>
<joey> nuances of like that would be in the </joey>
<joey> perfect world right but I still go I </joey>
<joey> still got what I wanted and I was </joey>
<joey> entertained thoroughly </joey>
<connor> um and you know I was just I was just </connor>
<connor> thinking is this really hotter than my </connor>
<connor> bread take you know yes yes </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like oh all I was trying to say </garnt>
<connor> is I have my own [ __ ] yeah you have </connor>
<connor> to understand right I think the Game of </connor>
<connor> Thrones ending in final season was like </connor>
<connor> one of the biggest betrayals of like TV </connor>
<connor> to the fan base more than Game of </connor>
<connor> Thrones it's very on brand yeah right </connor>
<connor> like it's literally on brand like can </connor>
<connor> you think of a TV show that burned its </connor>
<connor> fan base harder like I I genuinely can't </connor>
<connor> like I can't think of anything that is </connor>
<connor> up to was that hyped it was that big of </connor>
<connor> a deal that [ __ ] up that bad </connor>
<connor> like no no fairy tale no they [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> still love it </connor>
<connor> I'm plenty of shows go to [ __ ] but you </connor>
<connor> okay not on the scale that Game of </connor>
<connor> Thrones did it right this was like a you </connor>
<joey> know everything it did literally it was </joey>
<connor> like a day and night difference it was </connor>
<joey> like it went from everybody loves this </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] to now everyone in the western </connor>
<connor> world was talking about yeah yeah it was </connor>
<joey> Non-Stop and it also just goes to show </joey>
<joey> clearly how impactful that was that when </joey>
<joey> yeah they were able to green light so </joey>
<joey> many spin-offs that you know even though </joey>
<joey> everyone was like Game of Thrones </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] sucks that when they brought out </joey>
<joey> this new prequel that they shoveled </joey>
<joey> shoved way too much [ __ ] money into </joey>
<joey> that the moment the first episode </joey>
<joey> dropped everyone was like hype </joey>
<joey> it's so good everyone get back on this </joey>
<joey> it's actually hype it's actually good </joey>
<joey> and to be fair the first season was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing they only have like one </joey>
<joey> book um to work off of and it's finished </joey>
<joey> the story is completely done yeah but </joey>
<joey> they're gonna make like three or four </joey>
<joey> seasons from just one book </joey>
<joey> um and it's insane like even the George </joey>
<joey> RR Martin has said that some of the </joey>
<joey> characters in the TV show are portrayed </joey>
<joey> better in the TV show than in his mind </joey>
<joey> on the book oh wow he's like he uh </joey>
<joey> there's a character in particular that </joey>
<joey> was done really well </joey>
<joey> and he said like I wish I could go back </joey>
<joey> and redo those pages now I wish I could </joey>
<joey> take them out because it's so much </joey>
<joey> better on TV it's so so so so so good </joey>
<joey> please if you got burnt on Game of </joey>
<joey> Thrones give House of dragon a shot it's </joey>
<joey> so worth your time it's so good yeah </joey>
<joey> it's probably one of my favorite like </joey>
<joey> first seasons of TV in a long time wow </joey>
<garnt> all right yeah I mean I I will finish it </garnt>
<joey> so so good it's I I will I will reserve </joey>
<garnt> my opinion I'm sure everyone's raring to </garnt>
<garnt> hear my opinion on House of dragons it </garnt>
<garnt> comes back later </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna kill you gone if they added </joey>
<garnt> some more armor then I would have liked </garnt>
<garnt> it yeah I mean it's it's good like like </garnt>
<garnt> I said I'm I I always I with certain TV </garnt>
<garnt> shows I can appreciate I can always </garnt>
<garnt> appreciate good TV but sometimes I just </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes I'm just waiting for something </garnt>
<garnt> to interest me and I don't always know </garnt>
<garnt> what that is sometimes it's a certain </garnt>
<garnt> like plot element sometimes it's like </garnt>
<garnt> the cinematography or the way it's like </garnt>
<garnt> filmed or something like that yeah it's </garnt>
<joey> I get it there are just some there's </joey>
<joey> some shows is where it's just like I </joey>
<joey> can't explain why I like this like I </joey>
<joey> know it sucks yeah well I just like I </joey>
<joey> don't know love Island you know like </joey>
<joey> that as an example </joey>
<garnt> Love is Blind for example right like I </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] love that show I know that </garnt>
<garnt> show's trash it's just it's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> reality TV right but and I can't explain </garnt>
<joey> why it's good I just can't stop watching </joey>
<joey> it you know it's like it's like and he </joey>
<joey> is a guy show right it's like you can't </joey>
<joey> explain why it's good you probably know </joey>
<joey> it sucks but you're probably gonna keep </joey>
<garnt> watching it has has that has there ever </garnt>
<garnt> been a show that you you know is like </garnt>
<connor> flawed not not like it's not like </connor>
<connor> something that's like obviously trashy </connor>
<connor> but but you know it's like flawed not </connor>
<connor> executed perfectly but there's not been </connor>
<joey> another show like it and you're just </joey>
<joey> like you know what I'm I'ma look over it </joey>
<joey> you know I still enjoy it because like </joey>
<joey> for me I I recently just made a video </joey>
<joey> about it it was recreaters which is it's </joey>
<connor> got like such a unique idea in terms of </connor>
<garnt> just like you know when I watch a video </garnt>
<connor> I watched it by the way oh you watched </connor>
<connor> it yeah yeah I completely forgot about </connor>
<garnt> it yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> because one thing I've noticed is that </garnt>
<garnt> you eat like that that kind of show you </garnt>
<joey> either think it's just okay but everyone </joey>
<joey> who likes that show really really really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] likes that show yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> um and I'm one of those people and </joey>
<joey> that's just because it was like it </joey>
<joey> wasn't like the best executed way just </joey>
<joey> had such an interesting unique idea that </joey>
<joey> you don't see anywhere else that you're </joey>
<joey> just like okay you know maybe I don't </joey>
<garnt> really give a [ __ ] I don't really give a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] I've really enjoyed it was </joey>
<joey> definitely like it was definitely like a </joey>
<joey> polarizing show when it was airing </joey>
<joey> because I remember it's like you either </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] love this show or you're </joey>
<connor> like yeah oh yeah I do remember when it </connor>
<garnt> is because I I remember the conversation </garnt>
<joey> surrounding it yeah and I watched it and </joey>
<garnt> I think I only watched four or five </garnt>
<garnt> episodes and I stopped because yeah too </garnt>
<garnt> much talking yeah exactly </garnt>
<connor> um yeah and it was at the pace bogged </connor>
<garnt> down a lot yeah yeah because like I I </garnt>
<garnt> think that's why a lot of you know </garnt>
<garnt> that's why the indie game scene has like </garnt>
<garnt> grown so much whereas it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> these game developers who instead of </garnt>
<garnt> trying to compete against the AAA games </garnt>
<garnt> doing like the you know as much as I </garnt>
<garnt> love God of War it does very much go </garnt>
<connor> with the AAA game formula at least it </connor>
<garnt> deserves the triple a title it deserves </garnt>
<garnt> the Triple A game title and like a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of other AAA games but I feel like the </garnt>
<garnt> indie game scene has grown so much </garnt>
<garnt> because you have a lot of these </garnt>
<garnt> developers who are just like I really </garnt>
<garnt> like this one idea and I don't see any </garnt>
<connor> other game doing just this one idea of </connor>
<connor> doing it really really well huh </connor>
<connor> is that name a better jumping all right </connor>
<joey> I'll wait Mario </joey>
<garnt> I'm not as good yeah my man's invented I </garnt>
<joey> guess I guess James games like jumping </joey>
<joey> where you take this really really cool </joey>
<joey> idea yeah focus on nothing else but that </joey>
<garnt> core idea is he gonna appeal to the </garnt>
<garnt> masses no but the people who like it </garnt>
<garnt> they really really really like it you </garnt>
<connor> know and I feel like one of the best </connor>
<joey> games that came out you know in the past </joey>
<joey> five ten years A lot of them have been </joey>
<joey> Indie Games yeah yeah when you talk </joey>
<joey> about like like undertale when that was </joey>
<connor> out right that was insane that was </connor>
<garnt> everywhere yeah I still gotta play </garnt>
<garnt> undertale it's so good all memes aside </garnt>
<garnt> megalovania and sex memes </garnt>
<joey> I don't give a [ __ ] megalovania is </joey>
<joey> probably one of the best [ __ ] music </joey>
<joey> in a video game I've heard in a long </joey>
<joey> time I know the memes exist but every </joey>
<joey> time I hear I'm like I play that [ __ ] at </joey>
<connor> the gym I'm just like this is </connor>
<connor> true hype for the gym it gets me pumped </connor>
<connor> up I'm like I gotta defeat Sans </connor>
<garnt> God what are you gonna ask will I still </garnt>
<connor> enjoy it yes despite the facts that I've </connor>
<garnt> been exposed to so much of it I think so </garnt>
<connor> yeah I think like that yeah no matter </connor>
<connor> how you get exposed to it I think the </connor>
<connor> ultimately the experience you have with </connor>
<connor> it is definitely going to be different </connor>
<joey> from him I feel it's a very personal </joey>
<joey> game where like you know because again I </joey>
<garnt> feel the story is very dependent on how </garnt>
<garnt> you perceive it and how you want to go </garnt>
<garnt> about it because it has the multiple </garnt>
<garnt> endings and stuff yeah yeah yeah so it's </garnt>
<garnt> like I feel it's it's a really good game </garnt>
<garnt> to just kind of like sit down and play </garnt>
<garnt> with yourself and really just like get </garnt>
<joey> fully immersed in it yeah um because I </joey>
<joey> feel like I don't know I tried streaming </joey>
<joey> it once and I'm like I couldn't really </joey>
<connor> get into it because there's just like </connor>
<joey> too many outside Falls just like yeah I </joey>
<connor> think I would say it's a game to just </connor>
<connor> like play on your own terms yeah </connor>
<joey> um also the music is and story is </joey>
<joey> amazing because Toby Fox yeah the story </joey>
<joey> is really good I mean I care about it so </joey>
<connor> that's saying something that's that's </connor>
<connor> tough to get me to be like Oh I'm sad is </connor>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> all to say that I think Toby Fox is a </joey>
<joey> better musician than he's a Storyteller </joey>
<connor> uh I don't know I I I'm not sure what </connor>
<connor> other music he's done he did some music </connor>
<joey> for Pokemon he did just a lot of pieces </joey>
<joey> for the new people he's very talented </joey>
<connor> either way he's super tough this is like </connor>
<connor> this is like no matter what which one </connor>
<connor> he's better at he's still better than me </connor>
<connor> and everything </connor>
<garnt> talking about like very Niche games that </garnt>
<garnt> would you know only appeal to you </garnt>
<garnt> there's been a game series that I've </garnt>
<garnt> been thinking about getting into it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's a very very Niche jrpg series oh </garnt>
<joey> God </joey>
<joey> something like this you would [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hate Connor </joey>
<joey> um but I don't I don't even know if I </joey>
<joey> have the heart to commit to this right </joey>
<joey> what uh have you ever heard of like the </joey>
<joey> trails of atlia series or Trails yes I </joey>
<joey> have heard about it okay so I've never </joey>
<joey> played it so so I've been like so for </joey>
<joey> the past like two months I've been </joey>
<joey> trying to like psych myself up to see if </joey>
<joey> it's if it's worth getting into so so </joey>
<joey> let me that's so familiar okay let me </joey>
<joey> break let me break this down to you okay </joey>
<garnt> so I I I hear like bits and pieces of </garnt>
<garnt> this of this game series right and then </garnt>
<garnt> the first thing I search up is how to </garnt>
<garnt> get into the trails series on YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> and I swear to God one of the top videos </garnt>
<garnt> the the video was how do how to how to </garnt>
<garnt> get into the trail series one hour and </garnt>
<garnt> 50 minutes long </garnt>
<garnt> bro and I was like oh oh boy oh boy and </garnt>
<garnt> I was I was like surely surely there's a </garnt>
<garnt> shorter video than one hour 15 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> the shortest video I could find was a 20 </garnt>
<garnt> minute explanation that's the shortest </garnt>
<garnt> that's the shortest so this is this is </garnt>
<garnt> like setting up the stage for the type </garnt>
<garnt> of game series that this this game </garnt>
<joey> series is okay yes yes I have I have </joey>
<garnt> seen this before yeah that's the kiseki </garnt>
<garnt> series yeah yeah so I've never gone into </garnt>
<garnt> them though because I've heard it's like </garnt>
<joey> it's got such a high Benchmark to get </joey>
<garnt> into it yes yes so so before before even </garnt>
<garnt> deciding okay so I'll explain to you Joe </garnt>
<garnt> because I've done I've I've done </garnt>
<joey> research just to see if I want to get </joey>
<joey> into this game okay I haven't even just </joey>
<joey> played the game I've watched like I've </joey>
<joey> watched like these full videos just to </joey>
<joey> see if I wanted to play it right </joey>
<joey> uh because it's a game series that has </joey>
<joey> ran on for about 15 years or something </joey>
<joey> yeah right it's got 11 games </joey>
<joey> and what what I find really really </joey>
<joey> interesting and why I'm like oh should I </joey>
<joey> commit to this game is that every game </joey>
<garnt> is following on from one giant </garnt>
<garnt> overarching story so it's it's a game </garnt>
<garnt> where you have it's according you know </garnt>
<garnt> according to a lot of the people that </garnt>
<garnt> play it's got one of the best examples </garnt>
<garnt> of World building in gaming period it's </garnt>
<connor> like the one piece of games I'm sure I </connor>
<garnt> could [ __ ] make a big block yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so it's it's like it takes place in </garnt>
<garnt> this one all 11 games takes place in </garnt>
<garnt> this one kind of like big universe right </garnt>
<garnt> and each game it kind it's it's similar </garnt>
<garnt> to I guess something like Game of </garnt>
<garnt> Thrones right where you know you have </garnt>
<garnt> individual story arcs in different </garnt>
<joey> countries different areas of this world </joey>
<joey> that slowly interconnect and mingle and </joey>
<joey> start like characters from previous </joey>
<joey> games start to like have a proper big </joey>
<joey> effect on characters on story arcs in </joey>
<joey> like a different country and then slowly </joey>
<joey> start to mingle in and collide together </joey>
<joey> and I'm like [ __ ] that that's that </joey>
<joey> sounds like that sounds that sounds like </joey>
<joey> season six again </joey>
<joey> that sounds like everything I want in a </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] game that sounds like everything </connor>
<joey> I want in a video game series 11 games </joey>
<garnt> it sounds like and it's still ongoing </garnt>
<joey> God I'm never gonna [ __ ] see you all </joey>
<joey> right it kind of sounds like the Dune of </joey>
<joey> video games you know kind of like </joey>
<garnt> different planets and like the planets </garnt>
<joey> interact with one another yeah it's all </joey>
<garnt> based in this one yeah and like one of </garnt>
<connor> the biggest things I've heard is that </connor>
<connor> it's not like it's not like different </connor>
<connor> games Cameo into each other it's not </connor>
<connor> like one person cameos into this this </connor>
<connor> different game it's like prop games have </connor>
<connor> a proper impact on what happens stressed </connor>
<garnt> out yeah like the story the story arcs </garnt>
<garnt> of one game have a proper impact to what </garnt>
<garnt> happens in a different country different </garnt>
<joey> country story arc and I'm like holy [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> you know gone I'm about to finish the </joey>
<connor> Pokemon game </connor>
<connor> if you're committed </connor>
<garnt> it's honestly like I I remember I </garnt>
<garnt> remember like reading something about it </garnt>
<garnt> I was like this this sounds something </garnt>
<joey> like I could be interested in and the </joey>
<joey> more I researched more I'm like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> this this seems like a game that I would </joey>
<joey> really enjoy but yeah I can't 11 games </joey>
<garnt> 11 games maybe I'll just watch one other </garnt>
<joey> video just uh </joey>
<joey> let me watch one more hour and 30 minute </joey>
<garnt> video so the thing is is Imagine This </garnt>
<joey> RPG where every single the NPCs that you </joey>
<joey> meet you can actually play them in the </joey>
<connor> later years </connor>
<garnt> you have like 30 plus characters that </garnt>
<garnt> just that just means every character </garnt>
<garnt> matters in every character oh yes oh </garnt>
<garnt> that sounds like okay I've seen this </garnt>
<connor> first game trails in the sky yeah uh I I </connor>
<connor> I think I had a friend who had this uh </connor>
<joey> on like Windows I think </joey>
<joey> um and he was like yeah because I </joey>
<joey> specifically remember I remember the bar </joey>
<joey> of Entry being so high for this game </joey>
<joey> series because my friend was like he was </joey>
<joey> playing this game and I'm like oh that's </joey>
<joey> a really cool game what is it and he's </joey>
<joey> like you shouldn't know </joey>
<connor> you don't need to you don't want to know </connor>
<connor> should every character matter </connor>
<joey> I disagree I don't think every character </joey>
<joey> should matter </joey>
<connor> means if it's if it's </connor>
<garnt> if they'll be ones who impact that story </garnt>
<connor> more but I think it's okay to have NPCs </connor>
<connor> and characters that don't really do much </connor>
<garnt> but I think it's a cool concept where </garnt>
<connor> you know you can be NPCs and someone </connor>
<connor> else's story at the same time that </connor>
<garnt> doesn't mean you can't have your own </garnt>
<joey> story which it sounds like it's it's see </joey>
<joey> because I've read the Dune books and </joey>
<connor> it's exactly the same okay it's like </connor>
<garnt> it's like the NPCs in this first book </garnt>
<joey> are now the main characters in this </joey>
<connor> ladder book that makes sense I like the </connor>
<connor> Dune world I just think that when you </connor>
<connor> just the way you're describing it to me </connor>
<connor> it sounds awful um because at least Dune </connor>
<connor> is like hey here's a nice there's a nice </connor>
<garnt> like sandwich have a little bite of this </garnt>
<connor> sandwich right and then it's [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> ginormous and you don't realize how big </joey>
<joey> the sandwich is before you get a bite </joey>
<joey> and you're like well that tastes pretty </joey>
<joey> good actually </joey>
<joey> does this not sound like that too no </joey>
<garnt> this sounds like that's only because you </garnt>
<garnt> know how many that's only because people </garnt>
<garnt> know how many games are in this season I </garnt>
<connor> know how much Dune there is but also </connor>
<connor> like I I just was like oh if I can watch </connor>
<connor> the movie it seems good you know that's </connor>
<joey> a palatable way to to well then I'll do </joey>
<joey> this I would be like oh play this first </joey>
<connor> game so if you good yeah and if it's </connor>
<connor> good you had to watch an hour video just </connor>
<connor> just to play the game we're talking </connor>
<joey> about that's no that's not accessible </joey>
<joey> let me see how long it takes on average </joey>
<garnt> to beat the first game this is too much </garnt>
<garnt> for me it was it was mostly just I think </garnt>
<connor> I was just tell me you won't you don't </connor>
<connor> want 100 other games but you're like </connor>
<connor> I'll get into this 500 hour game </connor>
<garnt> collection yes yes </garnt>
<garnt> I I okay like I said if I know that </garnt>
<joey> there's a payoff if I know that there is </joey>
<joey> that can not be a payoff worth if </joey>
<joey> there's something that I really like and </joey>
<garnt> really appeals to me I will be willing </garnt>
<garnt> to grind through Heaven and Hell to </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] get to that according to how </joey>
<joey> long to beat main story 40 hours easy </joey>
<garnt> easy for one game </garnt>
<connor> but if you care about the NPCs yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> it says completionist is 65 which is not </joey>
<connor> too bad but you [ __ ] mean not too bad </connor>
<connor> that's a full-time job for a week dude </connor>
<joey> completionist for like Final Fantasy 10 </joey>
<joey> is like 120 hours I think that I've done </joey>
<connor> that before I think game devs and like </connor>
<garnt> on G's like because you know I used to I </garnt>
<joey> used to care about gamer school why I </joey>
<garnt> don't know why </garnt>
<joey> like Pac-Man and Shameless School Xbox </joey>
<joey> games oh yeah oh you told me because I </joey>
<joey> know that sometimes you like play </joey>
<garnt> against someone in card right and you </garnt>
<joey> want to [ __ ] talk them and you open up </joey>
<garnt> their profile like oh it's gonna go 200 </garnt>
<connor> games yeah they'd open up my profile </connor>
<connor> it'd be like 90 000 game of school and </connor>
<connor> they'd be like oh [ __ ] I want to mess </connor>
<joey> with this guy well no I want to be the </joey>
<joey> same way if I interact with another jrpg </joey>
<joey> player they'll be like oh you're a jrpg </joey>
<joey> fan what have you played and then I'll </joey>
<joey> be like finish the entire Trail </joey>
<joey> seriously be like </joey>
<joey> oh my God </joey>
<connor> I like the quantifiable number and so I </connor>
<connor> used to just play games a lot and I </connor>
<connor> would just play some games that were bad </connor>
<joey> but there is a quantifiable number 11 </joey>
<joey> games is it like a score a score that </joey>
<joey> you can show to other people and people </joey>
<joey> see right oh so that's what I enjoyed </joey>
<joey> but I would play games I didn't even </joey>
<joey> like just to get the stupid score I </joey>
<connor> would like buy games that were rated </connor>
<connor> easy online to get 1 000 like full game </connor>
<connor> of score because you'd only get 1 000 </connor>
<joey> gamer score in every game and a DLC you </joey>
<garnt> could add more you were gaming the games </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what happened there was </garnt>
<joey> like three years where I was obsessed </joey>
<joey> with this thing where I was like I just </joey>
<joey> care about getting this number go up I </joey>
<joey> get that so I would play like I bought </joey>
<joey> like lost the game you know lost the TV </joey>
<joey> series I bought that game because it was </joey>
<joey> like five bucks just to get a thousand </joey>
<joey> games because it was really quick to get </joey>
<joey> a thousand Gamers score and then you </joey>
<joey> know I I also then some of my friends </joey>
<joey> won a game of school and I was like well </joey>
<joey> I'll do it for you if you give me 200 </joey>
<joey> Microsoft points I'll get you I'll give </joey>
<joey> you like 5 000 game of score and I would </joey>
<joey> just do it in a day because I had like </joey>
<joey> loads of games hustling game of schools </joey>
<joey> yeah I would I would if someone won a </joey>
<joey> game of score because I I again I wanted </joey>
<joey> I wanted points so I would kind of do I </joey>
<joey> would figure out ways through gaming I </joey>
<joey> was like how can I use my talent gaming </joey>
<garnt> to get Microsoft </garnt>
<garnt> gaming so what are your what are your </garnt>
<connor> talents I I'm really good game really </connor>
<garnt> good and addicted to this gaming thing </garnt>
<connor> can I get money from it or can I get </connor>
<garnt> somewhere to get more games from it so I </garnt>
<connor> would like mess I would like my friends </connor>
<connor> would want some people to do it and then </connor>
<connor> I would message people I'm like hey if </connor>
<connor> you want game of score do it no I said A </connor>
<connor> Sketch choose [ __ ] but I actually did it </connor>
<connor> like if they gave me the points I would </connor>
<connor> log in their account and I would just </connor>
<joey> play these games hey kid you wouldn't </joey>
<connor> gave a score but then if they wanted me </connor>
<connor> to do specific games they'd be like </connor>
<connor> Oscar that's that's a toffee dude all </connor>
<connor> right I'm gonna need more </connor>
<connor> and then and then I realized oh you can </connor>
<connor> just take the internet out of your Xbox </connor>
<connor> get a USB and like download a file and </connor>
<garnt> it will just [ __ ] do it for you and I </garnt>
<garnt> was like and then I felt really dumb </garnt>
<connor> that I was spending like a day or two </connor>
<connor> doing this oh my god um but yeah no I </connor>
<connor> would I was obsessed with it I would buy </connor>
<connor> games for it I would do achievements </connor>
<connor> that was stupidly hard spend hours like </connor>
<joey> days like Halo I would spend days </joey>
<joey> getting all the Halo achievements </joey>
<joey> because I mean that makes sense and and </joey>
<joey> then and then I would get infuriated </joey>
<joey> when I would buy a game that I thought </joey>
<joey> was good and they would have impossible </joey>
<joey> achievements in it and you know which </joey>
<joey> ones were always the worst jrpgs always </joey>
<joey> always the worst 100 completion yeah </joey>
<joey> Final Fantasy these stupid [ __ ] games </joey>
<garnt> would be like get every single item in </garnt>
<joey> the game it's like yeah you are </joey>
<connor> psychopaths like you you willingly chose </connor>
<joey> this achievement [ __ ] me I I did that </joey>
<joey> for the new 7R though yeah that's stupid </joey>
<joey> I I think the reason I just never 100 </joey>
<joey> games was because I did it once with </joey>
<connor> Tails and then I was like never again </connor>
<joey> never 100 of the tails game yeah I'm </joey>
<joey> sorry I loved it that to me that's like </joey>
<joey> 200 hours you know you can remember back </joey>
<joey> in the day when you only had like that </joey>
<joey> one game to play until next Christmas </joey>
<joey> sure sure like to me for me that was </joey>
<joey> tails that was when I had time and I was </joey>
<garnt> like I don't know what to do I have no </garnt>
<connor> other videos I think that like having </connor>
<joey> like like having to go somewhere for </joey>
<joey> like one day it was like made me a busy </joey>
<joey> man and then yeah I could spend the rest </joey>
<connor> of the days playing video games I was </connor>
<connor> like damn that one day thing that </connor>
<connor> crashing I'm like bro I'll kill Stacy </connor>
<garnt> games now I'm like I will kill for one </garnt>
<joey> hour yeah sure I literally do anything </joey>
<garnt> for an hour yeah it's really weird for </garnt>
<garnt> me with the video games because I could </garnt>
<garnt> never play for like one or two hour </garnt>
<garnt> stints a noise if I if I have a video </garnt>
<garnt> game I like I need to play for at least </garnt>
<connor> like four hours oh man I've been able to </connor>
<connor> enjoy a game for like 20 minutes and </connor>
<garnt> then just do something else as hype </garnt>
<garnt> right it takes me 20 minutes just to get </garnt>
<garnt> like invested into like the game that's </garnt>
<connor> why OverWatch and games like that are </connor>
<connor> pretty fun because you can just do like </connor>
<connor> two games 30 minutes go back to whatever </connor>
<joey> you're doing pretty nice so I just play </joey>
<joey> module </joey>
<joey> like you can get a quick game out of it </joey>
<joey> you want to reset your brain you want to </joey>
<joey> like kind of just take your mind off </joey>
<connor> what the work is for like 20 30 minutes </connor>
<joey> yeah I mean maybe you don't want to take </joey>
<garnt> it then like one game turns into like </garnt>
<connor> two games I'm pretty good </connor>
<joey> at that point I'm just like and then at </joey>
<joey> that point I'm just like well I'm five </joey>
<garnt> games </garnt>
<connor> bro like going on tour with Connor off </connor>
<joey> entire hold up no no that's different </joey>
<connor> that is different because uh our entire </connor>
<joey> schedule revolved around whether Conrad </joey>
<joey> started the game of Kia [ __ ] tiona we </joey>
<garnt> would be like yo Conor rehearsals in </garnt>
<connor> five minutes Connor's like but but I </connor>
<connor> just started I just started the game I </connor>
<joey> just started a game of DFT guys I never </joey>
<joey> played near our rehearsal time that's a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] lie no no and most I would push </garnt>
<connor> it back five minutes that's that's not </connor>
<connor> true I would play a lot of TFT because </connor>
<connor> we didn't really have anything to do a </connor>
<connor> lot of the time yeah so I was like oh </connor>
<connor> just game but in normal work it's like I </connor>
<joey> will pretty much I will work from like </joey>
<joey> nine to ten Non-Stop and then I'll have </joey>
<joey> to take a break at some point and play </joey>
<connor> some games because always I'll get my </connor>
<joey> brain will be like wait 9am to 10 AM 10 </joey>
<joey> p.m okay I have to say I'm like I'll </joey>
<joey> work yeah </joey>
<connor> I don't know I normally have to like </connor>
<joey> stream and then I'm like all right I </joey>
<connor> have to do real work </connor>
<connor> now I'm gonna answer emails too much fun </connor>
<connor> I gotta I gotta feel like I didn't have </connor>
<garnt> fun yeah exactly speak for yourself </garnt>
<garnt> stream is like people pure gamer right </garnt>
<joey> here stream is definitely worked for me </joey>
<joey> yeah streams work for me I don't </joey>
<joey> actually like it it's fun </joey>
<joey> it's really a game for me I was thinking </joey>
<joey> like should I stream god of war and I </joey>
<garnt> was just like no I just because I I </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to just be like immersed in the </garnt>
<connor> game and just say like damn this show is </connor>
<connor> really good think of the five Subs yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah the only way that we'll be </joey>
<joey> able to get through the trail series is </joey>
<connor> if we stream till last year like </connor>
<connor> realistically so that's the thing right </connor>
<connor> if there's a game that is too long it </connor>
<connor> makes no sense to play it off stream </connor>
<connor> because you know it's a big time sink so </connor>
<joey> you should play but then there's no </joey>
<connor> point doing it on stream either because </connor>
<connor> then viewers will just fall off yeah </connor>
<connor> true maybe yeah maybe because I tried to </connor>
<garnt> do that with Yakuza 7 and like after 11 </garnt>
<garnt> streams I don't care people just don't </garnt>
<garnt> care so I'm like [ __ ] it I'll just </garnt>
<garnt> finish this game because it depends on </garnt>
<garnt> the game because like you know Pokemon </garnt>
<joey> it makes sense right yeah because it's </joey>
<joey> like you can just tune in whenever you </joey>
<joey> immediately know what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> happening there's no concrete story you </joey>
<joey> can just immediately be like oh you're </joey>
<garnt> trying to catch some Pokemon cool I'll </garnt>
<garnt> join in but like you know 10 streams </garnt>
<garnt> into Yakuza 7 where it's like the story </garnt>
<garnt> is pretty much fleshed out at that point </garnt>
<garnt> it's like oh I don't know what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> is happening therefore I'm not gonna </garnt>
<garnt> stay I think people need to enough </garnt>
<joey> people need to have played a game or has </joey>
<joey> to have like a really hardcore fan but </joey>
<joey> it's like you know Final Fantasy online </joey>
<connor> or you know yenshin even you know </connor>
<connor> invention streamer yeah because that's </connor>
<garnt> why you're such an easy Grace you can </garnt>
<garnt> come through that streamer yeah the </garnt>
<garnt> streamer that plays that game yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> such an investment and that you know </garnt>
<connor> anyone who would want to watch would </connor>
<garnt> also be interested in that game yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but yeah honestly it's it's also </garnt>
<joey> games especially as well so you know </joey>
<joey> who's going to be the world's first </joey>
<joey> Trail stream </joey>
<connor> there's got to be one out there right no </connor>
<connor> one cares don't do that do not do that </connor>
<garnt> because like Trails I'm like this is </garnt>
<garnt> this I see some light trails and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like this will never ever ever be </garnt>
<garnt> popular but holy [ __ ] it like it just </garnt>
<joey> speaks to me there's five Japanese dudes </joey>
<garnt> somewhere in the world who are like the </garnt>
<joey> hot most hardcore Trails fans who are </joey>
<connor> just like please give it to me the more </connor>
<connor> I get into streaming the more I want to </connor>
<joey> do non-game streams like the more I want </joey>
<connor> to do like I want to go fishing yeah </connor>
<joey> that's that's the OG game yeah can I eat </joey>
<joey> today like I feel like I want to play </joey>
<connor> the analog like I'm more interested in </connor>
<connor> streaming like classical stupid [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like like fishing or like outdoor stuff </connor>
<connor> that I think is like kind of games or </connor>
<connor> like you know games before games yeah </connor>
<joey> you know activities </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah I don't know why yeah </joey>
<joey> let's discover yeah </joey>
<garnt> real life stuff is great but what are </garnt>
<joey> they gonna patch this mechanic man I </joey>
<connor> can't believe fishing the time the fish </connor>
<connor> is too long like the fish the fish is </connor>
<garnt> like too much RNG man they're like this </garnt>
<garnt> this is just like gotcha but like </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah so I've done I've actually </connor>
<connor> done fishing a few times in Japan now </connor>
<connor> all right I did the fishing with mailing </connor>
<connor> in the ocean yeah uh that was that was </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] hard mode fishing that was just </garnt>
<garnt> hard much harder than uh Lake fishing </garnt>
<connor> lake fishing and River fishing is nice I </connor>
<garnt> like that that's like the perfect battle </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah you you get fishes uh at a good </garnt>
<garnt> Pace yeah you know and it's much more </garnt>
<connor> relaxing as well yeah yeah you can sit </connor>
<garnt> down on the boat you're like [ __ ] oh </garnt>
<connor> God am I gonna get a fish I don't know </connor>
<connor> for like four hours and then you don't </connor>
<joey> get anything </joey>
<joey> it's just [ __ ] yeah and then you kind of </joey>
<connor> like you want to go to the toilet you </connor>
<joey> have to go in this shitty little boat </joey>
<connor> like I just I everything about it I just </connor>
<joey> want to piss off the edge of the boat </joey>
<joey> dude yeah yeah I went on this uh fishing </joey>
<garnt> thing with Maylene and it was it was fun </garnt>
<garnt> it was just too long it was like it was </garnt>
<connor> like eight hours on like on the water </connor>
<garnt> yeah I had done it three hours man yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because I went like Lake fishing again </garnt>
<garnt> after when like sea fishing would mail </garnt>
<connor> in I just realized damn Lake fishing is </connor>
<connor> just it it's just so much more chill and </connor>
<connor> I'm like </connor>
<connor> the friends who made along the way yeah </connor>
<connor> and I go see fishing I was like oh this </connor>
<garnt> is why fishing is a job you know because </garnt>
<connor> it's it's hard it's hard work </connor>
<connor> I'm wet I'm soaking and you know I we'd </connor>
<connor> be I'd be there for hours right and I </connor>
<joey> would I would be staring at these like </joey>
<joey> old Japanese men who were like nuts at </joey>
<joey> it and I was literally copying </joey>
<garnt> everything they were doing I thought </garnt>
<garnt> they had the straps I wasn't doing it </garnt>
<garnt> because like I I would I swear to God I </garnt>
<garnt> would like literally one for one mimic </garnt>
<connor> exactly what he was doing and I could </connor>
<connor> not get a fish to save my life I got </connor>
<connor> like two fish total this these dudes bro </connor>
<joey> it was like that's like that's like </joey>
<joey> being like you know oh I'm gonna play </joey>
<joey> Dark Souls and watch this Dark Souls no </joey>
<connor> I just do exactly what they do I </connor>
<joey> recognized it like I'm definitely not </joey>
<joey> these dudes have been doing it their </joey>
<joey> whole life yeah and the thing that I </joey>
<joey> liked about like in sea fishing was </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] hot because the technique </joey>
<joey> matters a lot yes um </joey>
<connor> whereas in a lake you're like </connor>
<connor> blop yeah wait and then that's it yeah </connor>
<joey> it's good it's fun you can chat you can </joey>
<joey> chill out you want to drink a beer </joey>
<joey> you've got to like pull it you're </joey>
<joey> pulling it yeah </joey>
<joey> these dudes are nuts dude these Japanese </joey>
<garnt> men I mean it's in it's in the blood man </garnt>
<connor> it is a generation man throws it in two </connor>
<connor> seconds got like five on one hook I'm </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is happening man and </connor>
<connor> he's just like at a pity he's like </connor>
<connor> here's a fish genuinely out of pity he's </connor>
<connor> like bro I've caught too many I'm like </connor>
<connor> hey you want one yeah sea fishing was </connor>
<connor> just frustrating for me because I'm like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] am I doing wrong I </connor>
<garnt> actually have no idea what I'm doing </garnt>
<garnt> insane yeah million's been a ton and </garnt>
<connor> million wasn't getting anything don't </connor>
<joey> you do this often can you be getting </joey>
<garnt> more fish yeah because I did the exactly </garnt>
<garnt> the same way where there were some </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese men like catching like </garnt>
<joey> literally a bucket full of fish yeah I </joey>
<joey> like mimic everything they're doing the </joey>
<garnt> right way nothing yeah I throw it in </garnt>
<joey> nothing throw it in nothing because they </joey>
<connor> had the the [ __ ] like cracked uh </connor>
<joey> fishing pole that's what I'm guessing </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah I had the the school the </joey>
<connor> school uh Sports Hall pop fishing pole </connor>
<connor> they're like yeah we got a pole we put a </connor>
<joey> line on the end yeah yeah I don't know </joey>
<joey> you gotta stick with a piece of strings </joey>
<joey> they felt so bad for us that when we </joey>
<joey> docked and went back in because you pay </joey>
<garnt> like 15 bucks to go out and fish yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and you're allowed to catch as many fish </garnt>
<joey> as you want so there's some corn they </joey>
<garnt> give you free fish as well yeah the dude </garnt>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> that's it yeah hold on we caught like a </connor>
<connor> ton the other day he owns a bag </connor>
<connor> I guess he just felt bad yeah yeah with </connor>
<joey> the same thing but it's also as well I </joey>
<joey> feel them doing that is like backhanded </joey>
<joey> because like the game ring you was like </joey>
<connor> no I could do better I mean it's not </connor>
<connor> that I was trying to just clarify I'm </connor>
<connor> not frustrated because I didn't get </connor>
<joey> enough fish I'm frustrated because I I </joey>
<joey> hated the whole the vibe of it and how </joey>
<joey> long you were dead like a rainbow yeah </joey>
<joey> and you know you you dock and then you </joey>
<joey> drive out on the boat for like an hour </joey>
<joey> yeah and you're just the sun because it </joey>
<joey> was in like August so the sun is </joey>
<joey> destroying you as well and you're like </joey>
<connor> this this [ __ ] sucks because unlike </connor>
<joey> unlike Lake fishing sea fishing is a </joey>
<connor> commitment you can't just be like oh </connor>
<joey> just just talk somewhere let's just </joey>
<joey> chill out you know somewhere go yeah no </joey>
<joey> just just go can't pull the camping </joey>
<joey> chairs and put the beer yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly I can't do that it's a </joey>
<joey> commitment and unfortunately the sea is </joey>
<joey> the sea you know and if if if you need a </joey>
<joey> place to rest you still like it's still </joey>
<joey> rocking a lot yeah because it's the sea </joey>
<joey> and it's a lot more intense than Lake </joey>
<joey> fishing I was actually like sweating at </joey>
<joey> a point doing uh doing sea fishing </joey>
<joey> because it's like it's a workout it's </joey>
<joey> it's so much more intense because you're </joey>
<joey> constantly having to do something it's </joey>
<garnt> not a passive activity it's an active </garnt>
<garnt> activity </garnt>
<garnt> um but you get you get like bigger fish </garnt>
<garnt> for it you know that's that's the </garnt>
<joey> trade-off sometimes </joey>
<joey> if you can catch it yeah a little fish </joey>
<joey> are fine too they taste good yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah they're fine good so I want the </connor>
<garnt> five stars though man I'm waiting for my </garnt>
<connor> first five star man you have a catching </connor>
<garnt> big fish is way harder than getting a </garnt>
<garnt> little fish like a lot lot more yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I know but then we're not capable </garnt>
<connor> of that guy well we gotta stay in our </connor>
<garnt> lane 20 years too late but I I just want </garnt>
<joey> to know what that feels like you know I </joey>
<connor> wanna I wanna know I want to know yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> us me Immortals we haven't been fishing </connor>
<joey> for like 20 years I don't get to we </joey>
<garnt> don't get to do that no I don't know </garnt>
<joey> there's other sports I really want to do </joey>
<joey> as well more I want to do more Sports </joey>
<joey> essentially as well I'm the same yeah </joey>
<connor> trying to do more kayaking I want to do </connor>
<joey> a lot more of that I wanna I wanna surf </joey>
<joey> as well I went surfing with Felix the </joey>
<connor> other day yeah </connor>
<garnt> intense like it is it's a good workout </garnt>
<connor> it's a incredible workout but I it just </connor>
<joey> made me realize how unfit I actually am </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<garnt> no I knew but like it just it just </garnt>
<garnt> reaffirmed my suspicions right because </garnt>
<garnt> it's like I was probably out there for </garnt>
<joey> what maybe two hours yeah and I was just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] destroyed like because it's it's </joey>
<connor> the part that it's it's the paddling out </connor>
<joey> that just takes all the energy no and </joey>
<connor> maybe it's because like I heard I saw </connor>
<connor> some people you know saying like oh it's </connor>
<connor> because you were in like cold Waters and </connor>
<connor> that just saps the energy out of you </connor>
<joey> more than like summer warm Waters and </joey>
<joey> stuff like that but I think that's only </joey>
<joey> up to a certain extent like you need to </joey>
<joey> be at a certain level of Fitness guys </joey>
<joey> but that's actually you guys are on </joey>
<joey> copium yeah that's copium it's like yeah </joey>
<joey> you know but um no it's really fun like </joey>
<garnt> even if like I didn't I probably maybe </garnt>
<garnt> caught one wave and I didn't even stand </garnt>
<garnt> up for it obviously but like even just </garnt>
<garnt> like catching that one wave while on </garnt>
<garnt> your stomach it does seem hard it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> hard it is very hard but it's super </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] fun and like yeah I definitely </garnt>
<joey> want to go back </joey>
<garnt> um yeah yeah so I remember trying </garnt>
<joey> surfing for the first time as well it </joey>
<joey> was so much [ __ ] fun but like you </joey>
<joey> said you spend most of your end energy </joey>
<joey> not actually doing surfing it's actually </joey>
<joey> like paddling out it's like getting out </joey>
<joey> because you have to like go against the </joey>
<joey> waves yeah you don't realize how much </joey>
<joey> energy that takes Until you realize you </joey>
<garnt> spend all this energy to maybe like to </garnt>
<garnt> get one chance to catch like a wave </garnt>
<garnt> right and if you don't catch it then you </garnt>
<garnt> then you [ __ ] up and you gotta paddle </garnt>
<garnt> out all over again you know yeah so it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's a lot it's a lot of energy it's a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of waiting as well it's a lot of </garnt>
<joey> waiting especially if like the waves are </joey>
<garnt> kind of mediocre like it was when we </garnt>
<joey> went yeah yeah um it's just like a lot </joey>
<garnt> of like oh is it hit no oh is it no and </garnt>
<connor> you're just sitting in the water for </connor>
<connor> maybe 30 minutes yeah freezing your ass </connor>
<joey> off right because you're not moving at </joey>
<joey> all and then the one burst of energy you </joey>
<joey> have to use to catch that wave that you </joey>
<joey> might not even actually catch yeah you </joey>
<joey> just get way close to the Sean you go </joey>
<joey> well [ __ ] now I gotta paddle back out </joey>
<garnt> again yeah and use up all this energy </garnt>
<garnt> not serving it's like with skiing or </garnt>
<garnt> snowboarding it's [ __ ] easy because </garnt>
<garnt> uh like the [ __ ] ski lift does all </garnt>
<joey> the work for you yeah it's like it's </joey>
<joey> like if you went skiing except the ski </joey>
<joey> lift wasn't lurking working and you had </joey>
<joey> to walk </joey>
<joey> well I guess I gotta go all up all the </joey>
<joey> way again where's the ski let's just </joey>
<joey> surfing yeah </joey>
<connor> just like pick me up drop me off and put </connor>
<connor> me in the ocean but I'll show you I I </connor>
<connor> don't know why am I stupid I'm like </connor>
<garnt> what's I wonder what outdoor sports that </garnt>
<garnt> are cool that would work for streaming </garnt>
<connor> like okay surfing doesn't work there's </connor>
<joey> water if there's you are getting wet or </joey>
<connor> submerged it doesn't work anything like </connor>
<joey> that done kayaking could work but if you </joey>
<joey> go too far out to the ocean there's no </joey>
<joey> signal yeah yeah so you gotta kayak </joey>
<joey> around somewhere maybe in a river </joey>
<joey> snowboarding maybe see okay I thought </joey>
<joey> about this I thought skiing or </joey>
<joey> snowboarding could could work and </joey>
<joey> technically it's possible but I wondered </joey>
<connor> would it look [ __ ] on camera because </connor>
<connor> it's literally just White </connor>
<connor> uh it's just white and then you're going </connor>
<connor> fast down so there's like opportunities </connor>
<connor> to talk and stuff but I'm like I don't </connor>
<joey> know if it could be interesting you </joey>
<joey> would also need I guess maybe like a </joey>
<joey> wide lens to you know kind of capture </joey>
<joey> you and the rest of the thing because </joey>
<connor> this is like the the camera I have is </connor>
<connor> very wide okay it might work yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> but I guess also like is there like but </connor>
<joey> like some mountains I know don't have a </joey>
<joey> great signal either yeah it depends it </joey>
<connor> depends depends on the mountain depends </connor>
<joey> I don't know I just want to do more </joey>
<joey> weird outdoor stuff no that's right I </joey>
<joey> just I want to do more Sports Outdoors </joey>
<joey> but it's hard to convince anyone I'm </joey>
<connor> down okay okay good good yeah I'll hold </connor>
<joey> you to that yeah lean mountain climber </joey>
<connor> because I went because I went surfing </connor>
<joey> with Felix and then the week after we </joey>
<connor> went to driving range </connor>
<joey> as [ __ ] it's like oh I actually kind of </joey>
<connor> missed doing this during the pandemic </connor>
<joey> because I just got so [ __ ] lazy </joey>
<joey> because we couldn't go outside didn't </joey>
<joey> couldn't move our body because no one </joey>
<joey> else was outside yeah all the places </joey>
<joey> were closed but now everything else is </joey>
<joey> open and people are like yeah I kind of </joey>
<garnt> want to get back into shape or like I </garnt>
<garnt> kind of want to move my body I'm like </garnt>
<joey> well let's [ __ ] go </joey>
<connor> I like trips that are like focused </connor>
<joey> around doing an activity right where you </joey>
<connor> like maybe go for two days to like kayak </connor>
<joey> somewhere yeah yeah or to surf or </joey>
<joey> something I like that because I feel </joey>
<joey> like okay well it's a it's a holiday but </joey>
<joey> also you get to relax you do some </joey>
<joey> exercise it's like you've got to get </joey>
<joey> some endorphins </joey>
<connor> a lot of those sports that require </connor>
<garnt> they're like expensive or you need </garnt>
<garnt> equipment or someone is good to teach </garnt>
<joey> you around yeah yeah a lot of the a lot </joey>
<joey> of the sports require knowledge entry </joey>
<garnt> points it's like it's yeah it's the </garnt>
<joey> point of entry right where yeah that's </joey>
<connor> part of the reason I never went skiing </connor>
<connor> or snowboarding just because you need </connor>
<connor> someone who can help you yeah the </connor>
<connor> barrier Adventure was so high yeah no </connor>
<connor> one in my family ever skied or </connor>
<joey> snowboarded when I was younger so I was </joey>
<garnt> just like well I guess uh I guess I'm </garnt>
<joey> never going yes I'm never going yeah </joey>
<connor> that's true actually it for sure helps </connor>
<connor> yeah um I I wondered there's definitely </connor>
<connor> a scene for very odd extreme sports I </connor>
<connor> know there's like a scene for </connor>
<connor> um actually hunting in German man really </connor>
<joey> yeah you can you can you can uh like </joey>
<connor> with live animals or just like the clay </connor>
<connor> pigeons live animals oh really you can </connor>
<joey> do it for some reason I stumbled across </joey>
<joey> something and I was reading about it </joey>
<joey> it's quite interesting it seemed like </joey>
<joey> it's you have to it's a very long </joey>
<joey> process to get a gun in Japan yeah it is </joey>
<joey> um but it can be done and you can hunt </joey>
<joey> in Japan didn't know there was a scene </joey>
<connor> for hunting in Japan didn't think so </connor>
<joey> either yeah I thought everything was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] protected no no no there's </joey>
<joey> certain animals that you can hunt oh </joey>
<joey> certain Birds but know that fun fact </joey>
<joey> Japan often has a scene for very like </joey>
<joey> Niche Sports oh yeah but you need to I </joey>
<connor> wouldn't even know how you'd even begin </connor>
<joey> to get into stuff like that here that's </joey>
<joey> the problem is like a lot of like I feel </joey>
<joey> Japan is the one country where there are </joey>
<joey> so many small cool little niches that </joey>
<joey> you can get into whether it's like </joey>
<joey> physical or just like hobby based or </joey>
<joey> something like that but like it's either </joey>
<joey> the point of entry is so high or the </joey>
<joey> community surrounding it is so small and </joey>
<joey> hidden or gatekeeping yeah that it's </joey>
<joey> just like kind of hard to be like can I </joey>
<joey> join yeah you know without them being </joey>
<joey> like oh you want to be a train or taco </joey>
<joey> name five trains it's like it's like uh </joey>
<joey> I don't know it's like [ __ ] off you know </joey>
<joey> it's like there's always that because </joey>
<joey> like because I wanted to do a video on </joey>
<joey> like kind of the weird like you know </joey>
<connor> like the the small little niche otaku </connor>
<connor> spheres like the train or tacos but the </connor>
<joey> problem is a lot of those people just </joey>
<joey> don't want to be public about it and </joey>
<joey> don't want to talk about it because they </joey>
<joey> don't want it to be like a mainstream </joey>
<connor> thing you know they want to keep it in </connor>
<connor> their small Niche I know that some of </connor>
<connor> the train attacks is that game is that </connor>
<garnt> gatekeepy I don't know maybe it's it it </garnt>
<garnt> is geek yeah it totally is </garnt>
<joey> if you ever watched the James May Series </joey>
<joey> in Japan oh yes he talked to some train </joey>

<joey> that fishing restaurant I hate that </joey>
<joey> place so much oh yes oh so there's this </joey>
<garnt> restaurant you can go to in Japan and </garnt>
<connor> it's a very big touristy Place yeah um </connor>
<garnt> there's a few of them in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah where you can fish your own fish </garnt>
<joey> right yeah yeah okay so yes you fish you </joey>
<connor> fish the the fish and then you eat it </connor>
<connor> right and and they'll ask you how you </connor>
<joey> how you want it prepared but these fish </joey>
<joey> are like dead so you have to like stab </joey>
<joey> them with the hook you don't yeah you </joey>
<joey> don't catch them you kind of have to </joey>
<joey> shimmy the hook into the part of their </joey>
<connor> body and then drag them out yeah it's </connor>
<connor> very like oh this doesn't feel right </connor>
<joey> yeah and it's like really oh it's gross </joey>
<joey> and also like they don't even use the </joey>
<connor> fish that you even fish up right like </connor>
<connor> they have like a different fish prepared </connor>
<connor> I don't know I don't know if that's a </connor>
<connor> rumor but I mean I I would hope so just </connor>
<connor> from seeing how half dead some of these </connor>
<connor> fish I'm like I don't know if I'm I </connor>
<connor> don't know if they're good to eat like </connor>
<connor> food is mad as well that's all right </connor>
<connor> that's fine I mean it's it's fine just </connor>
<joey> it's mid it's just like fine the sushi </joey>
<joey> was fine it's fine I was just like damn </joey>
<joey> it it's acceptable I wish I ate other </joey>
<connor> Sushi like what just anything else </connor>
<joey> anything else </joey>
<joey> yeah Sushi chains in Japan even like the </joey>
<joey> 100 yen ones pretty [ __ ] weird </joey>
<connor> they're pretty decent they do the track </connor>
<joey> as long as it's not don't get the sushi </joey>
<connor> from the conveyor belt just order it </connor>
<garnt> from the tablet yeah get it fresh yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> mean I I noticed now that it's even if I </garnt>
<connor> go to a conveyor Bel sushi place it's </connor>
<connor> rare that it's full of sushi anymore </connor>
<connor> most of the time people just order from </connor>
<connor> the tablets nowadays yeah yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> because it's like why would I want the </connor>
<garnt> sushi that's been going around for 40 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes yeah yeah Sushi they just made </garnt>
<connor> yeah exactly like that sounds much </connor>
<garnt> better I'll do that thank you yeah even </garnt>
<joey> like the cheapest Sushi change you can </joey>
<joey> find in Japan is like better than some </joey>
<joey> of the expensive Sushi though like </joey>
<joey> worldwide so that's why I in a sense I </joey>
<joey> prefer going to like cheap conveyor belt </joey>
<joey> sushis and some of like the more higher </joey>
<joey> end sushi places because it's rare that </joey>
<connor> I'm ever full in like the higher end </connor>
<connor> sushi places you know yeah yeah but is </connor>
<connor> that what it is yeah </connor>
<connor> it's rather than that I'm ever full and </connor>
<connor> I just feel guilty like ordering more </connor>
<garnt> from the chef to be like you didn't feed </garnt>
<garnt> me enough give me more and then you </garnt>
<garnt> order like one or two more pieces I'm </garnt>
<connor> like [ __ ] how do I tell I don't think </connor>
<joey> they mind I don't think they're mine no </joey>
<joey> they don't mind because they're still </joey>
<joey> getting the money for yeah </joey>
<joey> I mean he you know he'll eat like the </joey>
<joey> majority of like the fish and stuff like </joey>
<connor> that but you know some of the weirder </connor>
<connor> ones like like he doesn't like not </connor>
<joey> though or like the sperm sacks or [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah oh like I don't even think he likes </joey>
<connor> uni if I I'm not too sure but like he </connor>
<connor> obviously like but if it's just like oh </connor>
<joey> regular white fish or or whatever salmon </joey>
<connor> finally though yeah it's obviously my </connor>
<connor> parents want to come visit Japan and I'm </connor>
<garnt> like damn I don't know if they're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> what kind of sushi they like yeah have </garnt>

<garnt> um and I'm like uh how can I describe </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney's parents like okay so my parents </garnt>
<garnt> are very very white British yeah </garnt>
<connor> it's like how do I get them to eat </connor>
<garnt> anything that isn't cooked yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney's parents are like the most </garnt>
<garnt> American parents you could like ever </garnt>
<joey> ever imagine like Sydney's dad is like </joey>
<joey> the epitome of like an American Dad </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> uh he's like I have white and blue yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah he's like every American Dad </joey>
<joey> you've seen in every sitcom won every </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] movie and everything like that </connor>
<connor> and I'm like how do I I it's it's just </connor>
<connor> like I I know hi Russell if you're </connor>
<connor> listening to this by the way it's it's </connor>
<connor> like I know it's like the type of person </connor>
<garnt> you take to a sushi place and he's </garnt>
<garnt> asking where the fork is you know yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this is my dad I don't think I've ever </garnt>

<joey> people who are like very weird about </joey>
<connor> eating raw meat right yeah well it's not </connor>
<connor> like I'm gonna be like hey eat this by </connor>
<garnt> the way it's raw horse </garnt>
<garnt> I mean see she's not the one I'm worried </garnt>
<garnt> about it's some of the other things that </garnt>
<garnt> they can find in Japan which might be </garnt>
<connor> having like a little bit harder I think </connor>
<connor> a sushi is like I want them to try that </connor>
<garnt> and other stuff you can get sushi in </garnt>
<connor> like yeah </connor>
<joey> that's good </joey>
<joey> um and that excuse me was fine um </joey>
<connor> because I don't want to take them to an </connor>
<connor> omicase place and then the the sushi </connor>
<connor> chef has been doing for 50 years like </connor>
<connor> please enjoy like what the [ __ ] is this </connor>
<joey> here you go I don't want it here you go </joey>
<connor> I don't want it you seen the I've seen </connor>
<garnt> videos of like someone stabbing the </garnt>
<joey> sushi with the fork and they're putting </joey>
<garnt> in like their salad and then eating it </garnt>
<joey> yeah I've seen videos of these from </joey>
<joey> because of tourist office coming in oh </joey>
<joey> my God yeah I I wonder why what other </joey>
<connor> dishes do you want them to try </connor>
<joey> what is like you know well actually it </joey>
<joey> depends when are they coming </joey>
<garnt> in April I don't know I'll figure it out </garnt>
<garnt> I think in January </garnt>
<joey> I just holy [ __ ] maybe like maybe like a </joey>
<garnt> nabe of some kind </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> although the raw egg might throw them </joey>
<connor> off a bit yeah I'm Gonna Make Them Eat </connor>
<connor> Sukiyaki I'm gonna be like you gotta </connor>
<garnt> make you gotta make them yeah yeah I I </garnt>
<garnt> think I can get away with raw egg you </garnt>
<garnt> know I think they'll complain about it </garnt>
<garnt> and I think it's weird but as soon as </garnt>
<garnt> they try it hopefully hopefully </garnt>
<connor> hopefully I mean I was I feel like the </connor>
<joey> if you're younger it's really easier </joey>
<joey> right because you're more open to trying </joey>
<joey> yeah right obviously if you're older </joey>
<joey> you've been eating the same things your </joey>
<joey> whole life and you're like why sure I've </joey>
<joey> survived without raw egg I don't think I </joey>
<garnt> want to try it it's just like it's the </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese Cuisine is just so vastly </garnt>
<garnt> different from like Western Cuisine yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and you know now the world's become more </garnt>
<joey> let's say like globalized and everything </joey>
<joey> like that so people our age I think I </joey>
<joey> feel like we've got we've had more of a </joey>
<joey> chance to try all these different types </joey>
<joey> of Cuisines stuff like that yeah but </joey>
<joey> when you get to a parent's age you know </joey>
<connor> it's it was it's it was a lot harder to </connor>
<connor> try different Cuisines back then let's </connor>
<connor> say in fact it's like surprised me so </connor>
<connor> much just how much Choice there is now </connor>
<connor> nowadays uh UK UK went from like nothing </connor>
<connor> to like good now exactly you know I go </connor>
<joey> to like most major cities and they have </joey>
<joey> like proper Cuisines of like every type </joey>
<joey> whereas but I remember before you go to </joey>
<joey> a Chinese restaurant and there was only </joey>
<joey> like one type of Chinese restaurant you </joey>
<joey> know which was just basically orange </joey>
<joey> chicken yeah orange chicken kung pao </joey>
<joey> chicken like and now like you go to the </joey>
<joey> UK and there's like so many different </joey>
<joey> types of Chinese restaurant which is how </joey>
<joey> it should be it's like Szechuan food </joey>
<joey> it's like Chinese hot pot </joey>
<joey> um and I'm just like wow this Choice </joey>
<garnt> wasn't there when I was growing up in </garnt>
<garnt> England God knows what the choice was </garnt>
<joey> like when my parents were you know it </joey>
<joey> might also be because maybe back in our </joey>
<joey> parents generation there wasn't enough </joey>
<joey> like uh understanding or knowledge on </joey>
<joey> the subtle differences of a lot of like </joey>
<joey> food like that so maybe the maybe they </joey>
<joey> existed like maybe you know like </joey>
<joey> Szechuan food and hot pot and like you </joey>
<joey> know traditional Chinese food did exist </joey>
<connor> but but it was probably all just labeled </connor>
<joey> under Chinese food yeah right and it's </joey>
<connor> probably just like oh it's it's from </connor>
<connor> China so it must be just Chinese food </connor>
<joey> and you didn't Pro probably there wasn't </joey>
<joey> enough information out there to be like </joey>
<garnt> oh this is a different type of Chinese </garnt>
<joey> food yeah well this is a different type </joey>
<joey> of Indian food yeah well you know </joey>
<joey> anything like that right it's like you </joey>
<joey> know I'm sure like back in our parents </joey>
<garnt> day there was just like there's Asian </garnt>
<joey> food and that's it it's Asian food and </joey>
<garnt> there is non-asian I remember when I was </garnt>
<garnt> growing up in in Brighton at least when </garnt>
<joey> when we wanted like when we wanted </joey>
<joey> Chinese or Japanese food they were both </joey>
<joey> under the same restaurant yeah it was it </joey>
<garnt> wasn't Chinese or Japanese it was </garnt>
<joey> Chinese and Japanese yeah it was like an </joey>
<joey> Asian fusion right it was like the </joey>
<garnt> opposite in terms of like flavors yeah </garnt>
<joey> you know Chinese food is often quite </joey>
<garnt> heavy maybe oily yeah whereas Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> food it's very light not so many spices </garnt>
<joey> meanwhile Korean food is full of spices </joey>
<garnt> I mean I remember I remember when it's </garnt>
<joey> growing well I remember when growing up </joey>
<connor> Korean food just wasn't a thing no no no </connor>
<connor> I was like you you had zero choice of </connor>
<connor> Korean cuisine and nobody knew about it </connor>
<connor> either it was either Chinese or Japanese </connor>
<connor> Indian you know yeah and it's just weird </connor>
<connor> now seeing how many different Cuisines </connor>
<connor> are like coming up there like Vietnamese </connor>
<joey> cuisine is like coming up as well </joey>
<garnt> whereas before I was just like oh I </garnt>
<garnt> guess I I I've had Thai food that's you </garnt>
<joey> know that's that's just all the stuff </joey>
<joey> before it was like let's get up that </joey>
<joey> Asian restaurant that has Sushi Pad Thai </joey>
<connor> yeah like so that's everything I could </connor>
<connor> be wrong but I Jordan the Thai </connor>
<joey> government and I think it might still </joey>
<joey> does like they they sponsor a lot of </joey>
<joey> people opening up Thai restaurants </joey>
<joey> abroad </joey>
<joey> um if they do that's five hit because </joey>
<joey> they wanted Thai food to be like really </joey>
<joey> well known right yeah </joey>
<joey> um I'm pretty sure they did that I </joey>
<joey> wouldn't be surprised because I think if </joey>
<joey> you look at all the foreign foods from </joey>
<joey> like southeast Asia like it's only like </joey>
<joey> Thai food is the big one like it's been </joey>
<joey> pushed the most yeah I think it's </joey>
<connor> because the government was like hey we </connor>
<garnt> need to get our food out there I mean it </garnt>
<joey> makes sense when pretty much everyone in </joey>
<connor> my parents and dad's side who emigrated </connor>
<garnt> out of Thailand started a restaurant </garnt>
<connor> business so yeah I'm pretty sure there's </connor>
<connor> like a text out like there's something </connor>
<joey> some kind of program maybe </joey>
<joey> there is not a single Thai person who </joey>
<garnt> has come out from outside Thailand who </garnt>
<joey> didn't at one point in analyze yeah I'm </joey>
<garnt> just I'm just thinking I'm just like </garnt>
<joey> we've got a fact checking okay all right </joey>
<joey> what do you think 2002 </joey>
<garnt> oh 2002. yeah thousands of restaurants </garnt>
<garnt> around the world </garnt>
<joey> because they realize like Hey how do we </joey>
<joey> get our name on the map let's make bomb </joey>
<joey> ass food the people are gonna be like no </joey>
<joey> I want Chinese food yeah yeah and you </joey>
<joey> think about it more right you know of </joey>
<joey> the country you know about it like yeah </joey>
<connor> I don't know a lot about some other </connor>
<connor> Southeast Asian countries because the </connor>
<connor> food isn't really like pushed that's </connor>
<joey> true yeah and it's kind of it's very </joey>
<joey> neat and food is very intrinsically </joey>
<joey> linked to the culture too oh yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> that's right like dude I mean I swear </connor>
<connor> half of the hype around Italy is how God </connor>
<joey> damn good their food is yeah you know </joey>
<joey> but no one ever thinks to stop about </joey>
<connor> their government we don't talk about the </connor>
<connor> Italian government the Italian politics </connor>
<joey> Italian politics are kind of whack but </joey>
<connor> their food you know you think about it </connor>
<garnt> yeah everyone every single family member </garnt>
<garnt> that has emigrated out of Thailand uh </garnt>
<garnt> and I've started a [ __ ] big family by </garnt>
<garnt> the way or in my parents generation </garnt>
<garnt> started a restaurant business almost for </garnt>
<garnt> a restaurant business </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah that that was that was like in </garnt>
<joey> the 1980s though is there is there a </joey>
<joey> particular Cuisine that you want more </joey>
<joey> people in the wall to like know about or </joey>
<joey> try that you think is like personal </joey>
<connor> progress in the white guy </connor>
<joey> Subway sandwiches </joey>
<joey> damn I I really want to just try more </joey>
<connor> Southeast Asian food but worldwide </connor>
<connor> everyone should know that's hard to say </connor>
<joey> um I still think to this day Greek food </joey>
<joey> is underrated no </joey>
<connor> you don't like Greek food no no Greek </connor>
<connor> Greek food Greek food is so hit or miss </connor>
<joey> really and dude it's all down to what's </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] sauce they put on everything </joey>
<joey> um Suzuki yeah if that [ __ ] doesn't if </joey>
<connor> that if they didn't make that properly </connor>
<joey> the food none of the Food Works I mean </joey>
<joey> not making good Tzatziki at a Greek </joey>
<joey> restaurant is being like Oh we got </joey>
<joey> vinegar instead of soy sauce for your </joey>
<joey> sushi it's like you know it's like such </joey>
<connor> a staple that it's like if you [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> at that point there's no going off I I </connor>
<connor> I've had them I've had some amazing </connor>
<connor> Greek food that I thought was so good </connor>
<joey> but so often so often Greek restaurants </joey>
<joey> outside of Greece are so [ __ ] it's like </joey>
<joey> whoever runs it just hates everyone </joey>
<joey> in the UK in the UK or I've been </joey>
<joey> anywhere else in Europe you know I've </joey>
<joey> gone to other places in like American </joey>
<joey> I've tried Greek food and it's like I </joey>
<joey> don't know what it is it's so hit or </joey>
<joey> miss really it's like Italian it's you </joey>
<joey> can normally rely on it to be decent at </joey>
<connor> least one or two items that you like and </connor>
<connor> there's always something and it's and to </connor>
<connor> be honest you you have to really [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> try to [ __ ] up Italian food yeah like </connor>
<connor> I'm not saying that it's easy to make </connor>
<joey> but like at least the base ingredients </joey>
<joey> are pretty readily available and the </joey>
<connor> recipes aren't too complicated and like </connor>
<joey> you have to really be have awful [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> maybe I just had a good because in </joey>
<joey> Australia we have a lot of Greek </joey>
<joey> immigrants maybe like I feel like that </joey>
<joey> I've been to like two or three Greek </joey>
<joey> restaurants in Sydney and they're all </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] bomb they were so good so good I </joey>
<connor> don't know if this is like anecdotal I </connor>
<connor> think I've had the worst service </connor>
<connor> consistently in Greek restaurants really </connor>
<connor> I think so I've had the best service I </connor>
<joey> feel like a really a dude I don't know </joey>
<joey> is that like there was a Greek </joey>
<joey> restaurant it's not there anymore that </joey>
<joey> was like near my house and like we would </joey>
<joey> go there because it was quite expensive </joey>
<joey> and it's expensive to eat out in </joey>
<joey> Australia right we would go there for </joey>
<joey> like if it's like a family member's </joey>
<joey> birthday or if it's like a New Year's </joey>
<joey> thing or something like that some kind </joey>
<joey> of Celebration and we went so often year </joey>
<joey> after year that like the head chef and </joey>
<joey> like most of the people who worked there </joey>
<joey> just knew who we were yeah and we got </joey>
<joey> some of the best [ __ ] service ever </joey>
<joey> like I've never seen my dad tip in </joey>
<joey> Australia except for at this Greek </joey>
<joey> restaurant every time my dad's like my </joey>
<joey> man yeah she could have gone there yeah </joey>
<joey> and it's not there anymore I don't know </joey>
<joey> maybe I need to try some restaurant more </joey>
<joey> restaurants let's see there's some </joey>
<connor> recommendations I mean I haven't been to </connor>
<joey> Greece so I I don't know if I've had </joey>
<connor> like other things that's nice yeah </connor>
<connor> everything was really cheap I remember </connor>
<joey> that I remember the food was quite good </joey>
<joey> yeah but that that's what makes me want </joey>
<joey> to go because I had such a good </joey>
<joey> experience at Greek restaurants in </joey>
<joey> Australia literally on the other side of </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] planet from Greece that I'm </joey>
<connor> sure the fooding actual grease is just </connor>
<connor> as good if not better yeah I like the </connor>
<garnt> food grease it's good yeah I feel like I </garnt>
<garnt> need to try more like Greek Foods uh I </garnt>
<garnt> think there's one thing that I feel like </garnt>
<connor> I don't gel with Greek food and it's </connor>
<connor> just unfortunate that I just don't </connor>
<connor> really like Feta cheese you know I'm not </connor>
<garnt> you're not only feta I don't really like </garnt>
<connor> Feta a lot of people don't yeah and and </connor>
<connor> that's it is it is a strong taste it is </connor>
<garnt> it's like a very very good though it is </garnt>
<garnt> a very very strong taste a bit too </garnt>
<connor> strong for you like palettes you like </connor>
<garnt> lamb though right yeah I like lamb okay </garnt>
<garnt> yeah good Greek lamb bro don't worry I'm </garnt>
<garnt> not Emily don't worry </garnt>
<joey> yeah when I eat lime it tastes like </joey>
<joey> goat's cheese and I'm like what like </joey>
<connor> they I mean yes they come you know goat </connor>
<connor> cheese and and uh you know whatever it's </connor>
<connor> I'm like how the [ __ ] how the [ __ ] does </connor>
<joey> the mink taste like the goats I don't </joey>
<joey> trust someone who said Yuzu tastes like </joey>
<joey> lemon cleaner I don't like Yuzu that </joey>
<connor> much though I I but do you think it </connor>
<connor> tastes like lemon cleaning it's a very </connor>
<connor> strong taste I will admit I don't know </connor>
<garnt> if it's I want to get Emily back on </garnt>
<connor> because she's the only person I've met </connor>
<connor> that could like rival she's all of our </connor>
<connor> teams like put together like holy [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> every time she comes out every time she </connor>
<joey> like in private or on [ __ ] Twitter </joey>
<joey> every time like we talk about food </joey>
<garnt> she'll say something [ __ ] outrageous </garnt>
<joey> so I'm like I thought I had bad I'm just </joey>
<joey> like I'm sorry I don't I don't believe I </joey>
<connor> heard what you just said could you </connor>
<joey> repeat that family told me she didn't </joey>
<joey> like lamb and I was like </joey>
<joey> what what do you mean you don't like </joey>
<joey> lamb and so I I I'm like you know what </joey>
<joey> maybe you've just had really bad land </joey>
<joey> yes like in America I think they got </joey>
<joey> many good lamps all right I don't think </joey>
<joey> it's fresh I don't think it's good stuff </joey>
<joey> I was like whatever let's I'll take you </joey>
<joey> to somewhere that is rigid lamb and </joey>
<joey> Hokkaido it's really good [ __ ] that </joey>
<joey> place we went to oh you've been there </joey>
<joey> yeah the genius complex yeah and I was </joey>
<joey> like let's just try this it's a </joey>
<joey> different style you cook it on the grill </joey>
<joey> right yeah yeah that's so good you get </joey>
<joey> like veg on the side and it cooks and I </joey>
<joey> was like all right we'll try every cut </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna try a little bit of each one </joey>
<joey> because she was like I don't dislike </joey>
<joey> lamb I just don't think it's that good </joey>
<joey> yeah and I was like well let's try it </joey>
<joey> yeah and every single one she's like </joey>
<connor> there's like goat's cheese and I was </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> and then she's like I just I just think </connor>
<connor> beef is way better than this and I'm </connor>
<connor> like what </connor>
<connor> what it's like it's different foods </connor>
<connor> different occasions you know I I think I </connor>
<joey> don't know what it is does she not like </joey>
<joey> the gaminess of it maybe I think so </joey>
<connor> maybe yeah I I can't accept people don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<joey> I understand if you don't like it for </joey>
<joey> the gaminess but not for the subtle </joey>
<joey> cheese flavor that it has which it </joey>
<connor> doesn't I don't know what she's on yeah </connor>
<connor> I don't know so yeah that was </connor>
<connor> frustrating but I like lamb a lot I </connor>
<connor> don't see him Welsh I love life yeah but </connor>
<garnt> I feel like a lot of times in Wales they </garnt>
<connor> didn't really cook it very well all </connor>
<garnt> right yeah I will say it was always lamb </garnt>
<garnt> chops as well yeah I will say like </garnt>
<garnt> comparing like lamb to beef beef is like </garnt>
<joey> a lot harder to [ __ ] up yeah I feel like </joey>
<joey> lamb if you don't cook it correctly of </joey>
<joey> the meat quality is not good there is a </joey>
<joey> there is like a real strong aftertaste </joey>
<garnt> that can be very off-putting with land </garnt>
<joey> but when you get good lamb [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> incredible whoa have you ever had </connor>
<connor> someone ask you </connor>
<connor> uh how would you like your pork cooked </connor>
<joey> no no someone was like do you want your </joey>
<connor> pork medium rare and I was like what </connor>
<joey> I was like </joey>
<joey> I'm like what do you what do you mean so </joey>
<joey> I went to um uh a katsu Place katsu is </joey>
<joey> uh breaded uh </joey>
<connor> pork and then like fried yeah um and </connor>
<joey> they were like do you want it rare or </joey>
<joey> medium rare or well done I was like what </joey>
<connor> it's like what do you what do you mean </connor>
<connor> it's tonkatsu yeah yeah I was like isn't </connor>
<connor> it deep fried how do you do what I was </connor>
<connor> like what do you mean I was very </connor>
<garnt> confused and they were like the show </garnt>
<garnt> also it's pork you should not be yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> the chef was like we recommend it medium </garnt>
<joey> rare and I was like okay I guess I'll </joey>
<joey> trust you because it's your pork and you </joey>
<joey> do this a lot yeah I'll get medium rare </joey>
<joey> and it was slightly pink very slightly </joey>
<joey> pink like like a little bit of pink in </joey>
<garnt> the middle yeah but it was bomb it was </garnt>
<connor> really [ __ ] good and I was like is it </connor>
<connor> safe yeah I assume so otherwise I don't </connor>
<joey> think they'd be open isn't red pork like </joey>
<connor> kind of bad yeah I don't know is it can </connor>
<garnt> we google this well then this is also </garnt>
<connor> the country that also does like raw </connor>
<connor> chicken like it was when I say it was </connor>
<joey> the one I posted on Twitter that picture </joey>
<joey> of the tattoo so like it was it was </joey>
<connor> clearly all white with just very dots of </connor>
<joey> pink in the middle so I assume they were </joey>
<connor> trying to cook it because often if </connor>
<connor> you've ever if you've ever come to Japan </connor>
<joey> and you have cheap katsu it's sometimes </joey>
<joey> it can be like fighting like it is </joey>
<joey> fighting a war you're like biting really </joey>
<joey> hard to kind of separate because the </joey>
<joey> chunks are normally quite big yeah so </joey>
<joey> you do want to it's normally at least a </joey>
<joey> two biter and sometimes it is pretty </joey>
<joey> hard to get through it and you're like </joey>
<joey> okay [ __ ] man maybe it makes sense that </joey>
<joey> it would be medium rare but it worked it </joey>
<joey> worked yeah it's a little bit pink it's </joey>
<connor> okay so that's probably why it was good </connor>
<connor> it was it was tasty highly recommend it </connor>
<joey> they have it was a chain I'm sure it's </joey>
<joey> gone but like I would also be a little </joey>
<connor> bit worried if the chef came up to me </connor>
<joey> and said how would you like it I was </joey>
<connor> just I was taking her back because I I </connor>
<garnt> never had that before it was like a bog </garnt>
<connor> standard cut like corner street uh katsu </connor>
<connor> place </connor>
<connor> I I I I ordered it and I was like oh </connor>
<joey> well you know what do you what do you </joey>
<joey> mean like I'd never heard of Chef ask me </joey>
<joey> that and I thought he was saying </joey>
<joey> something else because I thought I </joey>
<joey> thought I misunderstood yeah because I </joey>
<joey> was like what the [ __ ] do you mean </joey>
<connor> medium rare what no I didn't get beef </connor>
<joey> yeah but now is that it was good I </joey>
<connor> recommend it so if you ever get if you </connor>
<joey> ever get asked in Japan how do you want </joey>
<connor> your tonkat to and if the guy recommends </connor>
<joey> medium rare trust him he knows what he's </joey>
<joey> talking about so so bottom line with the </joey>
<joey> Emily thing she tried all those </joey>
<joey> beautiful cuts of meat right A lot of it </joey>
<connor> was Australian Cuts as well if I </connor>
<connor> remember and there was deer there as </connor>
<garnt> well </garnt>
<joey> she liked the deal yeah yeah and then </joey>
<garnt> she was like ghost she's in it I think </garnt>
<garnt> she just liked I think people just like </garnt>
<garnt> beef sometimes and I think some people </garnt>
<joey> associate like beef in the uh sorry meat </joey>
<joey> in the head as chicken or beef and then </joey>
<joey> pork is somewhere in the middle but I </joey>
<joey> think some people when they've only </joey>
<connor> really eaten chicken and beef a lot they </connor>
<joey> kind of only really think about those </joey>
<joey> too and they think there's the white </joey>
<connor> mean there's a red meat and so every </connor>
<joey> flavor of meat in their mind is like a </joey>
<joey> tree that starts from chicken or beef so </joey>
<connor> I think like some kind of I think </connor>
<connor> there's some kind of thing when you just </connor>
<garnt> don't eat yeah I mean it's like a mental </garnt>
<connor> thing right away you try something new </connor>
<connor> mental death and you're just like </connor>
<joey> what did she expect when she said to the </joey>
<connor> Welsh person I don't like lamb and I was </connor>
<connor> like what do you no that's not allowed </connor>
<joey> it's because you've had [ __ ] laughs yeah </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] lamb but now she's had good lamb </joey>
<connor> man apparently that didn't change I </connor>
<connor> didn't change your mind apparently at </connor>
<connor> the end of it she was like no she </connor>
<connor> doesn't tastes like goat cheese I'm like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is your palette what is </connor>
<garnt> this [ __ ] every time someone's like </garnt>
<connor> allergic to dark deathly allergic to </connor>
<connor> food now I'm gonna be like scalicious </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> why why are we why do we just should </connor>
<connor> restart the game </connor>
<connor> what are they allergic to things why </connor>
<connor> does that happen do we know why </connor>
<connor> allergies happen yeah why would you </connor>
<garnt> become allergic to [ __ ] skin issue </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> I don't understand more is how is it </joey>
<connor> that your body is just like yeah so um </connor>
<connor> you're allergic to this this and this by </connor>
<connor> the way so don't ever have it in your </connor>
<connor> body and then 20 years later they're </connor>
<connor> like never mind I changed my mind is it </connor>
<connor> like you're good now is it like a like a </connor>
<connor> you know how like games when they ship </connor>
<joey> and there's bugs like that where like </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like a patch I feel like </joey>
<joey> there's got to be like some kind of bug </joey>
<joey> on the DNA strand well because like you </joey>
<garnt> are you are allergic to this fruit that </garnt>
<connor> is nowhere near where you are born and </connor>
<connor> no one in your ancestors have ever eaten </connor>
<joey> you're like what well because my my dad </joey>
<joey> how did that happen my dad was born with </joey>
<joey> a prawn allergy and then at the age of </joey>
<joey> life 20. </joey>
<joey> one day he was just like yeah and then I </joey>
<joey> could eat it my allergy just went away </joey>
<connor> I'm like how does that work yeah I don't </connor>
<connor> get it yeah some people who are allergic </connor>
<connor> to like everything you're like what went </connor>
<connor> wrong like what happened how did you </connor>
<connor> just get alerted to everything like what </connor>
<garnt> how does well you developed an allergy </garnt>
<joey> to I developed analogy to catch and and </joey>
<connor> some reason adults yeah skill left dude </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> imagine not being able to pet every dog </joey>
<joey> I would end it I would be like I would </joey>
<connor> end it now I would just start again </connor>
<joey> I'm I'm smacking differently on the </joey>
<connor> skill tree minus intelligence not </connor>
<connor> allergic to dogs </connor>
<connor> what's the point my happiness meter it </connor>
<garnt> cannot cannot be full I've maxed out my </garnt>
<joey> dog petting skill tree yeah that's just </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] man I need to tell him he's a good </garnt>
<garnt> boy </garnt>
<connor> that's so [ __ ] stupid that's [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> up but he just thinks it's something </joey>
<connor> else it's like oh God are you dying it's </connor>
<connor> just a like a chicken wing </connor>
<joey> is anyone allergic to chicken </joey>
<connor> uh maybe you know we should do for trash </connor>
<joey> taste we should we should take one of </joey>
<joey> those allergy tests and then we should </joey>
<joey> report our results are we allergic to </joey>
<joey> any weird specific things oh yeah </joey>
<joey> because they can give you like a test </joey>
<joey> where they prick you with like every two </joey>
<joey> thousand different yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> and they're like all right look you're </joey>
<connor> allergic to octopus fangs </connor>
<joey> you're good </joey>
<garnt> I used to be uh I used to get hay fever </garnt>
<garnt> and then I didn't and then I was just </garnt>
<garnt> like I don't know what happened I just </garnt>
<joey> woke up one day and then I just did wait </joey>
<joey> wait so you had hay fever in the UK but </joey>
<garnt> not here right no I had hay fever in the </garnt>
<joey> UK yeah and then when I turned like 18 </joey>
<garnt> or something I just stopped having hay </garnt>
<garnt> fever really yeah I don't get it in the </garnt>
<connor> UK or anything anymore your body just </connor>
<connor> decided to be a giga chat </connor>
<garnt> sneezing now I told my body to get good </garnt>
<connor> and it did so it's like it's like when I </connor>
<connor> hear about people who like they they ate </connor>
<connor> they they ignored their lactose </connor>
<connor> intolerance so much that they just </connor>
<connor> somehow stopped being lactose intolerant </connor>
<connor> I'm like you sacrificed so much no but </connor>
<joey> that but that's an actual thing that can </joey>
<joey> happen it's like because like you can </joey>
<connor> also develop it if you don't have enough </connor>
<joey> Dairy rice but also you can do the same </joey>
<joey> thing with like cats for example yeah if </joey>
<joey> you live with the same cat that you </joey>
<joey> started off as being allergic to yeah </joey>
<joey> and you just let your immune system just </joey>
<connor> fight that [ __ ] for like I think it's </connor>
<joey> like a couple of weeks on average yeah </joey>
<joey> it is true because that's what happened </joey>
<joey> to Chris oh okay yeah Chris was allergic </joey>
<garnt> to cats but then when Chris and Charles </garnt>
<garnt> suddenly be together she has a cat yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then he had to live with this cat </garnt>
<joey> for you know have him anyways after a </joey>
<joey> while he's like I'm not allergic to this </joey>
<joey> particular cat your body just learns to </joey>
<joey> process that particular cat's allergens </joey>
<connor> or whatever the [ __ ] it is whatever I </connor>
<connor> try to keep it a secret he had a cat and </connor>
<joey> there's the the cat hair constantly kept </joey>
<connor> appearing on him </connor>
<connor> that was so funny like really Chris </connor>
<joey> rookie mistake yeah but so like that </joey>
<joey> that is like one way that you can just </joey>
<connor> get over so it's really interesting in </connor>
<connor> the case with Chris it's that he's not </connor>
<connor> allergic to this one particular cat that </connor>
<connor> he lives with yeah but every other cat </connor>
<connor> he's still allergic to huh and it's like </connor>
<joey> your body just being like yeah you're </joey>
<joey> good with this all these other ones </joey>
<connor> though no you're still [ __ ] being </connor>
<connor> allergic to these fruits and whatever </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] any of this stuff yeah I could </connor>
<connor> I could live with that </connor>
<connor> but I couldn't be lactose intolerant man </connor>
<connor> I a world without cheese is one I don't </connor>
<joey> want to be in aren't we old technically </joey>
<garnt> a little bit lactose intolerant no we </garnt>
<garnt> are I don't know if you would like toast </garnt>
<connor> intolerant you would just take the L and </connor>
<connor> just like fight I would I would fight </connor>
<connor> this as the man who has food poisoning </connor>
<joey> every [ __ ] week you you you were just </joey>
<connor> like lactose </connor>
<garnt> [Applause] </garnt>
<connor> kids who are allergic to peanut butter </connor>
<connor> are like [ __ ] it they eat like the </connor>
<connor> peanut butter uh the like Reese's </connor>
<joey> complimenters stabbed himself with the </joey>
<connor> Epic man it's like I think I would be </connor>
<connor> that kid I would be like [ __ ] it </connor>
<connor> like sitting profusely on the toilet </connor>
<connor> seeing like the cheese risotto thing </connor>
<connor> they do where they they cook like they </connor>
<connor> put the McDonald's cheese they like half </connor>
<connor> the cheese I'm like all right all right </connor>
<connor> good enough load the bidet ready I'm </connor>
<joey> going in </joey>
<joey> like I have some friends who live here </joey>
<joey> who are like full on lactose intolerant </joey>
<connor> like can't eat any Shades at all some </connor>
<connor> days when I'm out eating with them Asian </connor>
<connor> right they have yeah sometimes I'm just </connor>
<joey> out eating with them and they're just </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] it like that looks too good </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna take the hair so [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> Jesus so [ __ ] good it's gonna be </joey>
<joey> shitty for a straw for the next two days </joey>
<garnt> God I love that's the one thing I can </garnt>
<garnt> agree on with French people yeah </garnt>

<joey> I love cheese sir I I would cry </joey>
<joey> profusely if I was like her satara yeah </joey>
<connor> I would too I just don't do it I I don't </connor>
<connor> think I could continue I don't think so </connor>
<joey> I'm just glad I don't have a food </joey>
<connor> allergy you know yeah you know when you </connor>
<joey> go to a restaurant and you're like do </joey>
<connor> you have any food allergies no yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like David can you get chat theme </joey>
<joey> sauce </joey>
<connor> play it </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<joey> because I love food so much and I love </joey>
<connor> like so many variations of food that </connor>
<connor> like it would just be such like an </connor>
<connor> immediate hindrance to just like yeah </connor>
<joey> actually get explorative with food I </joey>
<connor> feel yeah and it sucks it must [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> suck but like you know I got some </connor>
<connor> friends with some peanut allergies where </connor>
<joey> it's like you have to go into a </joey>
<joey> restaurant as a [ __ ] battle because </joey>
<connor> you have to profusely make sure that </connor>
<connor> they know like hey I cannot have </connor>
<connor> anything with peanuts yeah peanuts you </connor>
<connor> cannot breathe near peanuts and walk </connor>
<connor> near me like they're and sometimes they </connor>
<garnt> take it seriously and sometimes they </garnt>
<garnt> don't yeah yeah I mean it's unfortunate </garnt>
<garnt> um because I remember when I when during </garnt>
<garnt> my wedding you know obviously I had to </garnt>
<garnt> get everyone's dietary requirements oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah and then everyone was just like </joey>
<joey> fine fine fine fine fine and then you </joey>
<joey> know had one person have to like send me </joey>

<connor> this is what you have to live with a </connor>
<joey> friend in the UK who's uh allergic to </joey>
<joey> Sesame yeah um but they're Asian </joey>
<connor> yeah of course of course they use sesame </connor>
<joey> oil a lot of the times to cook yeah yeah </joey>
