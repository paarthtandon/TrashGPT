<garnt> yeah a year at least profs possibly </garnt>
<connor> years cuz I mean when we decided we were </connor>
<connor> gonna move to Japan I think the first </connor>
<connor> thing in our mind was what we gonna make </connor>
<garnt> a podcast yeah yeah but but I think it </garnt>
<garnt> were even before that the idea of just </garnt>
<garnt> us finally getting into a room and just </garnt>
<garnt> you know not doing a one-off collab but </garnt>
<garnt> doing like a continual collab has been </garnt>
<garnt> you know in our minds for ages yeah I </garnt>
<joey> want to say several years yes at least </joey>
<connor> almost as known as late as long as I've </connor>

<garnt> like who's that guy exactly right hi I'm </garnt>

<joey> are I swear I'm so yeah let's actually </joey>
<connor> you know what before we talk about that </connor>
<connor> we should talk about what this podcast </connor>
<garnt> is because it's so was so light excited </garnt>
<connor> I'm finally excited to get this thing </connor>
<connor> off the ground so basically trash taste </connor>
<garnt> as the name implies is a podcast where </garnt>
<garnt> we us three and maybe </garnt>
<garnt> even a guest you never know comes onto </garnt>
<joey> the show and we basically talk about our </joey>
<joey> trash taste whether it comes to anime </joey>
<joey> manga just otaku culture in general or </joey>
<joey> you never know we might talk about </joey>
<garnt> whatever the [ __ ] we want </garnt>
<garnt> who knows yeah cuz if you didn't know we </garnt>
<connor> are all like anime youtubers yeah so </connor>
<garnt> know this guy called the anime man this </garnt>
<connor> guy called c-dog bar which God bow yeah </connor>
<connor> that too fast and Virginia is all the </connor>
<joey> comments from Virginia it's okay cuz the </joey>
<garnt> amount of years that I still get </garnt>
<connor> comments which is like they call me geek </connor>
<connor> UK and not get up I mean listen people </connor>
<garnt> might call you Kiki okay but I still </garnt>
<garnt> know you as the an amazing okay in but </garnt>
<joey> in the thumbnails in the old thumbnails </joey>
<garnt> that's how I knew I was watching an </garnt>
<garnt> anime zone I'm actually curious how long </garnt>
<garnt> have you been watching my videos because </garnt>
<garnt> this ties into how we first met as well </garnt>
<joey> I've known you I mean I obviously as I </joey>
<garnt> said I've known you since at the animes </garnt>
<connor> on it that's like that's the line so </connor>
<connor> it's like a long time but I think I like </connor>
<connor> I watched you probably not knowing that </connor>
<connor> you will like this like YouTube </connor>
<connor> personality because yeah yeah Sam yeah I </connor>
<connor> like cuz I was in like a weird state I </connor>
<connor> don't think I discovered youtubers until </connor>
<connor> maybe about 2011 yeah because they've </connor>
<garnt> been around for a long time since then </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and obviously you've been around </garnt>
<connor> since then but I never like went onto </connor>
<connor> YouTube being like I'm gonna go check </connor>
<garnt> out my favorite YouTube I couldn't just </garnt>
<connor> use YouTube up until around 2011 I think </connor>
<connor> I just use youtubers to like either </connor>
<connor> watch music all this in the music videos </connor>
<connor> or just to like oh this is an </connor>
<connor> interesting looking video yeah and I </connor>
<garnt> think a couple of your videos will like </garnt>
<garnt> the interesting looking ones I think I </garnt>
<garnt> remember actually the first video I ever </garnt>
<garnt> watched from you surprisingly was not a </garnt>
<garnt> verb ridged oh sure I watched saver </garnt>
<garnt> bridge when I like the idea of an like a </garnt>
<connor> breeding that sounds fun but tedious is </connor>
<connor> fun but um no I think the first video </connor>
<garnt> what from you was </garnt>
<garnt> I probably want to say it's the size </garnt>
<garnt> review oh my god like the one you didn't </garnt>
<garnt> like mm I never even saw your IVA </garnt>
<garnt> aver a bridge yeah I just excited watch </garnt>
<garnt> Davis I was like why would i watch the </garnt>
<garnt> upper I don't even know what this is why </garnt>
<garnt> would I watch that so I think I watched </garnt>
<garnt> some of your stuff I just knew you </garnt>
<garnt> always the British one yeah my brand </garnt>
<connor> yeah that was like it was like Tristan </connor>
<garnt> and then you in my mind I think that was </garnt>
<connor> it to a lot of people when yes when I </connor>
<garnt> got into it like 2013 I stopped watching </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube alone especially anime stuff </garnt>
<connor> right yeah but they're so how long have </connor>
<garnt> you been doing YouTube for I've been </garnt>
<garnt> doing it since 2007 oh he's like an </garnt>
<joey> actual OG I'm like I'll have to like </joey>
<joey> trace back but I'm think I'm like the </joey>
<joey> fifth ever anime youtuber Wow of all the </joey>
<joey> time might be like fourth or fifth but </joey>
<joey> I've been there since the beginning I </joey>
<joey> can recite the entire history of a knee </joey>
<joey> tube which we're definitely gonna do </joey>
<joey> with this episode because there there's </joey>
<joey> a lot to say but now like I remember the </joey>
<connor> first I can't remember what the exact </connor>
<connor> first video I saw from you Joey but I </connor>
<connor> remember your video is just getting </connor>
<connor> recommended to be constantly and I'm </connor>
<connor> just like my first thought was how has </connor>
<connor> no one taken to handle the anime I've </connor>
<garnt> been on YouTube for so many [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> years and just now someone is called the </garnt>
<garnt> animate there's no [ __ ] no but the thing </garnt>
<joey> is some what did take the handle </joey>
<garnt> animator oh because that's why like like </garnt>
<connor> even my like my YouTube URL and like my </connor>
<connor> Twitter and everything it's the anime </connor>
<garnt> man but so and I it's a 1 because </garnt>
<connor> somebody like Facebook Twitter Instagram </connor>
<garnt> like YouTube someone took the anime man </garnt>
<garnt> it was like this guy who never uploaded </garnt>
<garnt> any videos haha and he's been arrested </garnt>
<garnt> like 2007 yeah it's always just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> man you are such a son of a [ __ ] so I </garnt>
<garnt> was like well what am I gonna do alright </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] one somehow that caught on I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know yeah [ __ ] but yeah I mean I </garnt>
<garnt> regret that name I mean it works for SEO </garnt>
<garnt> verow because the reason I was called </garnt>
<garnt> the anime zone is because back in the </garnt>
<joey> day when you could just type in anime </joey>
<joey> and it was just all my videos I'm like </joey>
<garnt> man I've won this game </garnt>
<garnt> I'm playing the game correctly and then </garnt>
<joey> I came along a hold my beer exactly </joey>
<garnt> you're in this arm I'm the man but I </garnt>
<garnt> remember the first time I was I mean I </garnt>
<garnt> don't think I ever saw one of your </garnt>
<connor> videos the first time I heard about you </connor>
<connor> Connor was actually when you auditioned </connor>
<connor> for one of my bridge series so really </connor>
<connor> yeah yes I haven't told you story to Joe </connor>
<garnt> yeah I did a casting call for one of the </garnt>
<garnt> in minutes videos right and I told </garnt>
<garnt> people to send in their demo trying to </garnt>
<connor> remember what this was yeah and so I </connor>
<garnt> asked people to send in their demo reel </garnt>
<connor> and most people send in their demo reel </connor>
<connor> and this and this guy this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> doesn't even send in a demo reel he just </connor>
<garnt> sends in a YouTube video of him doing </garnt>
<garnt> League of left leg of legend character </garnt>
<garnt> why you should also never do that </garnt>
<garnt> yourself yeah don't do that we're gonna </garnt>
<connor> someone asked for demos send a demo reel </connor>
<connor> yeah no I think at the time I didn't </connor>
<connor> have a character demo reel chief I still </connor>
<garnt> don't have a character demo reel because </garnt>
<garnt> I never needed it okay his things well a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of character demos on Twitter you'll </garnt>
<garnt> hear them they're really really bad yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and the thing is when you're making it </garnt>
<connor> yourself you don't have anyone to say </connor>
<connor> like hey this voice kind of sucks so </connor>
<connor> like every time I've made a professional </connor>
<connor> demo I've had like a director who's like </connor>
<garnt> hand shows and every scene and told me </garnt>
<connor> what to do yeah and then it sounds good </connor>
<garnt> because someone who can hear your voice </garnt>
<garnt> and be like I'll do this and that but </garnt>
<garnt> back then I didn't know that and this </garnt>
<garnt> was before I started doing a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> professional staff in that yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> great way to introduce yourself or </connor>
<connor> someone this is okay this is also </connor>
<connor> another thing you shouldn't send a demo </connor>
<connor> to someone if it's garbage cuz you're </connor>
<connor> gonna like this guy still remembers that </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] I remember because he was the only </garnt>
<garnt> person who didn't send a demo reel or </garnt>
<garnt> just sent a YouTube video of him doing </garnt>
<garnt> impressions </garnt>
<garnt> Melisande like if there is a like a </garnt>
<garnt> checklist of things not to say our demo </garnt>
<garnt> do not send character impression that's </garnt>
<joey> such a big that's such a big do you </joey>
<connor> remember which characters he did I think </connor>
<connor> so I think they were like I was just a </connor>
<garnt> bunch of the manly guys from League of </garnt>
<garnt> Legends just anyone with a low voice </garnt>
<connor> yeah oh no it's like it's been awesome </connor>
<garnt> seeing you how far you've come from yeah </garnt>
<garnt> in a character impression real to you </garnt>
<connor> like that was like I that must have been </connor>
<connor> just like a year or two after I started </connor>
<connor> as well and I still like you think that </connor>
<joey> you figure stuff out after a year but </joey>
<joey> like you realized when you look back </joey>
<joey> like you've still you didn't know [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> because what year did you start YouTube </joey>
<joey> ah YouTube I started 2015 2015 2015 2015 </joey>
<garnt> I started voice acting really in like </garnt>
<garnt> 2013 late 2014 so that gave me a big </garnt>
<joey> like advantage I went into it with like </joey>
<joey> a great microphone which I'm not voice </joey>
<joey> acting yeah yeah yeah and we'd find that </joey>
<connor> how I met you actually have the email </connor>
<garnt> sent before we started recording this </garnt>
<joey> we're gonna talk about like how we all </joey>
<joey> made want to help this guy was like I </joey>
<joey> don't think Joey remembers the first </joey>
<connor> time we met I think I do though okay </connor>
<connor> sorry to read the email that I saw this </connor>
<garnt> is why I had what you send it to me </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah yeah so this is about like I </garnt>
<connor> must have been like four months into me </connor>
<connor> doing YouTube I think I had like maybe </connor>
<garnt> 30 40 K sobs yeah I think Joey I think </garnt>
<garnt> he had like nine hundred K at this time </garnt>
<garnt> probably it was something like you had a </garnt>
<garnt> long yeah I think way more than I had </garnt>
<garnt> and so I sent you an email saying that's </garnt>
<garnt> Owen hello there my name is Connor </garnt>

<joey> that Jerry sent me was like yo your </joey>

<joey> that so that's how I and she'd say I </joey>
<joey> thought that was so cool that you </joey>
<joey> actually replied cuz I'm not gonna lie </joey>
<connor> I'm kind of mean when I see a video </connor>
<connor> normally when it's like collab it's </connor>
<connor> normally like normally it's like I I </connor>
<connor> don't know what I want to do yet but I </connor>
<connor> want to collab you don't know what you </connor>
<connor> want to do so that's why I'm a year yeah </connor>
<connor> I [ __ ] remember that too because yeah </connor>
<connor> the the rap battle I did was oh so bad </connor>
<connor> don't watch it looks like I gotta prove </connor>
<connor> to you that I'm the best you want a </connor>
<connor> fight little email will be my guest the </connor>
<connor> full through the end until I got enough </connor>
<connor> on my chest but pretty bad it was pretty </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] bad at the time it was the first </garnt>
<garnt> time I ever used the green screen in my </garnt>
<garnt> like because I was in like my tiny </garnt>
<garnt> bedroom in Australia yeah there was no </garnt>
<garnt> place to like prop up the green screen </garnt>
<garnt> yeah what I had to do it so get her what </garnt>
<garnt> I have to do was I had to get the green </garnt>
<garnt> screen and literally like tape it to the </garnt>
<garnt> ceiling no I've done exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> thing and like I had no light so you can </garnt>
<garnt> see my shadow [ __ ] flickering in and </garnt>
<garnt> out the whole video I only could entrap </garnt>
<garnt> at the time I'm a little bit better now </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah it was a what was it it was a </garnt>
<connor> light no it was L from Death Note versus </connor>
<connor> Lelouch </connor>
<connor> from code right I remember I played </connor>
<connor> louche and another friend of mine played </connor>
<garnt> L know and I think the video has like </garnt>
<joey> half a million views </joey>
<garnt> I don't know how yeah I mean this is </garnt>
<garnt> back when it was like epic Rap Battles </garnt>
<joey> of History yeah that's like 2015 YouTube </joey>
<joey> yeah but basically like that kind of </joey>
<joey> somehow pulped off on my channel and </joey>
<connor> then yeah and then because I actually </connor>
<garnt> was riding that with grey fox at the </garnt>
<connor> time yeah amazing guy yeah and I thought </connor>
<garnt> like we had it we had like a banger </garnt>
<connor> we had like so many like grey fox had </connor>
<connor> made the tracks for many beads and they </connor>
<connor> were playing amazing and sending emails </connor>
<garnt> that's such a Boomer way to slide into </garnt>
<connor> something I mean now it's Twitter not to </connor>
<joey> mention we added each other on skype and </joey>
<connor> then I think like your Skype account got </connor>
<joey> hacked or something that uh I know I met </joey>
<garnt> you but it was weird cuz I think Sydney </garnt>
<garnt> we I saw Sydney was following me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's not my fiancee yeah Anna I </garnt>
<garnt> think it followed her backs I knew of </garnt>
<garnt> Sydney and then Sydney a DM me she'll </garnt>
<garnt> say that she didn't Sydney DM me first </garnt>
<garnt> and she was like you going to MCM which </garnt>
<garnt> is a convention in London yeah okay and </garnt>
<garnt> then Sydney was like oh come come to </garnt>
<garnt> this meet up you can meet me and gone I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't get to meet gone who's too busy </garnt>
<garnt> so I turned up like an idiot was like hi </garnt>
<connor> I'm like c-dawg </connor>
<connor> and stuff and everyone at the time I had </connor>
<connor> like 200k subscribers here's a </connor>
<garnt> substantial amount yeah that time period </garnt>
<garnt> but it was funny because you had </garnt>
<garnt> audience that was vastly different from </garnt>
<joey> their every other enemy still like that </joey>
<connor> it's it's gone like a lot lesser at the </connor>
<connor> time in around 2000 the peak of it at </connor>
<garnt> 2014 I had a 93 percent female audience </garnt>
<joey> which is his nickname when we first met </joey>
<garnt> him was the 93 % yeah </garnt>
<joey> just like how's the 90% doing okay I got </joey>
<joey> bullied for it I really want to stop </joey>
<connor> it's 55 60 percent now it's level down </connor>
<connor> along yeah it was crazy there and that's </connor>
<connor> like all the youtubers in anime all </connor>
<connor> dudes there was like one or two girls </connor>
<connor> yeah all dudes so every time I turned up </connor>
<connor> to like an ana tuber Meetup everyone's </connor>
<connor> like who the [ __ ] is this guy </connor>
<connor> how does he got 200k yeah so I mean </connor>
<connor> that's how I met gone and then we went </connor>
<garnt> from yeah can I tell the story about how </garnt>
<joey> the first time we heard yeah cuz I don't </joey>
<garnt> know where you're gonna start okay so </garnt>
<joey> the first time we met in person </joey>
<joey> so it was like ax 2000 and is it 17 it </joey>
<joey> was 16 or 17 I think I think so </joey>
<garnt> I knew Joey I didn't know that he knew </garnt>
<joey> who I was right and vice versa a new god </joey>
<joey> but I didn't know if he knew me yeah so </joey>
<garnt> this was back when I had like if you </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know I took a hiatus on on </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube for like two years because I got </garnt>
<garnt> a real time a real job and everything </garnt>
<garnt> like that and in that time I had gone </garnt>
<garnt> from being like one of the most popular </garnt>
<garnt> anime youtubers to just you know to </garnt>
<garnt> someone who taken i8s and in that time </garnt>
<garnt> Joey had like exploded like you you were </garnt>
<garnt> you reached numbers that's back in my </garnt>
<garnt> time I didn't know what's even [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> possible like you you were like close to </garnt>
<garnt> a million you were like like hot [ __ ] at </garnt>
<garnt> the time yeah so the first time welcome </garnt>
<garnt> so the first time I saw Joey we were </garnt>
<garnt> like in Little Tokyo or something </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah I remember exactly where it </joey>
<connor> was - it was that pot in like the back </connor>
<connor> half of Little Tokyo yeah right it's </connor>
<garnt> like underneath a building and you go </garnt>
<garnt> into where the like a figurine shop yeah </garnt>
<joey> and yeah and you were walking with Jeff </joey>
<garnt> right yeah yeah that's why I Jeff </garnt>
<garnt> because I think Jeff said hello to misty </garnt>
<garnt> because they're both tall [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> he was just like standing next to two </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] skyscrapers well we're just </garnt>
<garnt> hanging out and I remember looking at </garnt>
<garnt> you and you look to me and we didn't say </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] to each other and I thought this I </garnt>
<garnt> thought this [ __ ] must hate me </garnt>
<garnt> this [ __ ] hates me and that's </garnt>
<joey> the same time I like a gun I like looked </joey>
<joey> at each other in the eyes and in my head </joey>
<joey> I was like this guy definitely hates me </joey>
<garnt> this guy hates my guts so I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> man Joey's such an arrogant piece of </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] I can't believe this guy man but we </joey>
<garnt> shook hands we were like hi I'm Joey </garnt>
<joey> nice to meet you like hi I'm gone I said </joey>
<connor> that was it and that was it that was so </connor>
<connor> I've never heard this well because the </connor>
<garnt> only people who were there was misty </garnt>
<garnt> Jeff iñaki yeah I'm thinking us too so </garnt>
<joey> it was like very small yeah and then </joey>
<garnt> what like fast forward like what two </garnt>
<garnt> years I think it was just I think it was </garnt>
<garnt> next year we might you might have been </garnt>
<garnt> even less than that when I came to Egypt </garnt>
<joey> went on to a trip to Japan or something </joey>
<joey> and then you randomly deemed me yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah like for some reason he </garnt>
<garnt> follows me so maybe she doesn't hate me </garnt>
<connor> oh cool he's cool so yeah we sweet TMZ </connor>
<garnt> chowder and then we met in Japan and </garnt>
<garnt> then we just like instantly Italy just </garnt>

<garnt> little bit and then we went to an </garnt>
<joey> izakaya and Elena yeah yeah it's all </joey>
<garnt> like ridiculously missed the last room </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then we were like oh it sounds </garnt>
<connor> like a bromance we missed the last train </connor>
<garnt> we had so much fun because we had the </garnt>
<garnt> moment when we just we were seeing it on </garnt>
<garnt> in there he's like izakaya and I was </garnt>
<connor> like I thought you hated me and I was </connor>
<joey> like I thought you ate at me yeah and </joey>
<joey> then after that we had like a karaoke </joey>
<joey> nights where we yeah I think was like a </joey>
<joey> few days later yeah and I think that's </joey>
<joey> when the seeds of the podcast was sown I </joey>
<joey> think because we were up to we missed </joey>
<joey> last train and we were just with karaoke </joey>
<joey> with each other and Sydney and there was </joey>
<joey> like two other people </joey>
<joey> and then everyone else had fallen asleep </joey>
<joey> but it was just us to one other guy it </joey>
<joey> was like it was like 5:00 a.m. he didn't </joey>
<garnt> know who we were like he didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> that we were like anime youtubes or </garnt>
<garnt> anything huh so we're up at 5:00 a.m. </garnt>
<garnt> drunk as [ __ ] and then me and Joey just </garnt>
<joey> start hosting this panel for this one </joey>
<joey> guy karaoke microphone age like welcome </joey>
<joey> to yeah he didn't know who we were but </joey>
<garnt> we still just host this anime panel for </garnt>
<joey> him I don't name I didn't even know if </joey>
<joey> he watched anime or not but I'm like my </joey>
<joey> dear Joey what's your opinion on Bucky </joey>
<joey> Monica true who is best girl like an </joey>
<joey> hour then after that we were like we </joey>
<joey> need to host a panel together yeah and </joey>
<joey> we managed to do that last year ax which </joey>
<joey> was first time that was amazing yes yeah </joey>
<joey> like two three years in the making and </joey>
<garnt> in between that we were like surely we </garnt>
<joey> gotta make a podcast and here we are </joey>
<garnt> after [ __ ] what three or four years </garnt>
<garnt> yeah from like first conception yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> like even like planning this whole </garnt>
<joey> podcast out as well like toke up very </joey>
<connor> very long time because this is actually </connor>
<connor> a studio for it yes so we have to like </connor>
<garnt> get our own studio as you can see as you </garnt>
<joey> can see we're still working on it just </joey>
<garnt> working on it but give us some time </garnt>
<garnt> stick just like getting a studio in in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan oh my god you're Toki oh my </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] god don't even get me started on </garnt>
<garnt> how hard that was okay I'm sure we can </garnt>
<garnt> talk about in future or experiences with </garnt>
<garnt> just renting yeah stuff in Japan my god </garnt>
<garnt> bear yeah no I you know what's funny </garnt>
<garnt> when you guys are like you said like </garnt>
<garnt> just click like that after you guys </garnt>
<garnt> start talking it's so like I think that </garnt>
<joey> happens easily when you're both like </joey>
<joey> around the same like sub thing because </joey>
<joey> there's no question if you're trying to </joey>
<joey> leech off each other right yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> because I remember like when I when I </joey>
<joey> first started and when I was trying to </joey>
<garnt> it like when we were like first like </garnt>
<garnt> hanging out I always feel like man they </garnt>
<garnt> wonder if I'm she's like a leech </garnt>
<garnt> I'd like a hundred and fifty two hundred </garnt>
<garnt> and they had like million-plus right so </garnt>
<garnt> you just get this thing in your head you </garnt>
<connor> like my anime leeching do they think </connor>
<connor> that but then like when you get like I </connor>
<connor> think now I don't give a [ __ ] because </connor>
<joey> like I I'm here I mean like concerning </joey>
<connor> you and I yeah we popped off very </connor>
<connor> naturally because spoiler we never ended </connor>
<connor> up doing that no battle yeah yeah it </connor>
<connor> that just like disappeared because I </connor>
<connor> think the first time I like publicly did </connor>
<connor> something with you yeah was on your </connor>
<connor> stream yeah yeah you do broforce </connor>
<joey> together for like three yeah there's </joey>
<connor> still a pond on new to bar really yeah </connor>
<garnt> they all yeah yeah yeah and then I think </garnt>
<connor> we just I played a lot of games on your </connor>
<joey> stream with you and then I think we just </joey>
<connor> hung out at ax and you just went and </connor>
<joey> then obviously play like Metal Slug [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> oh my oh yah metal slugs on like my </connor>
<connor> favorite game and then I think we just </connor>
<garnt> did British things and I feel like it's </garnt>
<garnt> so easy to befriend other British people </garnt>
<garnt> cuz it's just like we just get it I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know no like going off to what you </garnt>
<garnt> said about feeling like you're leaching </garnt>
<connor> from something yeah it's it's weird </connor>
<connor> right because you can as someone who's </connor>
<garnt> been in the position of you know not you </garnt>
<garnt> know being a smaller youtuber and a </garnt>
<garnt> larger youtuber it's you can kind of get </garnt>
<connor> a sense just from meeting a person </connor>
<garnt> especially if you meet them in real life </garnt>
<connor> right online </connor>
<connor> it's so [ __ ] difficult as true to </connor>
<connor> gauge what a character what someone's </connor>
<garnt> character is actually like and you know </garnt>
<garnt> if they're trying to you know leech off </garnt>
<garnt> you know get clout or whatever but </garnt>
<joey> especially at a event like ax where the </joey>
<joey> real person comes out yeah yeah yeah you </joey>
<garnt> can definitely get a better judge of </garnt>
<garnt> character at a convention or meeting </garnt>
<garnt> someone in real life yeah a big event </garnt>
<connor> like ax </connor>
<connor> I think there's I'm also a lot with that </connor>
<connor> is that when you're at ax I think some </connor>
<connor> people think okay I've only got five </connor>
<garnt> minutes with this guy you've got to like </garnt>
<connor> befriend him yeah so they I think they </connor>
<garnt> like sometimes they go overboard with </garnt>
<connor> like trying to impress you where it's </connor>
<garnt> like I mean one thing I've noticed with </garnt>
<connor> when it comes to like cuz I've been to </connor>
<garnt> so many conventions where like people </garnt>
<garnt> have come up to me just for that like </garnt>
<connor> five minutes that they have time with </connor>
<garnt> somebody yeah so I just I don't want to </garnt>
<garnt> say kiss us but you know when someone's </garnt>
<garnt> trying to kiss ass here yeah all like </garnt>
<garnt> but like the thing is is that like at </garnt>
<garnt> least earlier on when I would meet </garnt>
<garnt> people like that and they're trying to </garnt>
<garnt> be nice to me during those </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes I didn't know if they were </garnt>
<garnt> just trying to kiss my ass or if there </garnt>
<garnt> were genuinely nice people yeah but the </garnt>
<garnt> one way I found it is if they can I </garnt>
<garnt> guess like main try and maintain that </garnt>
<garnt> friendship with you and try and stay </garnt>
<garnt> contact with you after that event then I </garnt>
<joey> think they're like genuinely nice people </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah because I I don't want to make </garnt>
<garnt> it sound like we all [ __ ] arseholes </garnt>
<connor> you think I'm talking with hearing about </connor>
<garnt> how you just message cornerback from </garnt>
<garnt> just that one email yeah I also remember </garnt>
<garnt> the point when I would just try to like </garnt>
<garnt> talk to everyone in class yeah but then </garnt>
<garnt> you get to a point when you see that </garnt>
<garnt> ninety percent of these emails in ninety </garnt>
<garnt> percent of these people talking to you </garnt>
<garnt> don't actually mean what they mean or </garnt>
<garnt> looking for something and you get a </garnt>
<garnt> sense force you get a sense for that as </garnt>
<connor> time goes by so it's it's I feel like </connor>
<connor> you just glanced at an email now and you </connor>
<joey> know actually here's a question for you </joey>
<joey> what's the way I know you've got some </joey>
<garnt> stories of this Connor Oh God </garnt>
<garnt> what does someone like the weirdest fan </garnt>
<garnt> emails you've ever received I get them </garnt>
<garnt> every week right I'd like to say every </garnt>
<garnt> week but it's like I've gotten somewhere </garnt>
<connor> it's just like I think like I'm actually </connor>
<connor> scared to open it even though there's </connor>
<garnt> like no attachments no links or anything </garnt>
<garnt> but even a subject title it's literally </garnt>
<garnt> just I open it and it says you're cool </garnt>
<garnt> open an email like that and like </garnt>
<garnt> midnight is like the scariest [ __ ] ever </garnt>
<joey> because I'm just like did my computer </joey>
<joey> just get hacked I don't know if this is </joey>
<joey> like an elaborate like trojan or or if </joey>
<joey> it's just like a ten-year-old who's </joey>
<garnt> learning to use an email for the first </garnt>
<joey> time like I'm like thanks but when they </joey>
<connor> just send a link that's cool it's like </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah man I don't know I've got so </joey>
<garnt> many stories I guess of emails because I </garnt>
<garnt> guess it's my fault because I kind of </garnt>
<garnt> encouraged it a little bit yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I've made multiple videos where I've got </garnt>
<garnt> content from my email sometimes it's </garnt>
<garnt> good but then </garnt>
<garnt> so I think now since I've joined an </garnt>
<garnt> agency I feel bad for the agency where </garnt>
<garnt> they sometimes I get said luckily I </garnt>
<connor> normally like delete the ones that I </connor>
<connor> know I like like just trolling the for </connor>
<connor> by agency you can see it because I don't </connor>
<connor> want some Japanese worker opening my </connor>
<connor> email and it being like hey I think your </connor>
<connor> dummy thick and I'm 13 </connor>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<garnt> that's like you get stuff where they'll </garnt>
<garnt> say like they they want to date you and </garnt>
<garnt> I'll put their 13 and like that it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like is this Christmas in is Chris </garnt>
<connor> Hansen emailing yeah I think I've spoke </connor>
<garnt> about this in a video once but there was </garnt>
<garnt> a someone who emailed me and I still </garnt>
<garnt> remember this cuz like I hadn't </garnt>
<garnt> interacted to it and it was this </garnt>
<garnt> interaction where they sent me a script </garnt>
<garnt> of phone sex that we were gonna have so </garnt>
<garnt> it was like it was like what I actually </garnt>
<garnt> still have the script I'm not gonna read </garnt>
<garnt> it out cuz there's more to the story </garnt>
<connor> that there's the reason why I decided to </connor>
<connor> not make it into a video yeah but it was </connor>
<connor> like a script and it was it was first it </connor>
<garnt> was one script was me and her and there </garnt>
<garnt> was also a music setlist that she'd </garnt>
<garnt> chosen so there was when the music was </garnt>
<garnt> it was like pour some like sugar on me </garnt>
<joey> oh my you know like the cheesiest song </joey>
<garnt> and so I thought in my head cause back </garnt>
<garnt> then I read all of them in depth and I </garnt>
<connor> thought wow this is a video idea if I </connor>
<garnt> can like is going right and there's also </garnt>
<connor> another script where as me having gay </connor>
<connor> sex with the sebastian michaelis of </connor>
<connor> course of course I mean that would be </connor>
<garnt> expected funny that's like not the </garnt>
<connor> weirdest story I'm surprised you didn't </connor>
<connor> make a video Wow okay so here's why and </connor>
<connor> I feel bad I hope this person isn't </connor>
<garnt> watching so I interacted with them a bit </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like obviously I knew they </garnt>
<connor> were gonna be strange right because ever </connor>
<connor> sends an email like that yeah and I </connor>
<connor> start interacting with them more and </connor>
<connor> more and then they started sending me </connor>
<garnt> way too much information about </garnt>
<garnt> themselves </garnt>
<garnt> there's also another guy who sent me is </garnt>
<garnt> birth certificate by the way that's a </garnt>
<garnt> whole nother what oh don't do that </garnt>
<garnt> turn that stage don't do that I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> ask for his opening email was his my </garnt>
<garnt> birth ticket driving license address and </garnt>
<garnt> I was like what is </garnt>
<garnt> I also mentioned this I don't know which </garnt>
<garnt> video I said I just mentioned all this </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah so I replied to this person I </garnt>
<garnt> kept replying with them because they </garnt>
<garnt> kept replying with really funny stuff </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah I was like oh my god I can </garnt>
<garnt> get an amazing video out of this yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then with the one thing they said </garnt>
<garnt> which made me think okay now I just have </garnt>
<garnt> to like completely scrap all this is </garnt>
<garnt> that they said like oh here are my </garnt>
<connor> hobbies hobbies blah blah blah by the </connor>
<garnt> way I'm in the Special Olympics team for </garnt>
<garnt> the USA but I was like like why you </garnt>
<connor> shouldn't be sending me this and then I </connor>
<connor> explained to them you know I was like </connor>
<joey> hey maybe you shouldn't send this email </joey>
<garnt> to me and you know I don't think this is </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah appropriate way and I'm really </garnt>
<joey> sorry for like messing with your time </joey>
<garnt> and stop it I just it was a whole thing </garnt>
<connor> where I was like oh my god I'm an </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] and Jesus Christ like yeah but </garnt>
<connor> yeah there's so many emails I've gotten </connor>
<garnt> where I mean I made a whole video where </garnt>
<connor> I went on a date with someone else yes a </connor>
<joey> date yeah from an email you were like </joey>
<connor> Kaunas gonna get canceled I remember you </connor>
<garnt> pitching that video idea to me and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like I don't know that's the best </garnt>
<connor> idea but I mean it turned out good video </connor>
<joey> yeah I pitched it to like 10 10 of our </joey>
<connor> friends and everyone's like no don't do </connor>
<joey> that don't do that I love hockey my </joey>
<connor> girlfriend was like genuinely worried </connor>
<connor> for you is like I really don't think I </connor>
<connor> watch the video they felt more concern </connor>
<garnt> for the girl because we turned up with </garnt>
<garnt> light me Evon mood and another guy like </garnt>
<garnt> one go alone right so thank you no but </garnt>
<garnt> it was like I I'm a wholesome in the end </garnt>
<garnt> as well </garnt>
<connor> she's very nice about it yeah yeah she's </connor>
<connor> like the video sounds good she just </connor>
<garnt> walked into our casting couch </garnt>
<connor> alright I don't get off that actually I </connor>
<garnt> actually don't get that many weird </garnt>
<connor> emails or weird fan mails yeah I don't </connor>
<connor> know I guess it's cuz I mostly talk </connor>
<connor> about anime and it's less about my own </connor>
<connor> personality I guess I don't know I guess </connor>
<connor> like one weird email ago recently which </connor>
<connor> wasn't even an email to me right so </connor>
<connor> someone used my email and pretended to </connor>
<connor> be me and emailed </connor>
<connor> studio wits </connor>
<connor> okay okay I got the email here actually </connor>
<connor> the emailed studio whit's pretending to </connor>
<connor> be me as they use my email and I got a </connor>
<connor> notification from the official studio </connor>
<garnt> with like you know you know like the </garnt>
<connor> automatic notification that says hey </connor>
<garnt> you've submitted this email to us okay </garnt>
<connor> so the email reads hello I am anime </connor>
<garnt> reviewer giggle I will make a request of </garnt>
<garnt> you </garnt>
<connor> many people want Eren and Mikasa to have </connor>
<garnt> a relationship Eren X Mikasa I think if </garnt>
<connor> this happens many people will enjoy the </connor>
<garnt> anime more has to be a troll I would be </garnt>
<garnt> pleased with the development of events </garnt>
<connor> in this direction I hope you will </connor>
<connor> evaluate my proposal I wish you good day </connor>
<connor> man this hazard email I said you contact </connor>
<joey> me for more to figure out the logistics </joey>
<joey> of Eren Mikasa oh no this is completely </joey>
<joey> bypassed you say arm I just go straight </joey>
<connor> to wit they just emailed studio with who </connor>
<garnt> has no creative control over how attack </garnt>
<joey> on Titans gonna end anyway I really want </joey>
<joey> I really wish that like studio we took </joey>
<joey> that email seriously and like actually </joey>
<joey> hooked up like you say I'm a being like </joey>
<joey> so uh this popular you know do you make </joey>
<garnt> this a thing yeah please make this a </garnt>
<garnt> theme a season for attack on Titan I'm </garnt>
<joey> ready I'm ready </joey>
<joey> hey you never know like none of us have </joey>
<garnt> caught up on the manga yeah no no no </garnt>
<connor> I feel like it's a crime to and if it </connor>
<joey> does happen we can thank a certain extra </joey>
<garnt> castes a thing I know I know who break </garnt>
<joey> out the beers </joey>
<garnt> this has been a long time coming welcome </garnt>
<joey> to trash taste podcast if you if you if </joey>
<garnt> you want to know drinking is going to be </garnt>
<joey> a quite frequent occurrence on this show </joey>
<garnt> yeah so get used to it yeah so that was </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't imagine our intro was gonna be </garnt>
<connor> that long ago in my head I was like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] finally I think it would you guys </connor>
<joey> will say that attack on Titan season 4 </joey>
<garnt> is your most anticipated Absa follow me </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> how do you even match that hype at this </garnt>
<garnt> point it's like exeed it's uh it was </garnt>
<joey> meant to be airing this fall I think oh </joey>
<joey> this summer I believe it was definitely </joey>
<joey> it was wrong but yeah I think it's I'm </joey>
<garnt> pretty sure it's airing it was scheduled </garnt>
<garnt> to air next fall and I've heard from </garnt>
<garnt> because I made a video about the first </garnt>
<garnt> three seasons of attack on Titan and </garnt>
<garnt> I've heard from pretty much everyone </garnt>
<joey> who's read the manga that season 4 is </joey>
<joey> going to be the best season oh no I mean </joey>
<connor> even if it was just mediocre I feel like </connor>
<garnt> it we'd still like just think it's </garnt>
<garnt> amazing because like the journey to get </garnt>
<garnt> there it's been yeah and this last part </garnt>
<garnt> was oh my god oh my god like it's so </garnt>
<garnt> rare that you get to see a series just </garnt>
<garnt> improve over time every season because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember when attack on Titan season 1 </garnt>
<garnt> was airing right and I was it was great </garnt>
<garnt> it was great but I felt like it was very </garnt>
<garnt> forgettable in a sense of well I </garnt>
<garnt> remember when season 2 aired I didn't </garnt>
<garnt> remember anything that happened in you </garnt>
<connor> know what I remember specifically in </connor>
<connor> your video of their like season or </connor>
<connor> review you said remember their attack on </connor>
<connor> Titan and then you just play cricket </connor>
<connor> noises and </connor>
<connor> and our IRA be like well I'm watching </connor>
<connor> attack on Titan season 2 is good I think </connor>
<joey> like I know I do agree that the like </joey>
<connor> season 2 cuz season 1 when I watched it </connor>
<connor> I was like the high prisons yes and then </connor>
<connor> season 2 came around and actually </connor>
<connor> dropped it </connor>
<connor> no one cares because yeah because I </connor>
<connor> think I think what it was was that </connor>
<garnt> because season 1 was you know all about </garnt>
<garnt> like the action and just like building </garnt>
<joey> the world and yet season 2 was a lot of </joey>
<garnt> politics and a lot of talking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah season 2 just took the pace cuz </garnt>
<garnt> season 1 was like a [ __ ] roller </garnt>
<garnt> coaster you were going up and down every </garnt>
<garnt> few episodes it's like you didn't know </garnt>
<garnt> what was gonna happen but you to me felt </garnt>
<garnt> a bit empty and season 2 you felt much </garnt>
<garnt> slower paced it was more of like a slow </garnt>
<garnt> burn when they focus more on the </garnt>
<garnt> characters yeah but I actually got </garnt>
<garnt> really drawn into the world way more </garnt>
<garnt> into season 2 but by the time Caesars </garnt>
<garnt> who ended I was like okay I'm now way </garnt>
<garnt> more invested but nothing really big has </garnt>
<connor> happens yeah yeah I think everyone was </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] we've waited four </connor>
<garnt> years or something twelve well because </garnt>
<connor> they rushed it out yeah I mean </connor>
<garnt> definitely I think in season three when </garnt>
<connor> that scene would leave I came out yes I </connor>
<garnt> think when it just explode yeah yeah cuz </garnt>
<garnt> everyone saw that gif on Twitter I was </garnt>
<connor> like I got a [ __ ] catch-up </connor>
<garnt> okay see this is insane like just </garnt>
<connor> thinking about that scene like gives me </connor>
<garnt> goosebumps it's so good because I </garnt>
<connor> remember season three part one I enjoyed </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] much show cuz I didn't </connor>
<connor> realize I could care about the politics </connor>
<connor> that much in attack on Titan because I </connor>
<connor> remember by the time season 3 started I </connor>
<connor> was enjoying attack on Titan for </connor>
<connor> completely different reasons than season </connor>
<connor> one here on I mean III can say the same </connor>
<garnt> thing about every season so I've heard </garnt>
<garnt> season four is going to be completely </garnt>
<garnt> different complete - what's previously </garnt>
<joey> been because I mean like it was but me </joey>
<garnt> and Aki went to the attack on Titan </garnt>
<garnt> exhibit mmm that they did in Roppongi </garnt>
<garnt> and basically it was really tough </garnt>
<garnt> because what what they did was </garnt>
<garnt> essentially they really catered to the </garnt>
<garnt> manga readers unfortunately yeah and I </garnt>
<garnt> am NOT the manga Rita so in like the </garnt>
<garnt> later rooms of the exhibit they </garnt>
<garnt> basically like on all the walls they </garnt>
<garnt> would have liked the original Ganga of </garnt>
<connor> the manga right right in these frames </connor>
<garnt> which is [ __ ] cool yeah but then as </garnt>
<connor> you got further down the exhibit they </connor>
<connor> would start showing stuff that hadn't </connor>
<garnt> been adapted yet right so I was like but </garnt>
<connor> obviously there was just some stuff that </connor>
<connor> I couldn't really avoid see yeah and the </connor>
<connor> tiny little bits that I did see out of </connor>
<connor> context I was like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> Wow there was no [ __ ] way that's </garnt>
<garnt> happening and then to top it off there </garnt>
<garnt> was this room this was like a really </garnt>
<garnt> experimental move on them their part but </garnt>
<garnt> there was this room that you had to go </garnt>
<garnt> into and it was a completely pitch black </garnt>
<garnt> room yeah and there's just audio playing </garnt>
<garnt> on the speakers in this pitch-black room </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and what that audio is is it's </garnt>
<connor> audio of what sa AMA envisions the final </connor>
<connor> chapter or the tack on time to be </connor>
<connor> there's no visuals there's no visuals </connor>
<garnt> it's just audio and it's what he </garnt>
<garnt> envisions it will sound like all of it </garnt>
<garnt> the only thing occurred was a lot of </garnt>
<joey> like background noises like ambient </joey>
<garnt> noises yeah and and mikasa yelling aaron </garnt>
<joey> from a long way away okay that could </joey>
<garnt> mean anything </garnt>
<joey> I mean like I'm obviously not looking </joey>
<garnt> the audio justice but it's can we get a </garnt>
<joey> one-to-one reenact but I mean I'm </joey>
<joey> obviously not doing the audio justice </joey>
<joey> but it sounded like when I when I just </joey>
<joey> like closed my eyes and heard that I was </joey>
<joey> like wow I've never been more excited </joey>
<garnt> for an anime in my life it's good to </garnt>
<garnt> know that the anime and the manga will </garnt>
<garnt> end with Mikasa screaming Eren a spoiler </garnt>
<connor> has done for the entire [ __ ] series I </connor>
<connor> mean is that I mean it with the track </connor>
<connor> record the attack on Titan house right </connor>
<connor> now I mean it's I mean every episode you </connor>
<connor> could argue it's been really good right </connor>
<connor> I mean this story's just been there's no </connor>
<connor> like faults in the story so far right </connor>
<garnt> it's holding up pretty well yeah I'd say </garnt>
<garnt> it's had been building on its story riot </garnt>
<connor> really well really really well like what </connor>
<garnt> if this if they nailed this ending what </garnt>
<garnt> like category is this in a flight </garnt>
<garnt> masterpiece master what what would you </garnt>
<garnt> put it is like </garnt>
<garnt> like anime in the same category man if </garnt>
<garnt> it killed that this last season like </garnt>
<garnt> this could even be in its own thing </garnt>
<connor> we're like no anime is like as good I </connor>
<garnt> would say that's that's not to say </garnt>
<garnt> that's a big statement right yeah but I </garnt>
<garnt> mean I'm just trying to think how many </garnt>
<connor> like how many anime series have there </connor>
<connor> been where it's stretched out for I mean </connor>
<connor> over 50 episodes over 50 episodes like </connor>
<joey> let's say four or five seasons and has </joey>
<garnt> like killed it this hog yeah I would say </garnt>
<garnt> it'd be similar to something like Full </garnt>
<connor> Metal Alchemist </connor>
<garnt> Hunter hunter although I'd say it's I </garnt>
<connor> haven't seen full metal alchemist my </connor>
<garnt> fanbase knows this it's a big [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> meme but Full Metal Alchemist is that </garnt>
<garnt> one anime that I haven't seen we all </garnt>
<connor> have that one anyway I just when I think </connor>
<connor> about it I you know hunter hundreds I </connor>
<joey> mean hasn't ended there which is pretty </joey>
<connor> yeah I couldn't argue that's it's in the </connor>
<connor> same class but I guess full malakas </connor>
<garnt> Brotherhood maybe you could yeah because </garnt>
<joey> you never know like hunter and I might </joey>
<garnt> I'm hoping yeah but you never know but </garnt>
<joey> hunter hunter might end up like a Hugh </joey>
<connor> hockshop yeah I think that's the problem </connor>
<connor> is that I think everyone's got kind of </connor>
<connor> beginning to accept that slowly oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> the world is just especially now with </garnt>
<connor> the Dark Continent which you know it's a </connor>
<garnt> load of stuff with Hunter hunter but </garnt>
<garnt> it's looking like it's even more </garnt>
<connor> ambitious than before and he's not </connor>
<garnt> releasing chapters no a very slow it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's is gonna take a whole lifetime to </garnt>
<garnt> catch up but going back to attack on </garnt>
<garnt> Titan I think I called it like if it's </garnt>
<connor> even if it was off the quality of season </connor>
<connor> 3 part 2 yeah and it all ended in that </connor>
<connor> quality it would be a modern classic oh </connor>
<connor> for sure my sure yeah if it's even </connor>
<connor> better than that I have no [ __ ] clue </connor>
<joey> but that makes me so excited yeah the </joey>
<connor> fact that we might be yeah he's just I </connor>
<joey> think the last time I was possibly that </joey>
<joey> excited for like a follow-up was one </joey>
<joey> punch man season 2 </joey>
<garnt> okay I've watched a few clips recently </garnt>
<garnt> up one punch man season 2 and he's like </garnt>
<connor> wasn't that bad I think it's just a wish </connor>
<garnt> set our expectations disgustingly hard </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't bad it was painfully mediocre </garnt>
<connor> it was like seven deadly sins season one </connor>
<connor> and then it like so what I'm hoping what </connor>
<connor> I'm hoping is that the net </connor>
<connor> season assuming we get another one at </connor>
<garnt> one punch man is that it doesn't go my </garnt>
<garnt> god bat [ __ ] is still I like I haven't </garnt>
<garnt> seen any of seven deadly sins I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know anything about it never read the </garnt>
<garnt> manga never enemy but not gonna lie </garnt>
<garnt> there's a part of me when I saw footage </garnt>
<joey> of season 3 yeah I was like I kind of </joey>
<joey> want to watch this now just to see it </joey>
<connor> devolve into this current state I </connor>
<connor> remember cuz the fight that they [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> up was one of the most likes it was one </garnt>
<connor> of the most hyped fights and then they </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] it up so much that fan animation </garnt>
<garnt> of that fight that was released before </garnt>
<garnt> looked better than the official but when </garnt>
<joey> I found out about that scene is someone </joey>
<joey> put it up on Twitter and had to preface </joey>
<joey> it by saying no this is not a fan </joey>
<connor> animation this is the official episode </connor>
<connor> because everybody in that tweet was like </connor>
<joey> is this fan made it's like some guy who </joey>
<joey> like just learn how to use flash like a </joey>
<garnt> week ago just you know what sticks on my </garnt>
<garnt> mind that kick the kick when I give </garnt>
<connor> first came and I saw the kick which </connor>
<joey> you'll probably see you on screen right </joey>
<joey> now I [ __ ] lost it like I don't think </joey>
<connor> I'd ever like I've watched all of seven </connor>
<garnt> deadly sends up at that point and like I </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't like a huge fanboy but every time </garnt>
<garnt> a new season was announced of the OVA </garnt>
<garnt> I'd watched yeah I never so quickly lost </garnt>
<connor> interest in a series just from seeing </connor>
<connor> that one screenshot melio dislike I was </connor>
<connor> like what did they do to him we've never </connor>
<connor> seen anything like has that happened in </connor>
<connor> anime before like where as season is </connor>
<connor> like so drastically like [ __ ] like </connor>
<joey> change Studios and lost I'm sure like I </joey>
<garnt> know I know there have been and I know </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to kill myself for not </garnt>
<garnt> remembering I like what this is but </garnt>
<garnt> there's been so many times that's </garnt>
<connor> because the difference forces when it </connor>
<connor> happened back then is that there wasn't </connor>
<connor> Twitter and when it happens now oh you </connor>
<connor> know when it happens exactly it was just </connor>
<joey> like a bunch of light we'll talk </joey>
<joey> being like [ __ ] like the only thing I </joey>
<garnt> can think of right now is like off the </garnt>
<connor> top of my head is berserk or jaw which </connor>
<garnt> it'll mean it's changed studio but it </garnt>
<connor> was technically a continuation okay okay </connor>
<connor> okay what's worse that berserk the </connor>
<connor> second adaptation of berserk or the </connor>
<joey> seven deadly sins the new season yeah </joey>
<joey> okay because I mean like you know I'm </joey>
<connor> saying that from like a heart called </connor>
<connor> beserk fan I haven't heard the manga so </connor>
<connor> yes because if you'd read them if you </connor>
<connor> read the manga I'm sure everybody who's </connor>
<garnt> read the manga can agree with this but </garnt>
<connor> like I have never wanted to like cry </connor>
<joey> from sadness I'm like how could they do </joey>
<connor> my boy guts like that am i I've because </connor>
<connor> the berserk adaptation was just a </connor>
<connor> failure on pretty every level every </connor>
<connor> level from like the animation which </connor>
<garnt> everyone likes points out boy like the </garnt>
<garnt> composition the sound design I mean if </garnt>
<garnt> you hear if you heard that like </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> what sound it's just what how did you </garnt>
<joey> get this who did you hire to be honest </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] came up with that sound like how </joey>
<connor> do you see this big [ __ ] iron sword </connor>
<garnt> and just like let's pull out a cowbell </garnt>
<joey> do you ever do a Jojo make everything a </joey>
<garnt> gun show yeah every every honestly can I </garnt>
<connor> talk about Jojo sound design I love Jojo </connor>
<connor> sound design so much cuz soun design is </connor>
<connor> something that people don't normally </connor>
<connor> talk about you know and you don't you </connor>
<garnt> don't you don't really you don't release </garnt>
<connor> his hair people who it's like voice </connor>
<connor> happening right well it's done well you </connor>
<garnt> don't notice yeah so with Jojo sound </garnt>
<connor> design it's one of the few shows where </connor>
<connor> if you hear if you hear like a sound you </connor>
<connor> know some judges you you know that you </connor>
<connor> know the exact stands and you know the </connor>
<connor> like sometimes it's the exact episode </connor>
<connor> and the exact fight because they're yeah </connor>
<connor> they're that recognized one that they're </connor>
<connor> like not generic at all and I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> love Jojo sound design cuz the reason </connor>
<connor> why I think the anime is as good as is </connor>
<garnt> one of the reasons is that the sound </garnt>
<garnt> design is so [ __ ] good </garnt>
<garnt> like have you guys seen the I assume you </garnt>
<garnt> guys have seen the Jojo Oh peas where </garnt>
<connor> they add the sound so cool I don't know </connor>
<connor> why they don't do that for the the </connor>
<garnt> airing versions I mean it's it's not </garnt>
<joey> really what you see in an ope right it </joey>
<joey> is pretty unconventional but I mean </joey>
<joey> there's so many sounds that you could </joey>
<connor> say like I quite okay when you hear that </connor>
<connor> that gunshot for the punch you know it's </connor>
<connor> a Jojo pan yeah yeah and it makes it </connor>
<connor> sound so meaty it's great oh I love how </connor>
<garnt> the punching sounds like every time you </garnt>
<garnt> know like this like a muda or like oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it is almost like gum like yeah I'm </garnt>
<joey> sure it's like gunshot yeah yeah it's a </joey>
<connor> gunshot like and then obviously there's </connor>
<garnt> a lardo timestop which I feel like it's </garnt>
<connor> almost become the universal sound of you </connor>
<garnt> know I mean if you talk musical oh my </garnt>
<garnt> god the new season absolutely killed it </garnt>
<garnt> it's like I think I think super ripe are </garnt>
<garnt> 12 John said this and in his review of </garnt>
<garnt> golden wind and I feel the same way like </garnt>
<connor> this is gone wind was the first </connor>
<connor> adaptation of a Jojo where I think the </connor>
<connor> anime is </connor>
<connor> because you know so much when you take </connor>
<connor> away that sound and especially the music </connor>
<connor> when you hear that journos theme come on </connor>
<garnt> oh you're a sweetheart </garnt>
<garnt> Jonah's theme is one of the few tracks </garnt>
<joey> in anime that has been memed to death it </joey>
<joey> is and I have no part I have more gotten </joey>
<garnt> bored of it that's that's all outside </garnt>
<joey> here but you like every version I've </joey>
<garnt> heard of joiners theme of equally just </garnt>
<garnt> be tight it's like a piano version metal </garnt>
<garnt> version I don't care it's always been </garnt>
<garnt> sorry like when when we can go back to </garnt>
<garnt> the gym some of the best music to Pearl </garnt>
<garnt> when you're working out is JoJo's it </garnt>
<garnt> works so well and I know it should work </garnt>
<garnt> well but man when the piano hits you're </garnt>
<garnt> doing an extra rep no matter how tired </garnt>
<joey> you are you're doing that extra rep it's </joey>
<connor> almost too hype sometimes there yeah </connor>
<joey> you're like oh [ __ ] I gotta keep doing </joey>
<connor> this rapper I'm dying right now </connor>
<connor> I don't know my boy Jojo down making of </connor>
<joey> anime adaptations though there is one </joey>
<garnt> topic I would like to color because it </garnt>
<garnt> is quite timely yeah but just yesterday </garnt>
<garnt> actually reporting over as of us </garnt>
<garnt> recording this episode I found or I </garnt>
<joey> guess Aki found that somebody is </joey>
<connor> adapting killing stalking you mean it's </connor>
<garnt> not a big deal this is the biggest </garnt>
<connor> opting killing stalking you mean when </connor>
<garnt> andaman you mean it's not an official </garnt>
<garnt> anime adaptation like everyone on </garnt>
<connor> Twitter thinks it is okay just like the </connor>
<connor> most is the original Twitter post that </connor>
<connor> blew this up said an official adaptation </connor>
<garnt> and then in the replies to that tweet </garnt>
<garnt> they double down saying it yeah it was </garnt>
<garnt> all official but the thing that caught </garnt>
<garnt> my eye is the picture that everyone was </garnt>
<garnt> retweeting alright three pictures of </garnt>
<garnt> this tweet one of them there's like </garnt>
<joey> chaos ops ops yeah so yeah so like cuz </joey>
<joey> kisaki found that on a timeline and was </joey>
<connor> like holy [ __ ] they're making us killing </connor>
<connor> slowking item adaptation I'm like really </connor>
<connor> let me see and I saw the pictures I'm </connor>
<connor> like the first two legit yeah oh yeah it </connor>
<connor> was like coming soon 2020 I was like oh </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] okay and then I looked at the last </joey>
<connor> one and it was like k ops ops to do </connor>
<connor> might yeah yeah right who what is the </connor>
<connor> student I legitimately had to look it up </connor>
<connor> on Wikipedia being like a baby's just </connor>
<garnt> one of them cuz you know recently </garnt>
<garnt> they've been so many [ __ ] Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> anime studio yeah </garnt>
<garnt> come out with like ridiculous name so </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like I was probably just one of </garnt>
<joey> those exactly I looked it up and I'm </joey>
<garnt> like no it's literally just one dude one </garnt>
<connor> dude but I feel bad for this derivative </connor>
<connor> making this cuz like my god the amount </connor>
<connor> of hikes they just got thrusted on them </connor>
<connor> and everyone's assuming this just like </connor>
<garnt> legit yeah I mean how did the hype just </garnt>
<garnt> happen did they just literally just </garnt>
<joey> between just the two it yeah but the </joey>
<joey> original tweet I think as of us </joey>
<garnt> recording I think has like forty </garnt>
<garnt> thousand likes and like 20 thousand </garnt>
<garnt> retweets or something Wow </garnt>
<garnt> because killing stalking fans are </garnt>
<connor> dedicated and also the thing was the </connor>
<connor> song Laura and the replies to that </connor>
<connor> people weren't questioning whether like </connor>
<connor> it was legit people what you're </connor>
<connor> questioning should it get an adaptation </connor>
<connor> no it's the main argument I think that's </connor>
<connor> why it was getting so many I think you </connor>
<joey> should get an adaptation I mean let me </joey>
<connor> let me chase the question have you guys </connor>
<joey> read it I've read the first like what is </joey>
<connor> it like cuz it came out like stories </connor>
<joey> right like seasons I said I watched I </joey>
<connor> read the first season and I quite liked </connor>
<connor> it and you know it's a lot but I feel </connor>
<connor> like from what I've heard as well it </connor>
<connor> handles it quite well towards the end </connor>
<garnt> yeah I I did a video on it I actually </garnt>
<joey> looked back on when I did my video of it </joey>
<garnt> almost four years ago holy [ __ ] was it </garnt>
<garnt> that long ago yeah I remember you </garnt>
<joey> releasing that like years ago and that's </joey>
<garnt> because I only reviewed the first season </garnt>
<connor> because I think the series ended like it </connor>
<connor> was like lost year yeah but there's like </connor>
<connor> a huge gap right so I've only really </connor>
<connor> seen or read like the first half of it </connor>
<connor> and it was you know it was marketed as </connor>
<connor> like oh it's a really hardcore like </connor>
<connor> gruesome Yowies yeah you know all these </connor>
<connor> fan girls getting on it and I was like </connor>
<connor> okay I mean I don't know if I'm gonna </connor>
<garnt> enjoy it as much because I'm not exactly </garnt>
<garnt> the target demographic but I'll give it </garnt>
<garnt> a go and it was like a genuinely good </garnt>
<garnt> story like yeah it had Yowie elements in </garnt>
<garnt> it but you know I'm an adult I can </garnt>
<garnt> handle that yeah other than that if you </garnt>
<connor> take away the young elements it's just a </connor>
<connor> really really good horror mystery but </connor>
<connor> when I saw that they were gonna make a </connor>
<garnt> quote-unquote anime adaptation for it I </garnt>
<garnt> was like I don't I don't because </garnt>
<garnt> immediately what I thought of is all of </garnt>
<garnt> these other like over sexualized series </garnt>
<garnt> getting anime adaptation </garnt>
<garnt> recently because as someone who hasn't </garnt>
<connor> read it seems like it's a very sexual </connor>
<garnt> story that would have to be heavily said </garnt>
<garnt> it is is well I think it also has such </garnt>
<garnt> like its divided a lot of community cuz </garnt>
<garnt> I think a lot of people really sexualize </garnt>
<garnt> it yeah when it's just a really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> up dynamic yeah and a lot of I mean a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of a really deep [ __ ] of like </garnt>
<joey> possessiveness and and all that but if </joey>
<joey> you're thinking about reading it it's </joey>
<connor> it's a lot like going to it with caution </connor>
<joey> definitely be here for the huge of 80 we </joey>
<joey> have to legally say I mean I I think you </joey>
<connor> should read it but then also like I can </connor>
<connor> totally recommend you not to read it </connor>
<connor> like it's your life would be totally </connor>
<garnt> fine if you don't read it yeah maybe I </garnt>
<garnt> love the anime instead talking about the </garnt>
<connor> anime like I said affiliate I feel bad </connor>
<connor> for the this person because a lot of </connor>
<connor> people are putting a lot of hype on it </connor>
<connor> but also what I saw it's a one-man job </connor>
<garnt> like these guys doing everything and I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if it's a guy or girl but </garnt>
<garnt> they seem to be in charge of they seem </garnt>
<garnt> to be 3d modelers I think what that </garnt>
<garnt> trade is and I saw the voice-acting </garnt>
<garnt> casting call and as someone who's you </garnt>
<garnt> know done a lot of voice acting casting </garnt>
<garnt> calls I've made my own I've worked with </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of professional ones like it is </garnt>
<connor> not normal </connor>
<garnt> I'd say I don't even know I don't - </garnt>
<connor> because they I don't think they're like </connor>
<connor> that experience and I think other voice </connor>
<connor> actors are helping them with it but </connor>
<connor> first of all normally you don't name </connor>
<garnt> who's gotten what role publicly right so </garnt>
<garnt> on this casting call document which I </garnt>
<garnt> think we even maybe show on screen for a </garnt>
<garnt> second it says like one person who has </garnt>
<garnt> the role and it's showing publicly </garnt>
<garnt> that's not normally the case normally </garnt>
<garnt> it's just here are the lines audition </garnt>
<garnt> for it more yeah and the way it's laid </garnt>
<garnt> out is really odd and it's just over I </garnt>
<connor> mean over Twitter isn't that weird but </connor>
<connor> there's no mention of pay or anything </connor>
<connor> like I guess I mean it is a fan-made </connor>
<garnt> project but normally still you you say </garnt>
<connor> if it's paid or not yeah you normally </connor>
<garnt> say how you know how many lines they're </garnt>
<garnt> gonna be it just I don't know it looks </garnt>
<garnt> like it belongs on like casting call </garnt>
<garnt> Club which is an amateur voice acting </garnt>
<garnt> website yeah which makes me uneasy </garnt>
<garnt> because if it is gonna be a USB </garnt>
<connor> microphone kind of deal it's not gonna </connor>
<connor> sound good because there was no there </connor>
<connor> was no hey here's the minimum require </connor>
<connor> into the sanitary room there was nothing </connor>
<connor> was just if you want to audition yeah </connor>
<connor> and I saw the replies to this thread and </connor>
<connor> it was like all thirteen Ewald sounding </connor>
<garnt> girls auditioning yeah but that's </garnt>
<garnt> because the main [ __ ] like readership </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah smoking our thirteen-year-old </garnt>
<garnt> girls yeah though it shouldn't be from </garnt>
<connor> purely based on context it should not be </connor>
<connor> it's just worrying with these kind of </connor>
<connor> things as well because normally like </connor>
<connor> when I've done plus eighteen project I </connor>
<connor> normally ask for proof of ID yeah and if </connor>
<connor> I cast someone like they need to show me </connor>
<connor> their ID and this should definitely be </connor>
<connor> one of the situations where I like those </connor>
<connor> those precautions should be taken yeah </connor>
<connor> even if it's fan-made right like yeah </connor>
<connor> not a good look for you if you you're </connor>
<connor> getting thirteen old girls to voice in </connor>
<connor> your thing about like it's still very </connor>
<connor> early days I mean it's from what it </connor>
<connor> sounds like it sounds like a situation </connor>
<connor> where someone just way too much press </connor>
<connor> got way too much press way too quickly </connor>
<garnt> because I have no doubt that they </garnt>
<garnt> probably have no [ __ ] experience </garnt>
<garnt> because I saw on their Twitter actually </garnt>
<joey> just this morning yeah they tweeted out </joey>
<garnt> being like oh my god after someone </garnt>
<garnt> retweeted my thing I've gained like ten </garnt>
<garnt> thousand Twitter followers in like </garnt>
<garnt> overnight and like you know this person </garnt>
<connor> obviously like came from Lee pretty much </connor>
<garnt> close to zero phone yes so for them </garnt>
<connor> that's a lot yeah that's that's a lot of </connor>
<garnt> like pressure just immediately built up </garnt>
<garnt> on them yeah because you're going after </garnt>
<joey> such like I don't wanna say iconic but </joey>
<joey> like a very like very very dedicated </joey>
<garnt> series no I think it's not just that as </garnt>
<garnt> well because I think what really built </garnt>
<connor> up the hype as well as we're in like </connor>
<connor> this environment now where webtoons </connor>
<connor> anime it cumbia are being major so it </connor>
<connor> wouldn't be it wouldn't be it wouldn't </connor>
<connor> have been so surprising to say killing </connor>
<garnt> Stalkings getting an anime as opposed to </garnt>
<garnt> like last year even two years ago where </garnt>
<garnt> you know we didn't have any presidents </garnt>
<garnt> for that now with tower of god airing </garnt>
<garnt> and god of high school and knobblies </garnt>
<connor> all guessing animes it's like maybe </connor>
<connor> we're in a new era where people are </connor>
<joey> expecting that's their favorite webtoons </joey>
<garnt> or their favorite web comics or whatever </garnt>
<joey> country is could get anime adaptations </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> I mean to be fired I wouldn't be against </connor>
<joey> the idea of it actually getting an </joey>
<joey> official adaptation the only stolen yeah </joey>
<connor> I think it could be definitely make </connor>
<joey> waves I mean it would make sense </joey>
<joey> considering that recently there's been </joey>
<joey> like a big trend of like as I said </joey>
<joey> earlier like over sexualized seriously </joey>
<garnt> we've got a shoe mats in a harem yeah my </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] god how they gonna handle how </garnt>
<joey> are they gonna handle that because there </joey>
<joey> is legitimately a sex scene everything </joey>
<connor> like I'm not even kidding so III don't </connor>
<joey> know anything about this monographs </joey>
<connor> earlier what is it called again it's </connor>
<joey> called shoe mutts on a hair or worlds </joey>
<joey> and Harold in a harem and basically the </joey>
<joey> the overall plot I'm over simplifying </joey>
<joey> this but basically it's a hemorrhoid </joey>
<joey> plot </joey>
<connor> humanity has gone to [ __ ] where there is </connor>
<connor> a disease that is killing all males it's </connor>
<connor> affecting males so basically now you can </connor>
<connor> tell males now are becoming like a </connor>
<connor> commodity they're basically being </connor>
<connor> treated like males that have like to </connor>
<joey> survive this disease yeah basically like </joey>
<connor> treated as like national let me guess </connor>
<connor> right first of all the difference </connor>
<connor> between this and hentai right is that if </connor>
<connor> it was a hentai it being ugly bastard </connor>
<connor> but like the dynamic see this is where </connor>
<connor> difference from a hint either is that </connor>
<connor> our main character has like this girl </connor>
<connor> that he's been thinking about his whole </connor>
<connor> life yeah and basically like doesn't </connor>
<connor> want to just go around and like yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah sex everyone in order to save he </connor>
<joey> met he'd rather keep his like purity for </joey>
<connor> the goal that he leaves been thingy </connor>
<connor> crazy it's about it's about waiting for </connor>
<connor> the right person it's basically blue </connor>
<garnt> ball feed the monitor because everyone </garnt>
<garnt> else all five other guys having a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] great time they're [ __ ] you </garnt>
<garnt> different chicks every [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<joey> they're pretty much they're pretty much </joey>
<joey> like what </joey>
<connor> hinto protagonist should be I'm not </connor>
<connor> being sold on this but saying that I </connor>
<connor> wasn't solving than two species </connor>
<connor> reviewers until I watched it I thought </connor>
<joey> this is pretty funny it's not gonna be </joey>
<garnt> as good in two species reviews is like a </garnt>
<joey> really weird case because it was </joey>
<joey> something that was definitely deaf </joey>
<joey> the Itchy in the manga in the manga in </joey>
<joey> the anime they just made it poor but I I </joey>
<joey> still like I I still I know in species </joey>
<garnt> reviewers to me is that line between </garnt>
<garnt> hentai and itchy because you don't watch </garnt>
<garnt> interspecies reviewers to jack off right </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah but it's undeniable that there </connor>
<connor> is just a straight-up sexiness which is </connor>
<connor> really interesting though because the </connor>
<connor> one sex scene that everyone was raving </connor>
<garnt> on about in the anime I think was </garnt>
<garnt> episode 4 3 3 episode 3 was never in the </garnt>
<garnt> manga no it wasn't it was implied all </garnt>
<garnt> sex scenes of that series isn't your </garnt>
<joey> slide in the manga but in the anime that </joey>
<garnt> was just like [ __ ] it let's just show it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like put things in perspective you </garnt>
<joey> didn't even see nipple in the manga wow </joey>
<joey> that was that was like no you seen this </joey>
<connor> man's Twitter he knows a nipple when </connor>
<joey> he's in all the volumes and I've enjoyed </joey>
<connor> every single one can we talk can we talk </connor>
<connor> about your Twitter and a bit clip is why </connor>
<joey> can you please explain your Twitter and </joey>
<joey> okay whenever I go on Twitter right I </joey>
<connor> don't follow </connor>
<connor> hentai artists on Twitter because I </connor>
<connor> don't need to because this man's got me </connor>
<connor> cuz as you know on Twitter when you when </connor>
<connor> you like when you like a picture there's </connor>
<garnt> a good chance for some reason especially </garnt>
<garnt> Joey's typically it comes on my Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm a scan at least every time I </garnt>
<garnt> open for a 6 or 7 like either like </garnt>
<garnt> full-on sex things or like very very </garnt>
<garnt> lewd it's always Joey it's like I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> I don't follow porn Oh like by Joey </garnt>
<connor> Bissinger and it's like how did you get </connor>
<joey> to this point he's what I don't </joey>
<joey> understand right like how many people do </joey>
<connor> you follow on Twitter like on average </connor>
<garnt> 600 something about about that many okay </garnt>
<garnt> right you both follow about over 500 </garnt>
<garnt> people yeah and like this isn't just you </garnt>
<connor> to like I've had this from like mutual </connor>
<connor> friends of mine everyone says it's you </connor>
<connor> how is it that my likes end up on </connor>
<joey> everybody's fine </joey>
<garnt> am I like am i only twitter preferred </garnt>
<garnt> like what I have no [ __ ] clue per it </garnt>
<garnt> it is I'd say 70 to 80% of the time I </garnt>
<garnt> see Lutz on my timeline it is you it is </garnt>
<joey> true [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> first of all you're welcome okay because </joey>
<garnt> this used to be the case and yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> swear you were way more timid about it </garnt>
<garnt> how did how did it cuz I'm scared of </garnt>
<garnt> doing that cuz i I don't know cuz I I </garnt>
<garnt> mean I shouldn't really excite you get </garnt>
<garnt> half naked so my videos but yeah I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know I was I was worried about like </garnt>
<joey> she's just having porn on my thing but </joey>
<joey> not I guess I could get away with </joey>
<joey> because how did you go from not sharing </joey>
<garnt> porn to basically just to being beat the </garnt>
<joey> hentai I've always shared that's the </joey>
<garnt> thing have you didn't I mean maybe not </garnt>
<connor> as frequently no no I know you're </connor>
<garnt> seeking I I think it's it was just </garnt>
<garnt> Twitter changing the like button to be </garnt>
<garnt> basically the because for the entirety </garnt>
<garnt> that I've been on Twitter yeah I've </garnt>
<garnt> liked hentai yeah because I followed </garnt>
<garnt> hint I like people like hentai other </garnt>
<connor> side like yeah I've discovered but I've </connor>
<garnt> never retweeted it because of this exact </garnt>
<connor> reason I don't want other people's </connor>
<connor> timelines but Twitter was just like hey </connor>
<joey> let's just like make the like button </joey>
<garnt> like a raider retweet button </garnt>
<garnt> I got us how much of your feet is just </garnt>
<connor> head that's why I asked to see his phone </connor>
<garnt> do you want to see you nail it wasn't </garnt>
<joey> that bad when I first saw it I mean the </joey>
<connor> thing is I don't follow that mini Han </connor>
<connor> Toyotas yeah I know that's hard to </connor>
<connor> believe </connor>
<connor> but I I genuinely don't the thing is I </connor>
<garnt> follow a hand Thai artists that love </garnt>
<connor> retweeting other hand time yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> that's where I find all the people okay </connor>
<connor> scroll scroll through what you scroll </connor>
<garnt> down which we don't see let's see how </garnt>
<garnt> many how many come up that one one in </garnt>
<joey> three can you also like everyone that it </joey>
<connor> was likes from one this is oh yeah go to </connor>
<connor> Ike's go to my likes oh that's another </connor>
<connor> one that's two in a row oh wait there's </connor>
<connor> a Jimmy Neutron that that's not meant I </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> oh yeah that's basic okay let me while </connor>
<joey> they're looking through this widow let </joey>
<joey> me defend myself real quick okay the </joey>
<joey> reason why I like it is because at the </joey>
<joey> end of the day these are just drawings </joey>
<joey> right there's a difference between </joey>
<joey> liking like actual human pawn versus </joey>
<garnt> just a picture this man's about to go </garnt>
<joey> the hens eyes are true I am genuinely </joey>
<connor> one of those people who looks at hantai </connor>
<garnt> as odd no I totally agree with you I'm </garnt>
<joey> talking on behalf of every hand tire </joey>
<joey> lover watching this episode including </joey>
<connor> you I'm Kent I just I don't know if I </connor>
<connor> look at it and like just cracker but a </connor>
<garnt> beer and just enjoy boy no no I've </garnt>
<garnt> gotten to that point right I've gone to </garnt>
<connor> the point you will see in my you see my </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] room you see my [ __ ] office </connor>
<connor> which is just like full of like anime </connor>
<connor> thighs and stuff like that because it's </connor>
<connor> gone to the point where sometimes you </connor>
<joey> just see this like drawing of a girl or </joey>
<joey> thigh or something and I just don't even </joey>
<connor> get horny anymore I'm just like I'm just </connor>
<garnt> I'm just [ __ ] impressed about how </garnt>
<connor> they make it look how good they make it </connor>
<connor> yeah that was me when I saw them le </connor>
<connor> odessan 70 because they're genuinely </connor>
<joey> like some hentai artists that I've seen </joey>
<joey> and I know of where I'm just like if you </joey>
<garnt> made an all-ages manga yeah you would </garnt>
<garnt> sell like crazy oh no people have people </garnt>
<garnt> and people have like look at like Nana </garnt>
<garnt> she who made um [ __ ] easier and they </garnt>
<connor> than that of a song yeah I love everyone </connor>
<connor> everyone has seen this chick before </connor>
<connor> alright now that she was originally like </connor>
<connor> a hardcore loli hantai artist yeah </connor>
<connor> and he made a really [ __ ] successful </connor>
<garnt> all a just call me manga which is </garnt>
<garnt> hilarious yeah and like and then and </garnt>
<garnt> even if they don't make all a just stuff </garnt>
<connor> look at artists like nepata who is like </connor>
<connor> genuinely an amazing artist yeah and </connor>
<connor> that's what I will like because you know </connor>
<connor> we've gotten to this point where hentai </connor>
<joey> has just become like haha anime boobs </joey>
<joey> hilarious and horny on me like it's all </joey>
<garnt> just become like a joke thing yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> don't want that </garnt>
<garnt> I don't I don't want but I'm sick of </garnt>
<garnt> those jokes I'd like I want to save this </garnt>
<connor> table because I was so III already get a </connor>
<garnt> whole episode I'm ready I have too many </garnt>
<connor> things to say about hentai and anti </connor>
<garnt> artists that I can't fit it all slide </garnt>
<joey> like five minutes much like on this </joey>
<joey> episode if you want to hand my episode </joey>
<connor> cuz we're gonna do it either way we're </connor>
<connor> gonna do it and give these guys like </connor>
<connor> three sips of beer and they just start </connor>
<joey> talking about anti like I don't know </joey>
<connor> like what I watch hentai it's like it's </connor>
<connor> for a service you know I guess I do it </connor>
<connor> too I do the deed right like I don't sit </connor>
<connor> there and like swirl my wine glasses </connor>
<connor> am i weird am i okay I want yes it's </connor>
<connor> probably the answer it's the way am i </connor>
<connor> weird to be like sometimes I kind of </connor>
<garnt> just want to watch hand-tied just do it </garnt>
<connor> yes that's he's going through that phase </connor>
<garnt> right now that's why I'm sure III don't </garnt>
<joey> I hem tied to me hasn't got to that </joey>
<joey> point right dojinshi and manga there's </joey>
<connor> there is no part of me in a porn where </connor>
<connor> like I watch a porn lighter immediately </connor>
<garnt> skips two minutes in you know you you </garnt>
<garnt> are you are the degenerate err </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] I've bought a lot of </joey>
<garnt> dojinshi from like artists I like yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> don't think I've actually read like </garnt>
<joey> physical copies of dashi and like jacked </joey>
<garnt> off to it I know that's TMI I'm sorry </garnt>
<connor> yeah I will recommend you some [ __ ] okay </connor>
<connor> I do I'll come on a little light in like </connor>
<connor> in like four episodes I'll come back </connor>
<connor> I'll totally agree with everything these </connor>
<joey> guys say I know I just referred to like </joey>
<joey> your like progression from like oh what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] - like you know what I love </joey>
<garnt> this artist yeah because it's if you've </garnt>
<garnt> read enough - gingy and if you've read </garnt>
<connor> enough your page manga there are so many </connor>
<connor> dodging cheese that just have really </connor>
<garnt> really good plots </garnt>
<connor> yeah and and it's it's this sips beer I </connor>
<connor> hire to agree I must say it's gotten to </connor>
<garnt> this point where sometimes you just want </garnt>
<garnt> the series to be adapted into a hentai </garnt>
<garnt> just so you can see it animated yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you've read the series that </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> do something new with porn or hem side </garnt>
<garnt> they just and have never seen before </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like wow this is like awakening </garnt>
<garnt> something in me right now this is </garnt>
<garnt> amazing okay no I've never heard someone </garnt>
<connor> describe I've watched em tight and it </connor>
<joey> awakened something that I've read where </joey>
<connor> like at first I was like okay I dig this </connor>
<connor> art and then I see like the edge he </connor>
<connor> scenes and I'm like okay I'm digging </connor>
<connor> this like you know may I have like a </connor>
<garnt> quarter charming but then as the story </garnt>
<joey> continues I'm like you know what the </joey>
<garnt> guys [ __ ] the HTC casts are the wrong </garnt>
<garnt> boys that question to you and question </garnt>
<garnt> to all of you watching why do you think </garnt>
<garnt> thighs hot thigh highs are sexy and if </garnt>
<garnt> the answer isn't anime an anime awakens </garnt>
<connor> your love for thigh highs your [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> life oh I did it did I mean because </connor>
<joey> let's be real Japanese girls don't have </joey>
<connor> five yeah yeah so like if you just think </connor>
<garnt> if you fire highs is like entry level </garnt>
<garnt> right in the world of the jinn she's in </garnt>
<joey> hate monger okay that's like southern or </joey>
<connor> me [ __ ] man happy with by - or me as </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] maybe in future we can return to </connor>
<connor> this topic when I've you know done my </connor>
<joey> research </joey>
<joey> yeah so we're getting ahead of ourselves </joey>
<joey> right now okay like this this was meant </joey>
<garnt> to be an introductory episode when we </garnt>
<joey> introduce what we won't even don't like </joey>
<joey> these topics I'm sorry it won't always </joey>
<connor> be hentai by the way because preface </connor>
<connor> that I just but I think that I mean the </connor>
<connor> main reason we started this as well </connor>
<connor> because we always hang out together like </connor>
<connor> it's it's not one of those things like </connor>
<garnt> some youtubers hang out they make videos </garnt>
<connor> seems like their friendships great we </connor>
<connor> all actually hang out together all the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] time and we always talk for like </connor>
<joey> two hours yeah what looking at and </joey>
<joey> essentially what we do on a daily yeah </joey>
<connor> like we easily have conversations where </connor>
<connor> we just talk for like three hours about </connor>
<connor> manga anime and we're like why don't we </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] not even about manga or </connor>
<connor> anime anyway and I remember the last </connor>
<connor> time we were at your house and we talked </connor>
<connor> about like what was the best burger </connor>
<garnt> joint really legitimately late </garnt>
<garnt> about like is in and out overrated or </garnt>
<joey> not for like it's not it's not by the </joey>
<connor> way it is okay we're gonna get into but </connor>
<garnt> I suppose uh I guess that's we're gonna </garnt>
<garnt> be talking about like anything and it's </garnt>
<garnt> evolved over the time yeah I mean the </garnt>
<garnt> core of is anime and manga I mean I have </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of things about anime manga that I </garnt>
<garnt> want to talk about but I also want to </garnt>
<garnt> talk about the culture the community </garnt>
<garnt> hentai more henselae yes yeah and I mean </garnt>
<connor> I'm also like just general because we </connor>
<connor> all were youtubers we'd want to talk </connor>
<connor> about sometimes if there's YouTube drama </connor>
<connor> that we feel like we can probably add </connor>
<joey> something of course well you know </joey>
<connor> sometimes if there's just like standard </connor>
<joey> banter of just laying on whatever the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] then yeah well if any of our </joey>
<garnt> Mutual's are ever in japan like if you </garnt>
<joey> want to talk anime and manga with us hit </joey>
<joey> us up yeah </joey>
<joey> and not even just our Mutual's like if </joey>
<joey> you're just if you want to like come on </joey>
<joey> to the show and my talk first of all you </joey>
<joey> gonna come on to the show physically sit </joey>
<connor> sit right here names because we wanna </connor>
<connor> ideally this will be a four-person </connor>
<connor> podcast and hopefully we I mean I'd be </connor>
<connor> really interested in to bring youtubers </connor>
<connor> on who don't really get to talk about </connor>
<joey> anime yeah I guess yeah I mean if there </joey>
<connor> are any youtubers watching this video or </connor>
<garnt> you know the tweet or whatever </garnt>
<connor> Suzanne I guess let us know if you'd </connor>
<joey> like to come onto the podcast because we </joey>
<garnt> will happily welcome because it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> surprising I've met so many youtubers </garnt>
<joey> who have nothing to do with anime or </joey>
<joey> anything to watch anime who watch anime </joey>
<garnt> and just really want to talk about anime </garnt>
<joey> too so yeah I think I think it's pretty </joey>
<garnt> awesome because I remember anime was </garnt>
<connor> nowhere near this popular before oh yeah </connor>
<connor> and I remember the feeling of being the </connor>
<garnt> only anime fan and haven't having there </garnt>
<connor> nothing I don't want to talk about I </connor>
<joey> mean I think that's why I started my </joey>
<garnt> youtube channel yeah like that was like </garnt>
<connor> my reasoning is that I hadn't no want to </connor>
<connor> talk to this about let's just say like </connor>
<connor> kids today have it like you're an anime </connor>
<joey> fan like this a day in high school you </joey>
<garnt> have it so much easier than any of us </garnt>
<connor> did my god I wish I I'm so jealous </connor>
<garnt> because I wish I could have just talked </garnt>
<garnt> to my [ __ ] friends about Naruto </garnt>
<connor> or one piece or Santa convinced my </connor>
<joey> friends to get into anime God in order </joey>
<joey> for them in order to find someone to </joey>
<connor> talk about </connor>
<connor> this is like another thing that I when I </connor>
<connor> talk to Americans they don't have this </connor>
<connor> problem at least in my age group I </connor>
<connor> imagine yours as well right yeah it's </connor>
<connor> like we at Americans had it good but </connor>
<connor> British people and I think probably </connor>
<connor> standing people are more closer to </connor>
<connor> British like [ __ ] ruthless at school </connor>
<connor> oh yeah </connor>
<connor> like and I remember I got [ __ ] for </connor>
<connor> gaming too much at school so how the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] am I gonna [ __ ] for gaming too much </connor>
<connor> in school so how am I gonna sit there </connor>
<connor> and be like alright so Call of Duty that </connor>
<garnt> thing that you play but give me [ __ ] for </garnt>
<connor> how about you check out these anime </connor>
<connor> titties right I I built up years getting </connor>
<garnt> to like a medium level of like yeah in </garnt>
<connor> between a level of popularity yeah but I </connor>
<connor> got out of the bullying zone if you will </connor>
<joey> didn't want to go back to you look crazy </joey>
<garnt> just how like I don't wanna say </garnt>
<garnt> mainstream mainstream yeah it's not </garnt>
<garnt> mainstream at all but like I guess just </garnt>
<joey> how much more accepted it's become as a </joey>
<garnt> sub it's good it's good yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> definitely definitely is because I feel </garnt>
<connor> like anime works so well meme culture oh </connor>
<connor> my god you know what I mean yeah an </connor>
<garnt> anime in a sense is meme culture in a </garnt>
<connor> lot of ways I mean I'm flying a room </connor>
<connor> when you mentioned meme culture and </connor>
<connor> anime you all know what we're talking </connor>
<garnt> about yeah but I feel like because of </garnt>
<garnt> that it's a lot more people know what </garnt>
<garnt> anime is or at least have seen a meme or </garnt>
<connor> a screenshot or a gift </connor>
<garnt> yeah of probably Joe Joe will happen as </garnt>
<garnt> it should be it's the only animal that </garnt>
<connor> matters and then people would just </connor>
<connor> recognize that a lot more because I </connor>
<connor> remember when I was growing up people </connor>
<connor> didn't even know what anime was yeah the </connor>
<garnt> words animated they're like what the </garnt>
