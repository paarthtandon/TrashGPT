<connor> they would do this thing at my pool </connor>
<connor> where they would have like how to learn </connor>
<connor> how to kayak like in the pool </connor>
<connor> yeah they would like people they would </connor>
<connor> put six kayaks in the pool and just let </connor>
<connor> people kayak around it and i don't know </connor>
<connor> how this happened </connor>
<connor> but after the kayak has left there was a </connor>

<garnt> [ __ ] like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] twin foil hat </garnt>

<joey> um through the magic of scheduling you </joey>
<joey> will </joey>
<garnt> you wouldn't have had a break at all but </garnt>
<garnt> uh yeah it's been in three weeks since </garnt>
<garnt> we lost </garnt>
<connor> yeah i've had a recovery i mean we had a </connor>
<connor> three-week break right because uh </connor>
<joey> well you went on journey across japan </joey>
<joey> across japan </joey>
<joey> abroad in a man </joey>
<joey> i also hung out with chris before that </joey>
<joey> in kyoto yeah it was like kind of like </joey>
<connor> an awkward timing where it was like </connor>
<connor> three weeks where we couldn't record </connor>
<joey> yeah but it's i don't know it's been a </joey>
<joey> nice refresh i'd say yeah came back i'm </joey>
<connor> sick of [ __ ] seeing you guys </connor>
<connor> yeah god every week jesus man </connor>
<connor> i mean it's it's uh it's because i think </connor>
<joey> normally especially when we did three </joey>
<connor> episodes in one week </connor>
<joey> because that's what we had to you know </joey>
<garnt> allow us to do yeah on the last episode </garnt>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<garnt> like what are we talking about yeah </garnt>
<garnt> there's only so much i can chat [ __ ] you </garnt>
<garnt> know if you're chatting [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> every day for like three times a week </garnt>
<joey> whatever and it's not like </joey>
<joey> we're all going out and doing like </joey>
<joey> interesting things every day right it's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> five days out of the week we're just in </joey>
<joey> our room like just working on videos </joey>
<garnt> yeah like that's that's what i mean we </garnt>
<garnt> talked about this earlier but like how </garnt>
<garnt> do </garnt>
<garnt> like streamers who stream every day and </garnt>
<garnt> just like what do they talk about </garnt>
<garnt> because sometimes when we have more than </garnt>
<garnt> one recording a week sometimes i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know what the [ __ ] to talk about </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you know like what's going on </garnt>
<joey> with you with you guys </joey>
<joey> i'm not i was like the barrel is very </joey>
<garnt> shallow the </garnt>
<garnt> bottom is just there what's going when </garnt>
<garnt> you're playing games or you're playing </garnt>
<connor> apex oh just just like last week like </connor>
<connor> the police don't stop me </connor>
<joey> i wanted to talk about it i need to </joey>
<connor> commit a crime to like </connor>
<connor> make a story i'm not running out </connor>
<joey> you got to be talking about the other </joey>
<joey> streams that happen yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> just going to like watch youtube videos </joey>
<connor> really funny name last stream called pee </connor>
<joey> pee poo poo </joey>
<connor> it was a really fun moment let me drag </connor>
<connor> that up for 15 minutes </connor>
<connor> i mean it's like i don't know i don't </connor>
<connor> know how much i'm allowed to talk about </connor>
<connor> journey across japan because i think at </connor>
<connor> this point it's free probably no </connor>
<connor> christmas yeah </connor>
<connor> it's probably not even out yet but i </connor>
<joey> think the trailer will be out by then so </joey>
<joey> if you want to check that out i guess </joey>
<connor> here's a teaser joey won't say </connor>
<connor> everything that happened i'm sure </connor>
<connor> watch the videos yeah yeah just go watch </connor>
<joey> the videos whatever </joey>
<garnt> i mean i mean yeah i literally came back </garnt>
<garnt> yesterday yeah as i was recording this </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah how was it was it oh it's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> insane like </garnt>
<garnt> hype it up hypothetically i'll hide it </garnt>
<joey> up i'll hype it up all right i'll hype </joey>
<joey> it up for chris joney across japan too </joey>
<joey> uh i should probably explain what </joey>
<garnt> unicorn so if you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> uh journey across japan is a series that </garnt>
<garnt> chris broad who's been on this show a </garnt>
<garnt> couple of times let me guess </garnt>
<garnt> you go across japan we go across japan </garnt>
<garnt> as i would say it kind of speaks for you </garnt>
<garnt> it's a show we do together on chris's </garnt>
<joey> channel where we go across japan do like </joey>
<joey> challenges and like go visit cool places </joey>
<joey> in japan </joey>
<joey> and join across japan three is like the </joey>
<joey> third one we just finished where we went </joey>
<connor> through uh </connor>
<connor> kyushu which is like the most southern </connor>
<connor> island in japan right awesome because </connor>
<connor> i'd never been to kyushu like at all and </connor>
<connor> just this past week i </connor>
<joey> went through all the prefectures of </joey>
<connor> kyushu in one go so yeah [ __ ] great </connor>
<connor> speed running tourism yeah we were </connor>
<joey> speedrunning kyushu literally </joey>
<connor> i like how chris got took you around </connor>
<joey> like all the amazing places and he told </joey>
<joey> me like the shittest place </joey>
<garnt> didn't you go to like a gin factory or </garnt>
<joey> something we did go to a gym place yeah </joey>
<garnt> was that like the highlight that was the </garnt>
<garnt> highlight yeah actually just got to </garnt>
<garnt> drink really nice gin that was like free </garnt>
<joey> which is like </joey>
<garnt> oh that's that's cool yeah and then you </garnt>
<joey> could just be like make me this cocktail </joey>
<joey> and they made it which is great which is </joey>
<joey> like just a power trip that i needed in </joey>
<joey> my life </joey>
<joey> but uh but i mean you've already been to </joey>
<joey> kyodo all right yeah i've been once </joey>
<joey> before </joey>
<joey> um but he he found this welsh town like </joey>
<joey> welsh british town </joey>
<joey> in like an hour in like an hour in the </joey>
<connor> in the mountains in kyoto drive </connor>
<connor> wow and it was it was pretty [ __ ] but it </connor>
<connor> was pretty </connor>
<connor> good but it was just kind of like really </connor>
<joey> underwhelming was it just like home or </joey>
<connor> weirdly did you feel like culturally </connor>
<garnt> culturally appropriated </garnt>
<connor> in it i don't know it's just how people </connor>
<joey> like feel when they see white people </joey>
<connor> wearing kimono </connor>
<joey> this is kind of cool but like what's </joey>
<joey> going on like why i just wanted you to </joey>
<connor> be like oh god this is so [ __ ] just </connor>
<connor> reminds me of horror </connor>
<connor> it was just kind of like it was really </connor>
<connor> bizarre and like underwhelming i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> but also the fish and chips is 22 which </connor>
<garnt> is criminal i mean i'm sure like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know how it feels like for say </garnt>
<garnt> like you know </garnt>
<garnt> someone who lived in china going to like </garnt>
<garnt> chinatown or something like that </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's kind of different though </garnt>
<garnt> isn't it it's like markets and </garnt>
<garnt> restaurants right yeah that's i mean </garnt>
<connor> that's true i feel like chinatown </connor>
<joey> okay it is actually china okay well what </joey>
<garnt> describes me this welsh town then okay </garnt>
<joey> so </joey>
<connor> that was what about a maid of welsh yeah </connor>
<garnt> all the buildings looked like they were </garnt>
<joey> just </joey>
<connor> pulled out of like a small town in wales </connor>
<connor> it was really weird </connor>
<connor> and it was just really old style like </connor>
<joey> the places where you'd find in like west </joey>
<joey> wales and it was just really strange </joey>
<connor> because it's like i did i didn't </connor>
<joey> particularly like everything written in </joey>
<connor> welsh or </connor>
<joey> well one of the pubs was called uh pond </joey>
<joey> oak and pond means bridge in welsh </joey>
<joey> oh okay at least they were accurate </joey>
<garnt> about it that was pretty cool i think </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] sheep </garnt>
<connor> i'm really sarcastic about everything </connor>
<garnt> and it was just like i feel like this is </garnt>
<garnt> the one time where i can be like </garnt>
<connor> time to actually become sarcastic about </connor>
<garnt> something and no one can correct me </garnt>
<garnt> this is my culture now welcome to my </garnt>
<joey> culture </joey>
<joey> i mean it probably wasn't as offensive </joey>
<joey> as the first time i went to a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> outback steakhouse right and i was like </joey>
<joey> whoa is this one australia's to everyone </joey>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] boomerangs on the wall </joey>
<connor> everywhere yeah just like an australian </connor>
<connor> home i don't really know i mean i i </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty i kind of bash on every </connor>
<connor> culture </connor>
<connor> but i'm by far the heart i buy far back </connor>
<connor> on my own culture more than anything </connor>
<connor> well that's good because </connor>
<connor> if it wasn't a culture yeah if i mean </connor>
<joey> anything else you'd be really bad </joey>
<garnt> to say right now americans be like oh </garnt>
<garnt> really </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] vain i'm pretty harsh on </connor>
<connor> americans but </connor>
<connor> i feel like i'm more harsh on though i </connor>
<garnt> mean i feel like that's just that's just </garnt>
<joey> part of british culture right yeah </joey>
<joey> because you just </joey>
<joey> you rag on everyone equally but you </joey>
<joey> especially rag on your own culture oh </joey>
<joey> yeah of course um </joey>
<joey> but like for some reason when someone </joey>
<garnt> else rags in your coach you're like no </garnt>
<garnt> only i get to complain about my culture </garnt>
<garnt> thank you very much </garnt>
<joey> that's the one time everyone has a </joey>
<connor> patreon i feel like being british she </connor>
<connor> can't really complain anymore like </connor>
<connor> everyone everyone [ __ ] mocks proof </connor>
<garnt> so you kind of just get used to it i'm </garnt>
<connor> just like yes honey oh you made another </connor>
<garnt> british meme bottle of water alright </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i mean like i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> self-deprecation is just part of </garnt>
<joey> british culture and british mentality </joey>
<joey> it's such an amazing </joey>
<joey> fall though right like especially on </joey>
<joey> youtube because like remember amazing </joey>
<garnt> for </garnt>
<garnt> the rise and fall of british columbia </garnt>
<joey> because remember in like 2015 </joey>
<joey> everyone was [ __ ] obsessed with </joey>
<joey> british culture and now everyone's like </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<garnt> in this english form of death i i think </garnt>
<garnt> it's just because </garnt>
<garnt> the internet has just realized what </garnt>
<connor> british people actually sound like </connor>
<connor> it's just i always wondered that when i </connor>
<joey> was like growing up </joey>
<joey> no one sounds like this everyone in the </joey>
<joey> uk doesn't sound like harry styles </joey>
<garnt> what and i'm and i'm just like what what </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember growing up i was like </garnt>
<joey> when uh when i like the world when is </joey>
<joey> the world going to realize that </joey>
<joey> people don't sound like they do in harry </joey>
<garnt> potter yeah every other like british </garnt>
<garnt> film like doctor who or whatever </garnt>
<joey> i'm just waiting for the day that </joey>
<joey> everyone realizes that not everyone in </joey>
<joey> australia looks like chris hemsworth </joey>
<connor> debatable i mean i know like two people </connor>
<joey> and they look you know you're one of </joey>
<joey> them you look close enough </joey>
<connor> to chris hemsworth you're getting you </connor>
<connor> get ripped you're the licorice hamburger </connor>
<joey> now if i get ripped i look like jason </joey>
<joey> mama </joey>
<joey> what are you waiting for </joey>
<connor> okay tell me tell me what else you get </connor>
<joey> up to then in fukuoka </joey>
<connor> okay i can tease well i mean journey </connor>
<joey> across japan so there's always a theme </joey>
<connor> right so like the first journey across </connor>
<joey> japan was cycling yeah it was chris </joey>
<joey> cycling yeah and i was just on one part </joey>
<joey> of it </joey>
<joey> um but then the second journey across </joey>
<connor> japan i was there fully for it and uh </connor>
<joey> it was called escape to fuji so the </joey>
<connor> theme of it was we went around </connor>
<connor> mount fuji and like all the cool places </connor>
<connor> we can go to mount fuji because </connor>
<joey> chris had never seen a nice view of </joey>
<joey> mount fuji in his life so he's never </joey>
<joey> taken one of those like touristy photos </joey>
<joey> right and he kept like </joey>
<joey> apparently his audience kept sending him </joey>
<joey> like pictures of like </joey>
<joey> amazing views like hey look chris i was </joey>
<joey> here for two days and i got an amazing </joey>
<garnt> view of foundation [ __ ] you </garnt>
<garnt> so you can check it out now by the way </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you can check it out now it's all </garnt>
<garnt> there so </garnt>
<joey> the third journey across japan is called </joey>
<garnt> the lost islands because </garnt>
<garnt> uh the kyushu area has all these like </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like jurassic park here man </garnt>
<connor> yeah right even though like the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like promotional artwork </connor>
<connor> looks like a [ __ ] like shitty movie </connor>
<joey> poster like </joey>
<joey> like it's like i say shitty it looks </joey>
<joey> amazing but like </joey>
<joey> yeah so the uh the kyushu area is like </joey>
<joey> it's almost like </joey>
<joey> an archipelago of just these like insane </joey>
<joey> amount of </joey>
<connor> time was that word sorry archipelago </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] you whip someone needs to </connor>
<joey> whip out a dictionary </joey>
<garnt> really you're looking for mailings you </garnt>
<joey> can be on your side here okay all right </joey>
<connor> like something so like the philippines </connor>
<connor> for example is an archipelago because </connor>
<joey> it's just a bunch of </joey>
<joey> tiny tiny tiny islands so basically </joey>
<garnt> cultural cross-pollination all over </garnt>
<joey> again man </joey>
<garnt> layman's terms there's lots of tiny tiny </garnt>
<joey> islands </joey>
<connor> along the coast of kyushu yeah so we </connor>
<joey> were like oh that's perfect we'll call </joey>
<joey> it the lost islands because we'll try </joey>
<joey> and go to as many of these like small </joey>
<joey> islands and i think we ended up going to </joey>
<joey> like three or four of them </joey>
<joey> um i mean obviously we couldn't go to </joey>
<connor> all them because there's literally </connor>
<connor> thousands of them out there but some of </connor>
<connor> these islands were [ __ ] insane </connor>
<joey> looking like </joey>
<joey> completely awesome pictures yeah yeah i </joey>
<joey> showed pictures </joey>
<connor> yeah but um yeah it's just incredible </connor>
<garnt> like we literally did </garnt>
<joey> speed run kyushu yeah i think i think </joey>
<joey> because like that week felt like a month </joey>
<garnt> yeah it was [ __ ] insane it sounds </garnt>
<garnt> like you did a [ __ ] ton from </garnt>
<joey> how you were describing it to me </joey>
<joey> honestly the challenges that we like </joey>
<joey> usually you know prepare with on journey </joey>
<connor> across japan yeah this time around was </connor>
<connor> like kind of a back burner just because </connor>
<connor> there's so much [ __ ] we were doing </connor>
<connor> like oh yeah i forgot we had to do like </connor>
<joey> a challenge for this video [ __ ] yeah but </joey>
<joey> yeah hopefully the trailer will be out </joey>
<connor> by the time it goes out yeah </connor>
<connor> if chris isn't lazy yeah if not sorry </connor>
<joey> chris i probably just sent a bunch of </joey>
<joey> where's the trailer people over to your </joey>
<garnt> channel </garnt>
<garnt> yeah what i want to know is that how </garnt>
<joey> many more places can he do journey </joey>
<joey> across japan like how many more themes </joey>
<joey> can he do because like </joey>
<joey> one thing i will say about japan is that </joey>
<joey> one one thing one other thing that </joey>
<joey> impresses me the most is just </joey>
<joey> how [ __ ] varied japan is in terms of </joey>
<joey> like how many places there are to travel </joey>
<joey> when to explore right </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like because i'm used to </joey>
<joey> the uk right and i feel like if you've </joey>
<connor> explored </connor>
<connor> a decent amount of the uk then you've </connor>
<connor> kind of to me at least you've kind of </connor>
<joey> seen it all in one town </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah if you go you go to one town </connor>
<connor> you go to one city and it's it's kind of </connor>
<connor> all the same i mean london </connor>
<garnt> to me london kind of exists in its own </garnt>
<garnt> bubble london's like unique but like </garnt>
<garnt> anywhere outside of london </garnt>
<garnt> i mean [ __ ] [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> i mean yeah i mean australia is the same </joey>
<joey> thing right like i think geographically </joey>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> just as large as like the us maybe close </joey>
<joey> to it </joey>
<joey> yeah we have sand so it's like 80 of it </joey>
<joey> is a [ __ ] desert </joey>
<connor> so it's like that's why like i've barely </connor>
<joey> gone exploring in australia because i'm </joey>
<joey> just like i just don't know what there </joey>
<connor> is out there but then again </connor>
<connor> if chris hadn't like gone and done like </connor>
<connor> extensive research on places in kyushu </connor>
<connor> yeah i probably would have had no </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i don't know how chris finds </connor>
<joey> these [ __ ] places no </joey>
<connor> he comes to me with this town in the </connor>
<connor> middle in the mountains of kyoto yeah </connor>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> well how do you find this he literally </joey>
<joey> just like spends months just researching </joey>
<joey> like interesting places i remember like </joey>
<joey> on journey across japan too </joey>
<joey> there was this like in the middle of the </joey>
<joey> mountains in uh gifu prefecture or </joey>
<joey> toyama i think it was toyama prefecture </joey>
<joey> which usually you know people don't go </joey>
<joey> to for tourism </joey>
<joey> yeah he found this like in the middle of </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] mountains there was this </joey>
<joey> like field of like </joey>
<joey> a thousand statues of people that had </joey>
<joey> just been built </joey>
<joey> and you know how he found it he </joey>
<joey> literally went on to like google </joey>
<joey> satellite and just like scanned through </joey>
<joey> the mountains oh my god what the heck </joey>
<joey> absolutely until he stopped and was like </joey>
<connor> what is this what is this gray bulb </connor>
<connor> and like enhanced enhanced and then i </connor>
<connor> saw that there were these statues and </connor>
<garnt> because like if you look it up like </garnt>
<garnt> before that video went up there is no </garnt>
<joey> articles about it like not even japanese </joey>
<garnt> media talks about it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this is like some next level this </garnt>
<garnt> is like some nasa [ __ ] yeah i was like i </garnt>
<joey> want your like </joey>
<connor> dedication of research people do strange </connor>
<connor> things with their land in japan </connor>
<garnt> like in the uk you just kind of have a </garnt>
<garnt> field and maybe put a fence in it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> let's call it a day but there's only so </garnt>
<garnt> many things you can do you know </garnt>
<garnt> apparently they seem to go crazy with it </garnt>
<joey> they're like what if we just made </joey>
<joey> a field that's just trampoline outside </joey>
<joey> like all right dude if </joey>
<garnt> i mean that's what's so awesome about </garnt>
<joey> japan is that you can just be driving in </joey>
<joey> the middle of nowhere then </joey>
<joey> like you just see this weird like this </joey>
<joey> weird [ __ ] place that </joey>
<joey> you don't know who you don't know what </joey>
<joey> madman came up with this idea just put </joey>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] like a like a field of </garnt>
<joey> statues </joey>
<joey> like it's like it's not even like built </joey>
<joey> for tourism either because like it's not </joey>
<joey> even known </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah it's like it's like if </joey>
<joey> you're lucky enough to find it then </joey>
<joey> there you go there it is enjoy it </joey>
<connor> i'm hoping the next journey across japan </connor>
<connor> is just like five star hotels and chris </connor>
<connor> is like come come come on connor let's </connor>
<connor> go </connor>
<connor> let's go just go review five star hotels </connor>
<joey> i'm down for that journey across </joey>
<joey> michelin restaurants </joey>
<connor> not only not only is it a tax deductible </connor>
<connor> it's also </connor>
<connor> fantastic it's fun i want to do this </connor>
<joey> yeah but please look forward to that </joey>
<joey> whenever that i think he said it's </joey>
<joey> coming out end of </joey>
<garnt> may maybe so hopefully soon so like how </garnt>
<garnt> many more places in japan do </garnt>
<joey> you want to visit personally so i have </joey>
<joey> this app actually on my phone </joey>
<joey> where you can keep track of it's it's </joey>
<garnt> what i use to keep track of all the </garnt>
<joey> prefectures i've been to google </joey>
<garnt> it's called google maps it stalks you it </garnt>
<connor> knows exactly </connor>
<garnt> okay yeah so like have we told the story </garnt>
<connor> about the cycling yeah </connor>
<connor> uh yeah okay i mean so i i know </connor>
<joey> because i i like this that google tells </joey>
<joey> me exactly where i was for how long </joey>
<joey> yeah i like looking back where i was and </joey>
<joey> like because when people ask me oh where </joey>
<joey> were you this day i'm like oh let me </joey>
<joey> check </joey>
<joey> yes </joey>
<connor> but like it tells you exactly where you </connor>
<joey> were for how long yeah and when we did </joey>
<joey> the cycling special we all had our phone </joey>
<connor> tracking on that wasn't sharing the </connor>
<connor> video but we actually saw where we all </connor>
<connor> were </connor>
<garnt> yeah throughout the video yeah and uh </garnt>
<joey> when the video was done uh i asked them </joey>
<connor> i was like hey guys can you export your </connor>
<connor> map data so that we can send it to our </connor>
<connor> editor so that he can </connor>
<garnt> know where we were so that's how you see </garnt>
<garnt> all the you know cool map </garnt>
<garnt> graphics that i made 100 accurate but </garnt>
<garnt> it's pretty close it's pretty close </garnt>
<connor> it's pretty close so where we are </connor>
<garnt> generally on that map is actually so </garnt>
<garnt> we turned on location services which i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't know that you could track each </garnt>
<joey> other </joey>
<joey> like in like light in like real time so </joey>
<connor> so it wasn't a part of like the big </connor>
<connor> we didn't make it a big part of the </connor>
<joey> special but we could actually see where </joey>
<connor> we were as we were cycling down so we </connor>
<connor> could </connor>
<connor> i could see like that joey was [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> kicking my ass and </connor>
<connor> connor turned off his location sharing </connor>
<joey> when he was taking the ferry so he just </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> he just like popped out of existence i </garnt>
<joey> literally thought </joey>
<connor> i literally thought he was like lost out </connor>
<joey> there yeah i just said i was probably </joey>
<garnt> like he's dead he's just straight up </garnt>
<connor> dead yeah so there was no signal </connor>
<garnt> exactly when i asked these guys to share </garnt>
<joey> it they were like wait </joey>
<connor> gantt was like wait what like they keep </connor>
<connor> all this information on here yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah it's awesome it's terrifying yeah </joey>
<garnt> so so i i didn't realize </garnt>
<garnt> that um by turning on location services </garnt>
<garnt> i could go through my </garnt>
<garnt> entire history day by day and if you've </garnt>
<garnt> turned on location services </garnt>
<garnt> you can probably do that right now if </garnt>
<garnt> you go to google maps and and </garnt>
<connor> you can go through the history of your </connor>
<connor> like location services </connor>
<connor> and it will tell you the exact location </connor>
<connor> you've been </connor>
<connor> hour by hour yeah every single day for </connor>
<connor> like the past 10 years of your life yeah </connor>
<connor> it's pretty good </connor>
<connor> that's it's scary that's terrifying </connor>
<connor> google is google is literally stalking </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> at all times you know what you're sad is </connor>
<joey> like when i used to live in london </joey>
<joey> because i barely ever left my house it </joey>
<joey> would be like what did i do this day </joey>
<joey> it's like a dot on the map of me not </joey>
<joey> leaving my house i'd be like oh what do </joey>
<garnt> like i didn't know this is like some </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] fbi [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know like because sometimes </connor>
<connor> i go to a place and i'm like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] where was that i could just go on </connor>
<connor> google and find out where i was i mean </connor>
<joey> it's cool </joey>
<garnt> like you know to look back on right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> no it's it's you're the only one looking </garnt>
<garnt> at it </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i mean i mean it's like two sides </garnt>
<garnt> right because it's cool to know that you </garnt>
<garnt> could go through your entire life </garnt>
<joey> history </joey>
<joey> but it's also kind of like i guess scary </joey>
<joey> or not not scary but like </joey>
<joey> disturbing that yeah your entire life </joey>
<joey> is like can be compressed down into a </joey>
<joey> file and just like analyzed right </joey>
<joey> and exported right and exported i don't </joey>
<connor> know that that's just that's just like </connor>
<joey> this this is the future that black </joey>
<garnt> mirror like warned us about you know </garnt>
<joey> that is some joy </joey>
<connor> i i for one welcome our black mirror </connor>
<garnt> i welcome technology i don't know i </garnt>
<joey> uh yeah i i don't know i like it it's </joey>
<joey> fun it's yeah it's </joey>
<joey> interactive it's right what do you what </joey>
<garnt> do you mean interactive </garnt>
<joey> it's not stalking it's interactive no no </joey>
<garnt> i can see the cool side of it it's just </garnt>
<garnt> it just you know it's just a bit like </garnt>
<connor> wait why did this come up again </connor>
<joey> because you're asking how many prefix oh </joey>
<garnt> yeah so so is there any place there </garnt>
<garnt> so i have i have an app that shows me </garnt>
<garnt> all the prefectures i've been to and i </garnt>
<garnt> can </garnt>
<connor> kind of give points as well it's been </connor>
<connor> like so it's like i visited there i </connor>
<connor> walked there i stayed there overnight i </connor>
<joey> lived there etcetera and like </joey>
<connor> adds on the point i lived here i did it </connor>
<connor> so i can i know exactly now like which </connor>
<joey> uh you know prefectures i haven't been </joey>
<joey> to yet um and i think </joey>
<joey> i mean i can bring it up but i think </joey>
<connor> maybe i've done </connor>
<connor> i want to say like three fifths maybe </connor>
<connor> three quarters of all the prefectures </connor>
<connor> but yeah these these are the ones i've </connor>
<connor> done red ones you've been to holy [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> so the red ones i've stayed overnight </connor>
<connor> i'll send this image to you but the red </connor>
<connor> ones i've stayed overnight the green </connor>
<connor> ones </connor>
<joey> i've like just stopped over the yellow </joey>
<joey> ones i've passed through the blue ones </joey>
<joey> i've </joey>
<joey> uh like walked around and the white ones </joey>
<joey> i haven't visited yet so </joey>
<joey> okay there's a decent amount that i </joey>
<joey> still haven't gone to but this is good </joey>
<joey> right because now </joey>
<joey> i can use that app basically to be like </joey>
<connor> all right well you know i want to like </connor>
<joey> take a weekend off somewhere yeah you </joey>
<connor> know like i can plan my next vacation to </connor>
<connor> be like well i've never been to this </connor>
<joey> prefecture yeah so let's go check that </joey>
<connor> out </connor>
<connor> yeah i wish i wasn't so [ __ ] stupid </connor>
<connor> man i just </connor>
<connor> don't really care where i am unless </connor>
<connor> there's like i don't know something fun </connor>
<connor> to do there i'm like oh yeah </connor>
<joey> of course yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't go </joey>
<joey> to a [ __ ] prefecture if i didn't have </joey>
<garnt> anything to do there yeah </garnt>
<connor> i'm not i'm not the type of guy who just </connor>
<connor> like okay i haven't been to this map yet </connor>
<connor> i haven't </connor>
<connor> been to this part of the map i need to </connor>
<garnt> know that there's something cool to do </garnt>
<joey> there </joey>
<joey> see this is my this is my jrpg like a </joey>
<joey> hundred percent completionist </joey>
<joey> coming out because i'm like i gotta i </joey>
<joey> gotta finish all 47 prefectures like </joey>
<joey> completed for me like it's like a </joey>
<joey> catch-22 because i want to go to new </joey>
<joey> places i want to find new cool places </joey>
<garnt> yeah but i also </garnt>
<garnt> don't have the energy that chris does to </garnt>
<joey> just like [ __ ] scout out places that </joey>
<joey> look like yeah </joey>
<joey> not only scour but like schedule it yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah like </connor>
<joey> meticulously it's like going with </joey>
<joey> someone who plans stuff i'm like yeah </joey>
<joey> you plan it i'll i'll i'll just </joey>
<joey> i'll come along i'll crack a few jokes </joey>
<connor> that's what i love across japan right </connor>
<connor> it's like it's a [ __ ] vacation for me </connor>
<joey> right honestly i have to be on camera </joey>
<joey> and talk for a few hours a day </joey>
<connor> that is definitely the benefit of </connor>
<joey> hanging out with chris he just takes </joey>
<joey> care of everything </joey>
<joey> yeah i know where we going i know a </joey>
<joey> place let's do it here's the definition </joey>
<joey> of i know a place </joey>
<joey> one time i i did that for chris i was </joey>
<joey> like i'll let me take you to a place </joey>
<joey> right we're in kyoto right and i was </joey>
<connor> like no </connor>
<connor> i know a great coffee place literally </connor>
<connor> outside where we were staying there's a </connor>
<connor> blue bottle coffee </connor>
<connor> right it's like the least kyoto thing </connor>
<connor> ever </connor>
<joey> like an american chain like that it's </joey>
<joey> good it's good it's good </joey>
<joey> that's too fat it's pretty [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<garnt> this is japanese starbucks </garnt>
<connor> starbucks do we have a clip name </connor>
<connor> japan's coffee is bottom tier because </connor>
<connor> probably not well we do now yeah we do </connor>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> we talked about japan's coffee [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's </joey>
<connor> yeah i didn't know that i cared about </connor>
<connor> coffee until i moved to japan and i </connor>
<connor> realized that the coffee here was [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> because i thought living in england my </connor>
<connor> i'm not i'm just like whatever i </connor>
<joey> would [ __ ] i thought i thought like </joey>
<joey> my coffee tolerance was </joey>
<joey> i'll [ __ ] take instant coffee if i </joey>
<joey> need to but yeah like when i moved to </joey>
<joey> japan i've realized </joey>
<garnt> what [ __ ] coffee tastes like but then i </garnt>
<joey> got a job </joey>
<joey> and now i know so because remember the </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> just the brainwashing that happens the </connor>
<connor> first time you come to japan you're like </connor>
<joey> i can buy a hot coffee at a vending </joey>
<connor> machine oh my god i'm going to play this </connor>
<connor> every [ __ ] day oh my god </connor>
<connor> then you realize it's just all sugar </connor>
<joey> yeah you realize it's all crap </joey>
<joey> yeah like oh starbucks has never been so </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] attractive to me so yeah so yeah </garnt>
<joey> as you know as you know japan has like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ton of vending machines like </joey>
<joey> everywhere yeah and i remember whenever </joey>
<joey> i used to go on holiday in japan </joey>
<joey> i'd always get the coffee uh vending </joey>
<joey> machine coffee every single day </joey>
<joey> without without fail and i'm just like i </joey>
<joey> will never get bored of this at all this </joey>
<joey> is [ __ ] amazing </joey>
<joey> i don't need to i don't need to go to a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] starbucks or a coffee shop to </joey>
<joey> get my coffee </joey>
<joey> i can just go to a vending machine and </joey>
<joey> then i moved here and then i don't know </joey>
<joey> what it is about moving here like </joey>
<joey> something switched in my brain right and </joey>
<garnt> then i just instantly recognized it </garnt>
<garnt> as like oh this tastes like crap this is </garnt>
<garnt> this is processed instant coffee [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> and i don't know i don't know why i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know what switched my brain like </garnt>
<garnt> why is it that when i was here as a </garnt>
<garnt> tourist i was </garnt>
<garnt> vending machine coffee and vending </garnt>
<garnt> machine drinks were just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> like five stars we don't have in the uk </joey>
<connor> so you're like you're </connor>
<connor> like amazed it's just like a new weird </connor>
<connor> thing right like you know conor i </connor>
<connor> remember was talking about how </connor>
<connor> you know every time every time you came </connor>
<connor> here to visit you would [ __ ] eat </connor>
<joey> you know family mode on geary every day </joey>
<joey> right yeah yeah and then you realized </joey>
<joey> oh this is not that great actually i've </joey>
<joey> actually gone back </joey>
<joey> on it now oh really i've got i've talked </joey>
<joey> about like a drone yeah </joey>
<joey> but i've been like full circle i've i've </joey>
<joey> relapsed </joey>
<connor> i was very diehard sandwiches for like a </connor>
<connor> year and a half and now i'm like man i </connor>
<connor> coffee is as much of like a smell thing </connor>
<joey> as it is a drink thing </joey>
<joey> like i need the reason why i like going </joey>
<joey> into a coffee shop </joey>
<joey> is because i need that that wall of </joey>
<connor> coffee smells yeah </connor>
<joey> that's what makes me feel like i'm ready </joey>
<garnt> to [ __ ] drink i i'd say i </garnt>
<garnt> coffee is a [ __ ] morning thing for me </garnt>
<connor> right now because </connor>
<connor> not a morning a [ __ ] morning it is a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] moment because </connor>
<connor> honestly honestly is your morning really </connor>
<connor> started if you don't have a coffee </connor>
<connor> because to me </connor>
<connor> if i don't have a coffee that's like </connor>
<connor> that's like my indicator that my morning </connor>
<joey> has begun </joey>
<joey> i can begin the day if i don't have the </joey>
<joey> coffee then i'm just like in permanent </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> 50 brain modes no coffee i sleep coffee </joey>
<joey> exactly that's literally how i am i </joey>
<garnt> don't know i don't know if it's a </garnt>
<joey> placebo thing no </joey>
<joey> i'm i'm totally the same like like i </joey>
<joey> remember there was one week where i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i might be a little too dependent on </joey>
<joey> coffee let me let me let me back it up a </joey>
<joey> bit </joey>
<joey> yeah because i was having like you know </joey>
<joey> two three cups of coffee a day right so </joey>
<connor> i was like like </connor>
<connor> four or five yeah right and i'm like </connor>
<connor> that's probably not that good for me my </connor>
<connor> heart's probably about to explode so let </connor>
<joey> me like let me just go a week </joey>
<joey> with no coffee and see how i do day two </joey>
<joey> i was like </joey>
<joey> i was getting just insane migraines in </joey>
<joey> my head i was like oh </joey>
<connor> like i'm really [ __ ] dependent on </connor>
<connor> this [ __ ] to start the day i just get </connor>
<joey> sluggish if i stop </joey>
<joey> i don't really get too bad you don't get </joey>
<garnt> like coffee headaches no i've never </garnt>
<garnt> gotten that </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like friends who got it how it </garnt>
<garnt> feels for me is that you know that </garnt>
<garnt> scene in the film where it's like it's </garnt>
<connor> like like they got the grayscale filter </connor>
<connor> on it </connor>
<connor> that's how i see the world before i have </connor>
<joey> my coffee man and then </joey>
<joey> like i have the coffee and then like </joey>
<joey> they they instantly turn up the </joey>
<garnt> saturation </garnt>
<joey> that that is that is how my mornings </joey>
<joey> work i go from grayscale to sepia </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] meme of uh don't talk to me </connor>
<connor> until i've had my coffee </connor>
<garnt> like you're literally that guy no </garnt>
<garnt> because i remember when i first moved to </garnt>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<garnt> and i my mornings were just like so </garnt>
<garnt> depressing because i didn't have that </garnt>
<joey> first </joey>
<joey> that first good hot coffee to look </joey>
<joey> forward to right right </joey>
<joey> because even if i'd go to my like family </joey>
<connor> mart to get a coffee it was like really </connor>
<joey> watered down coffee wasn't it </joey>
<connor> i don't know it's it's i've noticed the </connor>
<connor> more i like </connor>
<joey> the more i like grow up it's the little </joey>
<joey> things in life that you need to look </joey>
<joey> forward to i don't know </joey>
<joey> it is a little things like my mornings </joey>
<garnt> are 20 </garnt>
<garnt> less happy if i don't have a coffee to </garnt>
<connor> look forward to yeah i just feel like my </connor>
<garnt> day is depressing that's kind of about </garnt>
<garnt> it really yeah yeah exactly that's like </garnt>
<connor> most days </connor>
<connor> one time i went to an italian restaurant </connor>
<connor> here and you know i feel like an italian </connor>
<joey> restaurant </joey>
<joey> i feel like you can almost judge it on </joey>
<joey> uh how good their espresso is with the </joey>
<connor> meal oh yeah </connor>
<connor> it must end on an espresso i feel at </connor>
<joey> least like you know yeah absolutely and </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<connor> you know it was good it was pretty good </connor>
<connor> food i was like not bad have you have </connor>
<joey> you found one that has a good espresso </joey>
<connor> because i've </connor>
<connor> yet to find one there's one or two that </connor>
<connor> you know if i see the the </connor>
<connor> actual espresso machine in the back i'm </connor>
<connor> like nice yeah you know it's going to be </connor>
<joey> good because they've </joey>
<joey> they've gone to the effort to get this </joey>
<joey> ridiculously expensive machine </joey>
<joey> just for this like one part of yeah </joey>
<joey> right right yeah um </joey>
<joey> but i i was i was eating there and the </joey>
<joey> food was pretty good you know i was </joey>
<joey> disappointed and i thought well </joey>
<joey> fantastic i'm going to end my meal off </joey>
<joey> with an espresso and it said on the menu </joey>
<connor> he said espresso </connor>
<connor> right it was a double or a single and so </connor>
<connor> i ordered the double espresso </connor>
<connor> and they they just brought out </connor>
<connor> essentially an americano </connor>
<connor> what and i said i said like oh no no i </connor>
<connor> ordered the espresso like i don't know </connor>
<connor> that's the espresso and i'm like what </connor>
<joey> it's like this this talk i'm like that's </joey>
<joey> not an espresso and if it is i'm going </joey>
<joey> to be having a heart attack </joey>
<connor> it's like a triple double espresso i'm </connor>
<connor> like what am i the [ __ ] here </connor>
<connor> are you going to make me pay for this </connor>
<joey> i'm not paying for this </joey>
<joey> i paid for it but you know i didn't walk </joey>
<joey> out </joey>
<joey> and naturally i didn't complain and i </joey>
<joey> paid for it but that's not the point i </joey>
<joey> mean i was very disappointed was that at </joey>
<joey> least a good americana no he's awful </joey>
<joey> that day onwards i i swore against </joey>
<joey> ordering coffee in places where i </joey>
<connor> couldn't visibly see an espresso machine </connor>
<connor> in the establishment i'm like timing to </connor>
<garnt> the back take me to the back let's see </garnt>
<garnt> what's going on come on </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i i'd say like the best </garnt>
<garnt> purchase i've made in japan </garnt>
<garnt> bar none is the nespresso machine i'm </garnt>
<connor> gonna get that soon </connor>
<connor> i would trade my first born son for an </connor>
<joey> espresso machine honestly straight up </joey>
<joey> like i </joey>
<joey> that thing i i hug that thing yeah every </joey>
<joey> day </joey>
<joey> give it a morning kiss i could go </joey>
<connor> homeless and the one thing i'd keep with </connor>
<connor> me is the inspiration </connor>
<connor> i'd be going around on the street </connor>
<connor> holding the espresso machine plugging </connor>
<connor> into outlets when i can </connor>

<joey> have tick-tock install on my phone right </joey>
<joey> my only exposure to tick-tock is aki </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> and uh and this [ __ ] thing where </connor>
<connor> you know those like [ __ ] tick tocks </connor>
<connor> where it's like amazon gadgets that </connor>
<connor> changed my life part 71 like you know </connor>
<joey> those </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] they all sound the [ __ ] same </connor>
<joey> there was one where it was literally </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> alarm clock all right it's 400 bucks it </joey>
<joey> was this alarm clock </joey>
<joey> that makes you a cup of coffee oh we had </joey>
<connor> when it went </connor>
<joey> yeah we had that in the like 80s in the </joey>
<joey> uk for tea really yeah it was called a </joey>
<joey> kettle mate </joey>
<joey> and uh could set the alarm and it would </joey>
<joey> pour a cup of tea for you </joey>
<joey> this is this is not a new invention tick </joey>
<joey> tock [ __ ] yeah so it's like it was like </joey>
<joey> there's like a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> it looks like maybe it's about that big </connor>
<connor> that's pretty massive it's pretty </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] large but there's like you know </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> the cup the coffee mug there and then </connor>
<joey> there's like a proper brewing thing </joey>
<joey> on the side and you put in this like </joey>
<joey> canister of milk in the morning </joey>
<joey> right like lock it in and when the alarm </joey>
<joey> goes off it just straight up just makes </joey>
<joey> you a [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> an espresso machine is literally one </connor>
<joey> button you could literally have that </joey>
<connor> next to your bed </connor>
<connor> you don't need it yeah exactly that's </connor>
<joey> what i was thinking i was like </joey>
<joey> just get a [ __ ] nespresso machine and </joey>
<joey> just put the [ __ ] thing in and </joey>
<connor> do it yeah so please just sponsor us </connor>
<garnt> already yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> like like cause the problem is right i </garnt>
<garnt> feel like nespresso </garnt>
<garnt> is one of the best capsule machines but </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like in japan it's the only </garnt>
<connor> capsule machine </connor>
<connor> it's actually good because the like you </connor>
<connor> could get like the actual </connor>
<joey> uh you know the ones actually you have </joey>
<joey> to put the uh the coffee um </joey>
<connor> grinded the beans right yeah but like i </connor>
<joey> had one of those </joey>
<connor> i had one of those as well cleaning it </connor>
<connor> is such a it's a bit of an effect yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> like nespresso is like the perfect i'm </connor>
<connor> literally just [ __ ] marketing to you </connor>
<connor> right now yeah it is literally the </connor>
<joey> easiest </joey>
<garnt> and like easiest to clean it's just easy </garnt>
<joey> for the quality you get and for the </joey>
<garnt> convenience it is </garnt>
<garnt> the best capsule machine please </garnt>
<connor> sponsored </connor>
<connor> a lot of capsule machines </connor>
<connor> we bought one just for this office it </connor>
<connor> was literally the first purchase that we </connor>
<connor> made </connor>
<connor> and we tried to get geeks plus to play </connor>
<garnt> for it for us but they wouldn't allow it </garnt>
<joey> so we played before we bought this table </joey>
<connor> we bought the nespresso machine </connor>
<connor> we had our priorities right that's for </connor>
<joey> sure exactly yeah i remember when they </joey>
<joey> gave us the spreadsheet of just like </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> so they get so geeks gave us a </joey>
<joey> spreadsheet because they said they would </joey>
<joey> help </joey>
<joey> us um dick not decorate the office but </joey>
<joey> refurbish the office yeah and we were </joey>
<joey> like okay </joey>
<joey> tables desk television um not my story </joey>
<joey> no but there was a it was it was split </joey>
<joey> up in like here's the list of uh </joey>
<joey> like here's the list of the things we </joey>
<joey> need and here's the list of the things </joey>
<joey> we want and we put </joey>
<connor> the espresso machine in the first thing </connor>
<connor> on need </connor>
<joey> we're like no no you know what i'm </joey>
<garnt> saying yeah we need this </garnt>
<connor> do you really need this is this as </connor>
<connor> necessary </connor>
<connor> as the table and we were like yes yes </connor>
<connor> without without coffee this podcast is </connor>
<connor> not happening no i'm sorry </connor>
<joey> i'm not i'm not going to film yeah i </joey>
<joey> refuse to release episodes </joey>
<joey> because like another thing about </joey>
<joey> japanese like coffee shops as well is </joey>
<joey> that there are so many </joey>
<joey> independent coffee shops here in japan </joey>
<joey> so if you ever come to japan you you can </joey>
<joey> walk down a random street and find like </joey>
<joey> five to ten different like indie coffee </joey>
<joey> shops and the problem is they all look </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] great yeah they do but it's such </joey>
<joey> a coin flip </joey>
<joey> on whether it's going to be good coffee </joey>
<joey> or not because </joey>
<joey> the the like the fallacy is that you </joey>
<joey> know it's i've </joey>
<garnt> like some of the best and poshes looking </garnt>
<garnt> coffee shops i've been to in japan </garnt>
<garnt> have just had the shittest coffee yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's like acid yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like dirt water like because i </joey>
<joey> remember like uh especially in like </joey>
<joey> central tokyo like nishiazabu </joey>
<joey> and like um stuff like that there's like </joey>
<garnt> a lot of like </garnt>
<garnt> really like fancy kind of like rustic </garnt>
<garnt> looking coffee shops where </garnt>
<garnt> the beans are all lined up and they got </garnt>
<garnt> like they got the aesthetic down they </garnt>
<garnt> got the aesthetic to a tea yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then you order it and you're like </garnt>
<joey> waiting for this cup of coffee for like </joey>
<joey> 20 minutes </joey>
<joey> like what are they picking the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> coffee beans off the plant like it's </joey>
<joey> taking </joey>
<joey> so long and what comes out is like [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> yeah and essentially it's it's just like </garnt>
<joey> dirt water sometimes because </joey>
<joey> it's like twelve dollars please yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's [ __ ] twelve dollars for </garnt>
<joey> like this one yeah i i thought like </joey>
<joey> because especially going to america or </joey>
<joey> something you order like a cup of coffee </joey>
<joey> and you just assume that it's refillable </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> it's that kind of level of quality but </joey>
<joey> in japan you can have like </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] like instant coffee dirt </joey>
<joey> water </joey>
<garnt> and they give it to you in this like the </garnt>
<garnt> poshest little cup and it's [ __ ] tiny </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> dollars and you're just there being like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm even more depressed than i was </garnt>
<connor> before i ordered this coffee that's why </connor>
<joey> it's sad right it's sad that like blue </joey>
<joey> bottle coffee and starbucks are like the </joey>
<joey> best coffee in japan </joey>
<connor> it really is it's like going to you know </connor>
<connor> any foreign country like you know </connor>
<connor> mcdonald's is the finest cuisine yeah </connor>
<connor> he's </connor>
<connor> literally the best like don't eat </connor>
<connor> anything like it's so sad </connor>
<connor> the foreigners did it better than you </connor>
<garnt> yeah and they're [ __ ] chains </garnt>
<garnt> just like oh you want you want some good </garnt>
<connor> fried chicken well </connor>
<joey> i know a place yeah it begins with a k </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it's kind of it's got my favorite kernel </joey>
<connor> in front of it </connor>
<connor> it feels like you've like you're </connor>
<connor> admitting defeat where like the big </connor>
<connor> corporation's </connor>
<connor> the best at something yeah yeah all </connor>
<joey> right but like that's that's what i mean </joey>
<connor> when i say like we truly do live in a </connor>
<connor> tea society because yeah </connor>
<connor> like like they'll they'll do green tea </connor>
<joey> is amazing </joey>
<joey> here is [ __ ] great like the green tea </joey>
<joey> is obviously but like the other types of </joey>
<joey> tea here </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] fantastic but they just it's </joey>
<joey> taking a little bit longer to perfect </joey>
<joey> the coffee </joey>
<connor> i feel i i although i will say there's </connor>
<connor> some teas here with a like yeah it's </connor>
<connor> it's like cherry flavor and i'm like i </connor>
<connor> do not taste any tea in this this is </connor>
<connor> just cherry </connor>
<connor> are they like sweet teas well i can't </connor>
<connor> taste the tea and i'm like what's the </connor>
<joey> point in this see i'm i'm just </joey>
<joey> not a tea drinker so yeah i only drink </joey>
<garnt> tea when i have afternoon tea </garnt>
<joey> i don't know like i i don't i don't </joey>
<joey> drink tea </joey>
<joey> i i guess japanese tea is different </joey>
<joey> right because uh yeah </joey>
<joey> when i think of tea i think of hot tea </joey>
<garnt> yeah i think i like an earl grey or like </garnt>
<connor> a </connor>
<connor> english breakfast and yeah yeah stuff </connor>
<garnt> right but like yeah i don't count green </garnt>
<joey> tea is like a </joey>
<connor> like an afternoon tea tea i think </connor>
<connor> afternoon tea is probably the only good </connor>
<garnt> british export that we've done it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a british export that i'm proud of yeah </garnt>
<joey> i'm like yeah is it really nothing else </joey>
<garnt> a part of me dies inside whenever i go </garnt>
<garnt> to like a like a restaurant that does </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> foreign like european cuisine and i see </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] fish and chips there </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like why are you selling fish </garnt>
<joey> the best fish and chips though i ever </joey>
<joey> had </joey>
<connor> was uh this british pop british irish </connor>
<connor> pub called hobgoblin in shibuya </connor>
<connor> like maybe ever it's the best fishing </connor>
<connor> trip no no in japan </connor>
<connor> obviously no yeah in japan because every </connor>
<connor> other fish and chips i've had is like </connor>
<connor> they vinegar the [ __ ] out of the fish </connor>
<connor> where it's just like i'm not eating fish </connor>
<connor> i'm eating something </connor>
<connor> they should let you put the vinegar on </connor>
<connor> yourself yeah yeah but right but like </connor>
<connor> there's places where they just like do </connor>
<connor> it for it's [ __ ] up that's not right </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> so like the vinegar is like into in </connor>
<joey> inside the [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> meat of the fish and i'm just like this </joey>
<joey> does not taste like fish it tastes like </joey>
<joey> vinegar </joey>
<connor> yeah like as much as i love vinegar </connor>
<connor> don't get me wrong what's the max from </connor>
<connor> you to pay for fish and chips </connor>
<connor> abroad or in england that's just a full </connor>
<joey> stop oh it's still still i mean how big </joey>
<joey> are we talking like </joey>
<connor> a normal portion like a normal port like </connor>
<garnt> that that's why i was like you know when </garnt>
<connor> i went to this place 15 </connor>
<garnt> no that's the most that's what i mean </garnt>
<connor> right you would they charged me 22 </connor>
<connor> i'm still angry about this by the way </connor>
<garnt> they they're they're the same way you </garnt>
<garnt> made 22 dollars for a fish and chips 22 </garnt>
<connor> and it was mid [ __ ] honestly it was not </connor>
<joey> very was that at the welsh place yeah it </joey>
<joey> was at the wash tower </joey>
<garnt> i'm sorry i feel like i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> completely ruining their like any </garnt>
<connor> foreign tourism they get now but </connor>
<garnt> that was like that fish and chips is </garnt>
<garnt> important and they increased the price </garnt>
<connor> town reviewed by a welshman it was i </connor>
<connor> just i'm still annoyed about it </connor>
<connor> 22 times 22 bucks are pretty ridiculous </connor>
<connor> my mom was she probably slapped me if </connor>
<connor> she saw that i've had money for that it </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> it was like a five pound fish and chips </connor>
<garnt> as well it's not my chip was it like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] frozen iceland fish and chips </garnt>
<connor> it wasn't good it was it was like more </connor>
<connor> batter than fish ah that's that's that's </connor>
<garnt> what i've noticed whenever whenever i've </garnt>
<garnt> tried </garnt>
<joey> tried fish and chips that have not been </joey>
<joey> from england of course even even in </joey>
<joey> england not every fish and chips you get </joey>
<connor> is [ __ ] good </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] like i'd say 80 percent of fish and </joey>
<connor> chips you get in england is [ __ ] anyway </connor>
<connor> why would i trust it outside of england </connor>
<connor> that's right you gotta go to a nice pub </connor>
<garnt> a nice fancy kind of pub that does like </garnt>
<joey> focuses on food a lot and they'll have </joey>
<garnt> fish and chips on the menu it'll </garnt>
<garnt> probably be [ __ ] banging they might </garnt>
<connor> have like </connor>
<connor> triple deep fried fries as well honestly </connor>
<garnt> i want to take you guys to the hobgoblin </garnt>
<connor> because </connor>
<joey> it's like a proper barramundi like </joey>
<garnt> fishing i mean like the best fish and </garnt>
<garnt> chips i've had </garnt>
<garnt> is in brighton and it's like the one you </garnt>
<garnt> took us to </garnt>
<garnt> bankers i believe so i can't remember </garnt>
<connor> probably </connor>
<connor> probably yeah they live next to a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] ocean </garnt>
<garnt> next to the [ __ ] sea right so that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's like it's good fish and chips </garnt>
<garnt> because the fish is just fresh and you </garnt>
<garnt> can taste this fresh and it's like yeah </garnt>
<joey> the one you took us to in brian was </joey>
<joey> easily the best fish and chips i've ever </joey>
<joey> had </joey>
<garnt> but like like even so like there's </garnt>
<garnt> something that's i </garnt>
<garnt> i feel weird when whenever like you know </garnt>
<garnt> you go to japan and people like yo </garnt>
<connor> you can try the ramen you can try the </connor>
<connor> sushi you can try all these different </connor>
<connor> cuisines </connor>
<connor> and someone visits me in [ __ ] england </connor>
<connor> and i'm like yo you want to get sir </connor>
<connor> you want to get some fish and chips go </connor>
<connor> to the local shipping go to a pub and </connor>
<joey> i'm just like </joey>
<connor> that's what you're going wrong you </connor>
<connor> immediately have to get them drunk </connor>
<joey> so that they can't so they don't focus </joey>
<joey> on they can't judge yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's what i do i'm like let's go to </garnt>
<connor> the pub right away like yeah yeah but </connor>
<garnt> four people's in you won't kill each </garnt>
<garnt> other but like like the problem is when </garnt>
<joey> they stay </joey>
<joey> they're saying for like a week right </joey>
<joey> because you're just like how many days </joey>
<joey> in a row can they drink alcohol before </joey>
<joey> they've realized i'm going to blow your </joey>
<joey> mind with the test community before </joey>
<joey> before they realize that there's just </joey>
<joey> not much to our culture that we can show </joey>
<garnt> off to like </garnt>
<garnt> tourists that visit us that's what i </garnt>
<joey> think i mean it's the same problem in </joey>
<joey> australia as well like </joey>
<joey> after you have a kangaroo steak there's </joey>
<joey> literally nothing else </joey>
<joey> it's like we have fish and chips as well </joey>
<garnt> but like not as good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i i think the the one thing </garnt>
<garnt> i've realized </garnt>
<garnt> after moving japan after moving outside </garnt>
<garnt> of england and you know living in places </garnt>
<garnt> like thailand and </garnt>
<garnt> japan and stuff like that is that um </garnt>
<garnt> there's </garnt>
<garnt> to me in england there's not much to do </garnt>
<garnt> apart from drink </garnt>
<connor> right if you don't drink is that what </connor>
<connor> happens when you live in a place or is </connor>
<connor> that what happens when you like </connor>
<connor> like leave it and are aware like i </connor>
<connor> wonder okay do you think do you know </connor>
<connor> what there's much to do </connor>
<connor> like is there much to do in australia </connor>
<joey> that you know of other than going to the </joey>
<garnt> pub and going to the beach not really </garnt>
<garnt> far it's depressing at least we have </garnt>
<joey> really nice [ __ ] beaches yeah at </joey>
<joey> least </joey>
<garnt> at least you got that we don't even have </garnt>
<joey> nice beaches like i am from </joey>
<connor> there my beach is very nice there's </connor>
<connor> plenty of free needles and </connor>
<garnt> trash and everything like i say i tell </garnt>
<connor> people i'm from i like i grew up in a </connor>
<connor> beach town a beach city yeah </connor>
<connor> it's bright it's bright and [ __ ] yeah we </connor>
<connor> have pebble we we like brighton </connor>
<connor> is the tourist beach in england right </connor>
<connor> and it's like the worst beach it's </connor>
<connor> pretty bad </connor>
<connor> and i say that as someone who grew up in </connor>
<garnt> brighton i'm born and bred in bryce and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like it's </garnt>
<garnt> just a bunch of [ __ ] rocks you can't </garnt>
<connor> even go there barefooted right </connor>
<connor> and to make matters worse brighton is </connor>
<connor> just as expensive as london so like </connor>
<connor> what's the point </connor>
<garnt> of like it didn't always it wasn't </garnt>
<connor> always like that you're like </connor>
<connor> i remember gentrified my i remember a </connor>
<connor> time when bryson was cheap </connor>
<connor> you know the the way you could tell this </connor>
<connor> is like this i don't know if this is </connor>
<connor> scientifically proven but i'm </connor>
<joey> as far as i'm concerned it is you can </joey>
<joey> tell the costs of a town in the uk </joey>
<joey> 100 just go to the pub see what the the </joey>
<joey> pint of the beer the how much the beer </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<joey> yeah if you if you see yeah go go one </joey>
<connor> point </connor>
<garnt> if how much is like the the middle of </garnt>
<garnt> the like price </garnt>
<garnt> like pint yeah which is right right </garnt>
<garnt> because in brighton it's like what like </garnt>
<garnt> four pound fifty maybe five pounds </garnt>
<garnt> four pound five it's like london prices </garnt>
<connor> that's on the expensive and where i'm </connor>
<joey> from it's like two pound twenty yeah oh </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i i i i i </joey>
<joey> talk to people though that are from the </joey>
<joey> north or from wales or something and </joey>
<connor> they </connor>
<connor> tell me about these magical prices these </connor>
<connor> magical two mythical prices these </connor>
<joey> magical two pound prices </joey>
<joey> these are magical these are magical two </joey>
<joey> pound pints and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> what land are you from sir are you sure </joey>
<joey> that's are you sure it's beer that </joey>
<joey> you're drinking this </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry i didn't know we also i'm </joey>
<connor> sorry i didn't know you grew up in </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] narnia </connor>
<connor> what is this magical land that does not </connor>
<connor> exist in england it doesn't exist </connor>
<connor> also there are two americans as well uh </connor>
<joey> like a pint </joey>
<joey> is uh not an american point it's </joey>
<joey> different to the american point which is </joey>
<joey> also american pine's the biggest scam </joey>
<joey> ever by the way you guys got ripped off </joey>
<connor> i don't know why when americans took the </connor>
<connor> pint from us for some reason they made </connor>
<connor> it smaller </connor>
<joey> we talked about this on the stream </joey>
<joey> didn't did we oh okay yeah it's like </joey>
<connor> it's like a hundred milliliters less </connor>
<joey> you're losing a lot of beer there for no </joey>
<garnt> point the one time when americans took </garnt>
<garnt> something and made us </garnt>
<connor> it's like it's like 430 milliliters i </connor>
<connor> think around that in america and </connor>
<connor> british pine is 568 milliliters yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and </connor>
<connor> uh yeah you get a lot of beer for like </connor>
<connor> really cheap it's like the </connor>
<connor> pint where i grew up is like four </connor>
<joey> dollars [ __ ] the point where i grew up </joey>
<joey> was nine dollars </joey>
<connor> that's uh you uh australian australian </connor>
<joey> well that's not like real money </joey>
<joey> it's nine dollar dues so usd it's like </joey>
<connor> seven dollars </connor>
<joey> that's about london prices then yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's probably about london prices yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean like i i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> it's growing up in the south in england </garnt>
<garnt> whenever i travel like further north and </garnt>
<garnt> i see </garnt>
<garnt> the prices it's just like i i i feel </garnt>
<garnt> i feel great because no matter where i </garnt>
<garnt> go in england i'm paying either the same </garnt>
<garnt> amount or </garnt>
<garnt> less or less than i'm used to this is </garnt>
<connor> how like i i this is why </connor>
<connor> probably swiss people feel like the most </connor>
<joey> superior people on earth because </joey>
<joey> everywhere they go it's just like on </joey>
<joey> sale </joey>
<connor> like everything everything's cheap you </connor>
<joey> know what i mean that's why australians </joey>
<joey> love coming to you yeah </joey>
<connor> i feel so rich what do you mean it's </connor>
<joey> only one dollar for water </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly well i mean like remember i </joey>

<joey> in shibuya where on i think tuesdays </joey>
<joey> it's not even a happy hour but like all </joey>
<joey> night it's 50 yen beers </joey>

<connor> like that the beer scent doesn't taste </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> i don't know if it's because i don't </joey>
<joey> know if it's like the psychological </joey>
<joey> effect of me thinking this is too good </joey>
<joey> to be trying </joey>
<joey> but i find when the beer is mega cheap </joey>
<connor> at these places in japan it tastes like </connor>
<connor> water </connor>
<joey> yeah but after 10 of them you don't care </joey>

<connor> like i don't know i feel like i'm </connor>
<joey> struggling to keep up sometimes when </joey>
<joey> people want to party and i'm </joey>

<garnt> i just </garnt>
<garnt> like i i feel like i'm i feel like i'm </garnt>
<joey> still [ __ ] 25 23 </joey>
<joey> i mean you still look 25 you're gonna be </joey>
<connor> you're gonna be like the [ __ ] old </connor>
<connor> anime character that's like the most fun </connor>
<connor> to hang out with </connor>
<connor> and he teaches you some cool [ __ ] and </connor>
<connor> then he sacrifices himself casually </connor>
<joey> later on he's gonna be the old man who </joey>
<joey> like looks really small but the moment </joey>
<joey> he takes his shirt off it's jacked </joey>
<garnt> that's right basically </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i mean from what i've heard from </garnt>
<garnt> just other people who are older than me </garnt>
<joey> they just told me that </joey>
<joey> third your 30s is just basically your </joey>
<connor> 20s with one debuff to your body </connor>
<connor> and i i i i i i guess my hand is </connor>
<connor> what's the debuff for you i guess my </connor>
<connor> hangovers are slightly worse now that's </connor>
<connor> that's the only reason like </connor>
<joey> the only reason like i've i drink a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> ton more wine now because i don't know </joey>
<joey> what it is </joey>
<connor> like it's funny right because when i was </connor>
<joey> when i was like eighteen </joey>
<connor> thirty you go you're like beer vodka nah </connor>
<connor> me moment you turn 30 i have a wine </connor>
<connor> cooler yeah and it's fully </connor>
<garnt> you know that was exactly me when i was </garnt>
<joey> 30. </joey>
<connor> yes i only drink wine now thank you very </connor>
<garnt> much beer </garnt>
<connor> get get that teenage [ __ ] out the next </connor>
<joey> step is going to be like wine </joey>
<joey> cognac </joey>
<garnt> yeah i don't know like i just i mean i </garnt>
<garnt> drink wine because one i like the taste </garnt>
<garnt> and two because </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason the hangovers for wine </garnt>
<garnt> are just like </garnt>
<joey> seriously terrible i was like i remember </joey>
<garnt> because like yeah exactly like when i </garnt>
<garnt> was in my teens in like early twenties i </garnt>
<garnt> was like </garnt>
<garnt> why and [ __ ] you i would get the worst </garnt>
<garnt> hangovers and wine especially </garnt>
<connor> red wine like i swear i had like [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> vietnam flashbacks from drinking red </garnt>
<connor> wine at university right thai man </connor>
<garnt> like the hangovers there were like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] unbearable and then i hit like </garnt>
<garnt> 27 and i'm like oh this uh this this </garnt>
<joey> this kind of feels warm </joey>
<joey> i don't even have those like nam </joey>
<joey> flashbacks because like i didn't even </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't even drink water making that a </garnt>
<garnt> thing </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't because i didn't even i wasn't </garnt>
<connor> even interested in drinking wine i i </connor>
<connor> like you know in my early 20s because my </connor>
<connor> dad is like a [ __ ] heavy wine drinker </connor>
<connor> so he's always like you know try this </connor>
<connor> nice red wine </connor>
<connor> yeah of course australia yeah they all </connor>
<connor> love their wine </connor>
<connor> loads of wine yeah absolutely this is a </connor>
<connor> great wine now you know now that i can </connor>
<connor> drink wine it's like oh yeah that's </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] fantastic but </joey>
<connor> you know when you're like 21 22 and you </connor>
<joey> drink a glass of red you're like oh god </joey>
<joey> like i cannot </joey>
<connor> get used to this at all maybe we'd drink </connor>
<connor> more wine if we grew it in the uk but </connor>
<connor> unfortunately i think the only place </connor>
<joey> they make wine in uk are prison so i </joey>
<garnt> don't really think that much choice </garnt>
<joey> i think uk does make some wine is that </joey>
<garnt> wine is that considered wine or is that </garnt>
<garnt> just like grape juice </garnt>
<connor> attitude </connor>
<garnt> as well you just get it from france </garnt>
<garnt> right so like why did you make your own </garnt>
<garnt> when everyone's gonna be like </garnt>
<garnt> we literally have friends like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly and i didn't realize how </garnt>
<garnt> lucky i had it until i moved to a </garnt>
<garnt> country that you know is not well </garnt>
<garnt> i mean they produce sake here they do </garnt>
<joey> produce wine but it's not as well known </joey>
<joey> i didn't know how good we had it there </joey>
<joey> where you can just go to a [ __ ] local </joey>
<joey> co-op or tesco's in the bike </joey>
<joey> great wine that is like tripled the </joey>
<connor> price here in japan </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah and yeah sucks here yeah </joey>
<connor> that's the problem right </connor>
<connor> you have to go to like a specialist wine </connor>
<joey> place because like if you go to [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> family mart or seven it's it's like </joey>
<connor> you're just basically picking </connor>
<connor> poison if you drink a cheap wine here </connor>
<joey> you know it's it's basically just </joey>
<joey> it's basically just bottled rap boys </joey>
<joey> we have such first world problems </joey>
<connor> we're just like concerned about the </connor>
<connor> quality of the wine </connor>
<connor> listen what happened to us man i don't </connor>
<garnt> know man well i didn't it's </garnt>
<garnt> i i would say i'd start drinking way </garnt>
<garnt> more wine because of um because of </garnt>
<joey> corona </joey>
<joey> and because you know when you're stuck </joey>
<garnt> inside you you gotta fight you gotta </garnt>
<joey> find an interesting </joey>
<connor> decided to take up a new hobby </connor>
<joey> alcoholism </joey>
<joey> no but like it's incredible because like </joey>
<joey> i </joey>
<joey> it's the first time ever where i drank </joey>
<joey> something like a heavy heavy amount </joey>
<joey> yeah and i wake up the next morning i'm </joey>
<joey> like i i'm alive </joey>
<connor> now that see that's the thing right is </connor>
<connor> that i feel like that's a one-off right </connor>
<connor> i feel like that's being shot and it </connor>
<connor> like misses a vital organ that's what i </connor>
<garnt> when you're no no no no no no no no it's </garnt>
<garnt> not a wonderful time for me for me like </garnt>
<joey> if i just stay on wine and i just it i </joey>
<joey> don't mix drinks yeah wine hangovers are </joey>
<joey> the most bearable </joey>
<joey> like for me it's like beer is like </joey>
<joey> always worth stomachaches </joey>

<joey> life after a night of just drinking sake </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> sake is by far the worst is up there </garnt>
<joey> as well just above that is like all the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like spirits </joey>
<joey> they're really shitty tequila's what i </joey>
<joey> said tequila is the worst one yeah </joey>
<garnt> i would say tequila and sambuca are like </garnt>
<garnt> on that level right </garnt>
<connor> wait a minute i feel like like our </connor>
<connor> muslim fans that can't watch this </connor>
<joey> i wouldn't know i'll take your word for </joey>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> because like tequila and sambuca for me </joey>
<garnt> are like they're they're the student </garnt>
<garnt> shots they're they're what you get as a </garnt>
<connor> student because </connor>
<connor> who drinks that all night [ __ ] the </connor>
<connor> psychopaths drink sambuca what even is </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> exactly you don't know i don't even know </connor>
<connor> what's that it's that one drink that </connor>
<connor> your mate is like yeah let's get this </connor>
<connor> drink and then </connor>
<joey> you have it you're like like what is it </joey>
<garnt> it's it's like a licorice shirt it's </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it oh is it like like jaeger </joey>
<garnt> oh i was about okay go go just the same </garnt>
<joey> level </joey>
<joey> on the same level but like going above </joey>
<joey> that i would say is jaeger right because </joey>
<joey> they're all they're all like </joey>
<joey> they're all the shots where you know you </joey>
<joey> wake up and you </joey>
<joey> you can pinpoint the exact moment the </joey>
<joey> night went wrong </joey>
<joey> it was the exact moment someone ordered </joey>
<joey> like a round of jaeger shorts or around </joey>
<joey> sambuca shots or tequilas </joey>
<joey> for some reason melin [ __ ] loves </joey>
<joey> tequila </joey>
<joey> and i i will never understand that i </joey>
<joey> will literally never understand that </joey>
<joey> what about the taste it's good you don't </joey>
<garnt> like the taste </garnt>
<joey> there's other alcohol you can use a </joey>
<joey> concerning sentence </joey>
<garnt> no we don't because we can't relate </garnt>
<joey> because like it tastes like us </joey>
<joey> yeah and like the first i mean look the </joey>
<joey> only time where i was like okay tequila </joey>
<joey> is kind of fun it's like the first time </joey>
<joey> you do like a </joey>
<joey> you know like the with the whole salt </joey>
<joey> thing right yeah like that's like </joey>
<joey> because that's like </joey>
<joey> the whole </joey>
<joey> if you're like a student yeah which is </joey>
<joey> like when you start you know </joey>
<joey> trying all these drinks if you had some </joey>
<joey> kind of [ __ ] quick time event to it </joey>
<joey> drinking becomes like 10 times more fun </joey>
<joey> yeah you're a [ __ ] idiot yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> like there was a [ __ ] in in swansea when </joey>
<joey> i went to university there was this one </joey>
<joey> bar that would do these drinks with </joey>
<joey> sambuco where they would light it on </joey>
<joey> fire </joey>
<joey> yeah and then like put the like gas </joey>
<garnt> chamber yeah that's what it's called </garnt>
<garnt> which is not a very flattering name it's </garnt>
<connor> called a gas </connor>
<connor> chamber which is terrible yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> so they would do it for like one pound </connor>
<connor> 50 right which is like 2.50 i didn't </connor>
<connor> know it was legal in the uk </connor>
<connor> because i i don't know if it is but i </connor>
<connor> they served it because because the only </connor>
<connor> the only time i've been able to do that </connor>
<garnt> is not in the uk but it's when we go on </garnt>
<connor> like [ __ ] it might be illegal but you </connor>
<connor> know how the bars are in the uk </connor>
<garnt> sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you know you know on the bars you </garnt>
<garnt> know how some of the student bars are it </garnt>
<connor> feels like it's like world war three in </connor>
<connor> some of these parts yeah people are </connor>
<connor> throwing up everywhere they're serving </connor>
<connor> drinks people they shouldn't be </connor>
<connor> like yeah they would light the sambuca </connor>
<joey> on fire and put a gl wine glass over it </joey>
<joey> to extinguish the fire i've seen those </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and then they would put the </joey>
<joey> wine glass on the table really quickly </joey>
<joey> and then you would chop the thing and </joey>
<joey> then you'd have to breathe in the fumes </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> wine glass yeah yeah and it would go </joey>
<joey> straight to your head yeah like you know </joey>
<joey> i've done those before okay </joey>
<garnt> okay i've had sambuca yeah like you know </garnt>
<garnt> you know there are you know these like </garnt>
<joey> you know these like student shops don't </joey>
<joey> do it because like even </joey>
<joey> even with like tequila right you uh you </joey>
<joey> lick the salt </joey>
<joey> um do the tequila and do the lime right </joey>
<joey> yeah somehow like [ __ ] students have </joey>
<joey> found a way to make this like even more </joey>
<connor> messed up because you talk about the </connor>
<joey> kamikaze shot </joey>
<joey> did you call it the kamikaze the suicide </joey>
<joey> shot yes suicide or kamikaze </joey>
<joey> okay so instead of okay so the normal </joey>
<joey> sounds like a jackass stunt it is it </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] is so the normal </joey>
<joey> order you go in is that you lick the </joey>
<joey> salt you do the tequila shot and then </joey>
<joey> you </joey>
<joey> suck on the seminal line right you know </joey>
<connor> it makes it bearable so okay how about </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<joey> how about instead of licking the salt </joey>
<joey> you snort the snot </joey>
<connor> that sounds stupid and then you take the </connor>
<connor> shot and instead of sucking on the lime </connor>
<connor> you just </connor>
<connor> put it in your eyes yeah who the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> thought of this so </connor>
<connor> i'm thinking about a new challenge it's </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] yourself in public challenge </connor>
<connor> just shoot yourself on the train and </connor>
<joey> just see how long i had a friend of my </joey>
<joey> 18th birthday who did </joey>
<joey> that three times why because because </joey>
<joey> they were playing darts and he was like </joey>
<joey> he was so [ __ ] cocky about it he was </joey>

<connor> when you hear about this [ __ ] i'm like </connor>
<joey> why would you oh absolutely yeah </joey>
<garnt> we don't need courage this is this has </garnt>
<connor> always been a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] step who did like vodka shots </connor>
<connor> through their eyeball </connor>
<connor> oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just </connor>
<connor> like what's wrong with people </connor>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is that you have a </joey>
<joey> perfectly functioning mouth just use it </joey>
<garnt> like like i like for me i feel old </garnt>
<garnt> whenever you know </garnt>
<garnt> maybe i've always been old because like </garnt>

<joey> story like that i'm just like who the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] thinks this is cool </joey>
<joey> do you have brain damage it's like what </joey>
<joey> went on </joey>
<garnt> what went wrong in your life to think </garnt>
<garnt> that doing a vodka shot in your eye was </garnt>
<connor> badass right because this is why this is </connor>
<connor> the aspect i hated about being in </connor>
<connor> university is that like </connor>
<connor> they would be like yeah so you do the </connor>
<joey> vodka shot in your eye and i'm like why </joey>

<connor> [ __ ] 40s or 50s everyone's like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] investment banker or something </connor>
<connor> you know something like with a monocle </connor>
<connor> and top hat </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah that was base that's basically </connor>
<joey> like the main guy running the event is </joey>
<joey> like this really old french dude </joey>
<joey> who you could see in like a monaco on </joey>
<joey> top hat right </joey>
<joey> and uh i remember so i was with sydney </joey>
<joey> yeah and so he was you know it's like a </joey>
<joey> very intimate event </joey>
<joey> so he would go around asking people </joey>
<joey> what's what they do and of course when </joey>
<joey> when they go </joey>
<joey> they go to us we mention youtuber and </joey>
<joey> like obviously people perk the [ __ ] up </joey>
<joey> right right and of course he goes to </joey>
<joey> sydney and asks what she does </joey>
<joey> and sydney very just very tastefully </joey>
<joey> says that you know she does </joey>
<joey> videos about anime and manga and </joey>
<joey> japanese culture and then he asks her </joey>
<joey> for her youtube channel </joey>
<connor> and she gives it to him and then he goes </connor>
<connor> oh let me just search this up and i've </connor>
<connor> never seen like the life flash before </connor>
<connor> someone's eyes as fast as i've seen </connor>
<connor> like cindy go no no no no no don't don't </connor>
<connor> do that don't do that </connor>
<connor> but the best the best part was so </connor>
<connor> um so so at this one event you know it's </connor>
<connor> uh it's it's a room full of people there </connor>
<connor> very </connor>
<connor> very prim and proper yeah it's it's a </connor>
<connor> very i </connor>
<connor> would say it is a very posh room yeah of </connor>
<connor> course and so </connor>
<garnt> um we go up to have like i think like </garnt>
<garnt> our </garnt>
<garnt> third or fourth glass of wine that we're </garnt>
<garnt> trying and </garnt>
<garnt> so there's this word in french that </garnt>
<connor> means cheers </connor>
<connor> you say in english as well though do you </connor>
<garnt> say in the uk as well </garnt>
<garnt> okay so so what he uh so you know it's </garnt>
<joey> it's that joke </joey>
<joey> that the guy makes every single [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> time because it's like it's like a very </joey>
<joey> obvious joke right </joey>
<joey> so he goes okay everyone everyone say </joey>
<garnt> chinchin and then the entire room is </garnt>
<garnt> just silent </garnt>
<connor> except i just here next to me sydney go </connor>
<garnt> like it is not quiet at all she's burst </garnt>
<connor> out </connor>
<joey> and everyone starts laughing i remember </joey>
<connor> just sitting there like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm with those guys </connor>
<connor> oh my god to be fair it is pretty funny </connor>
<connor> yeah that you came to like chinchin yeah </connor>

<connor> you down a pint or something like </connor>
<connor> chinchin </connor>

<joey> thing i don't know people always said </joey>
<joey> that they say that in italy too don't </joey>
<connor> they </connor>

<connor> at the office this is never a good thing </connor>
<connor> what what the [ __ ] is going on here </connor>
<connor> right now </connor>
<connor> and she's just like yeah i have this </connor>
<connor> like ultrasound </connor>
<connor> thing that i want to put on your face or </connor>
<connor> something like it's for the baby is that </connor>
<connor> what it </connor>
<garnt> is yeah i guess so mainly do you want to </garnt>
<joey> explain what it was </joey>
<joey> it's like an ultrasound thing right no </joey>
<joey> it's like ultrasonic </joey>
<connor> warm vibration you're just putting </connor>
<garnt> you're just putting buzz words together </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> the only time you hear ultrasonic is in </joey>
<garnt> the sonic game </garnt>
<garnt> that is literally just a sponsorship </garnt>
<joey> script but yeah it's got ultrasonic </joey>
<garnt> buzzwords i have it right here it's a it </garnt>
<joey> is an evian </joey>
<garnt> facial sprain on your face no that's the </garnt>
<garnt> weight you'll find that's just that just </garnt>
<garnt> that's just to wet my face </garnt>
<joey> where so she so how much does this cost </joey>
<joey> how much does this cost me that looks </joey>
<joey> like a vibration that it does look like </joey>
<joey> a vibrator that does </joey>
<connor> how much does this cost i don't know i </connor>
<joey> got for free </joey>
<connor> from who i don't know who's who's giving </connor>
<garnt> out evian </garnt>
<garnt> costco costco i didn't even know they </garnt>
<garnt> had heavy in water spray before so yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> um so for some reason i just agreed to </garnt>
<joey> it and said yes </joey>
<joey> whatever do do whatever you need to do </joey>
<joey> mail in um and so </joey>
<connor> she puts this gel on my face yeah and </connor>
<joey> then starts rubbing </joey>
<connor> that first she sprays the evian </connor>
<joey> the evian facial spray which i think is </joey>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> water that she's telling me it's </connor>
<connor> literally </connor>
<connor> i think she just sprayed warts every and </connor>
<joey> water on my face </joey>
<joey> put a gel in it and just did a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> ultrasound on my face </joey>
<garnt> and apparently we are never getting a </garnt>
<connor> sponge </connor>
<joey> it's really just going back and forward </joey>
<joey> that's what it is </joey>
<joey> it's just it's literally that's all it's </joey>
<connor> doing how does that doing anything </connor>
<connor> maybe you </connor>
<garnt> it felt like she was going to like she </garnt>
<garnt> was like [ __ ] doing ultrasound on my </garnt>
<connor> face i want to start a business where </connor>
<connor> i just put my mouth against your cheek </connor>
<connor> and just scream and call it a therapy </connor>
<connor> the vibrations will heal any kind of </connor>
<joey> impurities </joey>
<joey> yeah so basically before we start </joey>
<joey> recording this episode </joey>
<joey> mailing was like i'm just going to do </joey>
<connor> half of god's face so that the boys can </connor>
<connor> see the </connor>
<connor> the magic and wonder of the before and </connor>
<connor> after um could not tell the difference </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> we're probably never going to get a </connor>
<joey> sponsor from evian but uh it looked the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] same </joey>
<garnt> like i don't know like can you tell the </garnt>
<joey> difference in my face from my usual </joey>
<joey> the left side of his face was just a </joey>
<joey> little bit more moist than the other </joey>
<joey> side </joey>
<joey> that's all it was like i don't know what </joey>
<joey> i don't know what this is supposed to do </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> does it though or or are you just late </joey>
<connor> tonight it's for gullible people who </connor>
<joey> want to believe there's a solution for </joey>
<connor> everything </connor>
<connor> and sometimes you're just ugly that's </connor>
<connor> like that's like that's how it is like </connor>
<connor> that happens </connor>
<joey> i gotta deal with that no amount of </joey>
<joey> everyone water spray everything wrong </joey>
<connor> it's gonna [ __ ] fix my problems you </connor>
<connor> know what i mean </connor>
<joey> like it's just [ __ ] that's the thing </joey>
<joey> if this truly fixed your ugliness like </joey>
<joey> no one would be ugly because everyone </joey>
<joey> would just buy these </joey>
<connor> i will now end world ugliness </connor>
<joey> industry out of business everyone is </joey>
<joey> going to be a model after we </joey>
<joey> bring out water spray to the scene </joey>
<connor> there's so much stuff like that where </connor>
<connor> i'm like i'm sure </connor>
<connor> it works as like 0.1 but how much is it </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> a negligible amount where you're like is </connor>
<connor> it worth my time you know </connor>
<connor> how how how good does it have to be </connor>
<connor> where i have to sit there and rub my </connor>
<connor> face and spray avion on it you know what </connor>
<connor> i mean </connor>
<connor> how good do the results have to be you </connor>
<joey> know there are just some things where </joey>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> i i get the intent as to why this was </joey>
<joey> invented yeah </joey>
<joey> but it's also like there are so many </joey>
<connor> other </connor>
<connor> alternatives that work just as well you </connor>
<connor> know probably a lot cheaper </connor>
<connor> yeah you know i mean like oh man look </connor>
<connor> like going back to the whole like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> amazon things you didn't you know you </connor>
<connor> need a thing right like that is a prime </connor>
<connor> example like that is just like </connor>
<connor> a bunch of people with like way too much </connor>
<joey> money who are just going on to amazon </joey>
<joey> buying all these [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like things like i remember it's just </joey>
<connor> sad because i mean it's just like they </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> they feed off the insecurities that </connor>
<connor> people have like those like </connor>
<connor> like they have those uh weight loss </connor>
<connor> bracelets have you seen those </connor>
<connor> what apparently just a bracelet that has </connor>
<joey> like magnets in it or something </joey>
<connor> oh yeah it makes you lose weight and the </connor>
<joey> the before and after pictures are </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] egregious you'll be like the </joey>
<joey> most obese person yeah and then </joey>
<joey> apparently because of this one bracelet </joey>
<joey> which they probably can't even get on </joey>
<joey> their hand how exaggerated this </joey>
<joey> starts off as a ring yeah it's like </joey>
<connor> apparently </connor>
<connor> this one magically makes you extremely </connor>
<connor> hot it doesn't address the problem with </connor>
<connor> that if you go from like 500 pounds to </connor>
<joey> 200 pounds </joey>
<connor> where's the skin gone yeah exactly what </connor>
<garnt> actually sucks back in </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] off what i love is when you </garnt>
<joey> see the before and after pic and it's so </joey>
<connor> obviously not the same person yeah i </connor>
<connor> love it </connor>
<connor> it's just like someone so morbidly obese </connor>
<garnt> that they think that because they now </garnt>
<garnt> have a six-pack he can't recognize that </garnt>
<garnt> it's just not the same </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] thing's totally off like the </connor>
<connor> belly button's totally different </connor>
<garnt> like that there's no hair like one okay </garnt>
<garnt> so one thing </garnt>
<garnt> one thing i i always find funny is like </garnt>
<garnt> why always in the before </garnt>
<joey> the before pick dude does like the </joey>
<joey> cameraman just say </joey>
<joey> look as depressed as you can yeah i just </joey>
<joey> just just like </joey>
<joey> it's like you're conscious like you're </joey>
<garnt> you're smiling why are you smiling this </garnt>
<garnt> is the </garnt>
<connor> before pic you know yeah yeah i mean in </connor>
<connor> the uk but they're just depressed in </connor>
<connor> both but i mean </connor>
<connor> it's just it's just it's like </connor>
<connor> subconscious right you see someone </connor>
<joey> smiling you you </joey>
<joey> your [ __ ] dumb monkey brains thing oh </joey>
<joey> good yeah yeah that's a that's a good </joey>
<joey> thing happened yeah good thing it could </joey>
<joey> happen thing here </joey>
<joey> i don't know i just i i get really sad </joey>
<connor> when i know that like clearly someone's </connor>
<connor> buying this stuff </connor>
<connor> and like the detox teases make you [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yourself like it's just like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yourself of course you're gonna </connor>
<connor> lose weight because you're [ __ ] out </connor>
<connor> all the stool that you have in there </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you know of course you're gonna lose </connor>
<connor> weight but it's just sad that people </connor>
<connor> like feel desperate enough and </connor>
<connor> they can't just like believe the fact </connor>
<connor> that it's like just eat less </connor>
<connor> yeah sometimes it's not that simple </connor>
<joey> though i know but that's the core of it </joey>
<connor> don't get cyberbully just turn off the </connor>
<garnt> pc but like that it sucks because </garnt>
<garnt> just don't get hungry </garnt>
<connor> but that's what it is the fundamental of </connor>
<connor> it is just like eat less </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] obviously there are exceptions and </connor>
<connor> then you know someone in the comments </connor>
<connor> being like i have ex con yeah okay </connor>
<connor> good but like a fundamental visit don't </connor>
<connor> buy this [ __ ] you know it's so yeah </connor>
<joey> but that's the thing it's like the </joey>
<joey> people who are buying into that kind of </joey>
<joey> stuff usually </joey>
<joey> or all yeah that's all it is like all </joey>
<joey> they need is just like a change of diet </joey>
<garnt> or just something </garnt>
<joey> so [ __ ] easy and yeah they're just </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> just don't be fast listen </connor>
<connor> listen i can vouch for the chicken and </connor>
<connor> broccoli diet </connor>
<connor> it works it works wonders the chicken </connor>
<connor> and broccoli diet is no joke i </connor>
<joey> it worked wonders for me you know a </joey>
<joey> simple payment of 6.99 </joey>
<connor> trade offer trade offer you get chicken </connor>
<joey> and broccoli you lose weight it's simple </joey>
<joey> as that literally </joey>
<joey> i get 79.99 you get chicken and broccoli </joey>
<connor> i need </connor>
<connor> a chicken and broccoli company team up </connor>
<garnt> with me i will show it dude </garnt>
<garnt> is there a chicken and broccoli there </garnt>
<garnt> actually is on ubereats around our area </garnt>
<joey> there is a yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> actually i actually ordered another </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] one it's pretty [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> there's literally a chicken and broccoli </joey>
<joey> chain that just delivers chicken </joey>
<connor> broccoli </connor>
<connor> this is how it works guys it's not fun </connor>
<connor> but weight loss isn't fun </connor>
<garnt> it's like it doesn't need to be i i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like i mean </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's sad that you know some </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes in like self-improvement </garnt>
<joey> a big factor in whether it's going to </joey>
<joey> succeed or not is if you're [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> enjoying yourself doing it yeah it's </joey>
<joey> it's unfortunate right but like </joey>
<joey> like like for me like for example going </joey>
<joey> to the gym </joey>
<joey> versus going to do like a sport or going </joey>
<joey> to do like a </joey>
<joey> like another active activity right </joey>
<joey> that's like doing that activity is way </joey>
<joey> more fun than spending </joey>
<joey> even like i could do three hours or </joey>
<joey> something of a sport </joey>
<garnt> versus 30 minutes on the treadmill and i </garnt>
<joey> choose like a three hour sport any time </joey>
<joey> but that's </joey>
<joey> but that's the thing like that's why i </joey>
<joey> think nintendo is like gigabrain when </joey>
<joey> they release ring fit </joey>
<joey> because that is literally the answer to </joey>
<joey> like you can lose weight and have fun </joey>
<connor> but </connor>
<connor> okay but this is the this is like i say </connor>
<joey> that having never played it </joey>
<connor> i play this has been sold out for a </connor>
<connor> while the </connor>
<connor> big problem that we have been like </connor>
<connor> believing for so long with weight loss </connor>
<connor> and this is like mainly </connor>
<connor> like i i know this is like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> history literally it's like okay okay </connor>
<joey> disclaimer none of us have weight loss </joey>
<connor> experts don't take our advice </connor>
<connor> but it's like you know the big companies </connor>
<connor> like coke mcdonald's and all them </connor>
<connor> they're like yeah dude you can drink as </connor>
<connor> much coconut you can eat as much </connor>
<joey> mcdonald's as you want all you have to </joey>
<connor> do is just exercise </connor>
<joey> it's not the food it's exercise and it's </joey>
<joey> like exercise doesn't really do that </joey>
<joey> much for weight loss no </joey>
<joey> it's like but what weight loss what i </joey>
<joey> find personally what exercise does do </joey>
<joey> is the day when i exercise i am like </joey>
<connor> vigilant about what i'm eating </connor>
<joey> i'm like yeah no no carbs here like no </joey>
<garnt> sugar </garnt>
<joey> for me for me the day when i exercise </joey>
<connor> for some reason i just take care of </connor>
<connor> yourself yeah i know </connor>
<joey> i actually crave healthy food right i </joey>
<connor> don't know what it is about </connor>
<connor> yeah but like if i get if i go to the </connor>
<connor> gym for an hour that day that day </connor>
<connor> afterwards i'm just like </connor>
<connor> man i'm kind of just craving a chicken </connor>
<connor> breast yeah like [ __ ] this pizza </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] the curry or whatever but like when </connor>
<joey> i'm just like being a couch potato just </joey>
<joey> like sitting there you wanna you know </joey>
<joey> you're just like yeah yeah i feel like </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] so i kind of just feel like i'm </garnt>
<joey> gonna eat [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> exercise yeah i feel like going to the </joey>
<joey> gym or like just exercising </joey>
<joey> in any way you can is like it's not so </joey>
<joey> much the act of losing it it's just like </joey>
<joey> the motivation yeah it's good for </joey>
<joey> obviously it helps you know general </joey>
<joey> fitness yeah yeah healthy and it's good </joey>
<joey> i'm not saying it's bad but like </joey>
<joey> i feel like we have definitely been like </joey>
<joey> it's not the cream </joey>
<joey> yeah we've also just been like told when </joey>
<joey> we were growing up right that if you </joey>
<joey> well if you eat 10 doughnuts just burn </joey>
<joey> off the calories and then boom no damage </joey>
<joey> that's not how it works 10 donuts 10 </joey>
<joey> kilometers on the treadmill it's like </joey>
<connor> that's </connor>
<connor> not how it works though unfortunately </connor>
<connor> the trade agreement </connor>
<joey> you lose you lose uh you know you </joey>
<joey> receive 10 doughnuts i received 10 </joey>
<connor> kilometers on the treadmill </connor>
<connor> like it sucks because it's like at the </connor>
<connor> end of the day it's it's you know </connor>
<connor> you could you could go in the gym and </connor>
<connor> distract yourself with it but it comes </connor>
<connor> to that moment when you're sitting on </connor>
<connor> the couch or you're wondering what to </connor>
<connor> eat and you've got to just </connor>
<connor> have the willpower to be like ah chicken </connor>
<connor> broccoli </connor>
<connor> fine fine yeah exactly you know it sucks </connor>
<garnt> because it's like not fun it is all diet </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i feel i feel like whenever </garnt>
<garnt> whenever you do any kind of </garnt>
<joey> self-improvement activity it's not the </joey>
<joey> days where you feel good </joey>
<connor> that's gonna define if you basically </connor>
<joey> succeed it's the days where you feel bad </joey>
<joey> and you're able to push yourself through </joey>
<joey> and i say this being like i've had </joey>
<joey> plenty of times </joey>
<joey> when i have failed because i felt bad </joey>
<joey> and i just didn't </joey>
<joey> just not that's not not even the </joey>
<joey> motivation to push myself through i just </joey>
<joey> didn't have the self-discipline because </joey>
<joey> i feel like </joey>
<joey> self-discipline is way more important </joey>
<connor> than motivation because there are going </connor>
<joey> to be some days </joey>
<connor> where you are just not motivated and </connor>
<connor> it's those days where you can push </connor>
<connor> through </connor>
<garnt> and i know plenty of people who have i'm </garnt>
<connor> not one of them unfortunately </connor>
<connor> but it's like as well i found that like </connor>
<joey> when i was it's easy to like </joey>
<joey> eat really healthy for like two weeks i </joey>
<joey> know not easy but it's doable right yes </joey>
<joey> but then it's like all right well if you </joey>
<joey> just go right back to doing what you're </joey>
<joey> doing it's like well nothing's changed </joey>
<joey> well that's what the bounce back happens </joey>
<joey> well i mean that's why like i </joey>
<joey> i was just like what can i cut out that </joey>
<joey> it's like i can i can keep out like </joey>
<connor> forever so </connor>
<connor> i don't drink like soft drinks ever yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i was like </joey>
<joey> the last like that [ __ ] yeah the last </joey>
<joey> like since juice probably the beginning </joey>
<connor> of quarantine </connor>
<connor> i've just made a conscious effort to not </connor>
<connor> drink any like fizzy drinks or anything </connor>
<connor> like that it's just cheese and [ __ ] like </connor>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> tea and water it's tea water coffee is </joey>
<garnt> all i'm [ __ ] drinking </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i i was lucky enough that </garnt>
<connor> i just never have craved </connor>
<connor> like soda or anything in my life i've </connor>
<connor> just always grown up on drinking water </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> it's kind of made me realize that man </connor>
<connor> the habits you the habits you had as a </connor>
<connor> kid </connor>
<connor> really just like it's it's so much with </connor>
<connor> you yeah they stick with you it's so </connor>
<connor> much easier to learn a habit once </connor>
<connor> than to unlearn it and to learn </connor>
<connor> something else and i feel like </connor>
<connor> so much of my life like if i could like </connor>
<connor> if i had a time machine if i could </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] e-second myself back </connor>
<connor> into like a younger body there's so many </connor>
<connor> things i would do to be like okay you </connor>
<garnt> learn this you learn this habit you </garnt>
<garnt> learn that habit so you don't have to </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] unlearn it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and like and like have like a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] year of your life being like </garnt>
<garnt> well i have this shitty habit that i </garnt>
<garnt> just had as a kid and </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of [ __ ] me over and i want </garnt>
<garnt> to i want to try and do something else </garnt>
<garnt> but </garnt>
<garnt> god damn this pizza feels so [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> good right now </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like it's not even like i </joey>
<joey> don't even eat that [ __ ] anymore i most </joey>
<joey> certainly do </joey>
<joey> yeah i kind of like trying to balance it </joey>
<joey> out how much i do eat and uh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's not like an everyday thing </joey>
<joey> right yeah i hate talking about the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> online because everyone's just a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> expert about it like in the comments no </joey>
<joey> doubt they'll be like 10 people would be </joey>
<joey> like i'm a nutritionist expert i'm here </joey>
<joey> to tell you that you're totally wrong </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> um because because everyone's got their </joey>
<joey> own opinion because er most people have </joey>
<connor> gone through it the experience have seen </connor>
<joey> what's worked for them and so yeah but </joey>
<joey> that's the thing it's what's worked for </joey>
<joey> them </joey>
<joey> right and that doesn't mean it works </joey>
<joey> fairly as long as you do it helpfully </joey>
<joey> you know you're not starving yourself </joey>
<connor> like you see some people like yeah i </connor>
<connor> lost 10 kilograms in a weekend it's like </connor>
<connor> that sounds like a terrible idea </connor>
<joey> what did you do that sounds like it must </joey>
<joey> have been some painful shits </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i feel like it's i think </garnt>
<connor> one </connor>
<connor> important thing is that just because </connor>
<connor> something worked for someone doesn't </connor>
<joey> mean it </joey>
<connor> doesn't necessarily mean it's going to </connor>
<connor> happen with something else and it's it's </connor>
<joey> really like uh </joey>
<joey> what i found is it's really a trial and </joey>
<connor> you know what was it like </connor>
<connor> an hour trial and trial and error </connor>
<garnt> you either lose weight or you die i used </garnt>
<connor> to be like [ __ ] paranoid about like </connor>
<connor> well what's in this thing but i just </connor>
<connor> started thinking like if i just </connor>
<connor> eat a reasonable amount of things yeah </connor>
<connor> and exercise </connor>
<connor> i think i'll be all right yeah and that </connor>
<connor> kind of worked </connor>
<connor> i was like carbs i eat a lot of carbs </connor>
<connor> but like i just eat them within reason </connor>
<connor> like i </connor>
<connor> like my meals are never too big like i </connor>
<connor> feel like i ate a fair amount of food </connor>
<connor> like i </connor>
<connor> i feel like the one when i stopped </connor>
<connor> giving a [ __ ] about calories and stuff </connor>
<connor> like that and just thinking like </connor>
<connor> is this portion stupid yeah yeah is this </connor>
<connor> a whole large domino's pizza do i should </connor>
<connor> i eat this probably not </connor>
<connor> so i'm probably not gonna do it like but </connor>
<connor> i i feel like another thing </connor>
<connor> is that i don't know maybe it's just me </connor>
<joey> but i think i just enjoy food </joey>
<joey> too much all right what's the problem </joey>
<joey> that's that's the problem </joey>
<joey> it's not like i enjoy eating a lot of </joey>
<connor> food right but we talked about it </connor>
<connor> i do yeah i mean we talked about </connor>
<connor> enjoying the little things in life </connor>
<connor> every now and again and for me like my </connor>
<garnt> day </garnt>
<garnt> is like 70 worse if i know i don't have </garnt>
<connor> a good meal to look forward to </connor>
<garnt> this is why i've just become an ubereat </garnt>
<connor> slave at this point like i </connor>
<joey> every day i order from it now it's </joey>
<joey> terrible it's like but especially </joey>
<joey> because like japan is just you know the </joey>
<joey> land of [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> great food everywhere like food's become </connor>
<connor> a hobby at this point yeah </connor>
<connor> oh it is just like if i don't have a </connor>
<joey> good meal yeah that's like </joey>

<connor> it's going to be [ __ ] magical </connor>
<connor> so i order it you know it takes a little </connor>
<connor> while not like crazy amount and then so </connor>
<connor> it gets here </connor>

<connor> because in japan when you tell them to </connor>
<joey> make it like 10 or max they just </joey>
<joey> they don't do it yeah and the first time </joey>
<joey> we went the first few times he </joey>
<connor> the person who was cooking it's always </connor>
<joey> the same guy he didn't actually make it </joey>
<joey> that spicy like it was just kind of like </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> it was definitely japan standing yeah </joey>
<joey> like it was very it was like on the high </joey>
<joey> end for japan standard yeah i'd say yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and then one time for some reason i </joey>
<joey> don't know why we went well he decided </joey>
<joey> this time he was like </joey>
<joey> fine i'm not playing he's like fine i'm </joey>
<joey> not playing anymore </joey>
<joey> and holy [ __ ] this is hard </joey>
<connor> to like yeah i was like i got like </connor>
<connor> halfway through this and i was like i'm </connor>
<connor> actually in like </connor>
<connor> severe pain yeah like this is actually </connor>
<connor> brutal i like </connor>
<connor> god couldn't finish it wow yeah </connor>
<connor> because it was i yeah i think it was the </connor>
<connor> one week where you had to go home early </connor>
<connor> yeah so </connor>
<connor> we were in this indian place yeah he was </connor>
<connor> not playing around </connor>
<connor> and i think i think i could see him like </connor>
<joey> in the corner of my eyes like he was </joey>
<connor> like watching us </connor>
<joey> because because we've been there so many </joey>
<joey> times we order the same </joey>
<joey> the same meal every time we order like </joey>
<joey> the most spicy option </joey>
<connor> and it's just like yeah we we it's spicy </connor>
<garnt> but it's not like it's it's </garnt>
<joey> like it's it's like it's a nice tingle </joey>
<joey> on your tongue what if he was like all </joey>
<joey> right the [ __ ] boy is gone </joey>
<garnt> i'm gonna give you guys the real [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> now but it is it was by far the spiciest </connor>
<connor> meal i've had </connor>
<connor> in japan i could not finish it because </connor>
<garnt> it got to the point where </garnt>
<garnt> it was just yeah well that's got numb </garnt>
<joey> about it </joey>
<joey> like the last time it was just like i </joey>
<connor> was enjoyable about that though i don't </connor>
<connor> care i don't know what it is because </connor>
<connor> like the flavors get like enhanced </connor>
<connor> by like being just beautiful no i get </connor>
<joey> that to a certain extent </joey>
<joey> but the level you guys have it is just </joey>
<joey> like i don't even know what flavor is </joey>
<garnt> anymore yeah i mean i feel like it </garnt>
<garnt> depends on the dish right because </garnt>
<garnt> i mean you can go to like coco ichiman </garnt>
<garnt> and um so </garnt>
<garnt> to explain have we have we talked about </garnt>
<joey> that before glacier is like a japanese </joey>
<garnt> curry </garnt>
<garnt> they have it in america oh yeah they do </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and so you can go to this </garnt>
<garnt> curry chain in japan and they have like </garnt>
<garnt> a spice scale </garnt>
<garnt> from one to ten and like ten is the most </garnt>
<connor> spiciest and i've had the ten before and </connor>
<connor> so is connor </connor>
<connor> and for me it was it was actually like </connor>
<connor> really spicy </connor>
<connor> but it just it felt like no however it </connor>
<connor> just felt like </connor>
<joey> you're adding spice for the sake of </joey>
<joey> adding spice right right </joey>
<garnt> there are some dishes that i feel um </garnt>
<joey> are designed to be spicy it's not like </joey>
<joey> flavor enhanced spice right yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's just spice for the sake of </garnt>
<joey> spicy like to me </joey>
<joey> like a mild curry a mild japanese curry </joey>
<joey> at least is </joey>
<joey> as good if not better than some of the </joey>
<joey> spicier versions but </joey>
<connor> there are some like thai dishes and </connor>
<connor> indian dishes and southeast asian dishes </connor>
<connor> where i feel </connor>
<connor> if you don't have enough spice to it </connor>
<connor> there's missing there's missing a </connor>
<connor> certain kick </connor>
<connor> yeah and also just a lot of endorphins </connor>
<joey> from the pain no i get nothing </joey>
<joey> i'm just like i'm constantly changing i </joey>
<joey> get i get the i get the fact of like you </joey>
<connor> know the spice enhances the flavor and </connor>
<connor> stuff like that because you know i've </connor>
<joey> had my fish over southeast asian food </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that which is quite spicy </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like oh this is hard to eat </joey>
<joey> but god damn like this probably tastes </joey>
<joey> way better than without the spice </joey>
<joey> and then there's your guys see the </joey>
<connor> reason why i got into spicy food </connor>
<joey> because again i have to bear my my </joey>
<joey> parents feel like paprika was spicy so </joey>
<joey> yeah when i was growing up i didn't </joey>
<joey> really eat spicy food but i just when i </joey>
<connor> started doing youtube i started doing </connor>
<connor> the like [ __ ] stupid pepper challenge </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and then i've done it so many </connor>
<connor> times where i was like i could handle </connor>
<connor> the carolina reaper like </connor>
<connor> semi-comfortably right and i was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] spicy food isn't spicy anymore </connor>
<connor> because i've just been eating these </connor>
<connor> peppers raw [ __ ] youtube challenges </connor>
<connor> and twitch live streams </connor>
<joey> so i got to the point where i was like </joey>
<joey> oh god this is like really good now like </joey>
<joey> i really like it yeah like habaneros on </joey>
<connor> stuff is like perfect </connor>
<joey> no i see because like i love that when </joey>
<connor> we're talking about like kokoichi levels </connor>
<connor> of space right because that's the </connor>
<connor> easiest gauge </connor>
<joey> when you're in japan right it's like </joey>
<connor> what level of calculation can you do </connor>
<joey> you immediately know like i used i can </joey>
<joey> now do level three </joey>
<joey> right but before like couple of years </joey>
<connor> ago i couldn't even do level one </connor>
<connor> that was back from joe's wearing a </connor>
<joey> diaper that's when i was back when i was </joey>
<joey> wearing a diaper that's when i was a </joey>
<connor> true [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like you need something you need at </connor>
<joey> least like a two yeah </joey>
<joey> right but i mean you guys can say that </joey>
<joey> because you're useless because you've </joey>
<garnt> been eating it you know yeah but like </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i mean i feel like even some </garnt>
<garnt> foods where there's an option to pick a </garnt>
<garnt> spicy </garnt>
<garnt> version i don't always pick the spicy </garnt>
<garnt> version it very much depends on the dish </garnt>
<garnt> and whether it </garnt>
<joey> complements it or not right right i mean </joey>
<joey> like you know now i could do a level </joey>
<joey> three and now </joey>
<joey> i understand like oh you know this is </joey>
<joey> actually so much better with spice yeah </joey>
<joey> to a certain degree but like </joey>
<joey> i had to kind of slowly trick my brain </joey>
<joey> into thinking that right because </joey>
<joey> if you had given me a level three spicy </joey>
<joey> kokuichi like two years ago </joey>
<joey> yeah i would have been like what is this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like this isn't enjoyable at all </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i seek enjoyment out of my meal and this </garnt>
<garnt> is not enjoyable i mean i'm in severe </garnt>
<garnt> pain </garnt>
<garnt> but now i've like slowly started to </garnt>
<joey> appreciate the pain </joey>
<garnt> yeah right joey says getting a level </garnt>
<joey> three yeah </joey>
<joey> i say like getting a level three i'm not </joey>
<garnt> feeling those endorphins now that's like </garnt>
<garnt> honestly like to me </garnt>
<joey> like that's [ __ ] painful but like </joey>
<garnt> it's good painful </garnt>
<joey> right and like now i'm finally starting </joey>
<joey> to understand i'm like oh okay </joey>
<joey> these like other friends i knew who </joey>
<joey> could eat like level seven and eights </joey>
<joey> who i just thought were like </joey>
<connor> absolutely [ __ ] maniacs just like the </connor>
<connor> noob anime character yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> it's like i kind of get it now after </joey>
<joey> after my training arc i'm slowly </joey>
<garnt> starting to get it </garnt>

<joey> well it's really weird right because </joey>
<joey> like you know obviously </joey>
<joey> you grew up in a thai household eating </joey>
<joey> spice food all your life right yeah </joey>
<joey> and you'd think i would be the same </joey>
<connor> because like my dad [ __ ] loves spicy </connor>
<connor> food like you know like the death source </connor>
<connor> that they sell here </connor>
<connor> my dad would just put that in meals </connor>
<connor> right like yeah but to me i was like why </connor>
<connor> are you putting cyanide in a perfectly </connor>
<connor> nice </connor>
<connor> why would you poison this meal like this </connor>
<joey> because then he would </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] serve it up to the family oh my </joey>
<connor> god and we would have to eat it that </connor>
<joey> reminds me my uh my older brother </joey>
<joey> he was growing uh carolina reapers yeah </joey>
<connor> and um why </connor>
<connor> yeah that's a good question because he </connor>
<connor> won he liked spicy food but yeah </connor>
<joey> um one time this was right before i </joey>
<joey> moved to japan </joey>
<joey> he he gave them to my parents and you </joey>
<joey> told them that they were like normal </joey>
<joey> peppers </joey>
<joey> oh wait why would you do that that is </joey>
<connor> true </connor>
<connor> they're like what happened that's a true </connor>
<connor> crime story yeah yeah so what happened </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> that they were like oh yeah they were </connor>
<connor> saying like oh brett's been growing some </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<connor> some peppers and he's he's given us some </connor>
<connor> right so i'm gonna put them in the stir </connor>
<connor> fry tonight and i think oh okay sure </connor>
<joey> i didn't know yeah that they were they </joey>
<joey> were carolina </joey>
<joey> or ghost peppers one of the other i mean </joey>
<joey> they're both [ __ ] they're both </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] hot yeah </joey>
<joey> bear am i my parents do believe that </joey>
<connor> paprika is spicy i'm not joking </connor>
<connor> they'll probably my dad watches the </connor>
<connor> podcast he'll be he'll be like you're </connor>
<connor> lying connor but </connor>
<connor> yeah um and so they made me it's the way </connor>
<joey> they did the stir fry is they make it </joey>
<joey> and they give it to me first and then </joey>
<joey> they </joey>
<joey> they make it for my dad and my mom makes </joey>
<joey> it for herself last and it's like this </joey>
<joey> is like five minutes in between </joey>
<joey> so i'm i'm eating this stir-fry and i'm </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i'm getting kind of like i'm like </connor>
<connor> this kind of what this hurts and i'm </connor>
<connor> thinking like oh wow </connor>
<connor> my what purpose did you use </connor>
<connor> he's like oh ah this is your brother he </connor>
<connor> grew them and gave them to us and i'm </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> did he say what kind of peppers they </connor>
<connor> were so no no he just said he grew them </connor>
<connor> and i'm like </connor>
<connor> look a little kick to them </connor>
<connor> my parents didn't know they thought they </connor>
<joey> were like the like the numbers did your </joey>
<joey> parents eat them </joey>
<connor> yeah so so what happened next is that uh </connor>
<connor> you know i want them i was like i was </connor>
<connor> like i really think i'm like i'm like </connor>
<connor> bear in mind i'm like </connor>
<connor> i'm like really think that you should </connor>
<connor> like go easy on the peppers on yours if </connor>
<connor> you can like </connor>
<connor> get them out a little bit i think you </connor>
<connor> should do that like no no it's fine </connor>
<garnt> we've had it before we've had these </garnt>
<connor> peppers </connor>
<garnt> pictures taken before disaster but at </garnt>
<connor> that point i was like you know what </connor>
<joey> fine let's just see what happens let's </joey>
<connor> just see what happens </connor>
<connor> let's see how this unfolds i'm there </connor>
<connor> like literally like that that meme of </connor>
<joey> that kid at the </joey>
<joey> the vein on his forehead yeah just </joey>
<joey> eating these peppers trying to keep a </joey>
<joey> straight face like </joey>
<joey> i'm not my daddy he's he's about to eat </joey>
<joey> it he takes one spoonful and he's like </joey>
<connor> yeah wow that's really </connor>
<joey> that's really spicy </joey>
<connor> and he just like started like crying </connor>
<connor> i thought it was so funny and my mom </connor>
<connor> thought he was over exaggerating </connor>
<connor> so my mom was like i'll try it too oh my </connor>
<connor> god </connor>
<connor> and my mom starts doing the exact same </connor>
<connor> thing she starts [ __ ] her car </connor>
<connor> after like one bite they just couldn't </connor>
<connor> finish it they just started drinking </connor>
<connor> milk for like 20 minutes </connor>
<connor> they were just dying it was the funniest </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i don't know </connor>
<joey> i mean if i was your parents i'd take </joey>
<joey> one look at you you'll be like oh he's </joey>
<joey> probably not making this [ __ ] up well </joey>
<connor> they </connor>
<joey> don't i thought they thought i was </joey>
<joey> exaggerating with how much i could feel </joey>
<joey> and i was texting my brother while after </joey>
<joey> i had a bite i was like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> are these peppers these are </joey>
<connor> what peppers are these these and what </connor>
<connor> are these habaneros ghost peppers </connor>
<connor> carolina reaper they're like why would </connor>
<connor> you give them to my parents you know </connor>
<connor> they can't eat these </connor>
<joey> it's just bad isn't it </joey>
<joey> mom and dad your parents trust you they </joey>
<joey> they are so much i think from that point </joey>
<connor> onwards they just never accepted any </connor>
<connor> peppers </connor>
<joey> because i saw them and i thought oh god </joey>
<joey> they look like they look like ghost </joey>
<joey> peppers </joey>
<joey> some interesting shaped peppers look </joey>
<joey> like this they store the thin green ones </joey>
<joey> they look like the the big </joey>
<connor> plump like the shriveled like ones like </connor>
<joey> like satan's toe </joey>
<joey> yeah it looks like the spiciest thing </joey>
<connor> you've had uh </connor>
<connor> i'd probably say habanero </connor>
<joey> really yeah i mean i mean other than the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] like </connor>
<joey> uh death source that like you know wait </joey>
<connor> have you ever eaten like a carolina </connor>
<connor> reaper or </connor>
<joey> like a like a ghost pepper why would i </joey>
<connor> do that oh my god we need to do that no </connor>
<connor> youtube challenge </connor>
<connor> why would i do that because it'd be fun </connor>
<connor> no it's no it won't for you </connor>
<connor> just build up your tolerance for you </connor>
<joey> guys it would be it's not that bad </joey>
<connor> people on youtube just </connor>
<garnt> lit trial by fire </garnt>
<connor> why did i teach them that phrase you </connor>
<joey> know people on youtube when i watched it </joey>
<joey> because i think i first saw rhett and </joey>
<joey> link do it yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah 2012 and they were like </joey>
<connor> it's not that bad it's just like it is </connor>
<connor> just discomfort it's yeah </connor>
<joey> it's why would i willingly put myself </joey>
<joey> into discomfort which makes great </joey>
<joey> content </joey>
<joey> yeah [ __ ] you got me there </joey>
<connor> who doesn't love killing themselves for </connor>
<joey> content like monster ramen wanker </joey>

<joey> carolina reaper </joey>
<joey> dude that's going to be the hardest run </joey>
<joey> to a w in my existence yeah </joey>
<joey> right and then if it's one of us we have </joey>
<connor> to eat three </connor>
<joey> so what's the eating so i'm eating one </joey>
<connor> either way yeah of course </connor>
<connor> if like let's say you win me and gonna </connor>

<connor> on those individuals like mesh with your </connor>
<connor> head it does it does like i remember </connor>
<connor> like the first time i like the first </connor>
<connor> time i had i probably had like a ghost </connor>
<joey> pepper or trinidad tobago like carolina </joey>
<joey> reaper the </joey>
<joey> the spice high i thought i'd heard about </joey>
<joey> it before yeah but i didn't realize it </joey>
<joey> was literally </joey>
<joey> like getting high yeah and you feel the </joey>
<joey> after effects </joey>
<connor> um for like hours afterwards because you </connor>
<connor> feel you feel this like </connor>
<connor> warm tingly glow yeah you just feel like </connor>
<garnt> you did something nice and you're like </garnt>
<connor> oh what's what's </connor>
<connor> like when the initial 20 minutes of pain </connor>
<joey> is over it's just like it's pretty nice </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean i i quite kind of looks very </joey>
<joey> uh unimpressed </joey>
<joey> unconvinced i mean i mean look it is </joey>
<joey> great i mean i've had the the death </joey>
<garnt> source that they sell here which is </garnt>
<garnt> technically ghost pepper </garnt>
<joey> sauce but like it's yeah but that's the </joey>
<joey> thing right it's like if we're talking </joey>
<joey> like just raw peppers like i've only </joey>
<garnt> done habanero </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i think the spiciest thing </garnt>
<garnt> like singular thing i've ever had </garnt>
<connor> uh was back in university where it was </connor>
<connor> like it wasn't even like a ghost pepper </connor>
<joey> it was a ghost pepper </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<connor> exactly it was just like the pure </connor>
<connor> extract and i never like at this point </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> i'd obviously like still grown up in </connor>
<connor> spicy food but i've nev i'd never had </connor>
<connor> like a ghost pepper or like an actual </connor>
<connor> one of the famous hot peppers that </connor>
<connor> people do youtube challenges over </connor>
<connor> uh about so um i remember this uh we </connor>
<joey> were drinking and my mate </joey>

<garnt> where we </garnt>
<garnt> we were like tipsy enough to start you </garnt>
<garnt> know contemplating doing stupid [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> and of course you know you know you know </garnt>
<connor> you know he's gonna commit credit card </connor>
<garnt> forward yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know he's an experienced friend </garnt>

<garnt> right time of the night where everyone's </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's intoxicated enough to like </garnt>
<garnt> think that it's a good idea </garnt>
<connor> what a horrible friend yeah just waiting </connor>
<connor> till everyone is just </connor>
<connor> semi-stupid start feeding them poison </connor>
<connor> exactly so he brings out this extract </connor>
<connor> and he's like yo </connor>

<connor> my my body went into like fight or </connor>
<connor> flight mode immediately </connor>
<connor> like i was fine i took it and then like </connor>
<connor> five seconds later i swear i was in the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] fetal position just like </connor>

<garnt> someone who can't handle my spice i </garnt>
<connor> literally um it was nice taken don't </connor>
<connor> worry </connor>
<connor> what happened is i was i was out of </connor>
<connor> commission for the entire night right </connor>
<connor> because it was so spicy that it just </connor>
<connor> induced my gag reflex </connor>
<connor> so i was i was like i was on the toilet </connor>
<connor> i was like in the bathroom for like a </connor>
<connor> good three hours just like </connor>
<connor> gagging on on the toilet couldn't throw </connor>
<connor> up it was just like my gag reflex just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> my body trying to throw up this thing </connor>
<garnt> that was like one one little drop so </garnt>
<connor> like there was nothing to throw up it </connor>
<garnt> was like a drop </garnt>
<garnt> right but it it had induced this gag </garnt>
<garnt> reflex and i was on the toilet for about </garnt>
<garnt> three hours </garnt>
<garnt> and uh my you know my my university </garnt>
<connor> mates being the good mates that they </connor>
<connor> were </connor>
<garnt> they just just they just kind of went </garnt>
<connor> clubbing and just left </connor>
<connor> you while you're on the toilet fantastic </connor>
<connor> mates well what a fantastic group of </connor>
<connor> mates well that's </connor>
<connor> i mean that's why i'm not friends with </connor>
<connor> them anymore </connor>
<connor> long story short i'm not in contact with </connor>
<garnt> any of my unimates anymore but uh </garnt>
<connor> i'm not in contact with many either yeah </connor>
<garnt> they didn't poison me yeah exactly they </garnt>
<joey> were nice to me </joey>
<joey> maybe what if it was all a ruse guard </joey>
<connor> where they all agreed to </connor>
<connor> take small amounts of this just so that </connor>
<connor> god would step up to the plate </connor>
<joey> let me show you yeah they were all like </joey>
<joey> oh we want to go clubbing but we don't </joey>
<joey> want to take guns </joey>
<joey> how can we how do we knock him out let's </joey>
<joey> get him out of commission yeah i know a </joey>
<connor> way i know a way that got to fall for it </connor>
<garnt> that's about that i think that's what </garnt>
<garnt> they did maybe the spice challenge but </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's uh </garnt>
<connor> like i i i think i've read that no one </connor>
<connor> has ever died from spice before or like </connor>
<connor> you can go into shock though </connor>
<connor> yeah i think so yeah i i don't know i </connor>
<garnt> don't know melon look it up has anyone </garnt>
<garnt> ever died from spice </garnt>
<connor> yeah they can go so you can't die from </connor>
<garnt> the chemical itself but you can die from </garnt>
<joey> shock you can die from the pain </joey>
<joey> it induces yeah yeah yeah yeah you can </joey>
<connor> get like cardiac arrest </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah but it's always fun yeah </garnt>
<garnt> basically basically just don't just </garnt>
<garnt> don't do something </garnt>
<connor> don't go into cardiac arrest </connor>
<garnt> doctors hate </garnt>
<garnt> ghost pepper extract or any kind of </garnt>
<connor> extract you know i wasn't going to </connor>
<connor> yeah and i think i'm still not going to </connor>
<garnt> yeah i think that's </garnt>
<garnt> right i'm good </garnt>
<connor> it was just like that scene from [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> pulp fiction right i just </connor>
<connor> i'm just passed down they have to forget </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] needle and inject it </garnt>
<connor> straight into my heart </connor>
<joey> oh my god oh god oh my god yeah so i'm </joey>
<connor> just gonna take it one step at a time </connor>
<joey> when it comes to spice like </joey>
<connor> i'm doing a pretty good job going up the </connor>
<connor> ladder i feel like yeah </connor>
<connor> just wondering about cpr i just like it </connor>
<joey> sorry because just </joey>
<joey> talking about moving my chest yeah i </joey>
<connor> feel like i'm too british to do cpr </connor>
<joey> i feel like i'd be like are you okay are </joey>
<connor> you okay is this is that too much it's </connor>
<connor> too much pressure </connor>
<connor> while i'm trying to save their life i'm </connor>
<garnt> like what is that do you know do you </garnt>
<garnt> know how to do cpr yeah so i was a </garnt>
<joey> lifeguard so we </joey>
<garnt> had to do it oh yeah that's right yeah </garnt>
<joey> luckily i always i always stop those </joey>
<joey> little [ __ ] before they </joey>
<joey> stop breathing did you did you ever have </joey>
<joey> to like do it no god no no you don't </joey>
<connor> you you'd know which kids were going to </connor>
<joey> drown right before they walked in </joey>
<joey> 100 wow i wish i was joking how do you </joey>
<joey> know okay </joey>
<connor> i might as well just tell stories about </connor>
<connor> being lifeguards there's just so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> so many yeah so </connor>
<connor> uh basically whilst i was working on </connor>
<connor> mcdonald's uh i want to be a lifeguard </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> well i could swim um good start i was a </connor>
<connor> really strong swimmer and </connor>
<connor> there was a course that i did that took </connor>
<connor> about a week um </connor>
<connor> and it was really really weird have to </connor>
<connor> do because i had to sacrifice a week of </connor>
<connor> school vacation </connor>
<joey> so i only had one week and i spent it </joey>
<joey> learning how to be a lifeguard i paid </joey>
<joey> like 400 bucks </joey>
<joey> and then i couldn't get a job for like a </joey>
<joey> year and a half because they were all </joey>
<joey> like yeah you don't have experience </joey>
<joey> cause i was like 17. right that catch </joey>
<joey> 22. yeah right </joey>
<joey> no they didn't hire me but eventually um </joey>
<joey> because it paid really well at the time </joey>
<connor> mcdonald's paid me four pounds 10 an </connor>
<connor> hour which is this much in dollars and </connor>
<connor> uh the lifeguarding paid nine pounds 10 </connor>
<connor> an hour oh wow which </connor>
<garnt> at the time that was that's that's a </garnt>
<connor> minted job bro </connor>
<connor> it was yeah but yes the thing was you </connor>
<joey> had to you had to have a week of </joey>
<joey> training you'd pay for it </joey>
<joey> that's a double shift at mcdonald's </joey>
<joey> right yeah and you know it was it's </joey>
<joey> on paper it looks like an easy ass job </joey>
<joey> because all you have to do is sit there </joey>
<joey> for 30 minutes and you get a 20 minute </joey>
<joey> break </joey>
<joey> then you sit there for 30 minutes you </joey>
<joey> have 20 minute break and that was it </joey>
<joey> basically </joey>
<joey> yeah um but when you're new they put you </joey>
<joey> on the at least minded they put me on </joey>
<connor> the shift </connor>
<connor> where it was uh kids birthday parties </connor>
<connor> and like because my mum swam at that </connor>
<connor> pool and they never put me on the shift </connor>
<connor> with the old people because all people </connor>
<connor> don't drown </connor>
<joey> old people no because they know their </joey>
<joey> limits yeah because they all go to the </joey>
<joey> swimming club </joey>
<joey> all the time and you know it's you know </joey>
<joey> they're not they're not going to and </joey>
<joey> apart from like freak accidents which </joey>
<joey> never happened and like people don't </joey>
<joey> drown in pools in the uk </joey>
<joey> the the year that i became a lifeguard </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> zero people died from pools in the uk </joey>
<joey> that's good </joey>
<connor> so this doesn't happen why are you </connor>
<connor> laughing about it until i started the </connor>
<connor> job </connor>
<connor> but like okay so have you ever seen </connor>
<connor> those </connor>
<joey> floats that take up all the pool oh like </joey>
<joey> all the lanes and stuff or </joey>
<connor> the whole pool it's like a big </connor>
<connor> inflatable i've never seen it </connor>
<connor> i've seen them you've never seen these </connor>
<connor> you've seen these mainly </connor>
<connor> you ever seen these google it like it's </connor>
<connor> like a picture on screen literally </connor>
<connor> they're these </connor>
<joey> massive kind of like total wipeout s </joey>
<joey> courses right that you can inflate </joey>
<joey> and they take up the whole pool and if </joey>
<joey> you fall off you fall in the water oh </joey>
<joey> that's kind of funny </joey>
<joey> when i was a kid i i loved the kid </joey>
<joey> sounds like a trash day special waiting </joey>
<joey> to happen isn't it it's like yeah i </joey>
<joey> imagine like a bouncy house </joey>
<connor> on water that sounds fun as [ __ ] no dude </connor>
<connor> it is it's literally house imagine a </connor>
<connor> total wipeout obstacle course on water </connor>
<connor> dude it's bad it's dude when i was 12 i </connor>
<connor> love this [ __ ] can we do that </connor>
<joey> dude yeah </joey>
<connor> so like you could um basically for kids </connor>
<joey> birthday parties uh there'd be like a </joey>
<joey> five or six year old who would rent it </joey>
<joey> out now yeah </joey>
<joey> problem is with kids birthday parties is </joey>
<joey> that not every parent thinks that kids </joey>
<joey> need to be taught how to swim </joey>
<joey> right right i think because parents </joey>
<joey> forget that kids need to be taught how </joey>
<joey> to swim yeah yeah because you just take </joey>
<joey> it for granted </joey>
<joey> so what ends up happening is obviously </joey>
<joey> it's a birthday party everyone invites </joey>
<joey> their whole class </joey>
<joey> now half the kids in the class don't </joey>
<joey> know how to swim yeah but they still </joey>
<joey> are invited and go anyway yeah so you </joey>
<joey> know what </joey>
<joey> i'd be sitting there on my my thing and </joey>
<connor> i can tell immediately which one of </connor>
<joey> these kids can't swim yeah they look </joey>
<joey> like that jerry </joey>
<joey> what the hell yeah so they'd be like uh </joey>
<joey> it'd be like a </joey>
<joey> climbing thing and then you have to go </joey>
<joey> through pylons as a slide yeah </joey>
<joey> now you could tell immediately when you </joey>
<joey> look at these kids which couldn't swim </joey>
<joey> they just had a look in their eyes where </joey>
<joey> they were like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i've never been in this before what do i </joey>
<joey> do and that's a big </joey>
<joey> like thing of water because they're also </joey>
<garnt> you know kids are like that thing where </garnt>
<garnt> like most kids </garnt>
<garnt> have like a built-in like danger system </garnt>
<garnt> yeah with their life </garnt>
<joey> yeah like it's like heights right kids </joey>
<joey> know that they're scared of heights </joey>
<joey> kids know that water is like weird and </joey>
<joey> scary yeah and then the kids that run in </joey>
<joey> it right away </joey>
<joey> and normally like they can swim yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but so you'd be what you'd be </joey>
<joey> doing this thing right and there'd be </joey>
<joey> kids </joey>
<joey> and then you'd see this kid like you </joey>
<joey> just tell again you can tell he looks </joey>
<joey> he doesn't look confident right his </joey>
<joey> technique's poor you know </joey>
<joey> looking at the water really scared like </joey>
<connor> toe first right yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so they climb on this thing and </connor>
<joey> bear in mind it starts at the shallow </joey>
<joey> end and it goes to the deep end </joey>
<joey> right where you get off right and then </joey>
<joey> we're talking like i don't know like </joey>
<joey> two meters deep yeah no no more than </joey>
<garnt> that it's like three meters five meters </garnt>
<garnt> deep </garnt>
<garnt> i mean five minutes deep in the pool i </garnt>
<garnt> worked out that's pretty [ __ ] deep </garnt>
<garnt> for uh for a kid it's like </garnt>
<garnt> these kids these kids would just walk </garnt>
<garnt> right and then they'd get to the end of </garnt>
<garnt> this obstacle course </garnt>
<connor> and you could see it that they were like </connor>
<connor> what do i do </connor>
<connor> everyone else is going down this slide </connor>
<connor> yeah and they're being you know they're </connor>
<connor> being egged on by their friends and they </connor>
<connor> just go down the slide </connor>
<joey> and they would just go down this is sync </joey>
<joey> they just sink they didn't come back </joey>
<joey> up they just wouldn't come back up wait </joey>
<connor> like two seconds </connor>
<connor> just to like make sure just to make sure </connor>
<connor> they don't come back up yeah </connor>
<connor> and then you have two choices you can </connor>
<connor> either jump in or you can get a really </connor>
<joey> long pole and like poke them with it </joey>
<connor> and hope they </connor>
<connor> well normally i just hope they're still </connor>
<joey> alive hello </joey>
<connor> so what i mean basically if a kid was </connor>
<connor> splashing around to be like ah you just </connor>
<joey> give him a pole </joey>
<joey> and he'll grab i'll like grab on to them </joey>
<joey> they'll grab on to anything </joey>
<joey> right but if you uh if they don't if </joey>
<connor> they don't swim </connor>
<connor> and they just sink which is like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] go in so then i have to go in </connor>
<connor> and this should happen like three or </connor>
<connor> four times sometimes in like one session </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hell because these kids are just </connor>
<joey> terrible and you i'd have to i'd like i </joey>
<joey> would </joey>
<joey> sometimes i would go and jump in i would </joey>
<joey> get a kid </joey>
<joey> yeah what are you doing stop don't go </joey>
<joey> near the deep end yeah </joey>
<joey> and then he would go and he would go </joey>
<joey> near it again and i feel i'd blow the </joey>
<joey> whistle back what are you doing </joey>
<joey> and then i look away for a second i look </joey>
<joey> back he's at the deep end again jumps in </joey>
<joey> drowns again </joey>
<joey> i have to go in and get him i tell his </joey>
<joey> parents off and his parents have a go at </joey>
<joey> me and complained to my manager saying </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> it's not my place to tell her what to </joey>
<joey> teach her kids and i'm like </joey>
<joey> it's not my place i should i could just </joey>
<joey> let your kid drown huh </joey>
<joey> see what happens then she went like full </joey>
<joey> carrying mode on me and try to get me </joey>
<joey> fired </joey>
<joey> because i bollocked her in front of her </joey>
<joey> like well because he saved their kid </joey>
<joey> because i went i i after i saved his kid </joey>
<joey> twice </joey>
<joey> i i hold his hand and i was like come </joey>
<joey> where's your mum show him where your mom </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<joey> and then we went to his mum where's your </joey>
<connor> mom </connor>
<connor> what are you doing i was like why are </connor>
<connor> you letting this kid </connor>
<joey> into this pool without any armbands or </joey>
<joey> anything and she's like </joey>
<joey> i didn't have any floaties or anything </joey>
<joey> oh yeah why would that's why why didn't </joey>
<garnt> they have armbands </garnt>
<garnt> right you know her reason was she was </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't want him to feel like he's </garnt>
<joey> he's like you know the weird one the one </joey>
<joey> who can't swim and i'm like </joey>
<joey> but he is the one who can't see him </joey>
<joey> that's because he can't swim </joey>
<joey> he will [ __ ] drown do you understand </joey>
<joey> how this works </joey>
<joey> like i'm like did you ever teach him how </joey>
<joey> to swim no i'm like why are you letting </joey>
<joey> him do this this is really irresponsible </joey>
<joey> and then i just left and this was in </joey>
<joey> front of </joey>
<joey> all her friends because they had like a </joey>
<connor> viewing bathroom yeah and then she </connor>
<connor> complained saying i didn't need to do </connor>
<connor> that in front of all her friends it was </connor>
<connor> really inappropriate of me </connor>
<connor> i'm like i'm sorry but like how you saw </connor>
<connor> your kid drowned once and thought </connor>
<connor> i'll let him keep swimming yeah i'll let </connor>
<connor> him keep going that really pissed me off </connor>
<connor> i'm still really annoyed about that yeah </connor>
<connor> that's just funny i mean i just </connor>
<garnt> that just sounds like bad parenting </garnt>
<garnt> that's terrible yeah </garnt>
<connor> the people that stuff like they would </connor>
<joey> just let their kids listen unless the </joey>
<connor> parent was like [ __ ] i've been trying to </connor>
<connor> get rid of them </connor>
<garnt> get ready next special we're [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> doing this doesn't this look amazing </connor>
<connor> dude and it was like it was a really </connor>
<connor> good job other than that like it's just </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> kids just like don't know how to swim </joey>
<joey> and you can tell a moment they can't </joey>
<joey> swim </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah um and uh yeah they would also </joey>
<joey> if you ever tried </joey>
<joey> sometimes if you'd um they taught you </joey>
<joey> and i never thought i'd have to use this </joey>
<joey> they teach you how to kick someone off </joey>
<joey> you if you're if they're like trying to </joey>
<connor> drag you down </connor>
<connor> oh well i'm gonna say if someone if </connor>
<connor> you're trying to save someone </connor>
<connor> right if i'm drowning you coming with me </connor>
<garnt> because some people </garnt>
<garnt> when they think they're drowning they </garnt>
<garnt> panic and what they do is that they push </garnt>
<joey> you down </joey>
<connor> yeah because they think i want to get up </connor>
<joey> yeah and you know it's not like a </joey>
<joey> selfish thing where they're like yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah i'm dying and you're dying with me </connor>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<connor> yeah literally it's like instincts kick </connor>
<connor> in for them and they think i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna push you down yeah to get up </connor>
<garnt> so i can observe that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> what was the technique so what you do is </garnt>
<garnt> just like aim for the head </garnt>
<connor> so if they're trying to like grab onto </connor>
<connor> you and push you down </connor>
<connor> you grab them by the arms and like like </connor>
<connor> so you </connor>
<connor> so let's say you're equal now in the </connor>
<connor> water we're both on top of the water </connor>
<joey> heads </joey>
<joey> you grab them and like you go down under </joey>
<joey> the water and you kick them up </joey>
<joey> and kick them off you right right right </joey>
<joey> right it's you push them away </joey>
<joey> and then you officially just grab them </joey>
<connor> by the face when you </connor>
<joey> i'm not i'm not kidding when you save </joey>
<connor> someone you're supposed to grab them by </connor>
<connor> the chin like this </connor>
<connor> and like pull them holy [ __ ] um or </connor>
<connor> you can there's some other ways but </connor>
<connor> that's the easiest because that way you </connor>
<connor> can kind of just do it like at your own </connor>
<connor> pace you can kind of </connor>
<connor> there's other ways like you can you can </connor>
<joey> grab them but that that's really awkward </joey>
<joey> uh </joey>
<joey> it depends like how big they are and if </joey>
<joey> you like if it's like a child like </joey>
<joey> sometimes grabbing them by the face </joey>
<joey> might be a bit much [ __ ] get over it </joey>
<joey> just imagine you like jewelry wielding </joey>
<connor> children </connor>
<connor> like grabbing it in the face </connor>
<connor> you know the worst thing was as well is </connor>
<connor> that when you this is the thing that </connor>
<joey> like you don't really think about is </joey>
<connor> that you don't bring spare uniforms yeah </connor>
<joey> that's not really your thing so if you </joey>
<connor> if you go in </connor>
<joey> um and you you save a kid and it's still </joey>
<joey> your shift you just go right back to the </joey>
<joey> chair </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and you're soaking and you </joey>
<joey> know some people </joey>
<joey> they take the time like the first time i </joey>
<joey> did it i thought i i have to go in right </joey>
<joey> away i have to save their life </joey>
<joey> right away yeah and i wouldn't take my </joey>
<joey> shoes off or anything yeah but then i </joey>
<joey> realized all the people who are like </joey>
<joey> experienced they would just walk down </joey>
<joey> slowly they would just take off their </joey>
<joey> shoes </joey>
<joey> and socks because they knew they had </joey>
<joey> time and they knew like it's a pool they </joey>
<joey> know they're going to grab them right </joey>
<joey> away </joey>
<joey> so they're like i'm not getting my nike </joey>
<connor> air maxes where what the [ __ ] bro like </connor>
<connor> there's like a kid driving in the gym </connor>
<connor> they sit down like this right they see </connor>
<joey> them like because if they're flailing </joey>
<joey> you've got plenty of time yeah </joey>
<joey> so they would just like sit they'd like </joey>
<joey> walk down really slowly like this you </joey>
<joey> know and then they'd be like </joey>
<joey> okay take the watch off like this you </joey>
<joey> know like that </joey>
<joey> and then they would then they would go </joey>
<joey> in yeah it was really funny i just </joey>
<joey> thought it was really bizarre but then </joey>
<joey> they i was like why did you do that </joey>
<connor> isn't that like bad they're like no no </connor>
<joey> they're not going to drown yeah </joey>
<joey> they're not going to drown i know the </joey>
<joey> average time it takes yeah </joey>
<joey> well the moment again the money if </joey>
<joey> you're worried is if they don't come </joey>
<joey> back up that's when you have to like </joey>
<joey> immediately go </joey>
<joey> in yeah so that was all like that was </joey>
<joey> fine and like again this like never </joey>
<joey> happened ever this is only with little </joey>
<joey> kids because little kids are dumb </joey>
<joey> i mean i make out these stories to be a </joey>
<joey> lot more exciting than they are in </joey>
<joey> general the job was extremely boring </joey>
<joey> like it is </joey>
<joey> one of the hardest jobs to do just out </joey>
<joey> of sheer insanity like </joey>
<joey> you sit there for 30 minutes at a time </joey>
<connor> just watching people swim </connor>
<joey> yeah then you take a 20-minute break and </joey>
<connor> then you go back to it and this is like </connor>
<connor> for like six hours </connor>
<connor> just watching people swim and at first </connor>
<joey> it's such a weird thing to do because </joey>
<joey> i'm like </joey>
<joey> yo what if people get a problem with me </joey>
<joey> like staring at them while they're </joey>
<joey> swimming </joey>
<joey> you know like like because i'm like you </joey>
<connor> don't stare at people normally we got to </connor>
<connor> watch the pool right but </connor>
<connor> is it weird that i'm looking at people </connor>
<connor> like there's parents watching me what do </connor>
<connor> they think i'm looking at their kid too </connor>
<connor> much </connor>
<connor> but i'm just making sure that they're </connor>
<connor> not drowning okay it's not weird right </connor>
<connor> like it's like oh okay </connor>
<connor> about that he said this is the thing </connor>
<connor> these are the thoughts you have when </connor>
<connor> you're going insane sitting there for </connor>
<connor> six hours thinking like </connor>
<connor> is it weird is it weird that i'm looking </connor>
<connor> at everyone for like this long is it </connor>
<joey> going inside </joey>
<joey> like an existential crisis </joey>
<joey> i legitimately started like going insane </joey>
<joey> working there because i was like </joey>
<joey> you have to just think how long did you </joey>
<joey> do that for ah </joey>
<joey> god about just under a year and then i </joey>
<joey> went to </joey>
<joey> and then i moved away um but yeah i got </joey>
<joey> that job from doing a different job </joey>
<joey> which i talked about at different times </joey>
<joey> it's completely different yeah it was </joey>
<joey> really funny as well but like </joey>
<connor> lifeguarding in general is like super </connor>
<connor> boring but the pay was really good </connor>
<connor> because you have to get the </connor>
<connor> qualification </connor>
<connor> yeah and you have to be taught a lot of </connor>
<joey> stuff i mean yeah you're there to save </joey>
<connor> lives </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah and the course is quite </connor>
<joey> hard like and you have to redo it every </joey>
<joey> year </joey>
<joey> and so i i can't be a lifeguard now </joey>
<joey> because i haven't got i didn't renew it </joey>
<joey> all right </joey>
<joey> so uh but for the one year it was yeah i </joey>
<connor> mean it was it was fine i mean the pay </connor>
<connor> the pay was insane like being 18 and </connor>
<garnt> coming back </garnt>
<garnt> and i feel like learning the basic first </garnt>
<connor> aid skills is really [ __ ] important </connor>
<connor> yeah it was really helpful because i </connor>
<connor> i was never taught it we don't get </connor>
<connor> taught in the uk yeah yeah we don't get </connor>
<garnt> too so i don't know how to do cpr </garnt>
<garnt> i i </garnt>
<garnt> i do not know how to do the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> heimlich maneuver are you going to learn </garnt>
<connor> that as well yeah yeah we just have to </connor>
<connor> learn like all the basics </connor>
<garnt> um all the basically probably i should </garnt>
<garnt> probably learn it now because </garnt>
<garnt> it's gonna be real awkward if i'm gonna </garnt>
<connor> be like hold on let me just bring up </connor>
<connor> this youtube tutorial for a second </connor>
<joey> all right wait wait wait i got i got on </joey>
<joey> sponsored it's sponsored </joey>
<connor> i got an </connor>
<connor> a lot of aspects of the job were fun </connor>
<connor> yeah not many </connor>
<joey> like i had to like clean as well like </joey>
<joey> clean all the </joey>
<joey> toilets and showers which was like i </joey>
<connor> mean i didn't know i was going to do </connor>
<joey> that but </joey>
<joey> right glad you spent 400 bucks to clean </joey>
<joey> toilets </joey>
<connor> you know you you're there and when </connor>
<connor> you're wrapping up and there's no one </connor>
<joey> left in the pool you just start cleaning </joey>
<joey> because that's </joey>
<joey> what you're supposed to do um but yeah </joey>
<joey> and then sometimes </joey>
<joey> he uh i had to like because even though </joey>
<joey> i wasn't i wasn't teaching the kids but </joey>
<joey> for the kids who are like one year old </joey>
<joey> they're learning how to swim they had to </joey>
<joey> be someone in the water constantly with </joey>
<joey> them all right right and those kids just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like don't let go of you </joey>
<joey> and it's like no get off me little [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> it's like wrestlemania with like babies </connor>
<joey> it's like get off me </joey>
<joey> you're supposed to learn how to swim but </joey>
<connor> the moment they let go of the wall </connor>
<connor> they're like </connor>
<joey> and they've like they suddenly gained </joey>
<connor> the grip strength of like a grown man </connor>
<connor> it was just yeah i mean it was it was </connor>
<connor> just it's all right job really it was </connor>
<joey> just paid well </joey>
<joey> but the kids at the pool are scary just </joey>
<connor> just kids man kids [ __ ] suck </connor>
<connor> and if your kid can't swim teach them </connor>
<garnt> how to swim yeah i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> when did you guys learn how to swim my </garnt>
<connor> mom </connor>
<connor> my mom like swims competitively and </connor>
<connor> still does wow </connor>

<connor> fastest women in her area and she's like </connor>
<joey> nearly like 55 or something like that </joey>
<joey> beautiful yeah so much more healthy than </joey>
<garnt> me it's so sad </garnt>
<joey> like when i go back home and she wants </joey>
<joey> to like go on a bike ride i'm like dying </joey>
<joey> and she's like just like breathing like </joey>
<connor> a casual 50k bike ride let's see that's </connor>
<connor> what she does she's like 50k </connor>
<garnt> bike ride nothing did she watch the </garnt>
<connor> cycling special i was like i thought i </connor>
<connor> raised you better </connor>
<connor> she's like pathetic no no really the </connor>
<connor> footage if you saw the raw footage </connor>
<connor> but yeah so my mum taught me like i like </connor>
<connor> i've always known how to swim i don't </connor>
<joey> remember not being </joey>
<joey> i i went to like a swimming school i </joey>
<garnt> remember like swimming was part of my </garnt>
<joey> curriculum </joey>
<joey> in like school oh really yeah yeah so we </joey>
<joey> had like a local </joey>
<joey> like swimming pool next like not next to </joey>
<joey> us but like really really close to our </joey>
<joey> school i remember </joey>
<joey> one like monday mornings was just </joey>
<joey> dedicated </joey>
<joey> to learning how to swim yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> i'm not a strong swimmer by any means </joey>
<joey> but i can </joey>
<joey> i still know the basics i still know how </joey>
<garnt> to swim like to me it's it's still scary </garnt>
<garnt> um whenever i go out and i swim and i </garnt>
<garnt> can't feel the bottom i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's like there's like the the fear </garnt>
<connor> there's something so wholesome about </connor>
<joey> hearing that </joey>
<joey> why i don't know it just sounds like a </joey>
<connor> child problem </connor>
<garnt> can't touch the floor i mean in the </garnt>
<garnt> swimming pool it's fine but like out </garnt>
<garnt> like out on out in the sea i remember </garnt>
<garnt> the first time no what's worse is when i </garnt>
<joey> can actually feels like </joey>
<joey> something something yeah that's when i'm </joey>
<joey> scared </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean like if i don't know some </garnt>
<joey> something like in in a pool completely </joey>
<joey> fine i didn't give a [ __ ] if i can't </joey>
<joey> feel the bottom </joey>
<garnt> if i'm like i remember the first time </garnt>
<joey> i've realized it when my when we were on </joey>
<joey> the beach it was </joey>
<garnt> it was brighton beach's work so it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't it wasn't exactly a [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> thrilling beach and i remember like my </joey>
<joey> mates just though we we're kind of just </joey>
<joey> like oh yeah let's go swim out </joey>
<joey> and uh swim out you know to where like </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] boys are and i've never done </joey>
<joey> it before but i knew i'd swim and i </joey>
<joey> remember we got there </joey>
<joey> and i this is the first time in my life </joey>
<joey> that i had swam that far out </joey>
<joey> and this is the first time in my life </joey>
<joey> where i i got i got to this point </joey>
<garnt> and i started kicking down and my whole </garnt>
<garnt> life experience had taught me </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how deep it is you can still </garnt>
<garnt> stand up </garnt>
<garnt> and so it was it was this it was this </garnt>
<garnt> realization where we get there and we </garnt>
<connor> start flowing on the water and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> where's the floor where's where's the </connor>
<connor> where's where's the ocean </connor>
<connor> was your six foot you just you take </connor>
<connor> floors for granted yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly right like i've never had a </joey>
<joey> swimming pool where like i couldn't like </joey>
<connor> stand up at least something like my </connor>
<joey> tiptoes yeah like i sink down a little </joey>
<connor> bit </connor>
<connor> and then you know i can still see like </connor>
<connor> the surface of the water i'm still in my </connor>
<connor> tiptoes i can reach the surface quite </connor>
<connor> easily </connor>
<connor> um so this was the first time where i </connor>
<connor> had i'd gone this far out and i had the </connor>
<connor> realization of </connor>
<connor> oh okay um there is no edges to this </connor>
<connor> pool that i can quickly grab onto </connor>
<garnt> i've got a swim literally like all the </garnt>
<garnt> way back to the [ __ ] beach and </garnt>
<garnt> and the beach like you know that scene </garnt>
<garnt> in uh like movies where you know </garnt>
<garnt> the character gets vertigo where they </garnt>
<garnt> look down and like the ground just </garnt>
<garnt> suddenly like </garnt>
<garnt> zooms out that's exactly how i look </garnt>
<garnt> that's exactly what the beach looked </garnt>
<garnt> like when i turned around and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like the beach just went </garnt>
<garnt> zoom like that and i was just like oh </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] that's why you don't really you </connor>
<connor> know you shouldn't be swimming if you're </connor>
<connor> getting even like one percent tired like </connor>
<connor> you should turn about </connor>
<connor> yeah i was already pretty tired you </connor>
<garnt> should turn the [ __ ] off people drown </garnt>
<garnt> that's probably like the closest that </garnt>
<garnt> would come to drowning as well </garnt>
<connor> people get tired and they swim out and </connor>
<connor> then they they're like they're tired by </connor>
<garnt> the time they turn around </garnt>
<garnt> and they're [ __ ] it's so sad and and </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i remember like </garnt>
<joey> i remember turning around and being like </joey>
<joey> okay i've got to [ __ ] do this because </joey>
<joey> i </joey>
<connor> because one of the like the scariest my </connor>
<joey> life literally my life literally depends </joey>
<connor> on it and i was like </connor>
<connor> guys i think i think i've got to turn </connor>
<connor> back and uh i don't think i </connor>
<connor> kind of conveyed how [ __ ] terrified i </connor>
<connor> was to my mates </connor>
<connor> because they were like yeah we're just </connor>
<connor> gonna keep going without school with you </connor>
<connor> and i'm like </connor>
<joey> okay okay i'm gonna turn back now um </joey>
<connor> so yeah what a great group of friends </connor>
<connor> those are bad mates maybe </connor>
<garnt> if they're letting you like do that dude </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i i didn't have a good group of </garnt>
<connor> mates when i was growing up if i heard </connor>
<garnt> even like a breath from my friend that </garnt>
<joey> sounded a little too heavy on my throat </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm like turn the [ __ ] around </joey>
<joey> get the [ __ ] back especially when you </joey>
<joey> get further out the waves get stronger </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly and then the currents come </joey>
<joey> in and that's when it gets really </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] scary </joey>
<connor> i mean i i can't think of anything more </connor>
<connor> depressing than just [ __ ] dying and </connor>
<connor> praying </connor>
<connor> you just at least if at least if i'm </connor>
<garnt> gonna die on a beach let me down a good </garnt>
<connor> beach like a nice beer </connor>
<connor> come to wales man we've got the finest </connor>
<joey> beaches man </joey>
<joey> my fondest memory as a kid because like </joey>
<joey> because australia every [ __ ] house </joey>
<connor> has like a pool in it because otherwise </connor>
<connor> you can't </connor>
<connor> survive the luxury yeah you can't </connor>
<connor> survive the summer otherwise </connor>
<connor> but um my fondest memory and i don't </connor>
<connor> know if this is like a collective like </connor>
<connor> memory for everyone </connor>
<joey> like every kid who like swam in a pool </joey>
<joey> but did you used to do this thing where </joey>
<joey> you would </joey>
<joey> go under the water and then you would </joey>
<connor> pretend to like walk </connor>
<joey> yeah i feel like you're in like on the </joey>
<joey> moon </joey>
<joey> of course that's the only memory i have </joey>
<joey> of being in a pool </joey>
<joey> even though i went to swimming school </joey>
<joey> for like seven </joey>
<joey> years to like learn how to like do all </joey>
<joey> these like different swimming things and </joey>
<joey> like all these fun activities and </joey>
<joey> whatnot </joey>
<connor> the only thing i remember is like yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm on the moon </connor>
<connor> what intelligent thoughts is joe yeah </connor>
<joey> the whole time you're talking about like </joey>
<joey> the pool that's in my head </joey>
<joey> that was just replaying over and over </joey>
<joey> again i'm like i want to go swim in a </joey>
<connor> pool again it's sad because it's so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hard to like </connor>
<connor> find a place to swim there's no pools </connor>
<connor> here it's like they thought they hate </connor>
<connor> swimming for some reason </connor>
<joey> unless you know you [ __ ] pay 150 </joey>
<joey> bucks a month to go to a gym that </joey>
<connor> also just happens to have a pool in it </connor>
<connor> i'd pay to go to a gym with a pool in it </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i just want to go to like a pool i </joey>
<connor> haven't seen a pool anywhere </connor>
<connor> yeah honestly it's always weird to think </connor>
<joey> they just don't like pools </joey>
<joey> yes well i mean i don't know if how </joey>
<garnt> statistically correct this </garnt>
<garnt> is but there's a lot of even adults in </garnt>
<joey> japan that would just </joey>
<joey> never learn to swim yeah i mean like </joey>
<garnt> if it wasn't kind of everywhere if it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't part of my curriculum i probably </garnt>
<garnt> would not have learned how to swim </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't know where i would have </garnt>
<garnt> gotten the motivation to be like okay </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to go out </garnt>
<garnt> and figure out how i'm going to [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> there's yeah let's play through waters </joey>
<joey> everywhere in the uk yeah because it's </joey>
<joey> in the public yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah exactly you pay like two pounds and </connor>
<joey> yeah because in australia it's almost </joey>
<joey> like sick second nature to be like oh </joey>
<joey> your kid is like </joey>
<joey> three to five years old well then we're </joey>
<garnt> going to take you to swimming school </garnt>
<garnt> no question as someone who's a lifeguard </garnt>
<garnt> has there any like was it pretty </garnt>
<garnt> common for like you to find pieces of </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] in your pool just like </joey>
<connor> it happened like so from like a year </connor>
<joey> it was like code brown so it's like </joey>
<joey> that's what it was </joey>
<joey> you'd have to you'd have to empty </joey>
<joey> everyone has to get out you have to </joey>
<joey> close the pool </joey>
<joey> because you have to really you have to </joey>
<joey> re-sanitize it because it's like it's </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah because obviously there's tons </joey>
<joey> of piss in there but you can't see it </joey>
<joey> but then you see a giant mars bar </joey>
<connor> floating in there </connor>
<connor> you gotta you gotta fish you gotta fish </connor>
<connor> it out and then you gotta kick everyone </connor>
<connor> out same if like someone throws up </connor>
<joey> i think more people threw up than </joey>
<joey> throwing up in a pool oh i guess from </joey>
<joey> drinking all the pool water maybe people </joey>
<joey> some kids are stupid they they would </joey>
<connor> like some of them would drink the pool </connor>
<joey> water yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> some of them would just eat a lot and </connor>
<connor> they'd like jump around and then swim a </connor>
<connor> bunch get really exhausted and then they </connor>
<garnt> would </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah how long would it take to </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] sanitize the pool i don't know </garnt>
<connor> we had like a roomba </connor>
<joey> that did it there's like a roomba that </joey>
<joey> went around like the bottom and there's </joey>
<joey> oh yeah like the little yeah we used to </joey>
<joey> have these yeah we could go around </joey>
<joey> and it would clean it but the water is </joey>
<joey> like never like emptied </joey>
<joey> yeah it's um it's just like salted </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and they they could do a </joey>
<joey> chlorine test every like two hours </joey>
<joey> yeah make sure the chlorine levels are </joey>
<joey> okay but i i never did that i wasn't </joey>
<joey> allowed to they were like we don't trust </joey>
<joey> you with the calling </joey>
<joey> with the chlorine connor get out of it </joey>
<connor> no i mean i was i was never like a </connor>
<connor> manager there so i just i was just like </connor>
<connor> there </connor>
<garnt> just because i i i remember still having </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] vivid memories as a </garnt>
<connor> when i was like learning how to swim </connor>
<connor> just like finding a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> in in like the swimming pool right it </connor>
<connor> happened like twice i think </connor>
<joey> yeah because like we would never float </joey>
<joey> it was </joey>
<joey> it would always be at the bottom yeah </joey>
<joey> and like as a as a kid i was just like </joey>
<joey> you because i was always been </joey>
<joey> short-sighted i was always short-sighted </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> in my entire life and i didn't know this </joey>
<joey> until i was like maybe 10 years old that </joey>
<joey> i was </joey>
<joey> oh short-sighted god actually i remember </joey>
<joey> i remember </joey>
<connor> i remember as a kid right i would be </connor>
<connor> looking sitting really close to the tv </connor>
<connor> because like like when playing games or </connor>
<connor> whatever my mom just like stopped </connor>
<connor> sitting so close to the tv </connor>
<garnt> and and i was like but i can't see it </garnt>
<garnt> and my mom's just like look harder </garnt>
<garnt> you're not you're not looking hard </garnt>
<garnt> enough get better eyes </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was only when it was only </garnt>
<connor> when um it's only when we realized </connor>
<joey> that we know when i was in the audience </joey>
<joey> but i was just i i was just born with </joey>
<joey> bad eyesight you know unfortunately </joey>
<joey> so as a kid i didn't have glasses at the </joey>
<joey> time so </joey>
<joey> i would be swimming in the pool and i </joey>
<joey> would see this like little </joey>
<joey> i remember seeing this like little black </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] thing like </joey>
<joey> in the corner of this pool right and you </joey>
<joey> do and it was it was it was [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> blurry as [ __ ] right so i'm just like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is this black thing no </connor>
<connor> in this in the corner before i've </connor>
<connor> noticed </connor>
<connor> and so like out of you know they say </connor>
<connor> curiosity killed the cats </connor>
<garnt> um so uh me being the curious little you </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] six year old i was or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> like i swim closer and closer to it </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> i'm looking back i i can hear the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] jaws music just </garnt>
<joey> playing in the background i'm like </joey>
<joey> done and so like i'm it's i start </joey>
<joey> swimming closer and closer to it and it </joey>
<joey> starts like </joey>
