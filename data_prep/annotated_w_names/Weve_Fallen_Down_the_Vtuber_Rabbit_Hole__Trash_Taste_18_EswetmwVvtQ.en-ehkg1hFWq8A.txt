<garnt> - Who's your best girl? </garnt>
<garnt> Who's your wife, Connor? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's it. </connor>
<connor> - No, because this is you can't do that, </connor>
<connor> that's a loaded question. </connor>
<connor> - If he can't answer within five seconds </connor>
<connor> then you don't have a wife yet. </connor>
<connor> - No, that's like saying
what's your favorite genocide? </connor>
<connor> There's no, someone's gonna be angry like. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> (soft upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> Hi, I'm the boy of the cDawgvariety </connor>
<connor> and today I'm with Jesus the carpenter man </connor>
<connor> he just built two chairs and Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Just Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Just Garnt?
- Just Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, do you want something else? </garnt>
<connor> - The Garnt the guy who
did not build two chairs. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just tired for no reason. </garnt>
<connor> - We've been building up
an office you can't see it </connor>
<connor> but yeah, there'll be some live streams. </connor>
<connor> - We? </connor>
<connor> Did you build two chairs?
- Yeah, I did what every </connor>
<connor> good white man, watch the brown man. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I was just sitting in
the corner on Twitter </connor>
<garnt> and I was like, you guys got this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah you guys got this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember where they
were building the pyramids </garnt>
<connor> and there was one guy in
the corner on Twitter. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - I was like the epitome of I'm helping. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you're helping. </garnt>
<connor> - Moral support.
- It was labeling things. </connor>
<connor> We should cut off that shit
that we just spoke about, </connor>
<connor> this is a very inefficient
interrupt, all right? </connor>
<connor> Garnt, what are we talking about today? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, what are
we talking about today? </garnt>
<garnt> (chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> Well, basically the only
like new current topic </connor>
<connor> I can think of
- At the time </connor>
<connor> we're recording, of course.
- at the time </connor>
<connor> we're recording this is this week </connor>
<connor> Hololive English just
got announced basically. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> What?
- Okay, no just. </connor>
<connor> - What are you laughing? </connor>
<garnt> Why is that is it funny? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, is just that if anyone's </garnt>
<connor> gonna start topic, it's Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been following Hololive for a while. </garnt>
<garnt> And this week, </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe was it last week or this week </garnt>
<garnt> that Hololive English got announced? </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone's had their debut. </garnt>
<garnt> And then Twitter just exploded. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I was in the
Hololive community before. </connor>
<connor> So I knew the usual suspects, </connor>
<garnt> whose suspects would be
talking about VTubers. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But within the last week, </connor>
<garnt> like my entire feed has just been VTubers. </garnt>
<connor> And it's not just Hololive VTubers, </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Fucking everyone's </connor>
<connor> coming out as a VTuber right now. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone is turning into a VTuber. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm right there with
you because I am a... </garnt>
<garnt> It's like coming out about benediction. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's like, I'm
sorry but I have recently </garnt>
<connor> fallen into the Vtube hole myself. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The Hololive hole and I can't get out. </connor>
<connor> - When you made that tweet, </connor>
<connor> it was like the proud father </connor>
<garnt> who had just found out his son </garnt>
<garnt> had like won the baseball
game or something. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how I felt reading the tweet man. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know dad, </connor>
<connor> I didn't feel like I was winning. </connor>
<connor> - I'm glad to accept we had
a nice variation of opinions </connor>
<connor> on the topic is 'cause Garnt, </connor>
<connor> has been like the old boomer simp. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - The boomer simp of Hololive. </connor>
<connor> - He's been simping </connor>
<connor> since the first crumb of Hololive existed </connor>
<garnt> we just got into it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like an alien who's just come </garnt>
<connor> to earth for the first time </connor>
<connor> and has just found out
about a religion he's like, </connor>
<connor> wait, so you will just
believe in this book? </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> Just take it 100% you'll just follow it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes.
- Give your money </garnt>
<connor> to this book. </connor>
<garnt> - It is a religion at this point. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm the altar
boy and he's the pope. </connor>
<connor> - So I felt like I didn't get it before </connor>
<connor> and now I feel like I must be like doing </connor>
<connor> like something is wrong with me. </connor>
<connor> - No, because--
- I'm like the only person </connor>
<connor> who's just standing being like, </connor>
<connor> so everyone's into this,
everyone likes this. </connor>
<connor> - No, I was there with you, right? </connor>
<connor> And then I don't even
know how it even started. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's because I was just curious, </garnt>
<garnt> because this guy won't shut the fuck UP. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I'm like, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> All right, I'll give it a go. </garnt>
<connor> Like I've worked with
VTubers in the past, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Kizuna Ai. </connor>
<connor> I worked with her and stuff. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, all right. </connor>
<garnt> Let me see what the stream of variety is. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I looked at Wan.. </connor>
<connor> An hour passed. </connor>
<garnt> - That's all it takes. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then two hours passed. </garnt>
<connor> And then three hours passed </connor>
<connor> and I said oh no. </connor>
<connor> I've fallen and I can't get up. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I've watched like a lot of the clips </connor>
<connor> because they come at my
recommended it's like, </connor>
<connor> someone someone says the N word. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's how it got viral </garnt>
<connor> in the first place. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How I fell into the hole was like, </connor>
<garnt> there would be some clip
that someone had read. </garnt>
<connor> - It was always the GTA one
there's like a compilation </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Just like just like why
is like these anime girls </connor>
<connor> dropping the N bomb. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Like what is that about? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't remember that
episode of Madoka Magica. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And then after that, </connor>
<garnt> it would be like that they
would jump like the F bomb </garnt>
<garnt> and then they would just be
like anime girls swearing. </garnt>
<connor> And then eventually, </connor>
<connor> I was like curious </connor>
<connor> and then saw one clip, </connor>
<connor> it was one clip that
got recommended to me. </connor>
<connor> And it was well one of
the Hololive VTubers, </connor>
<connor> Fubuki singing Scatman. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> And it's just this Hololive
girl like singing Scatman. </connor>
<connor> - That sound pretty good. </connor>
<connor> That sounds pretty fun. </connor>
<connor> - It's adorable as fuck, right? </connor>
<connor> And she does like a lot of covers. </connor>
<connor> And then it was one video, one video. </connor>
<garnt> And then after I watched that one video, </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube recommended was like--- </garnt>
<garnt> - Allow us to introduce ourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yo, you like this shit? </garnt>
<connor> Yo, we got all this shit right here. </connor>
<connor> - YouTube recommendations very turned </connor>
<connor> into like the back alley of
like crack deal, all right. </connor>
<connor> I was just like, you want more? </connor>
<connor> I got some more for you. </connor>
<connor> - The worst is when Youtube like </connor>
<connor> autoplays video you did not wanna watch. </connor>
<connor> And then it will not stop
recommending that channel. </connor>
<connor> I never intended for this to happen. </connor>
<connor> Stop, stop this right now. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, cause the difference between </garnt>
<garnt> just watching that one channel </garnt>
<garnt> and having YouTube recommend
this entire just one channel. </garnt>
<garnt> Like with VTubers, it's
watching one VTuber, </garnt>
<connor> and then it's just a load of other clips </connor>
<connor> on other different channels. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That just get recommended
to you all at once. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it
is about the algorithm. </connor>
<garnt> But I feel like if you
just watch one, your lost. </garnt>
<connor> - They kind of did it in a genius way </connor>
<connor> because almost all of
the Hololive members, </connor>
<connor> they almost always collab
with one another as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've seen that, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it's just perfectly built to just get </connor>
<garnt> once you start with one. </garnt>
<garnt> Then you see that one post in you're into </garnt>
<garnt> collab with another one. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, oh, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> let me check this one out. </garnt>
<garnt> And then like tree branches, </garnt>
<garnt> just keep growing out
until you're way too deep. </garnt>
<garnt> - To explain what virtual YouTube is... </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Let's first explain
what virtual Youtubers is </connor>
<garnt> to an audience, to some people </garnt>
<garnt> who probably don't know
what virtual YouTubers are. </garnt>
<connor> - In case you're watching this from 2012. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> So to basically explain, </garnt>
<garnt> to put it in the simplest terms, </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically real people
who rigged themselves up </garnt>
<garnt> with an anime avatar. </garnt>
<garnt> And they just make content </garnt>
<garnt> whether it be streaming
or YouTube content. </garnt>
<connor> Now Now it's more about live streaming. </connor>
<connor> I would say like the first
real big VTuber, is Kizuna Ai. </connor>
<connor> As you probably know or not do not know. </connor>
<connor> But now I feel like the content is grown </connor>
<connor> so far away from what
the content was before </connor>
<connor> with Kizuna Ai leading the charge. </connor>
<connor> Because I felt like before it was all </connor>
<connor> about making just just
like YouTube comments, </connor>
<connor> not YouTube content. </connor>
<garnt> - Content, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And now it's more
like it's less scripted. </garnt>
<garnt> It's less scripted. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's more about live streaming stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I actually prefer that. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know about you, </garnt>
<garnt> because I never really got into </garnt>
<garnt> VTubers before hololive
came along and really kind </garnt>
<garnt> of just took over the entire scene, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, there was a part
of me that when before </connor>
<connor> and after I did work with Kizuna Ai, </connor>
<connor> there was a time where I really did get </connor>
<connor> into the YouTuber side of things as well </connor>
<connor> because I found Kizuna Ai </connor>
<connor> and then I found like
some of the other big </connor>
<connor> ones like Shiro and Kabhi
Audrina and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, they're all of them </connor>
<connor> are like really entertaining. </connor>
<connor> There's a lot of really
entertaining VTubers out there. </connor>
<connor> But the problem is that the
content is just so confined, </connor>
<connor> like an average Kizuna Ai
videos like three minutes long. </connor>
<connor> It's really really short even
though it's a daily upload, </connor>
<connor> but now you have Hololive and Nijisanji </connor>
<connor> and these other like big
YouTube stream of VTube, </connor>
<connor> like organizations that stream </connor>
<garnt> for like two three hours daily. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - So it's just constant
constant feed of content. </connor>
<garnt> - As somebody who doesn't
really know anything about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is it not just Virtual Youtuber. </garnt>
<connor> Why does it have the name Hololive? </connor>
<garnt> What's up with that? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, so Hololive is just an agency. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so they're basically
an agency that have all </connor>
<garnt> these VTubers under this one roof </garnt>
<garnt> and it's more like a
branding thing, right? </garnt>
<connor> - You want your like talent
to be under your name. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like we will
have individual channels </garnt>
<garnt> and they have Trash Tastes. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not an agency but that's kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like the best way I can describe it. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like back in
the day when YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> there were different
types of gaming YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> but then a lot of the gaming Youtubers </connor>
<connor> will under the machinima like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because there are other ones as well. </connor>
<connor> There's Hololive I think the two big </connor>
<connor> ones a Hololive and Nijisanji. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right now, </connor>
<connor> but there's also all these other tiny, </connor>
<connor> tiny individual agencies
as well that have a bunch </connor>
<connor> of different VTubers under their umbrella. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And yeah, it's just
become like a branding now. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I guess to
play devil's advocate. </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> I gotta fucking bust up(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> What did he ask? </connor>
<connor> What stops it from just
being more than a gimmick </connor>
<connor> to you guys? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it was a gimmick. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, like I said, Okay, </connor>
<connor> the way I see is just a new
genre of content, right? </connor>
<connor> Because there's there's
just something about VTubers </connor>
<connor> that they're not, you
don't see them as like, </connor>
<connor> real life streamers even
though there's a someone that </connor>
<connor> someone behind the avatar, right? </connor>
<connor> So there is someone operating it </connor>
<connor> but it's not you don't
view them as that person, </connor>
<connor> but you don't also view them </connor>
<connor> as a complete anime character as well. </connor>
<connor> So it like fits in this little gray area. </connor>
<connor> The best way I can.. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - It's a little bit creepy. </connor>
<connor> - The best way I can describe it, </connor>
<connor> it's it's kind of like wrestling right? </connor>
<connor> Where wrestling fans. </connor>
<garnt> They know that the
people are like, acting. </garnt>
<garnt> They know Wrestling's fake, </garnt>
<garnt> but they still buy into it anyway, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's basically wrestling(indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - It's like a whole life
is interesting because </connor>
<connor> from the little that I've seen so far, </connor>
<connor> that the characters are
really human like when you </connor>
<connor> when you listen to them, yes, </connor>
<garnt> they're obviously playing and
acting up this character and </garnt>
<garnt> this entire law behind the character. </garnt>
<garnt> But then every now and then the human part </garnt>
<connor> of them slips out. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And that is kind of
charming to watch because. </connor>
<connor> - I can imagine yeah,
I've seen clips of, like, </connor>
<connor> stuff like that happening. </connor>
<connor> I remember what it was, yeah, they like, </connor>
<connor> break character for a second. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So it's basically like
the best of both worlds. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like, I don't I don't
feel like it's a gimmick, </garnt>
<connor> because the more I've gotten into it, </connor>
<connor> the more I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> man I can't really get this kind </connor>
<connor> of entertainment anywhere else. </connor>
<connor> And that's why I've become so addicted </connor>
<connor> to VTubers is because I
could never really get </connor>
<connor> into live streams. </connor>
<garnt> I know, you've you've been really, </garnt>
<connor> really into live streamers. </connor>
<garnt> I appreciate the work they do. </garnt>
<garnt> I've just never been a guy who could sit </garnt>
<garnt> and watch live streams for hours. </garnt>
<connor> I've always thought like-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't really
watch them for hours. </connor>
<connor> It's mainly like-- </connor>
<connor> - It depends on the streamer right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Depends on the stream what's happening. </connor>
<connor> It's very much like, </connor>
<connor> I'll see what they're up to, </connor>
<connor> maybe watch 10 minutes
and go do something else. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I don't really watch
streams and sit there. </connor>
<connor> I haven't really done that years. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I used to... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why I can't
really get into it. </garnt>
<connor> Like I watched the clips. </connor>
<connor> I find them funny, </connor>
<connor> but I feel no desire at all to like, </connor>
<connor> follow them around. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you think it's the
language barrier for you? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, </garnt>
<connor> I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> I think that's really, </connor>
<connor> I mean, especially
there's English ones now. </connor>
<connor> I checked out most of them. </connor>
<connor> Because I was like, well, </connor>
<connor> I wanna see if there's one I like </connor>
<connor> because everyone's just like, well, </connor>
<connor> it's easy to find one you like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But when you don't like like one. </connor>
<connor> It's like, no, no. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like that some
people would say about like, </connor>
<connor> you should find a woman you like, </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because there are
like so many VTubers now </garnt>
<connor> that I'm pretty sure there's
a VTuber for everyone. </connor>
<connor> Because that's how-- </connor>
<connor> - There's something for everyone. </connor>
<connor> - A little something for everyone </connor>
<connor> - That's how you get into it, right? </connor>
<connor> Because a lot of the times, </connor>
<connor> like with Joey Yeah, </connor>
<garnt> people didn't know why people go into it. </garnt>
<connor> - I never understood it
until I found the couple </connor>
<connor> of VTubers where I'm like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I can vibe with this person. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - cause for me when Kizuna Ai blew up, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I respect the
character and everything, </garnt>
<garnt> but it just wasn't my kind of content. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought it was just
a really cool concept. </garnt>
<garnt> But now, even if you don't, </garnt>
<garnt> even if you have some certain VTubers that </garnt>
<connor> aren't your favorite, </connor>
<connor> there's gonna be one that you like, man, </connor>
<connor> I didn't think I was a simp. </connor>
<connor> But I think I'm about to simp man. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I just like this. </connor>
<connor> I enjoy watching some like, </connor>
<connor> here's the iron mouse on Twitch. </connor>
<connor> I watched her about she's pretty funny. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, I wouldn't like say I'm like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I'm gonna simp,
you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Simp is a strong word. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, like, </connor>
<connor> you can have fun. </connor>
<connor> - I can watch the streams and enjoy them. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but I see people on Twitter and </connor>
<connor> they're like fucking like, </connor>
<connor> it's like life or death. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you got an email
from someone, right? </connor>
<connor> That one time. </connor>
<connor> That was like, you wanna talk about that? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess I got an email
from someone who was like, </garnt>
<garnt> basically trying to get me </garnt>
<garnt> to teach the VTuber
advocates to like people, </garnt>
<garnt> like English speaking fans
who watch VTubers, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, man, </garnt>
<garnt> I ain't getting involved in this. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> Like they're not following
etiquette or something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I can just chat shit while Garnt </connor>
<connor> pulls up the email for a moment. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I guess I get them. </connor>
<connor> Maybe they don't understand. </connor>
<connor> Like, the whole simping thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess like with Hololive, </connor>
<connor> it's not that I don't necessarily
like enjoy or anything. </connor>
<connor> I do enjoy what I like, </connor>
<connor> I guess it's one of those things </connor>
<connor> where when you don't
feel nearly as strongly </connor>
<connor> as other people do. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of alienating. </connor>
<connor> Oh, because I wanna enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> But then I feel like
am I enjoying it right? </connor>
<connor> Because everyone else seems to be </connor>
<connor> so fucking aggressive about this. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that when I first started watching it, </connor>
<garnt> and this was only like
three or four days ago, </garnt>
<connor> like fully started to get into it, </connor>
<connor> I just watched it like
just to check it out right? </connor>
<connor> Just like any streamer would, </connor>
<connor> and you obviously miss all
of these inside jokes that </connor>
<connor> are within the community, </connor>
<connor> but then the more you watch them </connor>
<garnt> and the more clips you
watch them you like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> so that means that like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to I'm slowly
starting to understand, </garnt>
<garnt> like, the general flow of how </garnt>
<connor> this particular VTuber
interact with their audience, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, okay, I
either can get into that </connor>
<connor> or I can't get into that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's that's why they
call it a rabbit hole, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because there's so much content out there, </garnt>
<garnt> that this whole that you fall into it, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no reaching the bottom. </garnt>
<connor> And the reason there's
no reaching the bottom is </connor>
<connor> because there is no way that </connor>
<connor> one person can catch up </connor>
<connor> with all the content out there right now. </connor>
<connor> Even if it's just like, </connor>
<connor> even if you just follow
Hololive Japan even </connor>
<garnt> that there's so many VTubers </garnt>
<garnt> that there's no way you can keep up </garnt>
<garnt> with everything that's going on. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's hard to catch up </connor>
<garnt> with just one VTuber right because yeah, </garnt>
<connor> most of these VTubers are streaming </connor>
<connor> three, four hours a day. </connor>
<connor> - Sounds like a normal streamer though, </connor>
<connor> like they stream jokes
they streaming a lot. </connor>
<connor> - But like what I found is
that with the couple of VTubers </connor>
<connor> that I have found we've really enjoyed, </connor>
<connor> they could literally be doing anything </connor>
<connor> and they just really entertaining
and that's really hard </connor>
<connor> to find in any streamer like VTuber alone. </connor>
<connor> - I can name a few streamers
off the top my head that are </connor>
<connor> pure entertainment. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> I know a few as well but there's </connor>
<connor> something, there's a different quality </connor>
<connor> that VTuber brings I feel </connor>
<connor> that a live action
streamer can't really... </connor>
<connor> - Live action! </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - 3D streamer </connor>
<connor> - Disgusting 3D. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the Netflix
live action adaptation. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> I like the anime version. </connor>
<connor> I don't dig the Netflix adaptation. </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I don't wanna say too much </connor>
<connor> because I think people will just be like </connor>
<connor> Connor just doesn't get it so but like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, </garnt>
<connor> to me at the moment at least
maybe next week I'll come </connor>
<garnt> on the podcast and be like, gentlemen, </garnt>
<garnt> I've changed my mind. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, like, </connor>
<connor> what do you think about basically
has your feed been like-- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah its been a little-- </connor>
<garnt> - It's been decimated by VTubers. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I mean, </connor>
<connor> I think is we're right on the cusp of it, </connor>
<connor> like kind of becoming mainstream </connor>
<connor> in English audiences, right? </connor>
<connor> - Because everyone's
trying to be a VTuber. </connor>
<connor> - I think the next few
months will be crucial </connor>
<connor> in determining whether
it's gonna be a thing </connor>
<connor> that sticks around. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, </connor>
<connor> - It'll be a phase of... </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was very very surprised
when Pokemon came out </garnt>
<garnt> with a Vtube avatar. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I know like Lily Picchu is about </connor>
<connor> to debut her avatar, </connor>
<garnt> which probably will be
debuted by the time. </garnt>
<connor> - Like debuting avatar. </connor>
<connor> Guys, I'm gonna release it. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta tune in to the debut. </connor>
<garnt> That's what it's all about. </garnt>
<connor> - See that's the thing-- </connor>
<connor> - Okay, that is cool. </connor>
<connor> I'll admit, that's kind of cool. </connor>
<connor> - It's how to build up hype. </connor>
<connor> And it's part of like the law, </connor>
<connor> which is why I feel like, </connor>
<connor> which is why I feel like Hollolive English </connor>
<connor> really did this super well, </connor>
<connor> because they debuted
everyone at once it became </connor>
<connor> this massive event. </connor>
<connor> And everyone's talking about it now. </connor>
<connor> And everyone paid attention. </connor>
<connor> And now like, all of Western Twitter </connor>
<garnt> and like Western streaming
communities will take-- </garnt>
<connor> - Like anime fandom is
really like our attacker. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it's even
going out to that now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it's out of that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've seen like, </connor>
<connor> plenty of tweets from a lot
of big streamers who are like, </connor>
<connor> what's this VTuber thing about? </connor>
<connor> Shall I get an avatar? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I'm thinking
about getting an avatar. </connor>
<connor> - It's mainstream internet then? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think so. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think just like the
general, the younger audience. </connor>
<connor> - So when you're watching these YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> the VTubers, sorry. </connor>
<connor> Do you don't wanna like because to me, </connor>
<connor> I find what's super
interesting about streamers </connor>
<connor> is the person and yeah, </connor>
<connor> everything about them. </connor>
<connor> And like, what they choose to show. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And perhaps maybe they have a really </connor>
<connor> interesting like life before streaming. </connor>
<connor> Like, to me, I find the human aspects </connor>
<connor> so entertaining and that's I think </connor>
<connor> that's the reason why
I connect so much more </connor>
<connor> with documentaries and fiction. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I think real life is
just so fucking interesting. </connor>
<connor> Because, you can't make this shit up. </connor>
<connor> Like the stuff that
happens in real life is </connor>
<connor> so much more insane than what happens </connor>
<connor> in someone's like, fiction-- </connor>
<connor> - I think-- </connor>
<connor> - And I wonder why you don't like </connor>
<connor> when you see a VTuber. </connor>
<connor> Like when I watch VTuber, </connor>
<connor> all I'm thinking is like, </connor>
<connor> I wonder what the real person's like, </connor>
<connor> I wanna see I wanna like talk to them. </connor>
<connor> I wanna-- </connor>
<connor> - I think though, that
whole thing just isn't-- </connor>
<garnt> - It's completely covered by just the law </garnt>
<garnt> as a character. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like how they present
themselves as a character </garnt>
<connor> is just so entertaining
that you almost forget. </connor>
<connor> Oh, shit, there's a person behind this. </connor>
<connor> - I guess it's why I
could never really get </connor>
<connor> into wrestling either. </connor>
<connor> I never really cared about that. </connor>
<connor> - I never got into wrestling either. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure there's someone can explain it </connor>
<garnt> some fucking PhD in the comment. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - As they always fucking explain it to me, </connor>
<garnt> but I have no idea why
I just can't connect </garnt>
<garnt> with the avatars. </garnt>
<connor> I think again, like it's funny the way </connor>
<connor> that like a clown dancing in front </connor>
<connor> of me will make me laugh. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, like that's cool. </connor>
<connor> - Here's the way I view it. </connor>
<connor> Because the reason I go and see VTuber was </connor>
<connor> this modern day iteration
is VTube is because </connor>
<connor> someone like Kizuna Ai, </connor>
<connor> I saw completely as a character. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I have no interest in Kizuna Ai. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like, I saw her completely </connor>
<connor> as a character. </connor>
<connor> And what kind of drew
me to Hololive VTubers, </connor>
<connor> was that it felt like they </connor>
<connor> did have a personality behind them. </connor>
<connor> That was you-- </connor>
<connor> - There definitely is. </connor>
<connor> I've seen it, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because you have times
when they talk about </connor>
<garnt> it's past stories about what they did </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid and some aspects. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've seen one of the Japanese </garnt>
<connor> ones always telling stories. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The green-haired one. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck is. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'll try and find it(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that the difference </connor>
<garnt> between the VTuber YouTubers
Versus the VTuber streamers </garnt>
<garnt> is that almost all of
the VTubers YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> were entirely scripted. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was very difficult. </garnt>
<garnt> They were really controlled, </garnt>
<connor> like they were controlled
as to how much of themselves </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - But it's weird, right? </connor>
<connor> Because the streamers
a not scripted, right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's a live stream. </connor>
<connor> So they actually have
a lot more flexibility </connor>
<connor> in what they can show of how
much of a person they are </connor>
<garnt> or how much of a character they. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I remember I saw recently, </garnt>
<garnt> there was a clip of one
of the characters who... </garnt>
<garnt> The Laurel of her character </garnt>
<garnt> is that she's like in her teens, </garnt>
<connor> but then the character, who
has a voice in the character </connor>
<connor> slipped out a little bit being like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, as a late 20 year old </connor>
<connor> and people in the chat when like late 20s. </connor>
<garnt> You're in your teens? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'm in my teens. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, sorry. </connor>
<connor> I didn't mean that. </connor>
<connor> - Dumb teenagers. </connor>
<connor> - But then as the community
was egging her on about, </connor>
<connor> like late 20s she just
completely just gave up </connor>
<garnt> and was like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm in my late 20s, fuck it </garnt>
<garnt> and she just rolled with it. </garnt>
<connor> And that side was like very
human and very entertaining. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is why I feel like I was saying </garnt>
<garnt> they exist in a place
between being a character </garnt>
<connor> and being a human. </connor>
<connor> It's just really weird. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that streamers
do that there as well. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I mean, like, </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - But they ain't cute
anime girls, are they? </connor>
<connor> - Tyler1 is pretty cute. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like, everyone knows
I fucking love Tyler1. </connor>
<connor> I think Tyler1 is such a fucking, amazing </connor>
<connor> natural entertainer </connor>
<connor> and like for example, the age thing, </connor>
<garnt> he's got the whole I'm six foot five </garnt>
<garnt> and he has a whole fake ruler. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah pulls out in the stream. </connor>
<connor> He's just like, obviously like five foot. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But that's like that's like
the same kind of thing right? </connor>
<connor> It's almost WWE in that aspect </connor>
<garnt> but he's obviously not that fucking insane </garnt>
<garnt> in real life. </garnt>
<garnt> No one can be. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - But like the only
difference between that </connor>
<connor> is a fucking add a cute anime
girl in between that, right? </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - To me it's like almost
scarily impressive how someone </connor>
<connor> who's on camera constantly
can keep up this act, like-- </connor>
<garnt> - It is impressive. </garnt>
<connor> It is super impressive. </connor>
<garnt> - I think live stream
is a fucking psychopath. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know what it'd have to be. </connor>
<connor> - Because you have that
beautiful thing of like </connor>
<garnt> when you have the Hololive,
it's doing the work for you. </garnt>
<connor> You just gotta put the
voice, which is easy. </connor>
<connor> - I say that as a YouTube creator </connor>
<connor> with total fucking respect. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have no idea how you
guys fucking do that. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know how 'cause
two hours of streaming </connor>
<garnt> and I start to like lose my energy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - How Tyler1 can be
screaming for 12 hours? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know.
- I don't get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like after I'm like
streaming for two hours, </garnt>
<garnt> two hours is like my limits, </garnt>
<garnt> anything off past two hours </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like pushing... </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like running on empty. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Whenever I stream I press
like the end stream button </garnt>
<garnt> and I go my couch and I collapse, </garnt>
<garnt> after two fucking hours. </garnt>
<connor> - It is really fucking tiring </connor>
<connor> and we have we all have friends </connor>
<connor> that can do fucking eight
nine hour streams daily. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, how do you do that shit? </connor>
<connor> - I fucking left my
stream on the other day </connor>
<connor> when I thought I turned it off. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I left my house </connor>
<connor> and then some people
were tweeting me like, </connor>
<connor> yo, your stream still on bro. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like what? </connor>
<connor> I checked and it was just on.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> I looked at like the final
10 minutes before I left. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like I go like bye guys. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> You guys can go and see this. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the-- </connor>
<connor> - At least you didn't
like jerk off on stream. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs)
(indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - Like could you imagine, </connor>
<connor> if I was just like done (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like that's just my thing when I'm done. </connor>
<connor> - Just stand up and the
dick just flopping out. </connor>
<connor> - God, I just hate that group of people. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Okay, Tyler1 become a VTuber dude, </connor>
<connor> just I'm saying that that
would be fucking insane. </connor>
<connor> We need a VTuber that
screams like Tyler1, bro. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's a lot fucking Japanese-- </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - You obviously have not seen some VTubers </connor>
<connor> that fucking blow off your ears. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, it's the muscles
combined with it that just adds </connor>
<connor> to the character building,
that's the real 3D model. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct)
(laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I wanna fuck Tyler1. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - You just wanna simp Tyler1.
(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Apes together strong.
- Apes together strong. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Okay, and as well like
I think there's a... </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is just me, right? </connor>
<connor> But it's the reason why I can't
like enjoy certain things. </connor>
<connor> Okay, I wanna make this very clear </connor>
<connor> before people get angry at
me because I know people do. </connor>
<connor> Because I'm like, </connor>
<connor> kind of doesn't like all the
live kind of hates all this. </connor>
<connor> I'm interested in other aspects. </connor>
<garnt> And I think blindly just being like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking love this thing </garnt>
<garnt> is fucking boring. </garnt>
<garnt> We wanna have a discussion here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a Japanese
company, right, Hololive? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Let's be honest. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty curious about that cop. </connor>
<connor> I wanna know what it is. </connor>
<connor> I wanna know what that contract is like </connor>
<connor> 'cause I guarantee that it is
skewed towards the Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it's probably like
machinima quality right? </connor>
<connor> - I'm betting it's a Machinima Com. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, we're talking like, </connor>
<connor> I would be genuinely surprised </connor>
<connor> if the creator was getting 30% or more. </connor>
<connor> If they were getting more than 20%, </connor>
<connor> I would probably call bullshit. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - I think they're getting
anywhere between 20 and 10%. </connor>
<connor> Again, this is just speculation, like, </connor>
<connor> I just know-- </connor>
<connor> - It's a very big possibility. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you've got approached </connor>
<connor> by a Japanese YouTube agency before right? </connor>
<connor> - Many times, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they were offering similar costs. </connor>
<connor> - Absolutely garbage. </connor>
<connor> - Like what was the lowest
one you've received? </connor>
<connor> - The lowest one I received was 70/30. </connor>
<connor> But 70 to the company, 30 to me. </connor>
<connor> - That's how it is. </connor>
<connor> But you were already
established at that point </connor>
<connor> which is disgusting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> I think I had like, </connor>
<connor> almost 2 million subs. </connor>
<connor> It was it was not that long
ago, sometime last year. </connor>
<connor> - It's really rare for an... </connor>
<connor> Especially if you're
an established talent. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - So this is this the kind of numbers </connor>
<connor> that you were probably getting
pitched by Japanese company </connor>
<connor> who realized you were established. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Can you imagine when
you're not established? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like what numbers they're
going to be pitching you? </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - And I know, </connor>
<connor> I know him likes to do that, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like, would
you focus on the character, </connor>
<connor> the entertainer, they're
having fun, they like it. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, when you're new, </connor>
<connor> you don't know what's good. </connor>
<connor> Like, I've spoken to many YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> who I have personally, like, helped </connor>
<connor> with deals who would
they were getting paid </connor>
<connor> like $1,000 for like
sponsorship (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> 10 times that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Just because they're happy with the deal </garnt>
<connor> doesn't make it okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I wonder if... </connor>
<connor> Again, it could be a totally fair deal. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, I would like to know, </garnt>
<garnt> just 'cause it makes me worried. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I guess this goes into like, </garnt>
<garnt> just the darker side of
idol industry period. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it's not only a Japanese company, </connor>
<connor> it's a Japanese idol company. </connor>
<connor> And we (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - That shit is fucked yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm interested to see, </connor>
<connor> we'll never find out. </connor>
<connor> But I would love to know the
rules of that they're under. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I don't know
because I feel like with-- </garnt>
<connor> - I'd like to think it's modern. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would also like
to think it's modern. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, this is all speculation </connor>
<garnt> so none of us know what kind of deal </garnt>
<garnt> the talent has going on. </garnt>
<connor> - It could be completely fucking wrong </connor>
<garnt> and yeah to complete(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> I fully apologize for that if I am. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just going off base off
experience and what I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're just playing devil's advocate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, get on with what you're saying. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because it feels like to me </garnt>
<garnt> just part of the reason </garnt>
<garnt> that Hololive rose up
so much in the beginning </garnt>
<garnt> was because compared to
other let's say idol agencies </garnt>
<garnt> and idol companies, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like part of it was that </garnt>
<garnt> they just kinda let the girls
do whatever the fuck they want </garnt>
<garnt> with less restrictions. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like most idol companies </garnt>
<garnt> don't allow girls to fucking swear </garnt>
<garnt> or like tell other girls
are gonna piss on each other </garnt>
<garnt> which is like one of
one of like (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - The reason the Hololive
expanded so much in our community </connor>
<garnt> was just how much they
were allowed to shitpost </garnt>
<garnt> and how much free-- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but I wonder if there's somebody </connor>
<garnt> at the charge of it, who's like, </garnt>
<garnt> alright, let them shitpost
and we'll keep the profit. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>

<connor> and go check out Skillshare. </connor>
<connor> - Thank you to Skillshare
for sponsoring this episode, </connor>
<connor> back to the video. </connor>
<connor> - I almost wonder because you have to... </connor>
<connor> Correct me if I'm wrong, </connor>
<connor> you have to audition for Hololive, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like when these
positions in this company </connor>
<garnt> where it's like you
have to audition for us, </garnt>
<garnt> they can kind of use that power </garnt>
<garnt> even then to force you
to take a shitty deal. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's 90/10% but, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> what's 10% when you're nobody, </garnt>
<garnt> we can make you into somebody. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's also the argument </garnt>
<garnt> of if you're signing with the agency, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna get so much publicity. </garnt>
<connor> Becaus of how massive HoloLive is. </connor>
<connor> Like with the English
VTubers that this just debut, </connor>
<connor> every one of them has
like got over 100k subs, </connor>
<connor> just like before they
even started streaming </connor>
<connor> and I'm now they're putting in like, </connor>
<connor> I remember I was watching
Mari stream yesterday </connor>
<garnt> and she was putting in over like 30K </garnt>
<garnt> concurrent viewers streaming.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you just don't get that </garnt>
<connor> starting out by yourself as independent. </connor>
<garnt> That's something you grow over years. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd be interested to see
if that keeps up as well. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but I agree. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you could argue that okay, </connor>
<connor> even if they are getting a bad car, </connor>
<connor> well, they're getting a free career. </connor>
<connor> So they should be happy
with what the company gives. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure as well with how powerful </connor>
<connor> and like willing Hololive is
now in these agencies are. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure that if they
wanna go into like say, </connor>
<connor> a lot of them are like
aspiring voice actors. </connor>
<connor> A lot of them are like aspiring
like that kind of stuff. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure getting into Hololive </connor>
<connor> is just a quick shortcut to getting to-- </connor>
<connor> - I'm totally open and happy if I'm wrong. </connor>
<connor> I hope that it's an amazing fucking deal. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause when was is it? </connor>
<connor> Like Coco had the most, what was it? </connor>
<garnt> - She was like the highest earning </garnt>
<garnt> super chat user in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> Like since debuting the art school, </garnt>
<garnt> I think she'd like earned
over like 800 or $900,000 </garnt>
<connor> which is fucking insane. </connor>
<garnt> - And like I hope most
of that's going to her. </garnt>
<garnt> Like she deserves that. </garnt>
<connor> She's the one that doing all the work </connor>
<garnt> for building this character. </garnt>
<garnt> She deserves that money. </garnt>
<connor> I'm hoping that they get that. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing about
especially Hololive talent </garnt>
<connor> is that everyone is extremely talented. </connor>
<connor> They obviously can hold
a stream really well, </connor>
<garnt> but a lot of it has other other
talents above that as well. </garnt>
<connor> - A lot of them do like a lot of like, </connor>
<garnt> covers and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of them do like singing stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and voice acting stuff.
- It's fucking awesome. </garnt>
<connor> - (indistinct) is a fucking
pro Tetris player or something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Morrigan like, she just
released a song the other day. </connor>
<connor> That's like fucking... </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - She's so talented. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm so proud of her, man. </garnt>
<connor> - God opens up and just
smiles at the lock screen. </connor>
<connor> I'm so proud of you, honey. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Move the picture of the
fucking Vtube (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like when Sydney walks in, </connor>
<connor> fucking change the tab.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's Sydney (indistinct), I mean, again-- </connor>
<connor> - I'm just trying to like sell them </connor>
<connor> because I feel like couldn't get </connor>
<connor> why I don't wanna get into
VTubers until I got into VTubers. </connor>
<connor> And now it's really fucking entertaining. </connor>
<connor> I really wanna talk about how... </connor>
<connor> The reason I'm so obsessed with them </connor>
<connor> is because it's just a
kind of entertainment </connor>
<connor> I couldn't find anywhere else. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I agree, it's definitely. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I guess 'cause like
when I hear about it, </connor>
<connor> and all of it, immediately
my mind is like, </connor>
<connor> I wanna know how this works. </connor>
<connor> Like that's immediately what I wanna know. </connor>
<connor> I only have an interesting anything else. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, this organization
sounds so unique. </connor>
<connor> Like, I wanna know how all this works. </connor>
<connor> How do you decide the cuts? </connor>
<connor> How do you decide what
rules they have and whatnot? </connor>
<garnt> That's so interesting, </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I feel like
that's why a lot of people </garnt>
<connor> got like mad at Pokimane
when she debuted her Vtuber-- </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Which I think is fucking dumb </garnt>
<connor> that we're fucking gate keeping people </connor>
<connor> putting an anime avatar
themselves like, come on guys. </connor>
<connor> - Gate keeping is already fucking dumb, </connor>
<connor> let alone this kind of gatekeeping. </connor>
<connor> - I think what that stems from </connor>
<connor> is the appeal of Vtubers like Hololive </connor>
<connor> is completely different
from just a normal stream </connor>
<connor> like putting an anime avatar above them. </connor>
<connor> Because like, it's that
character thing I talked about </connor>
<connor> where people don't view these
people as people what they do, </connor>
<garnt> but they also don't view them
as just a character as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's also
mainstream not mainstream, </connor>
<connor> our live streaming was was so mainstream, </connor>
<connor> like tuned into mainstream
especially with Fortnite. </connor>
<connor> I feel like everyone
fucking live streams now. </connor>
<connor> You're not special right? </connor>
<connor> Cool, go and watch Fortnite right? </connor>
<connor> Because this is something
like you told me this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I heard from someone at Twitch. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how accurate this is, </connor>
<connor> but apparently, if you average </connor>
<connor> over 10 viewers on Twitch per stream, </connor>
<connor> you're in the top 10% of Twitch. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - I hope that's real. </connor>
<connor> - If it's real, that's fucking crazy. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause every single
console can live stream now. </connor>
<connor> It's so fucking easy.
(indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - And so easy to like. </garnt>
<garnt> It used to be like, you'd
have a fucking beefy boy, </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm streaming, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I feel like it was almost... </garnt>
<garnt> At least I don't know, correct
me if I'm wrong, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it felt like. </garnt>
<garnt> It felt like this one thing </garnt>
<garnt> that felt kind of unique in streaming </garnt>
<garnt> was then mainstream-ified, </garnt>
<connor> then other people coming in. </connor>
<connor> There's dirty IRL streamers coming in. </connor>
<garnt> - Those dirty normies
coming into my circle. </garnt>
<garnt> Taking over my anime girls? </garnt>
<garnt> Nah, not today.
(laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I wish I could filter myself
live, like in my photos. </connor>
<connor> But I can't, so how about I
just make myself beautiful? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'll just remake myself completely. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I get it man, I'm lazy as fuck. </connor>
<connor> I look ugly as fuck in half
my streams bro, I wanna-- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, hey, man, I'm already prepared </connor>
<connor> to enjoy a couple of VTube
streams when I get home tonight. </connor>
<garnt> So Joey, I gotta ask,
who are your favorites? </garnt>
<connor> - All right, I'mma head out.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so the first one I
checked out was also Coco. </connor>
<garnt> Only because you fucking love her. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love Coco.
- And she's fucking great. </garnt>
<garnt> I love her. </garnt>
<connor> But then I found (speaks
in foreign language) </connor>
<garnt> - The best(indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen so many clips, she's funny. </connor>
<connor> - She's so fucking funny. </connor>
<garnt> - She's so cute.
- She's so cute. </garnt>
<garnt> She's so fucking cute. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I head pat her so bad.
- Oh, the head patting. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I wanna head pat her so bad. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna reach into the screen </connor>
<connor> so I can give her a head pat </connor>
<connor> because she's such a good fucking-- </connor>
<connor> - She's such a (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - And then recently I also
got into this other Vtuber, </garnt>
<garnt> NiKoma Takorone, </garnt>
<garnt> but she's got like the purple... </garnt>
<connor> She's a cat girl with purple hair. </connor>
<connor> But I fucking love her
because of her voice. </connor>
<connor> She kind of has like a tomboy-ish voice. </connor>
<connor> She kinda has like a
Sawashiro Miyuki voice </connor>
<connor> so a fucking like Celti's voice. </connor>
<connor> She has that exact type of voice </connor>
<connor> and I'm weak for that. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, so if you can
understand both English </connor>
<connor> and Japanese fluent, which one? </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> Like with VTubes? </connor>
<connor> Oh, Japanese for sure. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How come? </connor>
<connor> - Just 'cause I don't know the... </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I must say
you've ever say (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laugh drowns out voice of speaker) </connor>
<connor> - Even in Vtube-- </connor>
<connor> - Joey leaves to an
English speaking country, </connor>
<connor> God it's just not the fucking (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Drop that shit in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> (laughs)
(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Can you believe that shit? </connor>
<connor> - No because I'm very much like Seyu, </connor>
<connor> I have a Seyu fetish, like a voice fetish. </connor>
<connor> Like I love my fucking Seyus, </connor>
<connor> and if there's like one-- </connor>
<connor> - He's a Seyu simp. </connor>
<connor> - I'm a Seyu simp like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> like anything that's voiced </garnt>
<garnt> by like Sawashiro Miyuki or Kana Hanazawa, </garnt>
<garnt> I just immediately fucking
love because the voice </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel with Vtube, it's
kinda the same, but like... </garnt>
<garnt> But that's the thing though, </garnt>
<garnt> I found a few Hololives Japanese streamers </garnt>
<connor> who I really liked their voice, </connor>
<connor> but their personality
wasn't quite right for me, </connor>
<connor> so it's just kind of finding that </connor>
<connor> like perfect combination
of voice and personality. </connor>
<connor> And for me the top two right
now are Korone and Ohaiyu. </connor>
<connor> - Who should I watch to get into it? </connor>
<garnt> Who would you recommend for me to watch? </garnt>
<connor> I will watch it and I'll come back-- </connor>
<connor> - What kind of like content
are you looking for? </connor>
<garnt> Because there's so much... </garnt>
<connor> Is there a milf VTuber? </connor>
<connor> (laughs)
(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause me and Joe you're
playing this fucking arcade game. </connor>
<connor> It's so fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> It's like a huge pile of fucking men. </connor>
<connor> It's so fucking badass </connor>
<connor> and you have to pick like your wife </connor>
<connor> who always talks to you
when you tap your card. </connor>
<connor> - It's like six different
girls that you can choose from. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, dude milfs are
always the hottest (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - He picked the milf and
I picked the (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Why are you like
masterpiece (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - So I lock in the beautiful
older lady and very nice. </connor>
<connor> And I look on Joey, which one do you... </connor>
<connor> It's the fucking 10 year old (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (mimics voice)
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> My fucking God-- </connor>
<connor> - No she's a (indistinct)
bro, it's the best. . </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, yeah, masterpiece
is the best (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we'll leave that
for another episode. </garnt>
<connor> - Too many kid Hentais out there. </connor>
<connor> - But that what do you enjoy
and streamers, I should say, </connor>
<connor> it's not just about the character-- </connor>
<connor> - Or the monkey (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Well no, because I didn't
really enjoy watching XQC. </connor>
<connor> But I love Tyler1 and I feel
like that's so like close </connor>
<connor> in terms of the kinda energy they have. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know like, I
definitely do think like, </connor>
<connor> you're more into the
kind of like buff-like, </connor>
<garnt> yo, let's go kinda guys. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you love Tyler1,
Tectone's our boy like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Shout out to Tectone. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like the kind
of in the same realm, right? </connor>
<connor> Of like energy levels. </connor>
<connor> - I love watching small streamers. </connor>
<connor> Like be people like four viewers. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Because you always get the most like... </connor>
<connor> It's like you you get to watch
someone who's live streaming </connor>
<connor> who doesn't know how to live stream </connor>
<connor> and in such an endearing way </connor>
<connor> when you watch like a 10
year old playing Minecraft </connor>
<connor> and like that talking to the chat </connor>
<connor> as they've like learned from like ninja. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> So they're replicating
a big streamers behavior </connor>
<connor> but like not quite right </connor>
<connor> and it's really like uncanny. </connor>
<connor> - From the sound of
that then I don't think </connor>
<garnt> you can get into any Hololive VTuber, </garnt>
<connor> pretty fucking professional. </connor>
<connor> - They're all big and
they're all professionals. </connor>
<garnt> You might like some
smaller like Indie VTubers. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I saw I saw a few of them </connor>
<garnt> that were like 2D and it
was like 2D fishes moving </garnt>
<connor> and it was really janky and
I was like, oh that's cute. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> They didn't have enough money for the 3D. </connor>
<connor> I don't know I felt bad. </connor>
<connor> - They just use my face rig and shit. </connor>
<connor> - It was like yeah like face rig </connor>
<connor> but it didn't work properly. </connor>
<connor> I felt really bad </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, oh man, </connor>
<connor> but it's really endearing. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I really love like
watching viewers with like 20, 30 </connor>
<connor> because they're kind of
getting into the feel of it, </connor>
<connor> but not quite there. </connor>
<connor> Big streamers, </connor>
<connor> Yeah Tyler1 is definitely my favorite, </connor>
<connor> like even if I didn't
like League of Legends, </connor>
<connor> I think I just love him, </connor>
<connor> like back when he was
doing a variety streams, </connor>
<connor> he was amazing stuff, </connor>
<connor> like I think the Life of
Tyler1 is one of the-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you showed me. </connor>
<connor> - Is one of the best fucking
YouTube videos out there. </connor>
<connor> - That had to be one the greatest streams. </connor>
<connor> I wish I saw that.
- I wish I was there. </connor>
<connor> Like if you haven't watched this video </connor>
<connor> it's basically what he
does like a whole movie, </connor>
<connor> he reenacts it, like a budget movie. </connor>
<garnt> - That is like one of my
favorite streams of all. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the kind of streams I wanna do. </connor>
<garnt> I wanna do like events. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Kind of like I wanna have a stream </connor>
<connor> where it's like turn up
something dumb is gonna happen. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Like please. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I wanna do more-- </connor>
<connor> - Because like the way I see VTubers </connor>
<garnt> it's kind of like variety TV for me </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone's doing
something different, </garnt>
<garnt> like one of my favorite streamers to watch </garnt>
<garnt> because she just does some
really random shit sometimes, </garnt>
<connor> just Akai Haato or (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> And like what got me into her stuff </connor>
<connor> is she's just like, </connor>
<connor> she's just like pure chaos </connor>
<connor> and degeneracy into one right. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds good, I like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So this one time she was playing </connor>
<garnt> like get over it or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And like out of nowhere </garnt>
<connor> she just like smells her feet </connor>
<connor> because they like like
stink or something, right? </connor>
<connor> And then through that a meme started. </connor>
<connor> And then what she did right after that. </connor>
<connor> It's like one of the most current streams </connor>
<garnt> is that she asks her viewers
to send in feet videos </garnt>
<garnt> of just like, people doing </garnt>
<garnt> like the strangest things with feet. </garnt>
<connor> And then she reviews them </connor>
<garnt> and it's just equally
as hilarious and curse. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm gonna watch that. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds disgusting,
but really entertaining. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And another one is that </garnt>
<garnt> she starts reviewing her own lewds, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh like doujins of her? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, like rule 34. </garnt>
<connor> So she has like several tiers </connor>
<connor> of like lewdness. </connor>
<connor> And she posts like this black bar filter </connor>
<connor> over like the pictures, </connor>
<connor> so you can kind of see what's going on. </connor>
<connor> And you're just watching an
anime go review her own lewds. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like this is paid content. </connor>
<connor> Why am I even trying? </connor>
<connor> Like this is content you
cannot find anywhere else. </connor>
<connor> - That is like more meta than recreated. </connor>
<connor> - Can you send me a link
to this, I'll watch it. </connor>
<connor> Maybe I'll come in next week. </connor>
<garnt> And I'll be like, I wanna
take all my opinions back. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like entertaining. </connor>
<connor> It's just stuff </connor>
<connor> that real streamers can't get away with </connor>
<garnt> and then obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> you got like people who are
just really good at video games </garnt>
<garnt> with an anime avatar. </garnt>
<connor> - But then there are some that </connor>
<connor> are just fucking horrible at video games, </connor>
<connor> and they just make it </connor>
<connor> so fucking entertaining. </connor>
<connor> Because it takes them like six
hours to complete one level. </connor>
<connor> And they just constantly they just trying, </connor>
<connor> they're really just trying and struggling </connor>
<connor> and that shit is just cute to watch. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, fair enough. </connor>
<connor> Okay, man. </connor>
<connor> I'll give it a shot. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I do wanna preface again, </connor>
<connor> because I know some people
can be so fucking salty. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I don't wanna... </connor>
<connor> I don't hate VTubers. </connor>
<connor> - He just doesn't understand it. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't gotten into it yet. </connor>
<connor> And I would like to play devil's advocate. </connor>
<connor> - I was exactly like this last week. </connor>
<connor> - Because if it's just the
three of us talking around dicks </connor>
<connor> and agreeing on something, </connor>
<connor> it's not gonna be a very fun podcast. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I hate podcasts where like
yeah, you've got a point. </garnt>
<connor> I agree. </connor>
<connor> And then they also agree. </connor>
<connor> - Then they nod their
head for two minutes. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't fucking stand it. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know I just
feel like VTuber content </connor>
<connor> is the natural progression </connor>
<connor> to like anyone who really
go into the Waifu culture. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like we, like us. </connor>
<garnt> Like you that's so. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I've got I've gotten into it, </connor>
<connor> but I guess I wonder why I haven't gone </connor>
<garnt> on the off the deep end yet. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean-- </garnt>
<connor> - Because you've never stepped in yet. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, obviously you never went </connor>
<connor> into the deep end with the Waifu culture, </connor>
<connor> you just kind of like-- </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Who's your best girl? </garnt>
<garnt> Who's your Waifu Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - No, because this is... </connor>
<connor> You you can't do... </connor>
<connor> That's a loaded question. </connor>
<connor> - If you can't answer </connor>
<connor> within five seconds then
you don't have a Waifu. </connor>
<connor> - That's like saying what's
your favorite genocide? </connor>
<connor> There's no Waifu </connor>
<connor> someone's gonna be angry like. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - That's the point of Waifus, man, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't please anyone. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can immediately answer that question. </garnt>
<connor> - Suzuhara. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - Because she's a goat, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah she is, I agree. </connor>
<connor> - Because I for some reason, I like... </connor>
<connor> The whole rental girlfriend thing, </connor>
<connor> sounds so fucking fun. </connor>
<connor> I would love to do that
job, that sounds fun. </connor>
<connor> I would love to be in a situation </connor>
<connor> to test my acting skills-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - To be someone else's
like, to meet that grandma </connor>
<connor> and have to cry. </connor>
<connor> That sounds like fun. </connor>
<connor> Does that make me psychotic? </connor>
<garnt> - A little bit. </garnt>
<connor> - That's kind of what
you do on your YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Basically.
- Yeah, </connor>
<connor> I mean you just did it
until I fucking series </connor>
<connor> where you had a bunch of-- </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't that series but I
would love to like actually try </connor>
<connor> and like fucking pretend </connor>
<connor> and see like it would be believable. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why that sounds fun to me. </connor>
<connor> - Some people will definitely
call that sociopathic. </connor>
<connor> - Probably that's a little sociopathic. </connor>
<connor> What was the point of this? </connor>
<connor> Oh Suzuhara.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> I think she's a goat, man. </connor>
<connor> She's just a goat, man. </connor>
<garnt> - I fucking loves Suzuhara. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just made a fucking video about her. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The point is genocide is bad. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Okay, when the whole Waifu culture, right? </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Is it like a thing where </connor>
<connor> when I would like I would
fight for my favorite Waifu. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I felt like it was a
thing where it was like, </connor>
<connor> I genuinely like this character. </connor>
<connor> But I'm putting on an act, </connor>
<connor> like I don't actually
care about them that much. </connor>
<connor> Like, I figured that
everyone was the same way. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why this we're both taken men. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I'm getting fucking
married next year. </garnt>
<connor> - Is this cause like your
relationships aren't satisfying. </connor>
<connor> Like, God I gotta find something else </connor>
<connor> to just fill that void. </connor>
<connor> - No, because I see Waifus
in a totally different realm </connor>
<connor> than I see real people. </connor>
<connor> because I think like--
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It has to be stated. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> I think it does. </connor>
<connor> - I think people some people are like </connor>
<connor> when they say, your 2D is better than 3D. </connor>
<connor> Most people just say it is a gag. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - I've met some people
who are legitimately like, </connor>
<connor> nah, fuck 3D women, 2D is the way to go. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct)
- Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> But we don't like that. </connor>
<connor> We just say that as a fucking gag. </connor>
<connor> - You've had your fill of the 3D </connor>
<garnt> you're not satisfied. </garnt>
<connor> - I like the idea of like, </connor>
<connor> the Waifus or some of the Waifus. </connor>
<connor> - What's the idea? </connor>
<garnt> - The idea that you can simp for them, </garnt>
<connor> but there's no actual
repercussions for the simping. </connor>
<connor> - I hate that the word
simp has been invented. </connor>
<connor> Because now it just it replaces all nuance </connor>
<connor> of like explaining the feeling. </connor>
<connor> - But here's the thing, </connor>
<connor> you can simp for an actual real person, </connor>
<connor> but you can't see...
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> But you can't simp for an anime character. </connor>
<connor> Just that's just not how it works. </connor>
<connor> But I think some people
just tend to think like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I can simp an anime character. </connor>
<connor> But you can't. </connor>
<garnt> They're not even real. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't simp if they don't exist. </garnt>
<connor> - You can't simp if they don't exist. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why I just seemed, </garnt>
<connor> like I was under the impression
that everyone was like, </connor>
<connor> pretending to act like to
feel this strongly about it. </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm sure there are some people. </connor>
<connor> - I thought that we were all just like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I'll kill you for them, </connor>
<connor> I didn't think anyone actually
was like serious about that. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I mean, I'm not serious about that. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, that's that's
part of the fun of it. </connor>
<connor> - We all agree that it's like-- </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - Did you think we won? </connor>
<connor> - Wait, on what side? </connor>
<connor> - Did you think we-- </connor>
<connor> - Did you honestly think
that if you said like, </connor>
<connor> oh yeah Shinobu is shit
that I would come out </connor>
<connor> after you with a fucking knife. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's what you just said. </connor>
<connor> I was under the impression
that everyone was like, </connor>
<connor> we're all pretending
to feel this strongly. </connor>
<connor> - We are serious but we're not like, </connor>
<garnt> I will fucking commit genocide. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not pretending because-- </connor>
<connor> - You feel strongly, </connor>
<connor> but it's not genuinely a strong emotion. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I feel strongly about
a fictional character. </connor>
<connor> - About the act your putting on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we're committed to the media. </connor>
<connor> - It's an act, right? </connor>
<connor> Like this is what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> Like, I feel like I've met some people </connor>
<connor> who can't turn that shit off </connor>
<connor> and they don't know if it's an act. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing, we can turn it off. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> No, we can turn it off. </connor>
<connor> But that's because we have a brightness </connor>
<connor> and we can turn it off. </connor>
<connor> Some people can't turn it off. </connor>
<connor> - Like you know how people think like, </connor>
<connor> everyone just agrees the moon
landing didn't happen right? </connor>
<connor> It's like that this is
actually a conspiracy theory. </connor>
<connor> I was like, we all agree
that we're acting right? </connor>
<garnt> When we talk about these Waifu. </garnt>
<connor> This is actually a conspiracy theory, </connor>
<connor> where no one actually
feels strongly about it. </connor>
<connor> - It's like some American psycho shit. </connor>
<connor> - It's like what define feel strongly? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you mean by feel strongly? </garnt>
<connor> - You would never get
upset, like genuinely upset. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm talking like, </connor>
<connor> like crying over sanctity
with a fictional character. </connor>
<connor> - Some people will though. </connor>
<garnt> - Some people will. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, this is not
to do with the story. </connor>
<connor> Like this is like stuff to do with like, </connor>
<connor> outside emotions that you're bringing in. </connor>
<connor> - No some people will. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<garnt> - We're not that people. </garnt>
<garnt> - What you're describing </garnt>
<garnt> is exactly the same way as people who shit </garnt>
<garnt> on your favorite anime. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, you've seen the reactions </connor>
<garnt> where if you shit on some anime, </garnt>
<connor> people gonna like react strongly to that. </connor>
<garnt> - The episode hasn't gone live yet. </garnt>
<connor> Where we shit on the fandoms </connor>
<connor> but I'm sure we'll see. </connor>
<connor> - You've seen the smear campaign </connor>
<connor> that went against like me when I said </connor>
<connor> that fairy tale was shit, right? </connor>
<connor> - It wasn't a smear campaign. </connor>
<connor> - It was a smear campaign. </connor>
<connor> - Why I'm i still getting hate? </connor>
<connor> - They were like defend fairy tale </connor>
<connor> from the anime man, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'm not the only person </connor>
<connor> who said that fairy tale shit. </connor>
<connor> But that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> There are varying degrees. </connor>
<connor> - Do you think that that the whole like, </connor>
<garnt> simping over the Waifu and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> is just the extension of the show? </garnt>
<connor> And the like of the show? </connor>
<connor> - It's kind of the same
emotional attachments. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - As the as the resident Waifuologist, </connor>
<connor> I just made that title up. </connor>
<connor> - Really, I would never guessed that, </connor>
<connor> you really didn't have to clarify that. </connor>
<connor> - I've always found Waifu culture </connor>
<connor> like super fascinating, </connor>
<garnt> also because like I love it. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it's like an
act that everyone agrees </connor>
<garnt> to just play along with. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but at what point is... </garnt>
<connor> Here's what's interesting. </connor>
<garnt> At what point is like the attachment </garnt>
<connor> you feel towards a Waifu? </connor>
<garnt> At what point do we all agree </garnt>
<connor> that it becomes unhealthy, right? </connor>
<connor> Because like to me, I can... </connor>
<connor> To me, I can clearly separate my love </connor>
<connor> towards a fictional character. </connor>
<connor> My love towards like real people, </connor>
<connor> because I can safely say that, </connor>
<connor> some of like, my favorite Waifus, </connor>
<garnt> they would be fucking
assholes if they existed </garnt>
<garnt> in real life.
(laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, my God. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what you get for liking Syndra? </connor>
<garnt> - Imagine having a real life Syndra </garnt>
<garnt> who fucking hits you </garnt>
<garnt> for like, the stupidest shit? </garnt>
<connor> - Which is why </connor>
<connor> I don't understand about people who say </connor>
<connor> that Syndra is I mean, </connor>
<connor> I can't really speak much
cause mine is the same. </connor>
<connor> But like, at least my Waifu doesn't like </connor>
<connor> to hit people, </connor>
<connor> like for no fucking reason, right? </connor>
<connor> Your Waifu hits people
for no fucking reason. </connor>
<connor> - These men are disgusting
as if it's like, man, </connor>
<connor> if she was real, what would she do to me? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's weird, right? </connor>
<connor> Because no one defined the rules </connor>
<connor> on how to know act about or talk about it, </connor>
<garnt> but everyone just kind
of had this agreement, </garnt>
<garnt> but that we're gonna act and all engage </garnt>
<garnt> in a way like just like
it's a sports team. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, just like a common sense thing-- </connor>
<connor> - But some people have taken it too far. </connor>
<connor> - There's always gonna be
people who take it to far right? </connor>
<connor> - It's like fantasy football. </connor>
<connor> Some people just take it a little too far </connor>
<connor> and a little too seriously, </connor>
<connor> even though they know it doesn't exist. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, well, </connor>
<connor> it's like when people like give shit </connor>
<connor> to the team that like, you motherfucker, </connor>
<connor> I have $10 on this fucking
game, why don't you go? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like cause I would say, </connor>
<connor> it's all about the suspension
of disbelief right. </connor>
<connor> There's so many Waifus that work </connor>
<garnt> simply because they are anime characters. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's that's what
really works into hey, </garnt>
<garnt> I can really fucking love this character </garnt>
<garnt> and what she represents
but there's no fucking way </garnt>
<garnt> that she exists in real life </garnt>
<garnt> and I could be with someone like that. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the exact reason why
I'm okay with maid characters </connor>
<connor> but I can't stand maid cafes, like that-- </connor>
<connor> - My fucking God, going into a maid cafe </connor>
<connor> is the cringiest shit--
- It's so cringy. </connor>
<garnt> - I have ever been to. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is extremely cringy </garnt>
<garnt> and I just don't understand. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I don't mind the whole
like ghosting someone thing </garnt>
<connor> like if it's a fucking fictional
2D character on my screen. </connor>
<connor> But then when I went into a maid cafe </connor>
<connor> and a real life woman said that to me </connor>
<connor> in the exact same way, </connor>
<garnt> I was like, please stop. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I remember like peak mid 2000s </garnt>
<connor> like cringe culture was all about like, </connor>
<connor> seeing people act like anime
characters in real life </connor>
<connor> and I still like, to this
day, I still fucking cringe-- </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't translate. </connor>
<connor> - Whenever someone tries to
act like an anime character. </connor>
<connor> And that's whether it's
a fucking Western fan, </connor>
<connor> or is someone Japanese and it never gets. </connor>
<garnt> - It could be the cutest Japanese girl, </garnt>
<connor> it's still cringe. </connor>
<connor> - I think also being
British and Australia where </connor>
<garnt> I think we like our social rules </garnt>
<garnt> are a lot different to Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just anything like that, </connor>
<connor> it's just instinctively uncomfortable. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where you're putting on an act </connor>
<connor> and putting me above you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think in real life. </connor>
<connor> I think most people don't like it </connor>
<connor> when people pretend to be
anything other than a human. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I turn into you when you view Youtubers, </garnt>
<connor> whenever like someone acts
like an anime character, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, please
act like a human being, </connor>
<connor> I know your not an anime character. </connor>
<connor> - Like you put a fucking 3D model. </connor>
<connor> Let's go. </connor>
<connor> - That's it, put a 2D avatar. </connor>
<connor> - Is it the eye contact? </connor>
<connor> Is it that they have eyes? </connor>
<connor> You can see their eyes </connor>
<connor> and you can see the fuck it's
like death in their eyes. </connor>
<connor> Please stop. </connor>
<connor> I can see it in your eyes. </connor>
<connor> This is uncomfortable for both of us. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because every time I
walk into a maid cafe, </connor>
<connor> I know they're not doing it </connor>
<connor> because that's what they
really are like, right? </connor>
<garnt> - No because when you're a VTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a screen there is a screen-- </garnt>
<connor> - That's the barrier. </connor>
<connor> - You can't you cannot
physically interact with them. </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - As as a British person, </connor>
<connor> I get uncomfortable when people smile. </connor>
<connor> Like when McDonald's employees smile. </connor>
<connor> Like that's how much I
do not want you to act. </connor>
<connor> You should not be happy
working at McDonald's. </connor>
<connor> I worked in McDonald's. </connor>
<connor> And if you're smiling, </connor>
<connor> I'm like you don't get
paid enough to smile. </connor>
<connor> Don't smile. </connor>
<connor> - It's like saying </connor>
<connor> that your favorite animal is a lion </connor>
<connor> and you really enjoy
watching lions at a zoo </connor>
<connor> because it's from a distance. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> But if you're in the cage </garnt>
<connor> with an actual lion, you're like, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna get in,
I don't wanna be here. </connor>
<connor> - There's potential death there. </connor>
<connor> In McDonald's, when I'm there </connor>
<connor> and they look at me and they smile at me </connor>
<connor> asking for my order I'm like, </connor>
<connor> this is a lie. </connor>
<connor> You're not happy about receiving my order. </connor>
<connor> I know you're not, don't pretend. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's even that
that level of fakeness </connor>
<connor> is uncomfortable for me, </connor>
<connor> especially in the UK right? </connor>
<connor> You'll never see a fucking
McDonald's employee smile </connor>
<connor> and when they do, like stop that, </connor>
<connor> I'm ordering--
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Stop smiling right now. </connor>
<connor> - It's like watching a
Youtuber be really nice </connor>
<connor> when you know they're
an asshole in real life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just stop man.
(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know, I think it's like, </connor>
<connor> again with maid cultures, we don't like it </connor>
<connor> when people are fake to us. </connor>
<connor> And when we know they're being fake to us. </connor>
<connor> And I guess that's why YouTubers </connor>
<connor> and livestreamers have
done well for for so long </connor>
<connor> because it's poised as this real thing. </connor>
<connor> It's a genuine thing and there
are some people out there </connor>
<connor> who are and there are
also people out there </connor>
<garnt> who most definitely aren't. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is why like I never understood </connor>
<connor> like real Japanese idol culture in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Because the one thing I didn't understand </connor>
<connor> was this idea that
these real human beings, </connor>
<connor> needed to be perfect, </connor>
<connor> that is the Japanese culture. </connor>
<connor> If they're anything but perfect, </connor>
<connor> they kept fucking destroyed.
- They need to be pure. </connor>
<garnt> More pure than anyone can be. </garnt>
<connor> - Their whole life is over. </connor>
<garnt> - To me that that is that is
the unhealthy side of things. </garnt>
<connor> - Stochastic as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's when you are
imbuing fictional aspects </connor>
<connor> to real people </connor>
<connor> and you expect real people to
act like fictional characters. </connor>
<connor> The reason Waifus work </connor>
<garnt> is because they can be perfect </garnt>
<garnt> or they it's the idea
of them that is perfect. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember one fucking
great Japanese meme </connor>
<connor> that came out of about years
ago like this started on Twitch </connor>
<garnt> but there was a thread </garnt>
<garnt> of some person fucking critiquing idols </garnt>
<garnt> and the idol culture
and that kind of shit. </garnt>
<connor> And there was this one reply </connor>
<connor> of this like absolute simp for idols, </connor>
<connor> who was like, idols don't poop. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> They don't poop. </connor>
<connor> They're so pure </connor>
<connor> that they don't even poop. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't that something like </connor>
<connor> North Korea says about Kim Jong. </connor>
<connor> - He doesn't poop. </connor>
<connor> It's just rainbows but yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, he doesn't waste, there's no waste. </connor>
<connor> - There's no waste. </connor>
<connor> - It's converted into cause
he's a perfect a human being. </connor>
<connor> It all gets converted to energy. </connor>
<connor> - And then that turned into a meme </connor>
<connor> where it's like if something is so pure, </connor>
<connor> they just like yeah, they don't poop. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, they don't poo. </garnt>
<connor> Idols don't poop, they're
perfect in every sense. </connor>
<garnt> - They shit rainbows. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they shit rainbows. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll eat their shit, why not? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a lion. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Already cloudy, it's like Mike was out. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, oh my God it's hard </connor>
<connor> because there's so many... </connor>
<connor> I guess because VTubers have
gotten in that perfect spot </connor>
<connor> where it's like it is
done the everything right </connor>
<connor> that kind of goes against
the rules of other things </connor>
<garnt> that would make them comfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I find it fucking amazing </garnt>
<garnt> how just how quickly VTubers have exploded </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember when Kizuna Ai debuted, </garnt>
<garnt> like she started a massive
fucking wave of Japanese VTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> And nobody here gave a shit at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Some people do like
Kizuna Ai but I think-- </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it was Kizuna Ai, </garnt>
<garnt> and like there was like
a top three, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was Kaguya Luna and like Siro, </connor>
<garnt> i think were the top three. </garnt>
<connor> They had the most attention </connor>
<connor> and then there was like a BTA of like, </connor>
<garnt> like kind of smaller like 100K, </garnt>
<garnt> and then the CT was like, </garnt>
<connor> actual 1000s, 10s of 1000s. </connor>
<garnt> - But like I feel like
we're just on the cusp </garnt>
<garnt> of like something similar happening </garnt>
<garnt> to the English speaking culture. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm excited because it's fun </connor>
<connor> because I feel like it could
either be like you said like </connor>
<connor> something giant could comment
really establish itself </connor>
<connor> or it could be a flash in the pan. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's a little
bit different though </connor>
<garnt> than the the Vtubers, Youtubers are, </garnt>
<garnt> because with the Vtuber, Youtubers side </garnt>
<garnt> there was this like big three </garnt>
<connor> or like there was a
couple of really big faces </connor>
<connor> that were kind of pulling
the entire community. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that will happen there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I feel that
with like the live stream </connor>
<connor> is like with Hololive and Ninjisanji. </connor>
<connor> Everybody's kind of at
the top at the same time, </connor>
<connor> like the entire community
is growing at once. </connor>
<connor> It's not so much one
person leading the way. </connor>
<connor> - It will eventually level out there. </connor>
<garnt> This video is also sponsored by Ej Anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the same with Japan. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Fuck you Connor. </connor>
<connor> - You got this time. </connor>
<connor> - Ej Anime store is Kamikaze
official anime merge store </connor>
<connor> and once again today they have brought us </connor>
<connor> a collection of some of
the newest anime figurines </connor>
<connor> that you can get only on Ej Anime store. </connor>
<connor> - So the first one </connor>
<connor> that we have at the front there </connor>
<connor> is echidnas from the new
Re:Zero anime season. </connor>
<connor> This is the echidnas tea party version. </connor>
<garnt> - The girl who just
destroyed every other girl </garnt>
<garnt> by being introduced in season two. </garnt>
<garnt> Sorry Beatrice, I'm
simping over echidnas now. </garnt>
<connor> - This man changes his mind quicker </connor>
<connor> than the wind changes direction. </connor>
<connor> - But the great thing about this figure </connor>
<connor> is that it includes a
letter written by the author </connor>
<connor> of the original Re:Zero
light novel series. </connor>
<connor> now that's key topic </connor>
<connor> as an exclusive bonus. </connor>
<connor> - We also have the Angel Beats figure </connor>
<connor> in the front which is
the Kanade Tachibana. </connor>
<connor> Its keys 20th anniversary </connor>
<connor> and this is the gothic Lolita version. </connor>
<connor> The special edition includes
an A4 acrylic standard </connor>
<connor> and exclusive bonus. </connor>
<garnt> - And we also got the Strike
the Bloods Yukina Himaragi </garnt>
<garnt> tropical wedding version. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tropical wedding. </garnt>
<connor> I actually do like the the ribbon, </connor>
<connor> like kind of fluttering
around in the dress </connor>
<connor> and everything it's got
a lot of movement to it. </connor>
<garnt> - This is celebrating the completion </garnt>
<garnt> of the original Strike the
Blood light novel series. </garnt>
<connor> - I actually can't believe </connor>
<garnt> I know they've been
going on for that long. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know right. </garnt>
<connor> - I swear it started in like mid 2000s. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember seeing like anytime </garnt>
<garnt> there's a new Strike the Bloods </garnt>
<connor> or like Strike Witches anime series. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<connor> man, they're still going on? </connor>
<connor> Is this still going on, seriously? </connor>
<connor> - But wait, does it come
with a special item? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, this special sale
includes a big tapestry </garnt>
<garnt> of the original created illustration </garnt>
<garnt> that inspired this figure. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, the one I wanna talk about </connor>
<connor> is this one at the back here, </connor>
<connor> which is the Konosuba figure </connor>
<connor> and it's a double figurine of Iris </connor>
<connor> and Megumin. </connor>
<garnt> - I will say this figure is
heavily pushing monetization </garnt>
<garnt> on our channel. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you very much. </garnt>
<connor> But yeah, this is the Konosuba continued </connor>
<connor> and explosion on this wonderful wall. </connor>
<connor> Irisin Megumin lightened
little thief version. </connor>
<connor> And this set includes a
larger rubber play mat </connor>
<connor> as an exclusive bonus.
- A play mat? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like the stuff that
you can play like yogioh on. </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was like the kids </connor>
<connor> when they have like the car.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I mean if my kid played all that, </connor>
<connor> I'll be like, my man. </connor>
<garnt> - And finally, we have
the Sword online figure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey's favorite anime.
- I love it. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the action of
midsummer sparkle bride version. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, as much as I don't rate the show, </connor>
<connor> I wanna do long lesson
online is it's figurines, </connor>
<connor> like that's nice. </connor>
<connor> That's a nice figure, I would get that. </connor>
<connor> - Celebrating the 10th anniversary </connor>
<connor> of the original light novel series, </connor>
<connor> we introduce astronaut
running along the beach </connor>
<connor> in a wedding inspired bikini </connor>
<connor> from the catacomb
collection figure series. </connor>
<connor> This figure includes a big tapestry </connor>
<connor> of the original creative illustration </connor>
<connor> that inspired the figure
as an exclusive bonus. </connor>
<connor> - Lots of exclusive bonuses
only at Ej Anime store. </connor>
<garnt> - So yes, if you liked
any of the figures-- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, if you love these figures, </garnt>
<garnt> which we know you did. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's right, my bad man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry if you loved any of these figures, </garnt>
<garnt> then you go to Ej Anime store. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man. </garnt>
<garnt> - God fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> - E-J-animestore.com. </garnt>
<connor> - Link's in the description. </connor>
<connor> - They're constantly adding
new stuff to the store. </connor>
<connor> So go and keep checking it out. </connor>
<connor> - Thank you Ej Anime store
for sponsoring this episode. </connor>
<connor> - Back to the video. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, I feel like we're in a cusp </garnt>
<connor> of like just a new genre
being like birthed. </connor>
<connor> - I hope so. </connor>
<connor> - Like cause I wouldn't be surprised </connor>
<connor> if like in a year or something, </connor>
<connor> Twitch has a VTuber category on stream. </connor>
<connor> - That'd be cool. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's that's
kind of what I feel like </connor>
<garnt> we're about to experience, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's weird that
it's didn't this past week, </garnt>
<connor> where it's just gone from
this kind of cult following to </connor>
<connor> everyone kind of talking about it </connor>
<connor> and livestream circuit now.
- I hope so. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I'm always down for anything </connor>
<connor> that like spices up a little bit. </connor>
<connor> I feel like live streaming has
been a bit stale for a while. </connor>
<connor> And even if I'm not into it right now, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's gonna be
someone I like and again, </connor>
<connor> the ones I have seen I've rather enjoyed, </connor>
<garnt> just haven't gotten into it to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where I feel very strongly about someone. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] All right. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I just like people's content. </connor>
<connor> That's basically how I see. </connor>
<connor> I see VTubers. </connor>
<connor> People are gonna make
the simp memes whatever, </connor>
<connor> you're gonna make it anyway. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> But I respect them the same way </garnt>
<connor> I respect any other content creator </connor>
<connor> on YouTube or any streamer on Twitch. </connor>
<connor> - Because they like if you honestly </connor>
<connor> if you take away the whole
like anime girl facade away, </connor>
<connor> they just genuinely really
fucking good entertainers. </connor>
<connor> - Dude if Dior's voice actor
became a Vtuber, it's all over, </connor>
<connor> now I'm gonna simp. </connor>
<garnt> - When we get like officially
established voice actors </garnt>
<connor> to do vtubing, man it's over. </connor>
<garnt> - It's gonna happen </garnt>
<connor> - They gotta get (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - One thing I do find funny though, </garnt>
<garnt> is that I know several people like myself, </garnt>
<garnt> who like we're very big
anime fans obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> who now watch way less anime, </garnt>
<garnt> just because vtubing has (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - It's like Friendship Ended With Anime, </connor>
<connor> New Best Friend, Hololive. </connor>
<connor> - It's like that Toy Story meme, </connor>
<connor> like, I need to get rid of the toy. </connor>
<garnt> I don't wanna play with you anymore. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Honestly though, like just this weekend </connor>
<connor> I had so many plans </connor>
<connor> and they were just completely ruined </connor>
<connor> by the fact that I got into Hololive. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just gonna masturbate. </connor>
<garnt> - Had to cross all those out. </garnt>
<connor> - Because I feel like it's
just been the perfect storm </connor>
<connor> of 2020 being one of... </connor>
<connor> I think we can all agree 2020 </connor>
<connor> has been one of like the
weakest years of anime </connor>
<connor> in quite a while. </connor>
<connor> That's not just the fault
of the anime coming out. </connor>
<garnt> Obviously there's the
entire world situation, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's also that-- </garnt>
<connor> - Nothing's really like,
excited everybody unanimously. </connor>
<garnt> There's been, series like, right to go for </garnt>
<garnt> and that kind of stuff who have like, </garnt>
<garnt> some people have gotten excited about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But there hasn't been that one show </garnt>
<connor> that everyone's like, yes, let's go. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, other than
Re:Zero and Rent a Girlfriend </connor>
<garnt> and maybe like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck that Demon
fucking school thing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Demon school. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct)
(laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I would even say that. </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen a lot less hype
around these big shows, </garnt>
<connor> which are the biggest right now, </connor>
<connor> than I would say in other years. </connor>
<connor> - I wonder if it's also a mixture of like, </connor>
<connor> a great pretender being kind of scattered. </connor>
<garnt> And all the big Netflix shows </garnt>
<garnt> kind of being thrown out there, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of not really
allowing much discussion, </garnt>
<connor> in a way that, okay, if
there's less discussion </connor>
<connor> going on on social media, </connor>
<connor> because less people are
watching in the same way. </connor>
<connor> I guess it makes it way easier to then </connor>
<connor> get behind something like
Hololive where it's live, </connor>
<connor> and the memes can be shared instantly. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like just VTubers </garnt>
<connor> are the hot thing right now. </connor>
<connor> And it's just what's on
everyone's feed right now. </connor>
<connor> - Right, that's why I'm really interested </connor>
<garnt> to see how it will level out. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it will, </garnt>
<garnt> if it will keep growing up.
- I hope so. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I hope so, more interesting. </connor>
<connor> - Speaking of like Netflix
anime and everything, </connor>
<connor> like this weekend, I haven't
done this in a while. </connor>
<connor> But I watched an entire
show in like one day. </connor>
<connor> - Get out of here.
- What is this 2013? </connor>
<connor> - It's so weird. </connor>
<connor> - What show was it?
- It's Dorohedoro. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've watched that too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - So it's beem a while, like I
started watching a while ago, </connor>
<connor> completely forgot what happened. </connor>
<connor> - It's amazing right? </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Here's the thing--
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I've never lost a job
so quick in my life. </connor>
<garnt> - I just like the way you
said that so casually, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's amazing right? </garnt>
<garnt> - And I just said so. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, okay, here's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I did like it. </garnt>
<connor> But it's one of these things </connor>
<connor> that makes me hate
being like an anime fan. </connor>
<connor> Because it's one of those--
- I simp over it. </connor>
<garnt> - I have this experience so often, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So you have you have
this 13 episode series. </garnt>
<garnt> It's got so much potential. </garnt>
<garnt> It has a really interesting world. </garnt>
<garnt> It has really cool characters. </garnt>
<connor> And then just as you start to
get invested in everything, </connor>
<connor> nothing really happens. </connor>
<connor> - That's why you read the Manga, bruh. </connor>
<connor> - That was Dorohedoro for me. </connor>
<garnt> Because I really love the world. </garnt>
<garnt> It's one of the most interesting worlds </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen in a while. </garnt>
<connor> Like the whole, it's so fucking brutal. </connor>
<connor> And the magic system is
really weird as well. </connor>
<connor> It's a really-- </connor>
<connor> - It's unconventional, </connor>
<connor> it's very unconventional. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like Mad
Max timed psychopaths </connor>
<garnt> or something along those lines. </garnt>
<connor> - Does something have to happen? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause we're probably gonna
get a season two probably. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's no guarantee. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially that's that's the thing, right? </garnt>
<connor> That's the thing about being an anime fan. </connor>
<connor> With so many shows, you're
just in fucking limbo. </connor>
<connor> You're like, </connor>
<connor> just tell me if I'm
gonna get another season </connor>
<connor> or tell me if I'm not. </connor>
<garnt> I just wanna know, should I just go ahead </garnt>
<garnt> and binge the Manga or should I wait? </garnt>
<connor> - With Dorohedoro you should. </connor>
<connor> - To be fair Netflix has been pretty good </connor>
<connor> with making season two's for that. </connor>
<garnt> - We've got a lot better recently. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, like I was
really enjoying myself </garnt>
<garnt> with Dorohedoro, </garnt>
<garnt> but it just ended and I
was just feeling like-- </garnt>
<connor> - Empty inside. </connor>
<connor> - I can't remember exactly what happened. </connor>
<connor> - That's exactly it. </connor>
<connor> - It's been like, since
we started the podcast </connor>
<connor> when I watched this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I remember. </connor>
<connor> - That's two months. </connor>
<connor> - That's not two months. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it came out way earlier than that. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like four months
ago I watched that shit. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - We didn't start this
podcast like four months ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like 20 weeks ago. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- No fucking way. </connor>
<garnt> - This is episode 18, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - So I watched-- </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is 2020, man? </connor>
<connor> I was like this is episode five right? </connor>
<connor> We've been on trash day
for like two months. </connor>
<connor> - Your like a fucking comatose
patient on the podcast. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, I watched it like then </connor>
<connor> and I remember being really fucking happy </connor>
<connor> that it felt so fucking refreshing. </connor>
<connor> It was like a fucking glass of
orange juice in the morning, </connor>
<connor> I was like, damn, that's nice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the Manga especially. </connor>
<connor> - I read a few of the
chapters of the Manga </connor>
<connor> where it left off and
I was like, holy shit. </connor>
<connor> - Hiya Sedekyu's odd,
it's just fucking insane. </connor>
<connor> - I felt fine being like you know what? </connor>
<connor> I can tell the story isn't
getting to the best bits </connor>
<garnt> and that's totally fine. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I get it. </garnt>
<connor> - It's nowhere near
getting to the best bits. </connor>
<connor> - It's fine. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's fine. </connor>
<connor> It's just annoying, right? </connor>
<garnt> Because I like experiencing
the best part of stories. </garnt>
<garnt> I like seeing stories go from like, </garnt>
<garnt> at least hits one kind of climax </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like-- </garnt>
<connor> - There was Attack on Titan season two. </connor>
<garnt> That's what it was. </garnt>
<garnt> - My problem with Dorohedoro </garnt>
<garnt> was that I can't point to
a single part to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a huge climax happening right now. </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't have to have that though. </connor>
<garnt> Like literally the slice </garnt>
<connor> of life fucking like literally
just named slice alive. </connor>
<connor> Like nothing climatic ever happens. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that the thing, </connor>
<connor> I feel the reason why Dorohedoro
was so unique in that sense </connor>
<connor> is because it poses this incredible world </connor>
<connor> and these incredible characters </connor>
<connor> and yet they really take
their time to like-- </connor>
<connor> - And they don't mind you
showing you the characters </connor>
<connor> you might not be interested in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because eventually
they will become interesting </connor>
<connor> and it's a slowly building up world. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't give a shit about. </garnt>
<connor> - No, i can say it's perfectly, </connor>
<connor> it just didn't feel like a season. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it felt like, </connor>
<connor> alright, we've just run out of time. </connor>
<garnt> Let's just cut the season off basically. </garnt>
<garnt> Like with most anime seasons, </garnt>
<garnt> you have some kind of climax, </garnt>
<garnt> you have a season finale. </garnt>
<garnt> This didn't really feel
like a season finale. </garnt>
<garnt> You just kind of just ended. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I feel like I don't need that. </connor>
<connor> Like sometimes the ride is
better than the destination. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - I want a complete package with my story. </garnt>
<connor> - Well because I feel the
same thing kind of happened </connor>
<garnt> with Beastars as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah Beastars didn't end satisfyingly. </garnt>
<garnt> - There wasn't really-
- No, that had a climax. </garnt>
<connor> - Where was the climax? </connor>
<garnt> - The stage performance? </garnt>
<connor> - No, not just the safe performance, </connor>
<connor> but they fucked when he... </connor>
<connor> I can't say this without
going into spoilers. </connor>
<connor> - You can spoil it,
just say spoiler alert. </connor>
<connor> - But when he saved her, </connor>
<connor> that was pretty climactic. </connor>
<garnt> That was the end of a story. </garnt>
<connor> - Dorohedoro had equivalents of that. </connor>
<connor> When he bled out his magic juice. </connor>
<garnt> And they had to get it back or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember what happened. </garnt>
<connor> - Something like that yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember just being like
fucking hyped, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Not everything like needs to
have a neat package, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, it does.
- No it doesn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes it does. </garnt>
<garnt> - No it doesn't, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Literally The Lord of the Rings movie </connor>
<connor> like it's a mess bro. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I think at least at the end </garnt>
<garnt> of the Lord of the Rings movie, </garnt>
<garnt> you still have some kind of closure, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like, that was
that was a cool story. </garnt>
<connor> - I swear like what the fuck happens </connor>
<connor> in the second Lord of the
Rings film at the end? </connor>
<connor> - There's two towers. </connor>
<connor> That's the only thing I remember. </connor>
<garnt> - There was that climactic
battle at the end of two towers. </garnt>
<connor> - That wasn't the end of it though. </connor>
<garnt> - What you mean it wasn't the end of it? </garnt>
<connor> That was the end of the battle. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the end of the battle,
not the end of the movie. </connor>
<connor> - Imagine if they just stopped mid battle. </connor>
<connor> - Dorohedoro did not do
that, we didn't get like a... </connor>
<connor> We didn't we didn't get like a ticket. </connor>
<garnt> - Because we didn't even
get the big climactic battle </garnt>
<garnt> in Dorohedoro. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, Megalo Box was
basically that, right? </connor>
<connor> No, it was a very nice, </connor>
<connor> it was a cool story had
a very nice package. </connor>
<connor> And that was shit, right? </connor>
<connor> - What the fucking... </connor>
<connor> No, Megalo Box is great,
what are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> - It was boring bro. </connor>
<connor> - Megalo Box was like, </connor>
<connor> let's take ping pong and put
it in like a boxing setting. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> What didn't you like about Megalo Box? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I love mega blocks
in the first viewing, </connor>
<connor> I just said mega blocks. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I love Megalo Box. </connor>
<connor> I enjoyed it. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time, </connor>
<connor> I'm like the story was just
kind of like, alright, cool. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I knew what was gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> It was so fucking obvious. </connor>
<connor> Like, it was just kind of like, all right. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I'm not
saying that Megalo Box </garnt>
<garnt> was the greatest animates
come out of that year. </garnt>
<garnt> - But people are like it's </garnt>
<garnt> the fucking great, </garnt>
<connor> like people are genuinely
upset that it wasn't anime </connor>
<garnt> of the year, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it wasn't that good. </connor>
<garnt> I would say I felt more complete. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, </connor>
<garnt> I definitely felt more
complete watching Megalo Box-- </garnt>
<connor> - But I think Dorohedoro was better than </connor>
<connor> that Megalo Box for me. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, for me, </garnt>
<garnt> like at the moment. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I can see that Dorohedoro </garnt>
<garnt> definitely had more potential
to be good than Megalo Box. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just saying that it
didn't get near that point. </garnt>
<connor> It didn't fucking get near that point. </connor>
<connor> And I wanted something... </connor>
<connor> I wanted a moment I could
think back to Dorohedoro </connor>
<connor> and be like, that was a great show. </connor>
<connor> - But to me-- </connor>
<connor> - The baseball.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> Where they had like the
giant cockroach join them </connor>
<connor> to play baseball. </connor>
<connor> This is so fucking dumb, but I love it. </connor>
<connor> - By the way, </connor>
<connor> if you're wondering why
I'm not heavily involved </connor>
<connor> is because I read all the Manga </connor>
<connor> and I'm completely satisfied with this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm sure the Manga is amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't even watch
the anime 'cause I'm-- </connor>
<connor> - Joey's that guy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I'm just that guy. </connor>
<connor> - Joey is a fucking smug cunt. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, you peasants (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Joey is there when fucking
Jesus is on the cross, </connor>
<connor> Joey's like God, you should
see what happens next, </connor>
<connor> you guys won't believe it.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm the guy in the cinema </connor>
<connor> who likes mouths what they
say as it's happening. </connor>
<connor> - Just wait till we get to the cave. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, you gotta keep your eye on the cave. </connor>
<connor> You guys thought that
was insignificant bro. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not saying he's
gonna come back but yeah. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - He's gonna revive. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate those fucking Manga fans. </garnt>
<connor> - God, he's such a smug cunt. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you like that character, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Have fun while it last? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you might not wanna get into it, </connor>
<connor> just like forget what I'm
saying, it means nothing. </connor>
<garnt> Just don't get into that character. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate it though when
you have that friend </garnt>
<garnt> who wants to know the like, </garnt>
<connor> is anything gonna happen to them? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, don't ask me that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm absolutely that guy
that's like, oh you'll see. </connor>
<connor> - I hate it when people tell me like, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah I've got these three parts </connor>
<connor> that's like, part four's the best. </connor>
<connor> I'm like don't fucking tell
me what part is the best, </connor>
<connor> I wanna have my own opinion. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just wanna go into like a series </garnt>
<garnt> with like zero expectations </garnt>
<connor> because even if I hear something like, </connor>
<connor> this part is fucking amazing, </connor>
<connor> like I don't wanna know
this part is amazing. </connor>
<connor> I just wanna like experience </connor>
<connor> the fact that it's amazing </connor>
<connor> instead of like hyping it up </connor>
<connor> because then I have
like expectations to me, </connor>
<connor> and I don't want expectations to me </connor>
<garnt> - To fuck Joey over here. </garnt>
<connor> As Joey just started
watching Demon Slayer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, finally. </connor>
<garnt> - The Anime Man watching
Demon Slayer in 2020. </garnt>
<connor> - I was that bored. </connor>
<connor> He's like, all right. </connor>
<connor> - You haven't watched the
animation of the decade. </connor>
<connor> - Animation of the decade. </connor>
<connor> - The reason why I watched Demon Slayer... </connor>
<connor> Excuse me but... </connor>
<garnt> The reason why I watched Demon Slayer </garnt>
<garnt> was because I was not watching it, </garnt>
<garnt> but then suddenly on Twitter, </garnt>
<connor> dude episode 19, it was insane bro. </connor>
<connor> You won't believe it bro </connor>
<connor> the animation made my fucking
gave birth to my child bro. </connor>
<connor> Fixed all of my age (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It was like I've never seen... </connor>
<connor> This is like the level of hype </connor>
<connor> that must have been there for Jesus </connor>
<connor> is like fucking resurrection bro. </connor>
<connor> I've never seen so much hype
for something in my life. </connor>
<connor> - I think that was the first time </connor>
<connor> I've ever seen an anime
trending on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - Like fucking ninja was
like bruh I'm an anime fan </connor>
<connor> whole time fucking like. </connor>
<garnt> - Are we just gonna call it that now </garnt>
<garnt> the Jesus resurrection now. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It was the second coming of Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - I have probably made too
many religious references </connor>
<connor> this podcast. </connor>
<connor> I just think if people could
feel strongly about religion. </connor>
<garnt> But anyway, I watched it </garnt>
<garnt> and the whole time I was
watching Demon Slayer, </garnt>
<garnt> I was unimpressed by everything </garnt>
<connor> because I was like, yes,
I'm waiting for episode 19. </connor>
<connor> I'm saving my nut for episode 19. </connor>
<connor> And there was plenty
of really amazing like. </connor>
<garnt> - Saving my nut. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's like when you've
watched a porno right? </connor>
<connor> You're saving your, you
know where the good bit is. </connor>
<connor> We all do it right, let's
not pretend like we don't, </connor>
<connor> everyone skips, you know
where the blow jobs starts </connor>
<connor> and you skip. </connor>
<garnt> - Let's go to literally 10 minutes in </garnt>
<garnt> and then let's skip again 20 minutes. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay do you watch the blow jobs in porn? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - No, you skip past it, right? </connor>
<connor> So you skip past it and then
they're already in like, </connor>
<connor> then you've gone too far </connor>
<connor> because they already fucking fully at it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, you wanna get before
they just start that. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - That's what it was right. </connor>
<connor> That's what it was. </connor>
<connor> - Are you saying that episode 19 </connor>
<connor> was the post blow job. </connor>
<connor> - It was the post blow
job part of the plan. </connor>
<connor> It was like the everything else. </connor>
<connor> It was like you knew it was the blow job </connor>
<garnt> so you're like I'm saving it, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm saving the nut, I'm saving it. </garnt>
<garnt> You have to save it because
if you get super hyped about </garnt>
<garnt> something that happened </garnt>
<garnt> and you know better is coming on, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't match. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry to the female
viewers who don't watch porn. </connor>
<garnt> - Or the male. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - We don't discriminate here. </connor>
<connor> - But what the fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah so what is your
opinion on Demon Slayer then? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, so I have-- </connor>
<connor> - It's the blow job of the anime. </connor>
<connor> - It's an animation of the decade. </connor>
<garnt> So I'm not up to episode 19 yet. </garnt>
<connor> I think I'm right before that. </connor>
<connor> - Save that nut. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm saving the nut. </garnt>
<garnt> - Save the nut. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's I think that's
one of the big reasons </garnt>
<garnt> why I decided to not watch
it until much much later </garnt>
<garnt> because I didn't want that
hype to sway my opinion. </garnt>
<connor> Of course I mean like, </connor>
<connor> I'll admit, like, </connor>
<connor> because it was everyone
was fucking talking </connor>
<connor> about at the time, right? </connor>
<connor> It's definitely in the back of my head. </connor>
<connor> - You were unimpressed with
things because you're expecting </connor>
<connor> to be impressed. </connor>
<connor> - Right, because I'm expecting episode 19 </connor>
<garnt> to be the one that nut to. </garnt>
<garnt> - To be the nut. </garnt>
<garnt> - To be the nut, right. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm basically blue balls
for fucking 18 episodes. </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like it's coming,
I've got to hold on. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a JV </connor>
<connor> where it's like 15 minutes of buildup. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It is like but I think
that's why I wanted it to wait </connor>
<connor> until all the hype was over, </connor>
<connor> just so that the earliest
stuff doesn't fucking persuade </connor>
<connor> how I see the actual show. </connor>
<connor> I want it to just go
into a completely clean. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel sorry for
anyone who's doing that </connor>
<connor> with Attack on Titan. </connor>
<connor> It's like, someday it's
gonna stop being popular. </connor>
<connor> It's just not. </connor>
<connor> - It's just not happening, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But also because the Manga is ending soon, </garnt>
<garnt> or I think it's almost
at the end, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it has ended. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it has ended. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, so it has ended. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, okay, now
is probably the best time </garnt>
<garnt> to actually start watching it </garnt>
<connor> just so that I can probably go </connor>
<connor> and just read the Manga as well, </connor>
<connor> because I'm that guy. </connor>
<connor> So I was just bored. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, all right
you know what, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> I'll see what this show is all about. </connor>
<connor> And it's good. </connor>
<connor> I enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> It's great. </connor>
<connor> It's very-- </connor>
<connor> - It's the cornflakes of
anime, you can't hate it. </connor>
<connor> Like it's cornflakes. </connor>
<connor> - It's very inoffensive. </connor>
<garnt> Like, there there is nothing inherently </garnt>
<garnt> about the show I dislike </garnt>
<garnt> but I just I mean, so far, </garnt>
<connor> I can't fucking stand Zenitsu, I'm sorry, </connor>
<connor> like he's just he's annoying.
- Who does? </connor>
<connor> - There are lots of people.
- There are lots of people. </connor>
<garnt> - There are so many people
who simp for Zenitsu </garnt>
<connor> and I'm like why? </connor>
<connor> He's just fucking annoying. </connor>
<connor> - I guess 'cause I think a lot of people </connor>
<connor> can relate to the, yo, hold me back </connor>
<garnt> because if I go set sicko mode, </garnt>
<connor> I unleash my true power, you're done son. </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of people
can relate to that, </connor>
<connor> I'm a pussy but--
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When my ultimate self cool
down you better better run bro. </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem though is right now </connor>
<connor> is that I don't know if I'm just not </connor>
<connor> as invested into showing in
characters as most people are </connor>
<connor> but just like I don't
really care about Zenitsu, </connor>
<connor> right now, I still don't really
care about Inosuke that much </connor>
<connor> maybe I'll (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - I know people gonna be pissed about me </connor>
<connor> but like I feel like it is
literally My Hero Academia </connor>
<connor> with the skin like think about it. </connor>
<connor> In those case Bakugo. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Tanjiro is Deku, Zenitsu
is I don't fucking know. </connor>
<connor> An amalgamation of
probably some (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Here's the thing Demon Slayer
to me is solid it's just. </garnt>
<connor> - So is My Hero Academia
like it's just another </connor>
<connor> solid show. </connor>
<connor> - But to be fair if I can't, </connor>
<connor> I would rather watch Demon Slayer </connor>
<connor> than My Hero Academia. </connor>
<connor> - No same, is there a
tomahawk in Demon Slayer? </connor>
<garnt> That's what I need to know. </garnt>
<garnt> - No yeah, I mean the Demon Slayer-- </garnt>
<garnt> - No that we know of,
Manga reader Manga readers. </garnt>
<connor> - There probably is. </connor>
<garnt> - I just wanna find it </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like Demon
Slayer has just filled </garnt>
<connor> that gap in that was the
beast bleach fan before. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like you haven't
got to the later episodes </connor>
<connor> where they basically introduce like-- </connor>
<garnt> - A whole 70,000 characters. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, we basically have a soul society. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I do admit I'm way more invested </connor>
<connor> in the world's building of Demon Slayer </connor>
<connor> than I am in My Hero Academia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's so much... </connor>
<connor> I don't know the characters feel, </connor>
<connor> like the ones that we
don't know much about </connor>
<connor> seem so much more interesting. </connor>
<connor> Whereas I don't give a
fuck about (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> Like I don't think he's fun to watch. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't even get that far. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's fucking boring. </connor>
<connor> - I like for me-- </connor>
<connor> - Human scrotum with powers. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Like I really really
enjoyed Hero Academia </garnt>
<garnt> and then as more seasons came out, </garnt>
<garnt> I went from like loving it </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, solid. </garnt>
<connor> - For me it's like I watched season one. </connor>
<garnt> And that was like should
I watch season two </garnt>
<garnt> and then reflect it on like, </garnt>
<connor> I didn't like season one
enough to go watch season two. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Then people like new season two </connor>
<connor> is when the tournament ark begins bro. </connor>
<connor> It's so fucking cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Way to a cool me . </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just like I don't
give a shit about-- </connor>
<connor> - Are you cut up on My
Hero Academia anime? </connor>
<connor> - Yes, I am. </connor>
<connor> - Did you like the last
season that just happened? </connor>
<connor> - No I did not. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my fucking God. </connor>
<connor> I was so bored. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Like, I did not think
they built up the overload? </connor>
<connor> - Overload? </connor>
<connor> - That's a a good villain. </connor>
<garnt> - Over something the plague doctor. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't think they
built him up very well. </connor>
<connor> And then the whole... </connor>
<connor> it was like literally the anime trope </connor>
<connor> where every single
episode had a flashback. </connor>
<connor> And then they won the fight </connor>
<garnt> and it's like, for fuck sake. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what I hated about Naruto. </connor>
<connor> - It's the exact same thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Like cut back on the fucking flashback. </connor>
<garnt> - Like my my favorite fight in
My Hero Academia to this day </garnt>
<connor> is the first All Might vs Noumu fight </connor>
<connor> like zero flashbacks. </connor>
<connor> - That shit was good. </connor>
<garnt> - In season one yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That to me sold me on the show </connor>
<connor> and that was like zero flashbacks. </connor>
<connor> It was just a hero being a hero </connor>
<connor> and now it's just not... </connor>
<connor> That was a clean nut. </connor>
<connor> - It was. </connor>
<connor> - And like other acts
there have been good points </connor>
<garnt> in other acts but it hasn't taken me back </garnt>
<garnt> to the love I felt at that point. </garnt>
<connor> - That's a good point I'll be honest, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I was as hyped </connor>
<garnt> for the all my verses or for one fight. </garnt>
<garnt> Noumu Versus-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean all my verses was just like-- </garnt>
<connor> - You knew he was gonna win. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that was less about
the fight the fight itself, </connor>
<connor> which is really fucking boring </connor>
<connor> because they like, yeah
you had all for one. </connor>
<connor> All right, a million fucking powers </connor>
<connor> and he uses the same fucking attacks </connor>
<connor> five times in a row. </connor>
<connor> - Literally me in a fighting game. </connor>
<connor> X, X, X, X, X. </connor>
<connor> He doesn't have the fucking combo sheet. </connor>
<connor> How is he supposed to know it? </connor>
<connor> If you have all these powers, </connor>
<connor> how the fuck do you know
what combos to gather? </connor>
<connor> - It's like mashing X and then every now </connor>
<connor> and then the triangle. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally like when
you learn the one combo </connor>
<connor> that seems to be spammable. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's literally all for one. </connor>
<connor> Like he's case figured out three combos </connor>
<connor> that seem to work well. </connor>
<connor> It's like I don't really wanna do that. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't think the
bubbles power up will go well </connor>
<connor> with the photocopy power. </connor>
<connor> - It's like smash play who
only spams the forward Smash. </connor>
<connor> This will get the job done. </connor>
<connor> - I wonder if there
was ever a conversation </connor>
<connor> where he stole powers people like </connor>
<connor> but why did you steal that power? </connor>
<connor> It's like, I stole the power
to be permanently erect. </connor>
<connor> It's like but why? </connor>
<garnt> Why did you steal that power? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll tell you what it is. </garnt>
<connor> It's like the same syndrome you have </connor>
<connor> when you're like scrolling on Netflix, </connor>
<connor> where you just have like
so many fucking powers </connor>
<connor> and your like fuck yeah </connor>
<garnt> I'll just rewatch the same
thing five times in a row. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, I'll be honest, right. </garnt>
<connor> I really fucking wanted All
Might to win that fight and die. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I wanted him to die as well. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that would have
been fucking legendary. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, top 10 anime deaths. </garnt>
<connor> - I would have said legendary. </connor>
<connor> - Legendary? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he should have died. </connor>
<connor> I thought it would have
made like the next ark or so </connor>
<connor> because he's just kind
of chilling around now. </connor>
<connor> Which is just kinda like
the boomer who's like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I was cool once. </connor>
<connor> - I love hanging out with these kids. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure Manga readers. </connor>
<connor> I say always with that
omnipotence knowledge and-- </connor>
<connor> - Especially the My Hero. </connor>
<connor> - That three 360 vision and hindsight. </connor>
<connor> - I'm fucking one thing
my biggest pet peeve, </connor>
<connor> is when you have like
a criticism of a show. </connor>
<connor> That's like up to that point, </connor>
<connor> and the Manga reader is just like, </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - 10 volumes in, you'll see. </garnt>
<garnt> You'll see. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you Joey, thank you for that. </garnt>
<connor> - To me, it felt like hesitation </connor>
<connor> that he didn't kill All Might. </connor>
<connor> Because he'd been building up
All Might's frail ass like, </connor>
<connor> poison ridden body. </connor>
<connor> - Don't look at me </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about. </connor>
<connor> - Come on.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like he built up how frail
and how he was dying. </connor>
<connor> Why didn't he kill him there
at the peak right like. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, to me he should. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe because he was too
much of a beloved character. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that was
probably he was scared to. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know maybe the
again the Manga readers </garnt>
<connor> forgot why actually the some you know. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't give a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Definitely that scene
would have definitely </garnt>
<garnt> hit me harder if he had died. </garnt>
<connor> - Because it also would
have made endeavors like </connor>
<connor> when he becomes the hero, </connor>
<connor> in the next arc, </connor>
<connor> that would have made
that even more impactful </connor>
<connor> because he's the only one left now. </connor>
<garnt> Right and he never got to
show All Might that right. </garnt>
<garnt> Why are we going on a fucking fanfic </garnt>
<connor> of My Hero Academia. </connor>
<connor> I wanted him to die. </connor>
<connor> He shouldn't fucking died, kill All Might. </connor>
<connor> - Let me rewrite My Hero Academia. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - This is how it's supposed to be done. </connor>
<garnt> I'm a writer. </garnt>
<garnt> - So let let me fix your art. </garnt>
<connor> - Stop getting banned in China. </connor>
<connor> Let me fix it. </connor>
<connor> - I'm a writer, hire me Horikoshi. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know like this stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> that I don't have fucking
I'm losing interest </connor>
<connor> in My Hero Academia by the season. </connor>
<garnt> - I am as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't think I would </garnt>
<garnt> because one thing I was super hyped about </garnt>
<connor> when it first started airing. </connor>
<connor> And right now I think I
like Black Clover more </connor>
<connor> than My Hero Academia. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't--
(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> Did I just say something blasphemous? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Because-- </connor>
<garnt> - How can a man be so brave. </garnt>
<connor> - You have made the Black Clover
fandom extremely happy now. </connor>
<connor> You've given them validation
where there wasn't. </connor>
<garnt> - Recognition. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's your validation everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> But now because I feel
like with Black Clover, </garnt>
<connor> it's just so much fun. </connor>
<connor> It's just fun. </connor>
<garnt> It's just this is the pure
show and fun I was looking for. </garnt>
<garnt> And with My Hero Academia, </garnt>
<connor> I feel like it's trying
to go for greatness. </connor>
<connor> It's like it's trying to build-- </connor>
<connor> - It's going for the long con. </connor>
<connor> - It's going for long con. </connor>
<connor> It's trying to build
up so many great points </connor>
<connor> and great characters, </connor>
<connor> but it's just doing a lot of things </connor>
<connor> that is just not keeping
my interest as well. </connor>
<connor> Like what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Okay, what the fuck was that last arc </connor>
<connor> in My Hero Academia season four as well </connor>
<garnt> with the villain who
I can't even remember, </garnt>
<connor> the fucking magician </connor>
<connor> - The British guy basically.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He's whole quack </connor>
<connor> Is that like, he? </connor>
<connor> What is it like he drinks tea? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't actually think that's his quack. </connor>
<connor> But all he does is drink tea. </connor>
<connor> He can make things into... </connor>
<connor> He's basically Hisoka. </connor>
<connor> He makes things into rubber. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then he drinks tea. </connor>
<connor> So that's like, </connor>
<connor> like that's also his big thing </connor>
<connor> is that he's like really picky about tea. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> Is this how he like
envisions British people? </connor>
<garnt> Because yes, that's actually true. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean just felt like a filler arc. </garnt>
<garnt> That wasn't actually filler. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know people are gonna
be mad at me because yeah-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm looking forward to the
comments on this episode. </garnt>
<connor> - They enjoyed the school
festival and everything </connor>
<connor> but I was just not invested
enough in the side characters </connor>
<connor> to really give a shit
about the school festival </connor>
<garnt> and the villain was just
fucking weak sources fuck </garnt>
<garnt> so I don't give a shit about that. </garnt>
<garnt> So that entire arc was just... </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna forget that one
when season five ends. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I wonder is My
Hero Academia trying </connor>
<connor> to go for like a 10 year run here </connor>
<connor> or do you think it's gonna be like-- </connor>
<connor> - I feel with just how successful it is. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure people have shown it. </connor>
<connor> Well, because I think
the people have shown </connor>
<connor> in jump they want a-- </connor>
<connor> - A One Piece replacement. </connor>
<connor> - No, not so much One Piece replacement </connor>
<connor> but they want something that will line up </connor>
<connor> with One Piece for a while </connor>
<connor> because we've currently had
Demon Slayer just ended, </connor>
<connor> Haikyu just ended. </connor>
<connor> - Is One Piece gonna end anytime soon? </connor>
<connor> - Well, Oda said that it'll
end in the next five years, </connor>
<connor> but who the fuck, it's Oda. </connor>
<connor> - In One Piece years that's pretty soon. </connor>
<connor> - It's One Piece that's really soon, </connor>
<connor> but it's been gone for like 25 years. </connor>
<connor> - I'm wondering as a fan </connor>
<connor> who has been watching My
Hero from the start, right? </connor>
<connor> How, like, do they really
expect someone to be </connor>
<connor> into a show for 10 years? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes.
- Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been into One
Piece for over 10 years. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've been into One Piece
for as long as I've read it. </connor>
<connor> - Like when One Piece ends-- </connor>
<connor> - I think my mom gave up like, </connor>
<connor> be interested in me after like, eight. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Like, she fucking birthed me. </connor>
<connor> (laughs)
(indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - When One Piece ends I'm
gonna cry like nobody. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I'm gonna fucking
cry when One Piece ends. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause that's like a
huge part of my life. </garnt>
<connor> That's just gone. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> your pet dying or something. </connor>
<connor> - I guess I did watch like Game of Thrones </connor>
<connor> for like, 10 years.
- 10 years? </connor>
<garnt> Well it's eight seasons, right, </garnt>
<garnt> but they took like, two years and last-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, think about-- </connor>
<connor> - And that was the worst ending
I've ever had in my life. </connor>
<connor> - I mean think about the amount
of people who fucking cried </connor>
<connor> when Harry Potter ended. </connor>
<connor> And that show had been going off... </connor>
<connor> Well, not show but like that book series </connor>
<connor> had been going on for
like fuck knows how long. </connor>
<connor> - True, I guess I underestimate, </connor>
<connor> I guess when you say be
interested in this for 10 years. </connor>
<connor> It sounds hard. </connor>
<connor> But then in real life, </connor>
<connor> it's very much not like that. </connor>
<connor> So like every day you're like, I'm caring. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I saw on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> There's actually some
people who are like yeah, </connor>
<connor> I fucking love One Piece ever. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's their </connor>
<connor> only personality trait, right. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Your Tinder profile, I like One Piece. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like, we're meant to be. </connor>
<garnt> - It was so weird. </garnt>
<connor> like seeing even something like Naruto </connor>
<connor> seeing the characters grow up </connor>
<connor> and I'm like kind of like
growing up with the characters. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> I shit on Boruto and everything </connor>
<connor> but some of those first few episodes </connor>
<garnt> where you see Naruto as a
dad, you see Sasuke as a dad </garnt>
<connor> and you're like-- </connor>
<connor> - Well, the same thing happened </connor>
<connor> with fucking Avatar The
Last Airbender ended right. </connor>
<garnt> and then the first
episode on Korra was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God, Katara is old now. </garnt>
<garnt> But then after the first episode, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, alright, I don't fucking care. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love Korra. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought Korra was kind of mean. </connor>
<connor> - You fucking love that word. </connor>
<connor> I left it at four seasons. </connor>
<connor> Was it four seasons?
- Of Korra? </connor>
<connor> No, I think it was three. </connor>
<connor> - I lived all of it. </connor>
<connor> People had the complaints, </connor>
<connor> but I was like, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, because I never grew up </connor>
<connor> on Avatar the Last Airbender.
- Me neither. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I only just recently watched it </connor>
<garnt> like in the last couple of years. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, me too.
- Avatar is fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually still haven't seen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, it's fuck. </garnt>
<connor> I completely understand the hype now </connor>
<connor> because it's fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - But then I was Korra and I
was like, this doesn't hit. </connor>
<connor> This doesn't hit different. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a great anime kind of feel. </connor>
<connor> But also has that comfort of
a Saturday morning cartoon. </connor>
<connor> It's really like in a sweet spot. </connor>
<connor> - The jokes are like very campy. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think I've ever heard you talk </garnt>
<garnt> about something as endearing
as you just talked about. </garnt>
<connor> - So comfortable about
really like takes you, </connor>
<connor> it's like how you felt. </connor>
<connor> I imagined when I say like, </connor>
<connor> imagine when you were
trading Yu-Gi-Oh cards </connor>
<connor> with your friends. </connor>
<connor> Like, man that was fun, wasn't it? </connor>
<connor> - I can totally understand why people </connor>
<connor> just isn't into it today
as they were back then. </connor>
<connor> - It really is like, encapsulated </connor>
<connor> and captured it like like
time capsule of like, </connor>
<connor> just that feeling. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, when you watch it, </connor>
<connor> you can't help but get that feeling. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Gentlemen, we all know a
VPN protects all privacy. </connor>
<connor> No one's doubting that. </connor>
<connor> And our security online, right? </connor>
<connor> But I didn't know this until recently. </connor>
<connor> And it's taken my TV watching
game to the next level. </connor>
<connor> - Tell me more. </connor>
<connor> - You can use a VPN to unlock movies </connor>
<connor> and shows that are only
available in other countries. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I got so excited. </garnt>
<garnt> I forgot to even mention that this episode </garnt>
<garnt> was sponsored by ExpressVPN. </garnt>
<garnt> - The ExpressVPN. </garnt>
<connor> - Gentlemen over the weekend, </connor>
<connor> I used ExpressVPN to binge
Doctor Who on the UK Netflix. </connor>
<connor> - No fucking way. </connor>
<connor> - It was simple, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Simple.
- How simple? </connor>
<connor> - I just fired up ExpressVPN app, </connor>
<connor> change my location to
the UK refresh Netflix. </connor>
<garnt> And that was it.
- That was so easy. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you're telling me </garnt>
<garnt> that ExpressVPN hides your
IP address unless you control </garnt>
<connor> where you want the sites
to think you're located? </connor>
<connor> - That's exactly it. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I had no idea. </garnt>
<connor> - Not only that, </connor>
<connor> but you can choose from
almost 100 different countries </connor>
<connor> more than 99. </connor>
<garnt> - That's 100 more than zero. </garnt>
<connor> - That's 100 more than zero. </connor>
<garnt> That's double fifty. </garnt>
<garnt> So just think about all
the Netflix libraries </garnt>
<garnt> you can go through. </garnt>
<connor> I'll give you a clue how many libraries. </connor>
<connor> It's 100. </connor>
<connor> - Guys i have a question. </connor>
<connor> Do you love anime? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - Get outta here. </garnt>
<connor> - Do I love anime? </connor>
<connor> - Do you love anime, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - Connor. </connor>
<connor> - Did you know that
you can use Express VPN </connor>
<connor> to access Japanese Netflix
and be spirited away? </connor>
<garnt> - Is that an anime reference? </garnt>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<connor> - I would definitely need
that in my position right now. </connor>
<connor> - But Garnt, it's not just Netflix. </connor>
<connor> ExpressVPN works with
any streaming service, </connor>
<connor> Hulu, Hulu, BBC iPlayer. </connor>
<connor> YouTube, you name it. </connor>
<connor> It can do it. </connor>
<connor> Fix my marriage, it can do it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, listen, boys, </connor>
<connor> there are hundreds of VPNs out
there I'm sure we all know. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - BUt the reason I use ExpressVPN </connor>
<garnt> and the reason why you boys use ExpressVPN </garnt>
<garnt> is to watch shows. </garnt>
<connor> Because it's just so ridiculously fast. </connor>
<garnt> - How fast Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's never any buffering or lag </garnt>
<connor> and you can stream in HD. </connor>
<connor> No problemmo. </connor>
<connor> - No jokes aside actually it is good. </connor>
<connor> This VPN is also compatible
with all of your devices, </connor>
<connor> phones, media consoles,
smart TVs, and more. </connor>
<connor> So you can watch what you want on the go </connor>
<garnt> or on the big screen, wherever you are. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wherever?
- Whenever Joey. </garnt>
<connor> - Damn. </connor>
<garnt> - And if you go to
expressvpn.com/trashtaste right now, </garnt>
<garnt> you can get an extra three free months. </garnt>
<connor> - Three free months? </connor>
<connor> - Three, that's a lot of frees. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Not three, I don't what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> - So support the show,
watch what you want. </connor>
<connor> And protect yourself at
expressvpn.com/trashtaste, </connor>
<connor> link's in the description below. </connor>
<garnt> - Check yourself and protect
yourself, back to the show. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll tell you what else
I've been watching recently. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been catching up to
Re:Zero season two as well. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Me too. </connor>
<connor> This is like going back,
how many episodes ago? </connor>
<connor> Where we're just like we're
gonna get back to Re:Zero. </connor>
<connor> Here you go fans. </connor>
<garnt> We're getting back to Re:Zero. </garnt>
<connor> - The amount of memes
that came out of that. </connor>
<connor> - Just one minute later,
don't fucking, the internet </connor>
<connor> one minute is nothing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Man. </connor>
<connor> Can I just laugh at something? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Why is Garfiel a big orange cat? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I've never thought of that before. </connor>
<connor> - He literally turns
into a big orange cat. </connor>
<connor> Have you watched Re:Zero season two? </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - So this one character called Garfiel. </connor>
<connor> Not, Garfield, Garfiel. </connor>
<connor> - Garfiel. </connor>
<connor> - Garfiel, </connor>
<connor> and he turns into-- </connor>
<connor> - A big orange cat. </connor>
<connor> - A big orange cat. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Probably hates Mondays. </connor>
<connor> - Loves lasagna. </connor>
<connor> - I just I had to like
pause it when this like, </connor>
<connor> okay, spoilers reserved </connor>
<connor> when he just starts murdering people. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - This cat is just this
fucking chunky Garfield. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Murdering people. </connor>
<connor> I was like, wow. </connor>
<connor> - Now I wanna watch this. </connor>
<connor> - Damn what timeline happened
to Garfield when he died bro? </connor>
<connor> - It's on a Monday probably. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like you should
Re:Zero season two. </garnt>
<connor> - It's amazing. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's fucking amazing-- </connor>
<connor> - It's great.
- I need to. </connor>
<connor> Because I feel like,
have you seen season one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like we go back
to our conversation earlier, </connor>
<connor> season one set up the
world really, really well. </connor>
<connor> But then it I knew it had the
potential to go even further. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like Re:Zero season two </connor>
<connor> is definitely hitting that potential. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, like one thing I really liked </connor>
<connor> is how in like the first
few episodes of season two, </connor>
<connor> there were just no deaths. </connor>
<connor> It was just building up this character. </connor>
<connor> Like with what happened to
Subaru in the first few episodes. </connor>
<connor> That was fucking genius. </connor>
<connor> Because it managed to
build up Subaru's character </connor>
<connor> in a way that hadn't been like done before </connor>
<garnt> and really just explore who he is </garnt>
<garnt> and why he acts the way he does. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because they built up </connor>
<connor> this almost very childish
mindset that he had, </connor>
<garnt> that we often see in anime
characters, especially Isekai. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they kind of just
deconstructed it in season two, </garnt>
<garnt> which was amazing because it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I hate this fucking incel
and then they're like, </garnt>
<connor> here's the reason why he didn't say </connor>
<connor> and why he's going to change. </connor>
<connor> - I respect that. </connor>
<connor> - Nice, I like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've only I've only
heard the greatest things. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause season one when you saw people </connor>
<connor> who were like, dude, I relate to Subaru. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what's wrong with you? </connor>
<connor> The fuck (indistinct)
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> But it's great because it's basically, </connor>
<connor> they built that all up to be like, </connor>
<connor> okay, now he's a shady character, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna teach him why needs to change. </connor>
<connor> Why those kind of behavior </connor>
<connor> and I'm doing all this
for Amelia is toxic. </connor>
<connor> As it would be. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Fucking simping for Amelia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's really interesting. </connor>
<connor> I didn't like it </connor>
<connor> when I realized what they were first doing </connor>
<connor> but I started to enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> So they're using the whole reset thing, </connor>
<connor> as a way to like slowly build
up this one kind of thing </connor>
<connor> that they're stuck in right now. </connor>
<connor> And I thought it was
fucking annoying at first, </connor>
<connor> so I wanted them to leave the sanctuary. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I really liked </connor>
<connor> how they're just slowly been
building up through the resets. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And you get a piece by piece, </connor>
<connor> because it feels like almost
like a murder mystery. </connor>
<connor> Where you're kind of
getting little information. </connor>
<connor> And it's you built it up really well. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I'm just
really into it right now. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm so hyped for it guys. </garnt>
<garnt> I have no qualms with that right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I'm actually way more
into it than I was season one. </connor>
<connor> Season one, I very much enjoy. </connor>
<connor> - Actually, I do have a
thing that I don't like, </connor>
<connor> Where the fuck is Rem? </connor>
<connor> I want my bitch back, bro. </connor>
<connor> I get it. </connor>
<connor> She's just kind of gone but-- </connor>
<connor> - That's how basic she's bro. </connor>
<connor> - But we better get like a
full blow job with her back. </connor>
<connor> - Imma say it.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Everybody is gonna be like </connor>
<connor> who is that character
Connor is talking about? </connor>
<connor> (indistinct)
(laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Why would you still miss Rem </garnt>
<garnt> when this perfect specimen of a beauty </garnt>
<connor> has been introduced to the show. </connor>
<connor> - I can't get over echidnas.
(laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Because she has a four penises? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, she has four penises. </connor>
<connor> - Do you wanna explain
why that's the case, Joey? </connor>
<connor> - Because it was a meme that
I saw in the Sonic fanbase. </connor>
<connor> It's always a Sonic fanbase </connor>
<connor> where they're like Knuckles
has four penis heads. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, what? </connor>
<connor> And then apparently if
you go into Wikipedia, </connor>
<connor> you look up like an actual echidnas, </connor>
<connor> like the animal that's something
that Knuckles is based off. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, echidnas have four penises. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I will admit
she's a top tier Waifu. </connor>
<connor> She's definitely pulling away. </connor>
<connor> She broke Subaru down. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - She like when she got introduced. </garnt>
<garnt> She just fucking I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> there was some Re:Zero girls liked, </garnt>
<garnt> and then there was Beatrice </garnt>
<connor> and then she just came along </connor>
<connor> and destroyed everything. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally that meme
with the car drifting. </connor>
<connor> Like going straight and turning. </connor>
<connor> It's like Amelia drifting to echidnas. </connor>
<connor> One short episode, </connor>
<connor> I will admit, it's tempting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But as a Knight of Rem, </connor>
<connor> my loyalties cannot be swayed goddammit. </connor>
<connor> - Your not my queen. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like I was clowning earlier </connor>
<connor> about how I'll get serious about it. </connor>
<connor> Then I literally now do this,
I do not portray my queen. </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> If I don't trust men who sway
this simping, you're weak. </connor>
<connor> Pick a wife and simp goddammit. </connor>
<connor> - Swaying Waifu is such a weak mind. </connor>
<connor> - It such a weak mindset. </connor>
<connor> You would be a terrible. </connor>
<connor> - What do you even like about Rem. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - She's like crouton to the salad, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's always the best fucking part. </connor>
<connor> The crunchiest part that you can never... </connor>
<connor> You don't have to worry </connor>
<connor> about the amount of dressing on them. </connor>
<connor> All right, Rem never fails
to just be there, right? </connor>
<connor> Like Rem is just there, man. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean?
- I don't know man. </connor>
<connor> - Rem came through, she murdered him. </connor>
<garnt> That's hot first of all. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's hot. </connor>
<garnt> And then she kind ofm she became Owoo, </garnt>
<garnt> and I kind of opened to that. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen I'm not gonna lie I'm
very struggling to remember. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I just remember that
she was loyal to death, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was very endearing. </garnt>
<connor> How many times do we get Waifus, right? </connor>
<connor> That put their heart
on the line like that. </connor>
<connor> And God's like won't blink, </connor>
<garnt> bring out the note. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me bring out the massive list </garnt>
<garnt> of literally probably
90% of Waifus out there. </garnt>
<connor> - But I feel like those Waifus, </connor>
<connor> they wanted to get the result, </connor>
<connor> they wanted to be the chosen one. </connor>
<connor> Whereas Rem confessed knowing full well </connor>
<connor> she was never gonna be picked </connor>
<connor> and there's something I
can respect about that. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know about that one, man. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously I haven't
watched enough harem anime </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's like every other girl. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - They say that's what they like. </garnt>
<garnt> I know you won't pick me </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like in the back of the head. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't wanna be picked. </garnt>
<garnt> Now Rem totally did it </garnt>
<connor> was just like Chad like, </connor>
<connor> I know you're not gonna pick me </connor>
<connor> but I fucking love you
and that's okay, king. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's what I love about Rem, </connor>
<connor> that's when that single time </connor>
<connor> when she confessed I'm like-- </connor>
<connor> - I don't know man. </connor>
<connor> Didn't she go on an entire spiel of like </connor>
<connor> how she wants like a
family and stuff and like-- </connor>
<connor> - Do you think I fucking remember that? </connor>
<connor> - And she's like I want three kids </connor>
<garnt> in a cottage in the hills like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did she, what the fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I remember something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - She pretty set in stone. </garnt>
<connor> - That was definitely like
a flash forward or something </connor>
<garnt> where she had kids with Subaru. </garnt>
<connor> - Practice you pull out game then, </connor>
<garnt> you know what I mean is fine. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's fine. </connor>
<connor> - If it fails you can just reset. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You're like shit I hope that checkpoint </connor>
<connor> was over a month ago. </connor>
<connor> Gonna be real awkward. </connor>
<connor> - She comes back with like the results. </connor>
<connor> - You go back to your checkpoint, </connor>
<connor> it's like two weeks your like,
shit, she's still pregnant. </connor>
<connor> - You're like fuck go back. </connor>
<connor> - You're fucking awful people. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure there's a fucking dude. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember I'll be honest. </connor>
<connor> I cannot remember-- </connor>
<connor> - To me like just-- </connor>
<connor> - Does like all the knights </connor>
<connor> know why they fight for the king? </connor>
<connor> Like shit why are we fighting? </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I've been
doing it for like 10 years. </connor>
<connor> I just keep fighting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's such a weak mindset. </connor>
<connor> - That's a weak mindset bro. </connor>
<connor> - A weak mindset is swaying </connor>
<connor> with the wind Garnt like you do. </connor>
<connor> And you Joey. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't swayed yet,
I'm still for Beatrice. </connor>
<connor> - I already know you're gonna
sway I don't even fucking-- </connor>
<connor> - We'll see. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I was never like always-- </connor>
<connor> - Joey is literally that meme of the guy. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I was in the Beatrice camp because-- </connor>
<connor> - Because you like kids.
(laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - We bringin it there are we Connor? </garnt>
<connor> We bringing it there. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know what canon age is. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll have you know
your honor that she was-- </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - This is the problem right? </connor>
<connor> Let's say your wife who is Beatrice </connor>
<connor> or she's fucking Shinobu.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You go into the movies, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You turn up to the fucking restaurant. </connor>
<connor> Table for two. </connor>
<connor> This is my Waifu down here. </connor>
<connor> We're gonna sit and hold hands. </connor>
<connor> Come to the table. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I can't stand the looks I'm
gonna get at that restaurant. </connor>
<connor> When I sit down with my fucking
10 year old at the table </connor>
<connor> and we're playing footsies. </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - Here's a thing, first of all, she's 890, </connor>
<connor> but second of all-- </connor>
<connor> - Waiter can she drink? </connor>
<connor> She's 890.
- Yeah of course. </connor>
<connor> No, but here's the thing is that like, </connor>
<connor> at least my viewing of
like my enemy Waifus </connor>
<connor> is that I like them
because they're not real. </connor>
<connor> Do you know what I'm saying? </connor>
<connor> - Your honor--
(indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - We've gone full circle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like them like I don't
want them to be real. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you want a 10 page
thesis on Waifu theory? </garnt>
<connor> - I can give you a 10 page
thesis on Waifu philosophy. </connor>
<connor> Okay right now, like I don't want </connor>
<connor> my enemy Waifu to be real </connor>
<connor> because it's going back to
the whole maid cafe thing, </connor>
<connor> where it's like you-- </connor>
<connor> - Why do you like kids Joey? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's going back to the
whole maid cafe thing </connor>
<connor> where it's like I like
it because it's not real </connor>
<connor> and the moment it becomes real, </connor>
<connor> then you realize, shit, this is not cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Would you be happy with someone </garnt>
<garnt> if they fucking murdered
you in a past life? </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, you know
what, we're cool now. </garnt>
<garnt> You're loyal to me now. </garnt>
<garnt> But you did fucking
murder me that one time. </garnt>
<garnt> You did fucking like chop off my legs </garnt>
<connor> and fucking beat me to death, </connor>
<garnt> like three times or something. </garnt>
<connor> - If it was hot. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's not like some
people's kink, right? </connor>
<connor> Like it's like flat lining, </connor>
<connor> but not coming back. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's just like, just
actually fucking dying. </connor>
<garnt> - Are we gonna find you
in like (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - People are gonna think
I'm into some weird, </connor>
<connor> but I assure you-- </connor>
<connor> - We're gonna walk up
to your fucking life. </connor>
<connor> - And we're gonna walk
up to your dead body </connor>
<garnt> and just gonna have the
biggest smile on your face. </garnt>
<connor> - You're gonna be like died by like, </connor>
<connor> asphyxiation with like 10 stab wounds </connor>
<garnt> and you got like, a big smile. </garnt>
<connor> - I am fortunately I'm pretty vanilla </connor>
<connor> but I love the idea of the kink. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I don't
understand about people. </connor>
<connor> - It's the idea of these
weird things that you could do </connor>
<connor> that I never wanna do. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> You don't want it to be real. </connor>
<connor> But so you're okay with it not being real. </connor>
<connor> That's that's how I see it. </connor>
<connor> - You're okay with it with loosing. </connor>
<connor> It's such a weak mindset. </connor>
<connor> You're okay with it not being real. </connor>
<connor> You're okay with not growing. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But that's what I've never
understood about people </connor>
<garnt> who like say that fucking you
know Gasai is their Waifu. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> Because they openly are like, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> I'd love it if she was
my actual girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, no you
wouldn't, you would not. </connor>
<connor> You would not wanna
fucking murderous bitch </connor>
<connor> as your fucking girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - As an idea Yandere
can be hot, as an idea. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But obviously in real life. </garnt>
<connor> - It won't be hot. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolutely not. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, personally, </garnt>
<connor> I found Gasai like annoying as fuck. </connor>
<connor> That was no hot. </connor>
<garnt> That was just like, fucking annoying. </garnt>
<connor> The girl I preferred in Mirai Nikki </connor>
<connor> was the fucks the one with the eyepatch. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That chic, I found her way more-- </connor>
<connor> - I like that chic as well. </connor>
<garnt> - I found her way more hot than Yuno. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Fuck zero murders I want terrorists. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, </connor>
<garnt> - Just give me a terrorist Waifu. </garnt>
<connor> - Mirai Nikki, I was
actually recommending like, </connor>
<garnt> so my Japanese tutor,
she's a Japanese woman. </garnt>
<garnt> And she like, takes my anime
recommendations as like gospel. </garnt>
<connor> So I've seen--
- That's your first mistake. </connor>
<garnt> - I've slowly been recommending her </garnt>
<garnt> like worse and worse anime </garnt>
<connor> and she started off really into it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I wanted to see
how much she lied to me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I told her to
watch the Future Diary. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why it came up. </connor>
<garnt> I was like watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't particularly like it, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think anyone over
the age of 12 can like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No it's very weird. </garnt>
<connor> - And so she watched it. </connor>
<garnt> She was like yeah, it was good. </garnt>
<connor> I need to think of another one. </connor>
<connor> I recommended Rent A Girlfriend to her </connor>
<connor> but I'm sure she'll pick now. </connor>
<connor> - You got to recommend her something </connor>
<connor> that's similar to that but just worse. </connor>
<connor> - What's worse? </connor>
<connor> - Recommend like Heavy Object. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't even fucking watched that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause that's made by the
same person as Mira Nikki </connor>
<garnt> but it's a million times worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - I haven't watched that yet. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, it's so bad. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna recommend you-- </connor>
<garnt> - You're gonna recommend next? </garnt>
<connor> - Higurashi but in dubs
I'm gonna recommend that. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like no you have to watch it dubbed. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so much better. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause actual like when they cry. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - I recently rewatched Higurashi. </garnt>
<connor> - So I watched Higurashi
dub, cause this is back </connor>
<connor> when I never watched
dub, because I was like, </connor>
<connor> no I have to watch dub. </connor>
<connor> I used to watch on a website
called watch cartoons online. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember that website. </garnt>
<connor> Throwback Thursday. </connor>
<garnt> - I always used to be like, </garnt>
<connor> what do you mean there's no dub? </connor>
<connor> Like cause I refuse to watch
Attack on Titan for a while. </connor>
<connor> Which is why I just got into
anime like I don't wanna read. </connor>
<connor> I don't fucking read. </connor>
<connor> Even though I've been watching... </connor>
<connor> I've watched every single fucking film </connor>
<connor> that Jet Li was in, in subtitles. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I drew the line-- </connor>
<connor> - Every Jackie Chan movie. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'd gone through like, </connor>
<connor> all of Jet Li and Donnie Yen
and Jackie Chan filmography, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I fucking love them. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but, fuck what was I saying? </connor>
<garnt> Maylene fucking distracted me. </garnt>
<garnt> - You were talking about-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I watched Higurashi </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause fucking Glass
Reflection recommended it </garnt>
<connor> and I was like cool I'll watch it. </connor>
<connor> I didn't watch the full video </connor>
<connor> 'cause I didn't want to watch the review. </connor>
<connor> Later on on the video, </connor>
<connor> I think he says don't want you to dub </connor>
<connor> it's fucking terrible, I think. </connor>
<connor> I was like, well that would
have been nice to know. </connor>
<connor> Because I watched this thing </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> This is awful. </connor>
<connor> Why is it called When They Cry? </connor>
<connor> - I've never actually seen a dub. </connor>
<garnt> - It's terrible. </garnt>
<connor> - I think there's one good voice actress </connor>
<connor> in the entire thing. </connor>
<connor> And she stands out so much. </connor>
<connor> - She's carrying it. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, which character?
- I think it's Shion. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the fucking
like the one teammate </connor>
<connor> on league who isn't (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> Please just group, I can do it. </connor>
<connor> - Now I need to watch it. </connor>
<connor> - I love watching horrible. </connor>
<connor> - I really wish that the license
was in Limbo for the dubs. </connor>
<connor> We could just watch it live
on Twitch, no problems, </connor>
<connor> because I would love to do like
we'll watch Higurashi live. </connor>
<connor> That'd be so fucking--
- That'd be amazing. . </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, Higurashi dubs sucks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's okay, </connor>
<connor> because the new ones coming out soon, </connor>
<connor> so yeah remake-- </connor>
<connor> - Which I'm honestly excited for. </connor>
<garnt> - It seems like there's a lot... </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, you've done your
seasonal video already. </garnt>
<garnt> This seems to be getting back on track </garnt>
<garnt> on the just amount of anime that's-- </garnt>
<connor> - Just coming full circle, </connor>
<connor> like just redo all the good shit. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, they did it with (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> And they fucking nailed that. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it kind of like </connor>
<connor> doing the Hollywood thing now, right? </connor>
<connor> I hope it doesn't get to the point where-- </connor>
<connor> - Let's just remake everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't mind the remakes. </connor>
<connor> I really hope it doesn't get to the point </connor>
<connor> where one third of the
season is just remakes. </connor>
<connor> Because I'm gonna be like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Well remember, like the on the trip </connor>
<connor> that we just came back
from and we're hotel </connor>
<garnt> and they'd remade the first episode </garnt>
<garnt> of Detective Conan. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember. </connor>
<garnt> - So we were sitting in a hotel. </garnt>
<garnt> And we would turn on the
TV and lo and behold, </garnt>
<connor> there was anime on the TV. </connor>
<garnt> - And people were just
like there's anime on TV. </garnt>
<connor> - Without subtitles. </connor>
<garnt> How do I watch this without subtitles? </garnt>
<garnt> So it was an episode of Detective Conan. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like, obviously new animation </garnt>
<garnt> and we don't religiously
follow Detective Conan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so we watched it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, this must be the new episode-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and I'm like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - But then the more we watched it, </garnt>
<garnt> we were like, wait, hold on. </garnt>
<garnt> I know what's gonna happen next. </garnt>
<connor> This is the first episode just remade. </connor>
<connor> - I just felt like Subaru at that point. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I know what's gonna happen
he's gonna kick that globe </connor>
<connor> just watch him kick the globe </connor>
<connor> and then Joey's like, nah
this isn't the first episode, </connor>
<connor> this is like new animations like, </connor>
<connor> watch him kick the globe. </connor>
<garnt> He kicked the globe and at that point, </garnt>
<connor> we realized it was just a remake. </connor>
<connor> - Joey we started doing
this like mad rain man thing </connor>
<connor> where it started like,
Joey was like, alright, </connor>
<connor> and then this is gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they're like gonna
get in the roller coaster. </connor>
<connor> - Like exact things, like Joey
this is just fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> - They're gonna get into the tunnel. </connor>
<garnt> He's gonna get the water go on his cheek </garnt>
<connor> then he come out the heads
gonna be decapitated. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like the Pro Zd video </garnt>
<connor> where he just recycle the
Peter Pan or something. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> We were just sitting there fucking-- </connor>
<connor> - Drinking our beer like Joey stop, </connor>
<connor> this not a fucking talk show. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't even like
Detective Conan that much. </connor>
<connor> But for some reason that
first episode just sticks </connor>
<connor> in my mind so fucking much. </connor>
<connor> I surprised myself I was like, </connor>
<connor> well, I actually got that right. </connor>
<connor> - I am before the comments accusing Joey </connor>
<connor> of being a high functioning autistic. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> With it with Detective Conan episode one, </connor>
<connor> I am a high functioning autist. </connor>
<garnt> I know exactly what
happens with everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - See that. </garnt>
<connor> - I knew exactly what happened </connor>
<connor> like scene for scene.
- It was worrying. </connor>
<connor> - And I hadn't seen that first
episode in over 10 years. </connor>
<connor> So I surprised myself. </connor>
<connor> - Joey with one beer
fully unlocks his brain. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - To using 100% of my
brain power for that. </connor>
<connor> - That's exactly how it works. </connor>
<garnt> Is there anything else you
guys have been watching? </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I have to
watch Higurashi dub now. </connor>
<connor> - No, I haven't been watching anything, </connor>
<garnt> just been reading Manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've been reading
Manga as well actually. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, what you reading? </connor>
<connor> - There's a new Manga
I discovered recently </connor>
<connor> that's called... </connor>
<connor> What's it called again? </connor>
<connor> Records of Ragnarok.
- Yes. </connor>
<connor> - That's only like 30 chapters old. </connor>
<connor> But my God it is fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So to describe what it's about. </connor>
<garnt> So basically, it's it's what the God </garnt>
<garnt> of high school anime
should have been right. </garnt>
<garnt> It starts off with just a tournament talk </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just been tournament
talk this entire time. </garnt>
<garnt> So the premise is that
basically imagine like all Gods </garnt>
<connor> in every culture has like this council </connor>
<connor> and every few 1000 years
they just basically vote </connor>
<connor> on whether they should
wipe out humanity or not. </connor>
<connor> And so this time.
- So 2020. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, (laughs) </connor>
<connor> So in the first chapter
they just decide yeah, </connor>
<connor> humanity is kind of fucked right now </connor>
<connor> so let's just put them out their misery. </connor>
<connor> - Is that fucking </connor>
<connor> (speaking foreign language)
Valkyrie or something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't recognize the English title. </connor>
<connor> - I don't recognize your
peasant English name. </connor>
<connor> - Because you had to get
no because I was about </connor>
<garnt> to say that exact same anime </garnt>
<garnt> but then you explaining I'm like, no, </garnt>
<garnt> this sounds like the one
I'm about to talk about. </garnt>
<connor> - We are talking about the same show here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This sounds pretty fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so then so then like
the Valkyries come along </connor>
<garnt> and be like, let's give humanity a chance. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe they're not total pieces of shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe give them a chance
to defend themselves </garnt>
<connor> and so she suggests that they just do </connor>
<connor> a fucking massive tournament arc-- </connor>
<connor> - As you do with humans. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like a tournament
arc of some of like, </connor>
<connor> the most famous humans of all time. </connor>
<connor> And like the most famous Gods of all time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- So fate. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically just fate </connor>
<garnt> but just its fate combined with Baki. </garnt>
<connor> That's that's probably the
best way to explain, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because it's It's so fucking over the top </connor>
<garnt> and the first chapter just
starts a tournament arc, </garnt>
<connor> and you just have two
contestants coming out </connor>
<connor> and just banging the shit out
of each other immediately. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but unlike unlike
God of High School, </connor>
<connor> you actually get like the
backstories and everyone's story </connor>
<connor> as they start fighting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Are you throwing shade
Garnt are you throwing shade? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I am throwing shade. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I'm currently
reading through that right now </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm at the Adam Versus Zeus. </garnt>
<connor> - Adam Versus Zeus. </connor>
<connor> - Like Adam and Eve. </connor>
<connor> - Adam and Zeus. </connor>
<connor> - Did he eat the fucking apple? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he has an apple
in his mouth constantly. </connor>
<connor> And he's fucking great, so good. </connor>
<garnt> - Adam is so fucking op. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause is this fucking like
chad as fuck like massive. </connor>
<connor> - Is this like a tea list
and enough's incoming? </connor>
<garnt> - Probably, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - Because like the appeal of it </connor>
<connor> is that everyone's fucking op, </connor>
<connor> and it's like you get the backstory </connor>
<connor> about how they became op. </connor>
<connor> So it's like a Baki backstory. </connor>
<connor> Where everyone has done
something fucking ridiculous </connor>
<connor> with their lives </connor>
<connor> and then as you fighting it out </connor>
<connor> they like kind of one up each other </connor>
<connor> on like overpowered powers and attacks. </connor>
<connor> And it's yeah Adam Versus Zeus </connor>
<connor> felt like a season finale fight </connor>
<connor> and that's the second fight. </connor>
<connor> - That's the second fight. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the second fucking fight. </garnt>
<connor> - That's only volume two of I
think currently eight volumes. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, it's fucking great. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And I think the one I'm reading right now </garnt>
<connor> is Hercules Versus Jack the Ripper. </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna ask is
there Jack the Ripper, </connor>
<garnt> there's always a fucking Jack the Ripper. </garnt>
<connor> There's always a fucking
dude who murdered people. </connor>
<connor> It's not anything impressive. </connor>
<connor> - People don't even know
if he actually existed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No, now that fight </connor>
<connor> Hercules Versus Jack the
Ripper is fucking great. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I don't know, just I love I know </connor>
<connor> I say this with every fucking Manga </connor>
<connor> I recommend but I fucking love the art. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, it's something so, it's gritty, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's also so inoffensive. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's just like a great showman. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just love how postable it is </garnt>
<garnt> and like they have no filler. </garnt>
<connor> No, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I know you here for fights. </connor>
<connor> Here's the fight. </connor>
<connor> We'll give you the backstory. </connor>
<connor> So don't fucking worry about it. </connor>
<garnt> Here's a hype matchup </garnt>
<garnt> and let's just fucking go. </garnt>
<garnt> Chapter one. </garnt>
<garnt> And then when the fight finishes, </garnt>
<connor> you get like zero downtime. </connor>
<connor> - Immediately goes to the next one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Hell yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's great. </connor>
<connor> - Sounds amazing. </connor>
<connor> - The only thing that's
bad about it right now, </connor>
<connor> is that there are only 30 chapters. </connor>
<garnt> That's pretty much the only downside, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel about it right now. </garnt>
<connor> - I reckon though if
that ever gets animated, </connor>
<garnt> and it probably will
considering that it's really big </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I just really hope that
they don't fucking stretch </garnt>
<garnt> that shit out like they did with Baki. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wish that they would
just maintain that pace. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - To be fair Baki is pretty
faster with its fights. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but also they
throw in a load of bullshit </connor>
<connor> that the market didn't have. </connor>
<connor> - I guess yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then again the Manga
also has like some bullshit </connor>
<connor> in it where it's like I didn't need </connor>
<connor> to know about it's like this like, </connor>
<connor> like fucking Mohammed Ali Jr. </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> Is like that his backstory
is like 30 chapters long </connor>
<connor> and you see him fight
for like two chapters. </connor>
<connor> - Are we about to on a tangent about Baki? </connor>
<connor> - I don't think we have
enough time to go-- </connor>
<garnt> - We don't have time. </garnt>
<connor> - We need like a full episode for Baki. </connor>
<connor> - We can do a full episode on Baki. </connor>
<connor> - Baki is great. </connor>
<connor> Read it or watch it
before we talk about it . </connor>
<garnt> - We need to get John on the podcast </garnt>
<garnt> and just dedicate the episode to Baki. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- My God. </connor>
<connor> - No, that's great. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - As you guys know, I've
been reading Eyeshield 21. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, Eyeshield 21. </garnt>
<garnt> - So fucking amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - I know it's great. </connor>
<connor> - He's odd is (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) is a God yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like there's some panels </connor>
<connor> that like just blow you away. </connor>
<connor> Cause like every like </connor>
<connor> it's an American football Manga. </connor>
<connor> And you're kind of like </connor>
<connor> with the I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like the rough squad </connor>
<connor> with a bunch of the crazy characters and-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They're the rough around
the edges kind of characters </connor>
<connor> and team captain is a fucking
psychopath and is amazing. </connor>
<connor> I thought he was the villain
when he was first introduced. </connor>
<connor> - He looks like the villain, doesn't he? </connor>
<connor> - But he's amazing. </connor>
<connor> Anyway, the whole Manga super endearing. </connor>
<connor> The story is really unpredictable. </connor>
<connor> Like you really have no
idea what's gonna happen </connor>
<connor> and just oh my God the op. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So if you don't know Murata Yusuke </connor>
<connor> to use get he did the op for One Punch Man </connor>
<connor> - Not the original. </connor>
<connor> - The redrawing, the good one. </connor>
<connor> - Like there's a panel </connor>
<connor> where like said crazy
character does a throw. </connor>
<connor> And he like he like do
an illustration of him. </connor>
<connor> Like as like a fucking
God throwing a ball. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a two page spread
and it's fucking beautiful. </connor>
<garnt> - What I love about that Manga </garnt>
<garnt> and well, </garnt>
<garnt> no other sports Manga has
managed to match Eyeshield in </garnt>
<connor> is the fucking visual metaphors. </connor>
<connor> Visual metaphors is why this
Manga just works so well. </connor>
<garnt> - It's insane. </garnt>
<connor> Like, they like oh my God. </connor>
<connor> There's so many like-- </connor>
<connor> - The first time I saw him
do the fucking devil bat goes </connor>
<connor> I didn't know. </connor>
<connor> I fucking nutted.
(chuckles) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, that is the coolest
fucking thing I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like the whole, </connor>
<connor> if you haven't read Eyeshield 21 </connor>
<connor> and you're not into anime. </connor>
<connor> I fucking thing American football </connor>
<connor> is the most boring sport on earth. </connor>
<connor> But the Manga is so good. </connor>
<garnt> - That Manga got me
into American football. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like that's how I learned </connor>
<connor> the rules of American football. </connor>
<garnt> And after that Manga I'm like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I can watch American football now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's almost perfect-- </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Are gonna talk about that one thing? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, there's this whole. </connor>
<connor> This is all I don't know
if they appear again. </connor>
<connor> I'm about two thirds of the way through. </connor>
<connor> Maybe they appear in the end again. </connor>
<connor> So an American team comes over </connor>
<connor> and there's a black guy </connor>
<connor> and his superpower is that
he's just black, I guess. </connor>
<connor> And that's his whole thing
is that he's super powered </connor>
<connor> because he's black. </connor>
<connor> And that's why he's a great player. </connor>
<connor> And it's just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> when was the Manga made? </connor>
<connor> - It was Golden Age, wasn't it? </connor>
<connor> It was mid 2000s. </connor>
<connor> - Like mid 2000s.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I guess mid 2000s and you
could kind of see what-- </connor>
<connor> - I mean it was around the same year </connor>
<connor> as the questionable Gantz episode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it's like the the
American teams manager </connor>
<connor> hates black people because he
was replaced by a black player </connor>
<connor> in the NFL.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then he refers to
like, he's just horrible, </connor>
<garnt> he refers to them as monkeys. </garnt>
<connor> It's so uncomfortable. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like the most bare
bones exploration of racism. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess that's why it's like, </connor>
<connor> I guess it would be
uncomfortable in real life. </connor>
<connor> But, it's so like, </connor>
<connor> what someone would think racism is like, </connor>
<connor> and know what it is like. </connor>
<connor> Then it's like, it's just
kind of like, (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - It's just kind of like, yikes, </garnt>
<garnt> when you're reading it, </garnt>
<connor> it's just one big yikes. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just so funny to
me that the superpower, </garnt>
<garnt> he has no other superpower
apart from just being black. </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like, it's just a mutually agreed fighter </connor>
<connor> in the Eyeshield world. </connor>
<connor> Black people are just like, Superman. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's so many fucking panels </garnt>
<connor> I screenshotted a bunch, where
they're just talking about </connor>
<garnt> how it's like a superpower. </garnt>
<connor> And I was just reading it
with my jaw on the ground. </connor>
<connor> Like, holy fuck, this is a thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's poli age Manga panels. </connor>
<garnt> If there's a Twitter account for that. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like all of Africa </connor>
<connor> has just a buff in this universe. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like everyone else, it's just nerfed. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> There's a line and I'll
set the screenshot. </connor>
<connor> Without a black men
strong yet flexible body, </connor>
<connor> it is impossible to
make that kind of play. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> This is natural born sprinter, </connor>
<connor> muscles that only black people have. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I don't think it's the... </connor>
<connor> I'm not sure if this is
the official translation. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna look at it in Japanese </connor>
<connor> but I assume it's just as bad. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a massive you read it </connor>
<connor> and you're like, okay, it's just one. </connor>
<connor> Maybe they won't keep doing this. </connor>
<connor> And they kept doing it. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, oh fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah--
- But I guarantee-- </connor>
<connor> - That aside, it is an amazing Manga. </connor>
<connor> And I know some people probably argue, </connor>
<connor> you shouldn't forgive that. </connor>
<connor> It's like it's fucking 2000s Japan </connor>
<connor> they didn't fucking know any of that shit. </connor>
<connor> - There were lots of Manga
doing stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - They were never expose to it, right? </connor>
<connor> I get it they wanna touch on it </connor>
<connor> but it's like I just
fucking speed on that point. </connor>
<garnt> - And there's like worse way to be viewed </garnt>
<garnt> than just being good at being a fucking-- </garnt>
<connor> - At least they didn't like,
straight up, drop the N bomb. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - At least they were
subtle about it in a sense. </connor>
<connor> If they dropped the N bomb, </connor>
<connor> they were like, alright, yeah, </connor>
<connor> maybe it's time we talk
about this but you know. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a yikes to
read and your like okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like one little phone. </connor>
<connor> That's just hurts a little bit. </connor>
<connor> - Because you wanna recommend it </connor>
<connor> and you want to tell how amazing it is. </connor>
<connor> And then you just gotta be like, </connor>
<connor> there's just this one thing. </connor>
<connor> - There's one thing you should be careful. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It is an amazing Manga just be prepared </connor>
<connor> when you get to that part. </connor>
<connor> - This episode Of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> I wanna say a lovely thank you </connor>
<connor> to the beautiful patrons on screen. </connor>
<connor> - Look at all of them. </connor>
<connor> - Look at this beautiful motherfuckers. </connor>
