<garnt> - Boys, America, America, America. </garnt>
<joey> (mid tempo music) </joey>
<joey> - What's up freedom fighters? </joey>
<joey> Welcome to "America and Trash Taste", baby. </joey>
<joey> I'm freedom fighter one with freedom fighters two and three. </joey>
<garnt> - This is not even the right accent </garnt>
<garnt> for where we're at. - In America. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're in LA. </garnt>
<joey> We're in LA, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my fucking God guys, welcome back to "Trash Taste". </joey>
<garnt> This is the best show on the fucking internet. </garnt>
<joey> - This ain't my mans. </joey>
<connor> Guys, this is not our mans right now. </connor>
<joey> - What, come on, you are. </joey>
<joey> I am your, mans. </joey>
<joey> - Not when you do that. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Not when you do that. </connor>
<joey> - I had to set the scene, </joey>
<joey> 'cause we're once again in a different place entirely. </joey>
<joey> We're not in the UK anymore. </joey>
<joey> We're in the United States of America now. </joey>
<garnt> - But you truly had the Karen accent. </garnt>
<garnt> You are truly now cosplaying your Karen form aren't you? </garnt>
<joey> - Call the manager right now. </joey>
<joey> I need to speak with her. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, we're in LA in this beautiful Airbnb. </joey>
<joey> The most grandiose our set has ever looked. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it? - Is it? </garnt>
<joey> - These couches are pretty fucking nice to be honest. </joey>
<garnt> - These couches are comfy, a bit too comfortable, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I'm just sinking back in. </joey>
<joey> - I'm definitely sinking back in. </joey>
<joey> - I gotta fucking talk and be aware </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Oh Joey, Joey, you fucking talk." </garnt>
<joey> - I was thinking about I have to hold my mic </joey>
<connor> 'cause it just keeps moving. </connor>
<joey> So I have to do that. </joey>
<joey> - Every podcaster ever fucks with their mic. </joey>
<joey> They go, "If I go one second without touch my mic </joey>
<joey> "on a podcast, I'm gonna cry." </joey>
<joey> - I'll double fist like Lady B did in "Cry". </joey>
<connor> Yeah, double clutch it like Lady B did. </connor>
<joey> - But yeah, we've made it to Los Angeles. </joey>
<garnt> - And we've somehow been able to build a studio </garnt>
<garnt> despite a lot of issues that we've been through. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're gonna get into that very quickly. </garnt>
<joey> I'm sure the rounds have already been made </joey>
<connor> of the actual situation. </connor>
<connor> - The rounds have already been made. </connor>
<garnt> - The rounds have already been made. </garnt>
<joey> People online- - I mean, if you been </joey>
<joey> on Reddit, maybe you're aware of this. </joey>
<joey> If not, which our big portion of audience isn't- </joey>
<joey> - Hey Paul, the sub Reddit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so our baggage containing, </joey>
<joey> Meilyne said it was $30,000 worth of equipment </joey>
<joey> is actually I think closer to 50,000. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's closer to 50. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, closer to $50,000 worth of filming equipment, </joey>
<joey> all our mics, all our cameras were lost on the way here </joey>
<garnt> and at this moment we still dunno where they are. </garnt>
<joey> - So we had to scramble to get all of this equipment </joey>
<joey> so that we can actually film some episodes </joey>
<joey> especially because we're gonna get guests on eventually </joey>
<joey> as well from next episode. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, so it's just stressful as shit. </joey>
<garnt> - This was not the start that we wanted. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so thankful that we scheduled in two, three days </garnt>
<joey> of just no guests, no filming anything because if we thought </joey>
<joey> that we were gonna hit the ground running, </joey>
<garnt> we would've been fucked, absolutely fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Our guest literally arrives and it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "So where's the set?" </garnt>
<joey> And we're like "Ah, yeah, about that, it doesn't exist yet." </joey>
<connor> - Do you wanna explain your process </connor>
<connor> of going to the airport. </connor>
<connor> - So I was in charge </connor>
<garnt> of bringing all of the equipment to America </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause these boys flew a bit early. </garnt>
<garnt> So I get to Heathrow Airport terminal two, </garnt>
<garnt> and already, alarm bells were ringing </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I get there and I want to check in </garnt>
<joey> and I can't check in. </joey>
<joey> And I hear one of the operators say, </joey>
<joey> "Oh no, we can't check anyone in right now </joey>
<joey> "'cause there is a queue downstairs of about 200 bags </joey>
<joey> "and no one can check in right now." </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, "That's pretty bad. </joey>
<joey> "That's a bad omen right there." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's worrying. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I arrive an hour, no, two hours before my flight </joey>
<joey> as that's what they recommend. </joey>
<joey> So I have to wait an hour just to check in my bags, </joey>
<joey> just to check in my bags </joey>
<joey> and that's true for pretty much everyone on the plane. </joey>
<joey> So I check in my bags an hour before our flight </joey>
<connor> and then I check in my normal bags. </connor>
<connor> And then we have two massive Pelican cases containing all </connor>
<connor> of our filming equipment. </connor>
<connor> And they look at that and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "We can't check that in here. </connor>
<connor> "You're gonna have to go to the oversized luggage section." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh no, oh no." </connor>
<joey> - This is scary already. </joey>
<joey> - My spidey senses were tingling. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Something is going to go wrong." </joey>
<joey> And so I bring over the two Pelican cases over </joey>
<joey> to the oversized luggage place. </joey>
<connor> And so there's an operator there. </connor>
<connor> And you could tell this operator, he was fucking done. </connor>
<connor> He does not give a- </connor>
<connor> - He's probably been dealing with this for a few days. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he does not give a shit at all. </connor>
<connor> And then he looks at the Pelican cases and he is like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, just put them on the conveyor belt </connor>
<connor> "and I'll get it through the system." </connor>
<connor> And then I put it on the conveyor belt. </connor>
<connor> He presses a button to open a shutter </connor>
<connor> to get it through the airport. </connor>
<connor> The shutter doesn't open and he presses again, doesn't open. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Okay, something weird is going on here. </connor>
<connor> "Is this a malfunction or something?" </connor>
<connor> And he sits there. </connor>
<connor> He sits down and he sits there </connor>
<connor> for five minutes doing nothing, </connor>
<joey> doing nothing. - [Joey] What? </joey>
<connor> - He just sits there for five minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Not even pretend to work? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah just doesn't even pretend to work. </garnt>
<garnt> He just sits down and plays on his phone. </garnt>
<garnt> And then while I'm waiting, </garnt>
<garnt> a queue starts to form behind me. </garnt>
<garnt> First it's one person, then it's two people, </garnt>
<garnt> then it's three people and it really starts to build up. </garnt>
<garnt> And so after about 10 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> of just sitting down doing nothing, </garnt>
<garnt> the guy just tries to press it again, doesn't work </garnt>
<garnt> and then finally, he phones. </garnt>
<garnt> He tries to phone someone. </garnt>
<garnt> He tries to do something about it. </garnt>
<connor> And so he phones the operator in charge </connor>
<connor> of whoever is in charge of the baggage. </connor>
<connor> And he says, "Oh, the shutter won't open." </connor>
<connor> And then they say, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, we're not letting any bags in right now </connor>
<connor> "because we are just completely full. </connor>
<connor> "We cannot take anymore bags </connor>
<connor> into our system. - What the fuck happens? </connor>
<connor> - And so I was waiting for about 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> And so I was waiting in this queue </connor>
<connor> for about 20 minutes before he presses the button </connor>
<connor> and the shutter finally opens </connor>
<connor> and the fucking bags finally went through. </connor>
<connor> And I remember by the time my bags went through, </connor>
<connor> it was half an hour before my flight. </connor>
<connor> And I remember thinking, finally, the shutter is open, </connor>
<garnt> bag goes through and then the shutter close. </garnt>
<garnt> And there was just this moment of, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm never gonna see them again am I?" </garnt>
<garnt> I had a feeling, I had a feeling. </garnt>
<joey> - Self-fulfilling prophecy. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, had a fucking vision. </garnt>
<garnt> It closed and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I have a bad feeling about this, like fucking OB one." </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember texting the group being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Guys, not to be alarmed, </garnt>
<garnt> "but I'm pretty sure there's a good chance </garnt>
<garnt> "that maybe we won't get to see our equipment." </garnt>
<garnt> But I was hoping outta hope. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I check in, we go through. </garnt>
<garnt> So I flew Aer Lingus. </garnt>
<joey> So the Aer Lingus flight goes from Heathrow to Dublin </joey>
<joey> and then Dublin to America, LAX. </joey>
<joey> And so the flight </joey>
<joey> from Heathrow to Dublin was actually on time, which I think </joey>
<joey> that's the reason our bags didn't get delivered </joey>
<joey> because it was on time. </joey>
<joey> And we woke up the next day and we found out </joey>
<joey> that there's an image on screen </joey>
<joey> with all of the bags </joey>
<joey> that are stuck in Heathrow terminal two now. </joey>
<joey> It's a fucking sea of bags. </joey>
<joey> Our bag is somewhere in there at this point. </joey>
<joey> But then after that, </joey>
<connor> I check in to my second flight to go to America, </connor>
<connor> and we all check in. </connor>
<connor> I'm sitting in my seat </connor>
<connor> and then you know where you have some of those flights </connor>
<connor> where for some reason, the plane just doesn't move? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So we were sitting there for a full on hour. </joey>
<joey> So we were sitting there for a full hour trying </joey>
<joey> to figure out what's going on? </joey>
<joey> Are we actually gonna take off? </joey>
<joey> And then after an hour, the operator comes in </joey>
<joey> and was like, "Guys, I know you've been waiting a while, </joey>
<joey> "that's because there's been a massive queue </joey>
<joey> "on the runway right now. </joey>
<joey> "So we're gonna be a bit delayed </joey>
<connor> "and I'm gonna be real with you, </connor>
<connor> "it's looking like that we're gonna be sitting here </connor>
<connor> "for another two hours." </connor>
<connor> And you know when bad news gets announced </connor>
<connor> and you just feel the air just drop? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There was that fucking grown noise </connor>
<connor> that just distributed throughout the entire fucking plane. </connor>
<connor> And everyone's just like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> So we all start getting out our phones </connor>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> And I was thankful 'cause I got to catch up </joey>
<joey> with fucking "Spy family". </joey>
<connor> That's what I did with my extra two hours on the tarmac. </connor>
<joey> - It could've been worse. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it could've been worse. </joey>
<garnt> - But after being delayed for three hours on the tarmac, </garnt>
<joey> finally I get to go to LAX. </joey>
<joey> Fucking brilliant, I finally get to go my flight to America. </joey>
<joey> The flight itself was very, very pleasant. </joey>
<joey> We had some very good, </joey>
<joey> what are they called, air stewardesses there. </joey>
<garnt> - Service? - Yeah, service, </garnt>
<garnt> we had very good service. </garnt>
<garnt> The flight itself was great, </garnt>
<garnt> but then the nightmare continued when I landed in LAX. </garnt>
<connor> - Or just any landing at LAX. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - The nightmare continued. - Yeah, and so I get down </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought that I had saved time </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause if you fly from Dublin to America, </garnt>
<garnt> we have pre-clearance. </garnt>
<connor> If you fly from Dublin, you don't actually need </connor>
<connor> to go through immigration in America. </connor>
<connor> - That's very fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can go through immigration in Dublin </connor>
<connor> so it's treated as a domestic flight. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, "Great." </connor>
<connor> I can just pick my bags and get the fuck out of there. </connor>
<connor> And so I walk for what feels like 20 minutes </connor>
<joey> to get to my baggage collection. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was pretty fucking long. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we all had to do that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> and by the time I get there, </joey>
<joey> our bags aren't even on the carousel </joey>
<joey> because they are so busy. </joey>
<joey> The people from the previous flights </joey>
<joey> are still getting their bags from this carousel </joey>
<joey> 'cause there's only one carousel in the domestic terminal. </joey>
<joey> People from Hawaii, </joey>
<joey> which was the flight before were still waiting </joey>
<joey> for their bags to come out. </joey>
<joey> So we couldn't get our bags </joey>
<joey> before the passengers from Hawaii </joey>
<joey> to completely get their bags out. </joey>
<joey> So I was waiting for about an hour </joey>
<joey> before we even got any bags from our flights to come out. </joey>
<garnt> And then after their bags finished getting collected, </garnt>
<garnt> finally our bags come out. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like a drip feed. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how it was such a slow drip feed. </garnt>
<garnt> Were they fucking cycling it over one bag at a time? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they were dragging it over the same journey you did. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so it was coming out fucking five bags at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> So by the time I got some of my bags out, </garnt>
<connor> I had to wait another 20, 30 minutes. </connor>
<connor> And then of course, I was waiting for my equipment bags. </connor>
<connor> And then I wait, I wait a little longer. </connor>
<connor> I wait a little longer and they were like, </connor>
<connor> "So thank you, ladies and gentlemen, </connor>
<connor> "the Aer Lingus bag flights </connor>
<connor> "at the Aer Lingus flight bags are now finished. </connor>
<connor> "So if you have any bags to collect, </connor>
<joey> "we've collected it in a corner." </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, "Fuck, I did not see the bags </joey>
<joey> "that I had." </joey>
<joey> I would rather have lost my clothes </joey>
<connor> than lose the $50,000 of equipment. </connor>
<connor> And so I go to this corner and there's a line </connor>
<garnt> of about 30 people being like, "Where the fuck is my bag?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no. - And so after that, </garnt>
<garnt> I have to queue again with these 20, 30 people all trying </garnt>
<garnt> to wave their fucking tickets to pick a form up. </garnt>
<joey> And it was my first reminder </joey>
<joey> about what I can experience here </joey>
<joey> in terms of customer service </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm used to Japanese customer service. </joey>
<connor> - You are blessed with Japanese customer service. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I am very blessed with Japanese customer service </connor>
<joey> where they felt like they will do anything they can </joey>
<joey> to help you. </joey>
<joey> Or at least, they will at least pretend to give a shit. </joey>
<joey> At LAX, I've had two instances now </joey>
<joey> where there is not even any pretending to give a shit </joey>
<joey> about the customer at all. </joey>
<joey> If anything, I felt guilty for having to trouble them </joey>
<joey> for an issue with the fucking airport. </joey>
<joey> So I had to fucking fight my way through </joey>
<joey> to give them the ticket. </joey>
<joey> And this guy punching my numbers in </joey>
<joey> to this lost and found form just could not give a shit. </joey>
<garnt> He didn't give a shit so much, </garnt>
<garnt> we found out later that he'd punched in the wrong numbers </garnt>
<garnt> to this form. </garnt>
<garnt> And so it was this experience of everything </garnt>
<garnt> that could go wrong with a flight did go wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> And it turned a already long travel time from England </garnt>
<garnt> to America and added around five to six hours </garnt>
<garnt> on top of that as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm so sorry you had to go through that. </joey>
<connor> - It just ain't it, it just ain't it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, this ain't it. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, at this moment in time, </joey>
<connor> that's all we know about what's happened to our bags. </connor>
<joey> I think it's still in Heathrow if I'm gonna guess. </joey>
<garnt> Hopefully, we can get our equipment back. </garnt>
<connor> - But what happens if they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, by the way, we delivered it to LAX a month later." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "We're not in LAX anymore. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck is happening. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just frustrating. </connor>
<connor> I wish they would tell you anything. </connor>
<connor> I think the fact the airline leaves you completely </connor>
<garnt> in the dark and doesn't tell you, "Hey, it's here. </garnt>
<garnt> "It hasn't been shipped out yet </garnt>
<garnt> "'cause it's all backed up." </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "Okay well, I could somewhat understand that." </garnt>
<joey> But when they just fucking tell you nothing. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Oh well no, it's in LAX." </joey>
<connor> 'Cause Meilyne was calling them up </connor>
<garnt> and being very angry, good Meilyne. </garnt>
<garnt> - Good Meilyne. </garnt>
<garnt> - They told Meilyne that, </garnt>
<connor> "Hey, yeah, the bags have been at LAX since June 16th." </connor>
<connor> And then he goes to LAX again to try and get them. </connor>
<garnt> - So they told us that the bags have been delivered to LAX. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was just like, "I want to go there physically. </garnt>
<garnt> "to pick them up." </garnt>
<garnt> Because we got $50,000 of equipment. </garnt>
<joey> I don't wanna risk like waiting anymore time. </joey>
<joey> So I drive to LAX and of course, </joey>
<joey> driving to LAX is a fucking nightmare in LA </joey>
<joey> because you have to fucking fight. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you have to drive in LA. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so it takes us about 40 minutes </joey>
<joey> to get to LAX. </joey>
<connor> And then I go to the section </connor>
<connor> where they told me to pick the bags up. </connor>
<connor> And I had my second experience with LAX customer service, </connor>
<connor> which was I tried to explain that I have tickets </connor>
<connor> to pick up my bags. </connor>
<connor> And so the woman in charge just goes, </connor>
<connor> "No, no, no, we don't have any bags </connor>
<connor> "from Aer Lingus right now." </connor>
<connor> And that's all she says. </connor>
<connor> And then she goes away. </connor>
<connor> She doesn't even give me, time's like explain my situation. </connor>
<connor> She just fucks off. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Well, what, what do I do?" </connor>
<connor> - That's annoying. - So I phone up Meilyne </connor>
<connor> to be like, "Can I get like the exact details </connor>
<connor> "of everything our airline said to you </connor>
<connor> "so I can explain the situation." </connor>
<connor> And so this lady goes off and I can see her in eyesight. </connor>
<connor> She goes off to the other side of the room </connor>
<connor> and starts picking up and messing around with some bags. </connor>
<connor> And so I talked to one of the security guards there </connor>
<connor> to be like, "Can I call that lady over please </connor>
<connor> "because I think she's in charge </connor>
<connor> "of the baggage system here." </connor>
<joey> And she literally picks out her phone and phones the lady. </joey>
<joey> I can see the lady pick up her phone and answer it. </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "Okay." </joey>
<joey> And then hangs up. </joey>
<joey> And then she continues messing around with the bags. </joey>
<joey> I can see her in eyesight. </joey>
<joey> I see her. </joey>
<joey> - You can literally just run up to her. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And so after 20 minutes of dicking around over there. </joey>
<joey> I dunno what she's doing. </joey>
<joey> She reluctantly comes back, looks at me </joey>
<joey> and I can see the disappointment in her face be like, </joey>
<joey> "Why the fuck are you calling me again?" </joey>
<joey> And so I'm like trying to explain, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I just wanted to get more information </joey>
<joey> "and explain more of the situation about what I've been told </joey>
<connor> "and what the situation is." </connor>
<connor> So I explain everything that Meilyne has explained to me. </connor>
<connor> I give her the tickets and she does a fucking eye roll. </connor>
<connor> And just (sighs). </connor>
<connor> She literally does that. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Why am I being made to feel guilty </connor>
<connor> "for trying to solve a situation with my bags." </connor>
<joey> - That you guys created. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> it made a stressful situation 10 times more stressful </joey>
<joey> because with customer service, I don't mind </joey>
<joey> if you are not fucking Japanese level, </joey>
<joey> "Yes King, we'll do anything we want for you. </joey>
<joey> "What do you need?" </joey>
<joey> I'll explain everything. </joey>
<joey> But at least don't make the customer feel guilty </joey>
<joey> about bringing up, </joey>
<joey> about needing a service. - Needing a service. </joey>
<garnt> - She made me feel guilty for even trying </garnt>
<garnt> to explain the situation </garnt>
<garnt> and trying to find out more information after driving there </garnt>
<garnt> for 40 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> And she goes there and she checks the details </garnt>
<garnt> on the fucking luggage tag and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And then she comes back and she's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "There is no bags here. </garnt>
<garnt> "Your bags and have not been delivered. </garnt>
<garnt> "I dunno what the airline have told you. </garnt>
<garnt> "They've pretty much just said something false </garnt>
<garnt> "because we've had no bags from that airline at all." </garnt>
<garnt> And that almost broke me, that almost broke me </garnt>
<garnt> because after driving there for 40 minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> not getting my bags after being delayed, </garnt>
<garnt> after wasting five hours of my time the day before, </garnt>
<joey> I now had to drive back from LAX to our studio. </joey>
<joey> And for some reason, </joey>
<joey> God just hated me on that day </joey>
<joey> because the traffic back was way worse </joey>
<joey> than the traffic there. </joey>
<joey> So it took twice the amount of time to drive back. </joey>
<joey> And it was just, ah- </joey>
<joey> - You couldn't get a dog dude. </joey>
<joey> - Oh man, that drove my monk experience to its limit </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I was up to here. </garnt>
<garnt> I was about to fucking explode. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm surprised you didn't explode. </garnt>
<garnt> I think anyone else </garnt>
<garnt> would've fucking exploded long before that. </garnt>
<joey> I would've certainly exploded. </joey>
<garnt> - Internally, I was screaming 'cause I don't wanna scream. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna be the Karen to the customer service manager, </garnt>
<garnt> but they just- - But in situations like that, </garnt>
<joey> where I think it's almost a necessity to be a character. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, no, because I didn't wanna bring out my frustration </garnt>
<garnt> on the person, but also that person </garnt>
<joey> was I felt bringing out her frustrations on me, the customer </joey>
<joey> with maybe previous customers she's had. </joey>
<joey> It was just awful. </joey>
<joey> It was an awful experience. </joey>
<joey> There's no silver lining in this. </joey>
<joey> It was just an awful experience and it's still not resolved. </joey>
<garnt> So it wasn't the best first experience touching down </garnt>
<garnt> in America, but yeah. - Welcome to America. </garnt>
<garnt> - Welcome to America. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean you didn't tip your bag handler </garnt>
<joey> at the airport? </joey>
<joey> How dare you not give him a 20% tip on his salary </joey>
<connor> to get your bag delivered. </connor>
<joey> - Can we fucking talk about that </joey>
<garnt> 'cause that's one frustration I've had since getting here. </garnt>
<garnt> So obviously, because we had lost our shit </garnt>
<garnt> and it still hasn't been resolved, </garnt>
<garnt> we had to figure out ways to get the equipment. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're calling up camera rental places, </garnt>
<garnt> we're calling up light rental places, </garnt>
<joey> all that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> And then we realized, oh, there's no mic stands </joey>
<joey> because we're usually attached to a table, </joey>
<joey> but that's not gonna work </joey>
<joey> with the current set we're in right now. </joey>
<joey> So we're like, "All right fuck, </joey>
<joey> "we gotta buy some mic stands." </joey>
<garnt> So I'm like, "All right, I'll just get some on Amazon." </garnt>
<garnt> Go on to Amazon, blah, blah, blah. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think, again, this is where we're blessed </garnt>
<garnt> with Amazon Japan standards, </garnt>
<garnt> which is, it is very rare to get something on Amazon, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how small or large, how cheap or expensive it is, </garnt>
<garnt> and usually 99 times out of a 100, </garnt>
<garnt> you'll get it the next day. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, next delivery. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's next day delivery. </garnt>
<joey> That's just normal in Japan. </joey>
<joey> So I thought It would be the same here. </joey>
<joey> They do have next day delivery, </joey>
<joey> if you would like to pay 500% more for shipping. </joey>
<connor> And I looked at it and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Hold on, how does that work? </connor>
<connor> "So I get free shipping if it comes on three days from now." </connor>
<garnt> But if I wanted tomorrow, </garnt>
<garnt> I basically have to tip Amazon 10, $15 more </garnt>
<joey> to get it the next day. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's about 10, $15 delivery </garnt>
<joey> if you want to get your stuff the next day, </joey>
<joey> which we are obviously blessed </joey>
<joey> with Amazon UK, Amazon Japan, </joey>
<joey> which it comes free with Prime. </joey>
<joey> You get next day delivery. </joey>
<joey> I would understand maybe if it was kind of like, </joey>
<joey> one thing that surprised me </joey>
<joey> 'cause I thought fucking Amazon started </joey>
<joey> in California, right? - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Can we fact check that at least? </connor>
<garnt> - Did Amazon start in California? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's Seattle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it Seattle? - Oh, okay, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - It was Seattle. </connor>
<connor> - It's American. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, okay, okay, ignore that. </garnt>
<joey> That's a just I made it the fuck up moment. </joey>
<joey> - [Woman] Seattle. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, Seattle. - Seattle. </joey>
<joey> - But I would think that with LA being one </joey>
<joey> of the fucking major cities in America, </joey>
<joey> because you get perks if you order from say London </joey>
<joey> in the UK, I thought with LA, </joey>
<joey> with this being Hollywood and needing a lot of equipment, </joey>
<garnt> a lot of shipment and everything like that, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that they would have a service </garnt>
<garnt> that is more convenient. </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, I was very surprised to see </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't get the same level </garnt>
<garnt> of convenience just by being in LA. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you literally have to pay to win. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it's hard. </connor>
<connor> There's a lot of like socioeconomic factors involved. </connor>
<connor> I mean already, next day shipping, </connor>
<connor> you don't really need next day shipping. </connor>
<connor> How often do you need next day shipping? </connor>
<connor> - All the time. - No, never normally. </connor>
<connor> - No I do because usually when I have to buy something </connor>
<joey> on Amazon, it's when I need it urgently. </joey>
<joey> And I don't have enough time to go to the shops to get it </joey>
<joey> or perhaps, it's something that I can't get. </joey>
<connor> - I'd like an example. </connor>
<connor> Can you gimme an example? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, say for example, like camera equipment in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's very rare that you can go </garnt>
<connor> to a big enough Yodobashi or big camera </connor>
<connor> that has the exact specific thing that you need. </connor>
<connor> Or sometimes there are some brands for example, </connor>
<joey> that you can't easily access in Japanese science. </joey>
<connor> - I'd say it's very rare that you need 100%, </connor>
<connor> you need this next day. </connor>
<connor> I bet 90% of shit you order on Amazon, </connor>
<connor> you do not need that next day. </connor>
<joey> - Well I'm sure, yeah, but the convenience is there, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah it's there. </joey>
<joey> I think it's good to have that convenience, </joey>
<joey> but I think especially in America </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's just so inefficient </joey>
<connor> and everything is delivered by road. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen the videos of the freight trains </connor>
<connor> that deliver stuff in California? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - I have not. </connor>
<connor> - You have to fucking break and open. </connor>
<connor> They get robbed all the fucking time. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. - I just think </connor>
<connor> 'cause the infrastructure just isn't there </connor>
<connor> and then the next day delivery that they do do, </connor>
<connor> it fucks up the the people who have to actually deliver it </connor>
<connor> 'cause they have to do these insane routes </connor>
<connor> to try and deliver this, </connor>
<connor> and they're pissing bottles and shit. </connor>
<connor> So a part of me is like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I'd love next day delivery." </connor>
<connor> But I feel like in America it's not- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Feasible? - It's sort of feasible, </connor>
<connor> and if you are doing it something bad is happening </connor>
<connor> to someone who is delivering. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess this is definitely me being privileged. </garnt>
<connor> - It's definitely us being privileged. </connor>
<garnt> - It's definitely a privileged problem. </garnt>
<connor> - I sort of talk about it </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's a complicated thing. </connor>
<garnt> - There's a bigger underlying issue to where, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Japan, for some reason, </garnt>
<connor> people don't give a fuck about being worked like crazy </connor>
<connor> for nine hours and being superficial, I don't know why. </connor>
<garnt> - In the UK, you get next day delivery as well. </garnt>
<connor> - You do, but in London, </connor>
<connor> it seems like it would make way more sense </connor>
<connor> to have that work in London. </connor>
<connor> But in Wales, you don't have that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh you, don't? </connor>
<connor> - Not really, I lived right next </connor>
<joey> to the Amazon warehouse in Swansea </joey>
<joey> and it was never next day delivery, </joey>
<joey> and I lived next to the warehouse for the whole area. </joey>
<connor> I dunno, London, it makes more sense. </connor>
<connor> It's possible, there's a lot more couriers available. </connor>
<joey> - Is there maybe a sense </joey>
<joey> of urgency towards fulfilling customer requests maybe? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I assume in Wales, </joey>
<joey> not a lot of people are ordering from Amazon, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, there's a lot. - Surely in Cardiff, </joey>
<connor> surely in Cardiff. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe in Cardiff there are a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think all the Cardiff orders are being fulfilled </garnt>
<connor> by the Swansea because it's about an hour drive. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I guess that's what I thought </connor>
<joey> where I would understand </joey>
<joey> if you lived in the fucking boonies </joey>
<joey> in the middle of nowhere, </joey>
<joey> Okay, you're not gonna get next day delivery, </joey>
<joey> but if you live in an amazing city- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] This is LA. - Yeah, this is LA. </connor>
<connor> - I mean you can get it, but it's only certain items </connor>
<garnt> 'cause it's gotta be fulfilled by Amazon, </garnt>
<garnt> which means it's in their warehouse already </garnt>
<connor> and they get one of their couriers to come and get it. </connor>
<garnt> And that makes more sense. </garnt>
<connor> But I don't know, the whole fucking system here is weird. </connor>
<connor> And even in Europe, it's not as good as Japan. </connor>
<connor> Japan works, but Japan's had an amazing shipping network </connor>
<connor> for like forever. </connor>
<connor> - They've just sort of figured it out. </connor>
<joey> - They're so on top of everything, </joey>
<connor> that's what they care about. </connor>
<joey> - And not a single tip was necessary. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause people here they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Bro, we've got so many issues like guns." </connor>
<connor> And then Japan's like, </connor>
<joey> "If that fucking package doesn't fucking turn up </joey>
<connor> "when I tell it to, I'm not voting for you." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Legit. </connor>
<connor> - That's what they give a fuck about. </connor>
<connor> - We've only been here a few days </connor>
<connor> and within that few days, </connor>
<garnt> we can feel an entirely complaining about America. </garnt>
<joey> - This is just the complaining about America episode. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because it's just this endless fucking stream. </connor>
<connor> - Because America is an endless loop of dichotomy is like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, oh, this big company does bad thing, </connor>
<connor> "but the reason why it's doing bad thing </connor>
<connor> "is 'cause people don't wanna do anything else." </connor>
<garnt> And it's just this fucking cycle. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I get it to a point </garnt>
<garnt> why I've experienced such bad customer service </garnt>
<garnt> because they have no fucking incentive </garnt>
<garnt> to give a shit about their job. </garnt>
<garnt> And I get it, </garnt>
<garnt> especially dealing with people with the airport, </garnt>
<garnt> you deal with the most stressed out people in the world. </garnt>
<joey> At a level, I get it </joey>
<joey> and it's kind of sad in a way, </joey>
<joey> where I see a lot of people in customer service positions </joey>
<joey> and it feels like the only people that you see actually care </joey>
<joey> about giving a good service is when there is an option </joey>
<joey> to tip in that occupation. </joey>
<joey> - It's true, it is true. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's just what I've seen. </joey>
<joey> There are plenty of customer service positions in America, </joey>
<joey> but only the ones that tip with my own experience </joey>
<joey> is the ones where you really feel </joey>
<joey> that they care about the customer. </joey>
<garnt> Society, right? - We live in a society. </garnt>
<connor> - Society. - I'd love to say that, man, </connor>
<connor> dude, I would do different. </connor>
<connor> I would totally care. </connor>
<connor> I don't think I'd care. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - I think I'd be like, "I don't fucking care." </joey>
<connor> Why would I? </connor>
<connor> It's on my bag. </connor>
<joey> - Well, especially if you're surrounded by that environment. </joey>
<connor> It's like, you look like the weirdo </connor>
<joey> if you're the one that's caring. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure at LAX, that woman has probably </connor>
<garnt> had the most horrible people shouting at her </garnt>
<connor> and fucking just screaming and then no repercussions. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Well yeah, of course. </connor>
<garnt> - And can fucking walks off, goes home and is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I did nothing wrong." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I totally get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It sucks though. </garnt>
<connor> But it does suck 'cause you're like, </connor>
<garnt> "Why are you taking it out on me? </garnt>
<garnt> I was nice to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it sucks for me 'cause I happened to be the person </garnt>
<joey> that all that fucking frustration got taken out on. </joey>
<joey> And it just felt fucking horrible, </joey>
<joey> which is not to be given the time of day </joey>
<connor> or just to be made to feel guilty for just trying </connor>
<connor> to resolve one issue on my end. </connor>
<connor> - Even in the UK, that's pretty rare. </connor>
<connor> I feel like there's just a level of disappointment </connor>
<connor> and resentment that everyone has. </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't really go below that. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone kind of was just kinda like, "Yeah." </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like in the UK, </garnt>
<joey> you can really just like, </joey>
<connor> "Look, I'm going through a fucking bad day right now." </connor>
<connor> There's a certain tone </connor>
<connor> especially in this kind of situations </connor>
<connor> where I feel like it's much rarer in the UK, </connor>
<connor> from what I've seen </connor>
<connor> to see people really have a fucking outburst. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I mean, that they will. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I've seen plenty, I've seen plenty. </connor>
<connor> - It will definitely happen, </connor>
<connor> but it's less than what I've seen here in America at least. </connor>
<garnt> I just needed to vent a bit </garnt>
<garnt> because I literally lost about in counting, </garnt>
<garnt> about eight hours of my time to this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean like when it's LAX, </garnt>
<joey> it's triple a mental time. </joey>
<garnt> You gave eight, but you lost 25. </garnt>
<garnt> - Time moves slow. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like I lost a year of my life </garnt>
<garnt> with this experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I'd be miserable if I worked at LAX. </garnt>
<joey> Fucking worst airport. </joey>
<joey> - I'm miserable going through LAX, </joey>
<joey> let alone working at it. </joey>
<joey> - People were like, </joey>
<joey> "Bro, at least we're not in New York." </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "You are not fucking any better. </connor>
<connor> "What are you on about? </connor>
<connor> "You all suck. </connor>
<connor> "This is all broken. </connor>
<connor> "None of this works!" </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so actually 'cause we've been to LA before, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think this is the first time </garnt>
<garnt> we've had extended stay in LA. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the longest time I've spent in LA in one go </joey>
<joey> is maybe five days at most. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and that's always been in downtown. </garnt>
<garnt> And every time I talk </garnt>
<joey> to a local they're like, "Downtown really?" </joey>
<joey> That's the awful fucking sector. </joey>
<connor> - It's pretty sketch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's the sketch sector. </connor>
<connor> You'll get stabbed or shot </connor>
<connor> if you walk down the streets there, </connor>
<connor> which is something we've definitely come close </connor>
<connor> to experiencing in downtown LA around "AX". </connor>
<connor> But the reason we normally come to LA </connor>
<joey> is because of "AX", and "AX" is in downtown LA. </joey>
<joey> So this is actually our first experience, </joey>
<joey> mostly outside of downtown, </joey>
<joey> but also getting a chance to experience others. </joey>
<joey> - Actually explore Los Angeles. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so you guys were here a few days before me. </garnt>
<garnt> How was your guys' experience so far? </garnt>
<joey> Well, it was good until I got COVID. </joey>
<garnt> - That's true, that's true. </garnt>
<joey> - So I mean, it was good for the first three or four days </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was staying in Pasadena, </joey>
<garnt> which is a relatively nicer part of LA, </garnt>
<garnt> at least everyone in LA says it's a nice part of LA. </garnt>
<connor> It was nice to be fair. </connor>
<connor> And then you have places like Glendale, </connor>
<connor> which is where all the YouTubers live and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I definitely saw a more relaxed. </connor>
<garnt> I felt safer </garnt>
<garnt> in Pasadena and Glendale a million times more </garnt>
<garnt> than in downtown LA, which is not hard </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause downtown LA is just "GTA" in real life. </garnt>
<connor> I felt a little safer and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, I can actually kind of walk the streets </connor>
<connor> "of Pasadena during the day </connor>
<connor> "and it feels just like a regular town." </connor>
<connor> It's like kind of nice and there's like lots of places </connor>
<connor> to eat and it's really chill. </connor>
<connor> - I just looked like "Drake and Josh" when I was there. </connor>
<connor> I felt like I was on an episode of "Drake and Josh". </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. - A little bit, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I walked past an elementary school </joey>
<joey> that looked like it was ripped straight from "The Simpsons". </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh!" </connor>
<connor> It was that point where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, you know what, LA might not be as bad." </connor>
<connor> And then again, </connor>
<joey> there was just those like just small little instances </joey>
<joey> that just made me be like, </joey>
<joey> "Mm, yeah, maybe not, maybe not." </joey>
<connor> Say, the fucking LAX situation </connor>
<connor> or the Amazon situation. </connor>
<garnt> It's very nitpicking, I know, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think it just goes to show </garnt>
<joey> how much we've been blessed in Tokyo. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's nitpicking </garnt>
<garnt> when you choose a place to live for example, </garnt>
<garnt> visiting and living </garnt>
<garnt> is two totally different experiences </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a lot of little things </garnt>
<garnt> that will build up over time. </garnt>
<garnt> One thing I've really, really missed is walking. </garnt>
<garnt> I've missed walking a lot </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm sure there are some places in LA, </garnt>
<garnt> which I'm sure you can walk </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like a lot of America as a whole </garnt>
<garnt> is just not built for walking at all. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I remember I was meeting up with a friend of mine </joey>
<garnt> and she lives like kind of in the middle </garnt>
<garnt> between Pasadena and Glendale. </garnt>
<garnt> So from my hotel, it was a 20 minute walk at most. </garnt>
<garnt> And so we were hanging out in Pasadena, </garnt>
<garnt> we had lunch and shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, let's just go back to your place </garnt>
<garnt> "and we'll just hang out." </garnt>
<garnt> And I looked on the map and it was 20 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm like, "Yeah, we can walk that. </garnt>
<connor> "It's a nice day, fucking it's the middle of the day. </connor>
<connor> "It's what, 2:00 PM in the afternoon. </connor>
<connor> "I kinda wanna have a walk." </connor>
<connor> She looked at me like I was a fucking weirdo. </connor>
<connor> - She was like, "What are you, homeless? </connor>
<connor> "Walking, what the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> - And she's like, "We're gonna walk it?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Don't fucking look at me like that! </connor>
<connor> "Yes, I would like to use my legs </connor>
<garnt> "'cause I haven't done that in a while since I got here." </garnt>
<garnt> And she was just like, "Okay." </garnt>
<garnt> And she kind of reluctantly followed me. </garnt>
<garnt> I got five minutes into this walk </garnt>
<garnt> and I turned a corner and I was like, </garnt>
<joey> "I don't wanna go down that street." </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, I can see what you were talking about." </connor>
<connor> Yes, it's a 20 minute walk, </connor>
<joey> but it's also 20 minutes of my life potentially </joey>
<joey> in a lot of danger at the same time. </joey>
<connor> - It's 30 minutes when you gotta do the Navy Seals checks </connor>
<joey> and all of that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, when you gotta dodge all the homeless people. </joey>
<connor> I feel weird catching an Uber to some place </connor>
<garnt> that's five minutes away, but you have to living here. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that's one thing that made me realize, </garnt>
<joey> perhaps LA is fun to visit, </joey>
<joey> but definitely I wouldn't wanna live </joey>
<joey> here personally speaking. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, when there's four lanes of cars crossing, </connor>
<connor> it just feels like a fucking dice roll. </connor>
<connor> And a lot of them don't have lights. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, "Wait, so when do I go?" </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, no, no, you play chicken. </connor>
<connor> You cross the first two </connor>
<connor> and then you kinda wait in the middle. </connor>
<joey> - Literally the moment you step out of the car, </joey>
<garnt> you are playing with your life. </garnt>
<garnt> - You just playing "Frogger". </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it gets pretty fucking scary, </joey>
<joey> especially when you're in downtown LA or any sketch places, </joey>
<connor> which there are a number of in LA. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, I'm white. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you get free pass. </connor>
<joey> Because I still remember, </joey>
<joey> I was saying this to Connor the other day, </joey>
<joey> I still remember </joey>
<garnt> that fucking Airbnb you </garnt>
<garnt> and Sydney booked the last time we were in "AX". </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, </garnt>
<garnt> you were having like a house party </garnt>
<joey> and you sent me the address on Google maps. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, sick, it's literally just around the corner </joey>
<joey> "from our hotel." </joey>
<connor> So I was just like, "Let's just fucking walk it." </connor>
<joey> It was a three minute walk. </joey>
<joey> And I remember we were mostly on the main road, </joey>
<joey> cars whizzing by, a couple of people </joey>
<joey> on the streets or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, all right cool, that's fine. </joey>
<joey> And the moment we got to your street, </joey>
<joey> it was just this dark alleyway. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "This can't be right." </joey>
<joey> And then from all the way across the alleyway, </joey>
<joey> I could just hear you going, "Over here!" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "You are not making me walk down this fucking alleyway. </joey>
<joey> "Are you kidding me?" </joey>
<joey> There are two other people </joey>
<connor> in this alleyway looking sketch as fuck, </connor>
<connor> just standing around. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "I'm literally about to put my life on the line </garnt>
<garnt> "to go and hang out with Connor. </garnt>
<joey> "All right, fuck it, let's do it." </joey>
<garnt> - I remember that Airbnb 'cause inside, </garnt>
<joey> it looked fucking fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, inside was great. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, inside was fucking fantastic. </joey>
<joey> We had a pool table and everything. </joey>
<joey> It was a nice open space. </joey>
<joey> But my God, </joey>
<joey> it was in the most sketch area you could ever imagine. </joey>
<joey> And I felt bad whenever I was inviting people around </joey>
<joey> to that Airbnb </joey>
<joey> 'cause I remember at least you walked down </joey>
<joey> that dark alleyway </joey>
<joey> 'cause our house was right at the end of this dark alleyway. </joey>
<joey> It was an alleyway with a dead end. </joey>
<joey> So if you would like to rank the top places </joey>
<connor> to get mugged in LA, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure that was top 10 places to get mugged </connor>
<joey> and stabbed in LA. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Definitely, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember I invited Super Eyepatch Wolf John </joey>
<joey> to the apartment as well. </joey>
<joey> And I remember he gets to the same point </joey>
<joey> and all I see is a dark silhouette </joey>
<garnt> 'cause he's saying that he's standing </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of this alleyway. </garnt>
<garnt> I see this dark silhouette. </garnt>
<garnt> It's John, he's by himself. </garnt>
<garnt> And I go out, I see him like, "John, over here, over here." </garnt>
<garnt> But I'm sure to him, he just goes, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, hello, hello, hello." </joey>
<garnt> And so I remember, he sees my silhouette. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember he starts walking the opposite direction, </garnt>
<joey> immediately starts power walking the opposite direction. </joey>
<joey> - He was like, </joey>
<joey> "Who's this fucking weirdo calling to me?" </joey>
<joey> - And so I have to fucking sprint to run up to him. </joey>
<garnt> And be like, "John, John it's me, it's me, don't worry." </garnt>
<joey> - And then he starts running more faster. </joey>
<joey> He was like, "Get away from me." </joey>
<joey> That was scary. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember a long time ago, </joey>
<connor> Connor, you were saying you wanted to live in America. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it'd be fun for a while. </connor>
<joey> - Has that opinion changed? </joey>
<connor> - No, dude, I'd get so much content living here. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay, when you say living in America, </connor>
<connor> do you mean living in LA? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know about that. </joey>
<connor> I just feel like even you just talk to an Uber driver, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "Great, I just got content for a week." </connor>
<connor> Just talking about this guy, crazy shit he said to me. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, it's a crazy place, but I dunno know, </connor>
<joey> at some point, I'd like to experience it more </joey>
<joey> 'cause I feel like even two weeks isn't enough. </joey>
<joey> I want experience that awful process of signing up </joey>
<joey> for a water bill or something. </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I love that shit. </connor>
<joey> - Have you not already experienced it enough in Japan? </joey>
<connor> - No, but yeah, I love going through that mundane stuff. </connor>
<connor> Something about, I dunno, </connor>
<connor> you really feel like you're in it. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> There's something about that experience I really enjoy. </joey>
<joey> - I'm good bro. - During I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "This is awful", but after that fact I'm like... </joey>
<connor> I'd love to be like yeah, LAX dude, </connor>
<connor> what a fucking crazy. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> Just sitting down like, </connor>
<garnt> "Fuck, I don't wanna go to LAX." </garnt>
<garnt> No one wants to go to LAX. </garnt>
<connor> It's fucking awful. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, being here for a few days, </garnt>
<garnt> we've already got a fucking weeks' worth of content </garnt>
<joey> for "Trash Taste". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, honestly, honestly, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean you got married </garnt>
<garnt> and we didn't even speak about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Oh yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - We were too busy fucking ranting about America. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, I guess this is the first podcast </garnt>
<garnt> since I got married, so yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Congrats. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] I'm a married man now. </joey>
<joey> - Hell yeah. - Look at that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, silver. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, silver. </joey>
<joey> - Classy, very nice. </joey>
<joey> - So I guess now, I can ask. </joey>
<joey> I remember before the marriage, you were just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, is it gonna be the "JuJutsu Kaisen" of marriages?" </joey>
<joey> - It was okay. </joey>
<joey> - Is it gonna be myth? </joey>
<joey> Is it gonna be myth? </joey>
<garnt> How was your guys' experiences with it? </garnt>
<garnt> - It was okay. (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - Joey could never say anything. </connor>
<joey> He can't say anything good. </joey>
<joey> - I could have been </joey>
<joey> in my hotel room watching "JuJutsu Kaisen", </joey>
<joey> but I had to come out. </joey>
<joey> No, no, it was fantastic. </joey>
<joey> I mean yeah, 'cause I mean, this is what, my second </joey>
<joey> or third wedding I've been to. </joey>
<garnt> - Is this your first mate's wedding you guys have been to? </garnt>
<joey> - This is my second mate's wedding. </joey>
<garnt> - This is my first friend's wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it was very different to my first mate's wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, because it was the Indian wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, it was the Japanese wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was the very traditional fucking invite your boss </garnt>
<connor> and your colleagues level Japanese wedding. </connor>
<connor> So actually, I'd say this was the first time </connor>
<connor> where it was a proper mate's wedding type thing. </connor>
<connor> I got really fucking close </connor>
<connor> to crying watching you cry though. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause in my head, I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Okay, this is a really fucking momentous </connor>
<connor> "occasion for Garnt." </connor>
<connor> Obviously every wedding, very emotional, </connor>
<connor> really important day for a lot of people. </connor>
<garnt> And so, I cried at my cousin's waiting </garnt>
<garnt> because obviously watching a family member cry </garnt>
<garnt> is gonna make you cry. </garnt>
<garnt> But I didn't cry at my mate's wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> Nothing against my mate. </garnt>
<connor> I just didn't. </connor>
<joey> - You're not good enough. </joey>
<joey> You don't deserve it. </joey>
<joey> - You're a mate, but you're not my boy. </joey>
<connor> But I was fully expecting that I was gonna cry at some point </connor>
<garnt> in your wedding, </garnt>
<garnt> but I didn't know what was going to be the trigger. </garnt>
<connor> And the trigger came very quickly when you started crying </connor>
<joey> because there's something about watching Garnt cry </joey>
<joey> that is really fucking sad. </joey>
<connor> - It's like seeing your dad cry for the first time. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - This shit just doesn't happen. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It doesn't happen. - [Connor] What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - It never fucking happens. </joey>
<garnt> So when you see it in real life, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, shit, this is gonna make me cry." </garnt>
<joey> And I could tell that I wasn't the only one </joey>
<joey> because literally fucking 70% of that room was crying </joey>
<joey> at that moment as well. </joey>
<garnt> - That was like a sniffing convention for a while. </garnt>
<joey> - That was a sniffing convention. </joey>
<garnt> - People told me man. </garnt>
<joey> - And then I almost cried a second time </joey>
<joey> when it was that clip where we honked it out </joey>
<joey> on the dance floor. </joey>
<garnt> - There's so many fucking wholesome moments </garnt>
<garnt> from that wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fucking glad. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fucking glad. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm happy, I'm happy because I'm glad </garnt>
<joey> that everyone, it was just a happiness fucking gathering. </joey>
<joey> Everyone was just like good vibes. </joey>
<joey> Everyone was just happy. </joey>
<joey> It was good vibes. </joey>
<joey> And that was before everyone got fucking hammered </joey>
<garnt> and fucking drunk like holy fucking shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, some people got blasted. </joey>
<garnt> - Meilyne, Meilyne, Meilyne! </garnt>
<garnt> I remember Meilyne. </garnt>
<garnt> So we had an open bar and I remember- </garnt>
<joey> - Best and worst decision ever. </joey>
<garnt> - Best and worst decision of my life </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember going up to the bar to open the bar </garnt>
<garnt> and you have to put a tab down on the bar. </garnt>
<joey> And I remember asking how much is a reasonable number </joey>
<joey> to put the tab down. </joey>
<joey> And the guy says, </joey>
<joey> "We've been doing weddings for years. </joey>
<joey> "We recommend this number." </joey>
<joey> Great, and so I was like, "Great, just in case, </joey>
<joey> "I'm gonna put double of the amount </joey>
<joey> "so that I don't have to get charged, </joey>
<joey> "so you don't have to call me if it breaks that limit." </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, "Great." </joey>
<joey> And so how it works is that however much you don't spend, </joey>
<connor> they'll refund you. </connor>
<connor> So about a few days after the wedding, </connor>
<connor> I give them an email to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh great, can I get the refund please? </connor>
<connor> "How much was not used on the tab?" </connor>
<connor> And I waited a few days 'cause it was bank holiday </connor>
<connor> or something, and then I get an email back. </connor>
<connor> - Processing all these fucking transactions. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and I get an email back and they're like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh great, we can refund you a grand total of one pound 40. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Legit, one pound 40? - One pound 40. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn. - And I'm like, "damn." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not even mad anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just impressed. </garnt>
<joey> - You meticulously calculated that. </joey>
<garnt> - But it was double the recommended amount </garnt>
<garnt> and you guys fucking destroyed that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm not surprised because I've never seen </garnt>
<garnt> so many fucking shots being taken in one night. </garnt>
<connor> I took around seven shots of tequila that night. </connor>
<connor> My God, Meilyne was a fucking tequila fiend. </connor>
<connor> My God, if you went into a five meter radius of Meilyne, </connor>
<connor> you were getting dragged to do a shot of tequila. </connor>
<connor> I remember this one time, </connor>
<connor> I remember seeing Meilyne ask Joey </connor>
<garnt> if you wanted the shot and you were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "No Meilyne, I hate shots." </garnt>
<garnt> And she fucking gave you a fucking death grip </garnt>
<joey> and just dragged you to the bar and made you do a shot. </joey>
<joey> - She literally grabbed me by my sleeve </joey>
<joey> and was just like, "No, is not an answer." </joey>
<joey> And so I did that first shot. </joey>
<joey> So the first shot was like, all right, you know what, </joey>
<joey> it's a wedding. </joey>
<joey> There's seven other people doing the shot with me, fuck it. </joey>
<garnt> I hate tequila so much, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'll do it just because I don't wanna- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] You're vibing, it's good vibes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna be part of the vibe so I did it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was fucking horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the second time around was when Meilyne was like, </garnt>
<connor> "No is not an answer." </connor>
<connor> And dragged me to the bar. </connor>
<connor> Again, with all the familiar faces like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, the first time for you all? </joey>
<joey> "All right, yeah." </joey>
<joey> So I did the second shot, hated it. </joey>
<joey> And then a couple of hours passed by and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, Meilyne hasn't called me back yet." </joey>
<joey> And so I just when I thought I was in the clear, </joey>
<joey> Meilyne from a distance fucking scuttles towards me </joey>
<joey> and she was just like, "Tequila shot, Joey?" </joey>
<joey> And I just had to go, "Fuck off." </joey>
<joey> I literally flipped a finger and was just like, </joey>
<joey> "No, get away from me." </joey>
<joey> And I just walked off. </joey>
<joey> And Meilyne, she was just like. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Fucking ran. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I literally ran from her </joey>
<joey> 'cause I knew if I wasn't stern about it, </joey>
<connor> she would grab me by the sleeve again </connor>
<connor> because I heard from a bunch of other people </connor>
<connor> who were way too nice to Meilyne that they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, she made me do six shots." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "That's 'cause you have to say the hard no. </joey>
<joey> "It's not just the soft no, it's the hard no." </joey>
<joey> - Pressure, pressure. </joey>
<connor> - Did she make you do any shots? </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<joey> I didn't really mind though, one is fine. </joey>
<joey> - You only got to do one? </joey>
<joey> - I think Meilyne only made me do one. </joey>
<joey> - Why did she make me do three? </joey>
<joey> - I guess 'cause you were just too close </joey>
<joey> to her vicinity wise. </joey>
<joey> So I was really worried 'cause you we had food </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "This isn't enough. </joey>
<connor> "Three courses gone, really? </connor>
<connor> "Come on, I'm a six course kind of guy minimum </connor>
<joey> "or at least gimme someone else's course who didn't finish." </joey>
<joey> And then lo and behold, </joey>
<connor> people just start bringing out pizza. </connor>
<joey> - It was all you can eat pizza. </joey>
<garnt> - It was all we can eat like stone bake pizza. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think I had like four whole pizzas. </connor>
<joey> - I had a worrying amount of pizza. </joey>
<connor> - It was more pizza than any doctor would ever recommend. </connor>
<connor> Even if you were carb loading for a desert survival </connor>
<connor> for 10 weeks, you wouldn't eat this many calories. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, every time they brought it to me, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, I can't say no. </connor>
<connor> "I mean, it's a different topping. </connor>
<joey> "I gotta try it." </joey>
<garnt> - That was me with the espresso martinis. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I had five espresso martinis that day </garnt>
<joey> and I'm like, "Oh that's why I'm shaking." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so we had a station </garnt>
<connor> to give out free espresso martinis to everyone. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. - [Joey] Wow. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, we wanted everyone to have a good time. </garnt>
<connor> - No wonder that tab was high. </connor>
<connor> - But that wasn't even on the tab. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - That was a pre-package that we paid for. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I remember, </garnt>
<connor> I went up to the bar after my first espresso martini </connor>
<connor> that they brought out for everyone </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Oh, can I get another espresso martini?" </connor>
<joey> And the dude literally just points to the side </joey>
<joey> because there's literally this three layered shelf </joey>
<joey> of espresso martinis. </joey>
<joey> There was 12 espresso martinis. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Take your pick." </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh shit, all right, cool." </connor>
<joey> I just drank three of them and I was just fucking shaking. </joey>
<garnt> - So I guess to go to the start of my experience </garnt>
<garnt> of the wedding </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause obviously you guys' experience was very, </garnt>
<garnt> very different from mine. </garnt>
<garnt> So we had about, </garnt>
<joey> I think it was only 62 people at this wedding. </joey>
<joey> So it was a fairly small wedding, </joey>
<joey> but I really, really liked the size of the wedding </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was a good amount of size. </joey>
<joey> I could keep up with pretty much everyone. </joey>
<joey> - You could interact with everyone. </joey>
<joey> - I could talk with everyone </joey>
<joey> and not feel like it was just like a convention experience </joey>
<joey> where I was having one sentence conversations with people, </joey>
<joey> but have proper, meaningful conversations, </joey>
<joey> which is good 'cause I just wanted to share the good vibes </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> But I remember like the night before the wedding, </joey>
<joey> I was so fucking, I dunno what the right word </joey>
<joey> to describe it was. </joey>
<connor> It was a mixture of nervous and excited </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was not the bad kind of nervous. </connor>
<connor> The way I described it, </connor>
<connor> it kind of felt like you were 10 years old </connor>
<connor> and it was the day before Christmas. </connor>
<connor> And you knew, you knew you were getting </connor>
<connor> that N64 for Christmas. </connor>
<connor> You knew, that this was the special Christmas, </connor>
<connor> where you were getting the fucking game console. </connor>
<connor> And so I got two hours of sleep before my wedding, </connor>
<connor> before the day of my wedding </connor>
<connor> 'cause I tried to go to sleep at a reasonable time. </connor>
<connor> So I was gonna go to sleep at around 11. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Great, I'm gonna have a reasonable amount </connor>
<connor> "of sleep before my wedding and can be well rested." </connor>
<connor> And then like an hour passes, </connor>
<connor> two hour passes and I'm like, "I cannot get to sleep. </connor>
<connor> "Okay, okay, if I go to sleep now, </connor>
<connor> "I'll get six hours of sleep now, now." </connor>
<connor> An hour passes, all right. </connor>
<connor> Five hours of sleep, now, now. </connor>
<connor> - That's how it always works. </connor>
<connor> - And I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "If I just go to sleep now, </connor>
<connor> "I'll wake up and I'm gonna have a wife. </connor>
<connor> "It's gonna be great." </connor>
<connor> And then it gets to about four or five in the morning. </connor>
<connor> I'm in pure copium right now </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "What if I just have no sleep before my wedding? </connor>
<connor> "I can function. </connor>
<connor> "If I just stay up or not, I can function, </connor>
<connor> "that's something I can do before one </connor>
<connor> "of the most important days of my life. </connor>
<connor> "I can do that." </connor>
<connor> But before I like truly justify it to myself, I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Okay, let's just try something new." </garnt>
<garnt> So I take off all of my sheets </garnt>
<garnt> and take off all my blankets and I put them on the floor. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Let's try sleeping on the floor, </garnt>
<garnt> "on the hard floor." </garnt>
<garnt> And for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if there's just these like Asian genes </garnt>
<garnt> or something where it just felt like I was home again. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just immediately conked out. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh my God. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I dunno, I was sleeping. </joey>
<joey> - Were you reminded of your monk days, </joey>
<garnt> sleeping on the temple floor? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even know, pretty likely. </joey>
<joey> It felt like I was sleeping </joey>
<joey> on a fucking futon or something. </joey>
<joey> I dunno what it was about sleeping on the floor, </joey>
<joey> but I just immediately conked out after sleeping </joey>
<joey> on a nice comfy bed or something. </joey>
<connor> And then yeah, we go to the wedding venue. </connor>
<connor> And of course, I was tense nervous. </connor>
<connor> It was like the feeling of before you get in, </connor>
<connor> you start a panel where you go on stage or something. </connor>
<connor> It's just like you know this big thing is coming up, </connor>
<joey> but you just gotta wait around for it to start. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's the worst. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was so fucking jittery. </joey>
<joey> - I know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I talked to Sydney </joey>
<joey> if she was nervous for the wedding </joey>
<joey> and she was like her nerves ended the moment she woke up </joey>
<connor> because she was so busy before the wedding started </connor>
<connor> because she had to go do her makeup, </connor>
<connor> go do her hair and all the bridesmaids as well. </connor>
<connor> So she was at the venue from 9:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't need to get there till 12 noon. </connor>
<joey> - You had the easy job. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and so that was just a lot of time </joey>
<joey> for just me to be alone with my own thoughts </joey>
<joey> and be really, really fucking nervous. </joey>
<joey> And so yeah, I was really tense, nervous, whatever, </joey>
<joey> but luckily, I had my boys with me. </joey>
<joey> I had my boys. - The lads were there. </joey>
<joey> - The lads were there, my hype men were there with me. </joey>
<joey> I remember going to the boys. </joey>
<connor> So to fully explain neither of these two were my best men. </connor>
<connor> It's okay. - Heartbreak. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry guys. </connor>
<connor> Only Connor was a groomsman, </connor>
<connor> but part of the reason was it, made me realize </connor>
<joey> how long it's been since I've planned this wedding </joey>
<joey> because me and Sydney had planned the wedding basically </joey>
<joey> before we had moved to Japan. </joey>
<joey> And every role </joey>
<joey> or the entire wedding party was chosen and everything. </joey>
<joey> - Before "Trash Taste". </joey>
<joey> - The wedding was going </joey>
<joey> to originally be before "Trash taste" even started. </joey>
<joey> So it's fucking insane that I've grown so much closer </joey>
<joey> to these two in these past two years </joey>
<joey> where when my wedding was planned, I knew Joey, </joey>
<joey> but we'd hung out only a few times. </joey>
<joey> And we'd hung out a lot, but I was not as close to you </joey>
<joey> as I am now. </joey>
<joey> It was so weird to have a wedding </joey>
<joey> that was planned two years ago, </joey>
<joey> where now the dynamic is totally fucking different </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> - I was just sitting in the crowding, like, "Yeah!" </joey>
<joey> - So I remember, </joey>
<joey> we call everyone in to the main ceremony hall. </joey>
<joey> So everyone starts getting their seats and I go out </joey>
<joey> by myself and I'm like, "Garnt, you got this, </joey>
<joey> "you got this. </joey>
<joey> "Garnt, you're gonna do a no tear wedding run. </joey>
<joey> "There's going to be zero crying at this wedding." </joey>
<connor> And I go out to myself just to give myself a breather. </connor>
<connor> Me and Sydney had personal vows. </connor>
<connor> So I bring out my personal vows and I'm rehearsing them </connor>
<connor> in my head. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Okay Garnt, you got this. </connor>
<connor> "Zero tears, we're not gonna cry at this wedding </connor>
<connor> "You got this, you got this." </connor>
<connor> I read the first sentence </connor>
<garnt> and I start fucking like my jaw just starts going. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Oh no, oh no, this is a bad sign. </garnt>
<garnt> "This is a bad sign." </garnt>
<garnt> And so while I'm doing this all of my lads, </garnt>
<connor> all my groomsmen come out and they see me. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Guys, I'm gonna need some hype around me. </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna need some fucking hype around me." </connor>
<connor> And so this was a moment where I took a page out </connor>
<connor> of Connor's book. </connor>
<connor> I literally go full monkey mode </connor>
<connor> right outside the ceremony room. </connor>
<connor> - It works, dude. - It works. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "You fucking got this! </connor>
<garnt> "You fucking got this!" </garnt>
<garnt> Not realizing that everyone inside, </garnt>
<garnt> could you hear me just fucking shouting by the door? </garnt>
<joey> - I heard you shouting at something, </joey>
<joey> but I wasn't too sure. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "That's Garnt, right? </joey>
<connor> - People who fear the shouting type </connor>
<joey> are people who haven't tried it. </joey>
<joey> If you try it, it actually works. </joey>
<connor> If you fully commit to it, it works. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, that time, it really fucking worked </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I had so much adrenaline in my body </joey>
<joey> that I needed some way to release it. </joey>
<joey> And so I remember getting to the ceremony room and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, it's good. </joey>
<joey> "The shouting helped." </joey>
<connor> I'm reset and the shouting's helped. </connor>
<connor> I go to the front, I turn around, </connor>
<connor> I look at my mom's face and just immediately, </connor>
<joey> I'm a broken man again. </joey>
<joey> My cousin told me this after the ceremony, </joey>
<joey> but he's just like, </joey>
<joey> "If there's one thing you definitely should not do </joey>
<joey> "when you're standing up there, waiting </joey>
<joey> "is look at your mom." </joey>
<connor> It's look at your parents. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, I can understand that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's a feeling I can't describe. </connor>
<connor> My dad and my mom were fucking tearing up </connor>
<connor> and I rarely see them tear up. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, what did my face look like </connor>
<garnt> when I was waiting up there? </garnt>
<garnt> I gotta know. </garnt>
<joey> - I can do a reenactment of exactly what you were like. </joey>
<joey> You were like (exhales). </joey>
<joey> That's what you looked like. </joey>
<garnt> - You're close, yeah , that's pretty accurate. </garnt>
<joey> - Every now and then, you'd turn and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, (exhales)." </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> That's what you looked like right before. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause there was a lovely, what you call it, quartet? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, quartet. </joey>
<joey> - It was lovely, killing it, playing this music. </joey>
<connor> And every time they were about to you know, </connor>
<connor> 'cause the song ends. </connor>
<connor> They're not doing a medley. </connor>
<connor> The song finishes and then they start the new one. </connor>
<joey> And everyone's talking, </joey>
<joey> and then the moment they finish the song, </joey>
<joey> it was like, my God. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, everyone stops. - It's starting. </joey>
<connor> And then they start playing the next song. </connor>
<connor> We're all waiting for Sydney to show. </connor>
<connor> And even I'm standing up here next to Garnt, and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "What's my fucking role? </connor>
<connor> "What do I do? </connor>
<connor> "I just wanna not fuck up. </connor>
<connor> "It's his day. </connor>
<connor> "I don't wanna do like a bit. </connor>
<joey> "I'm not here to do a bit. </joey>
<joey> "What do I do? </joey>
<connor> "I don't know." </connor>
<connor> - And then seeing you again, </connor>
<joey> it was seeing you nervous that made everyone else </joey>
<garnt> in the room nervous, being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh shit, this is actually finally happening and all that." </garnt>
<garnt> And then the quartet stops for the final time, </garnt>
<connor> and everyone was like, "Okay, its starting." </connor>
<connor> And then Sydney walks down </connor>
<connor> and then you immediately start breaking down. </connor>
<garnt> - I expected that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which I fully expected. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just like, "Oh, here come the floodgates. </garnt>
<joey> "Here it comes." </joey>
<joey> And then what stopped me was the song you guys played. </joey>
<joey> I was just like, "Oh my God, here it comes." </joey>
<joey> Is that "Gus' theme"? </joey>
<joey> Jen was sitting next to me and Luna was sitting next to me </joey>
<joey> and we all looked at each other and were like, </joey>
<joey> "That's "Gus' theme", right?" </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask. </garnt>
<joey> What made you choose that? </joey>
<joey> - Yes, Sydney walked down the aisle to "Gus' theme". </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Which is amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, which I knew it was coming </joey>
<joey> because I remember, it was literally the day </joey>
<joey> that Mira passed away. </joey>
<joey> And I remember, we were at a Netflix shoot at the day </joey>
<joey> so I didn't have proper time to process that news. </joey>
<joey> And I remember that day, </joey>
<connor> I went back home and I put on "Gus' theme" </connor>
<connor> and I was just zoning out "Gus' theme", </connor>
<connor> fucking crying to the news that had just got announced. </connor>
<connor> And Sydney was also listening to it, </connor>
<connor> just listening to it, seeing me listen to it for hours. </connor>
<connor> And she's just like, "I fucking love this song." </connor>
<joey> To me, "Gus' theme" is by far one of the greatest tracks </joey>
<joey> in anime to ever be made. </joey>
<joey> It's such a beautiful track </joey>
<joey> and it's unfortunate that it's been memed a lot nowadays. </joey>
<joey> So that's how people perceive "Gus' theme", </joey>
<connor> but I remembered listening to that on that day </connor>
<connor> that it's just such a beautiful fucking track. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, it's gorgeous. </connor>
<connor> - And I fucking cried to it so many times. </connor>
<connor> And so I remember Sydney goes to me jokingly, </connor>
<joey> she turns me and she was like, </joey>
<joey> "Wouldn't it be funny if we walked down the aisle to this?" </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, (chuckles) "Yeah, that'd be funny." </joey>
<joey> And then we both turned to each other </joey>
<garnt> and we looked at each other in the eyes </garnt>
<garnt> and we were just like, "But what if?" </garnt>
<connor> - What are you gonna do, using the fucking default music? </connor>
<garnt> That's boring. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then we're like, "Would it be cheesy? </garnt>
<connor> "Would it be cheesy?" </connor>
<garnt> And so we let it sink for a while and we let it sit </garnt>
<joey> for a few days. </joey>
<joey> We let it sit for a few weeks. </joey>
<joey> And then the longer we sat in it, </joey>
<joey> the more it felt like it was just the right idea </joey>
<joey> 'cause I fucking knew that I was gonna cry listening </joey>
<joey> to "Gus' theme" seeing Sydney down the aisle. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure if people knew we were gonna play "Gus' theme", </joey>
<garnt> that would've taken the fuck, "Gus' theme"? </garnt>
<joey> - I wish I knew beforehand </joey>
<joey> because I feel like for me, it was the initial really? </joey>
<joey> It was that moment where I was just like, </joey>
<connor> "Wow, they're actually using "Gus' theme"? </connor>
<connor> There was a split second </connor>
<connor> where I was about to start laughing, </connor>
<garnt> but then again, seeing you, and then seeing Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, "This is the right choice." </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember Sydney was telling me </garnt>
<garnt> that before Sydney comes out, all the bridesmaids walk out. </garnt>
<joey> So if you are familiar with "Gus' theme", </joey>
<joey> there's the intro bit. - Then there's the voice. </joey>
<joey> - There's the voice of guy going. </joey>
<joey> ♪ Ah ah ♪ </joey>
<garnt> - And I remember thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> I see all the bridesmaids walk out and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Where's Sydney, where's Sydney?" </garnt>
<garnt> And as soon as the fucking ah comes out, </garnt>
<garnt> she just appears. </garnt>
<joey> And apparently behind the scenes, </joey>
<joey> Sydney's with her dad waiting to walk out </joey>
<joey> and her dad's like, "Come on then, it's time to go." </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "No, I need to wait for that moment." </joey>
<joey> - The right moment. </joey>
<joey> - I need to wait for that voice before I appear. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - It was so incredibly well timed. </joey>
<garnt> - It was incredibly timed. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought it was just fucking God smiling down on us, </garnt>
<connor> but no, Sydney was like, "No, I'm waiting for this moment. </connor>
<joey> "I am waiting for this moment." </joey>
<connor> - You only get one shot. </connor>
<joey> Why not? </joey>
<joey> - And it fucking worked, man. </joey>
<joey> I think that's why I just immediately started balling </joey>
<joey> 'cause I hear that voice just pop off </joey>
<joey> and I see Sydney emerge. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "This is-" </joey>
<joey> - It's a double whammy. </joey>
<joey> - It's a fucking beautiful sight. </joey>
<joey> I cannot even begin to describe what I felt at that moment </joey>
<connor> 'cause it was literally like a scene out of anime. </connor>
<connor> - It had the final episode vibes. </connor>
<connor> Final episode vibes, all happy endings. </connor>
<connor> - That moment that fucking voice hit, </connor>
<connor> she emerges and I'm fuck man, </connor>
<connor> I'm fucking getting teary eyed just thinking about it. </connor>
<joey> But yeah, she walks down, </joey>
<joey> we say our vows </joey>
<garnt> and we fucking stumble through our fucking vows, man. </garnt>
<joey> - You guys did pretty good. - Did we? </joey>
<connor> - You guys were tearing up obviously, </connor>
<connor> but I think, yeah, you guys said your vows. </connor>
<joey> - I wouldn't say stumble. </joey>
<joey> I'd say you took pauses, </joey>
<joey> but who doesn't take a dramatic pause? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you took your time with it. </joey>
<joey> - It's not one of our fucking sponsors, </joey>
<joey> which is (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Do you wanna talk about the actual stumble, </joey>
<joey> which was the greatest moment of this wedding. </joey>
<garnt> - So obviously, everyone's sniffing. </garnt>
<joey> Everyone's crying after we've just finished </joey>
<joey> our vows together. - Very emotional. </joey>
<joey> - It's a very emotional, which is good vibes. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's just happy. </joey>
<joey> And so the registrar comes over </joey>
<joey> and she starts to say the official vows </joey>
<joey> that we need to repeat after her </joey>
<joey> in order to officialize our marriage. </joey>
<joey> She said my name a few times before. </joey>
<joey> So she knows how to pronounce my name correctly </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> And then it gets to like the final vows where she goes- </joey>
<joey> - The most important one. </joey>
<garnt> - And she goes, do you Grant, Garnt? </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - And everyone in the room was like, "Yeah, she did it." </joey>
<garnt> - All of the nervousness </garnt>
<garnt> and the emotions just fucking evaporated. </garnt>
<garnt> The entire room explodes and fucking starts applauding. </garnt>
<joey> - You would've thought it was a FIFA match happening. </joey>
<joey> It was just like, "Yeah!" </joey>
<joey> - It was so fucking perfect that everyone- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Everyone thought it was scripted. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone thought it was scripted. </joey>
<joey> - And everyone was like, "You made her say that, right? </joey>
<joey> "It was a bet, it was a bet." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "No." </joey>
<joey> - That just makes it even better. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah and I can't remember </joey>
<joey> what I said after that happened, </joey>
<joey> but I was like, "Yeah, got him." </joey>
<joey> - Got it, she did the thing. </joey>
<joey> - She did the thing. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Damn, are you a "Trash Taste viewer </joey>
<garnt> "Cause you just gave us a year's worth of content, man." </garnt>
<connor> - She's like, "This marriage hits different." </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> We don't say that anymore, do we? </joey>
<joey> - We don't hear that. - We don't say that anymore. </joey>
<joey> - We don't hear that. - We gotta bring that back. </joey>
<joey> I just realized whoever said that- </joey>
<joey> - It was a wedding with attitude. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, that was a brilliant moment. </garnt>
<joey> That was the icing on the cake. </joey>
<joey> Anyone would be pissed off if their name got mispronounced </joey>
<joey> at their wedding, but I was just like, </joey>
<garnt> "This just made the wedding 10 times more memorable </garnt>
<garnt> "and that moment 10 times more special." </garnt>
<joey> - And I guess yeah, as you were saying, </joey>
<garnt> the nerves just immediately disappeared </garnt>
<garnt> from you, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And the rest of the night was just good times. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I did almost fuck up, so close to fucking up </garnt>
<joey> at one of the most important moments of my life, </joey>
<joey> 'cause we finished our vows. </joey>
<joey> Well, officially were husband and wife. </joey>
<joey> And then I go sit down to sign my marriage papers. </joey>
<joey> And my marriage was a week after MCM </joey>
<joey> so the previous week, </joey>
<joey> I had just been signing hundreds and hundreds of prints </joey>
<joey> and everything like that, </joey>
<joey> but I was signing them as Guggukaz. </joey>
<joey> And my Guggukaz signature is very, very similar </joey>
<garnt> to my real signature, </garnt>
<garnt> but except it spells out my real name. </garnt>
<garnt> And so what happens? </garnt>
<garnt> I sit down to sign my marriage certificate. </garnt>
<garnt> I put down the G and then I put down the, I. </garnt>
<connor> - Giarnt Giarnt, maybe. - Giarnt. </connor>
<joey> - It's Italian Garnt. </joey>
<connor> Hello, I am Giarnt. </connor>
<connor> - So it's a small line. </connor>
<connor> And luckily, I stopped myself before I go too far, </connor>
<garnt> but I get a fifth of the way to signing Guggukaz </garnt>
<garnt> on my marriage certificate. </garnt>
<joey> - That would've been amazing. </joey>
<joey> - You could make the A from the I, right? </joey>
<connor> Making it a vertical A. </connor>
<joey> - You can recover from that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but luckily I was able to recover </joey>
<garnt> from that before I put down the extra G. </garnt>
<joey> - Just like Sydney (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - What if Sydney was like, </joey>
<connor> "I nearly made a big mistake. </connor>
<connor> "I nearly married the wrong person." </connor>
<joey> - I married Guggukaz. </joey>
<joey> Sydney's almost married to fucking Guggukaz </joey>
<joey> instead of Garnt. </joey>
<joey> I might as well just put down the fucking animes on. </joey>
<connor> - I just got a flashback. </connor>
<connor> I remember when the fucking spiel of, </connor>
<connor> "If anybody has anything to say." </connor>
<connor> Sydney was like, "Don't you fucking dare.", to everyone. </connor>
<connor> That was good. </connor>
<joey> I liked that part. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause we were planning beforehand </connor>
<joey> in the boys' locker room </joey>
<joey> or not the locker room, but the changing room. </joey>
<joey> - Boys' locker room. </joey>
<joey> - The groomsmen and all the dudes were hanging out. </joey>
<joey> We were conspired to be like, </joey>
<joey> "What if we just like, when the pastor says, </joey>
<joey> "'If anyone objects to this wedding, </joey>
<joey> "'please say your piece right now, whatever.'" </joey>
<joey> We were all planning, all the boys to just stand up </joey>
<joey> and be like, "We object." </joey>
<joey> And then we just skip out of the room with the boys. </joey>
<joey> That would've been funny. </joey>
<joey> - But then Sydney was just like, "Don't you fucking dare!" </joey>
<joey> She verbally said that and everyone laughed. </joey>
<joey> It was a great time. </joey>
<joey> And then yeah, it just felt like after that, </joey>
<joey> everyone was just on such a high. </joey>
<connor> It felt like everyone was drunk. </connor>
<connor> - Drunk on happiness. - Drunk with good vibes. </connor>
<connor> - And then alcohol. - And then alcohol. </connor>
<connor> - So double drunk. - On top of that. </connor>
<connor> I mean, there was a lot of magical things </connor>
<connor> that happened at the wedding. </connor>
<connor> I remember, we had </connor>
<connor> some fucking excellent photographers and videographers. </connor>
<connor> - They were great, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They were fucking great. </connor>
<connor> And then I remember we went outside. </connor>
<connor> We started taking photos and everything </connor>
<connor> with the group photos, family photos, </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<joey> And then we finally have a moment to ourselves </joey>
<joey> and Joey turns to me and he goes, </joey>
<joey> "Wouldn't be funny if we did the end </joey>
<joey> "of "Ava" congratulations scene right now?" </joey>
<joey> I looked at Joey and I look around </joey>
<joey> and I realized, this is a once in a lifetime. </joey>
<joey> - You have the power. - You have the power. </joey>
<joey> - This is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Joey, that's a great fucking idea." </joey>
<joey> - We've seen it, we can do it. </joey>
<joey> - I literally gather the boys. </joey>
<joey> - You're like, "Lads, assemble." </joey>
<joey> - It was really funny because before that, </joey>
<joey> while we were taking photos, </joey>
<joey> we had separate photos, the guys and the girls. </joey>
<joey> And, oh my God, the guys had so much fucking testosterone </joey>
<joey> when we took our photos. </joey>
<joey> I can't wait to see them. </joey>
<joey> But I remember there was this really funny moment </joey>
<joey> where it was like a school playground again, </joey>
<joey> where all of the girls were on one side of the venue </joey>
<joey> and all of the guys were on the other side of the venue. </joey>
<joey> So it was like a school trip or something. </joey>
<joey> So luckily all of the guys are gathered in one spot </joey>
<joey> and I gather the boys. </joey>
<joey> - Gather the boys. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "Boys, come here. </joey>
<joey> - You were like, "Lads, lads, lads, lads." </joey>
<joey> - We have an important mission, lads. </joey>
<connor> And at this point, people were like, </connor>
<connor> "Garnt, why are you calling us? </connor>
<connor> "We've just taken the photos." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Has everyone seen "Evangelion"?" </connor>
<garnt> And immediately as soon as I say that, everyone's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "King, we know what to do. </garnt>
<garnt> "Say no more. </garnt>
<garnt> "Say no more, King. </garnt>
<connor> "We know exactly what to do," </connor>
<connor> which is the beauty of having a bunch of weebs as friends </connor>
<connor> 'cause everyone's just on the same page. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even need to say what we did. </connor>
<joey> And so we filmed the congratulations scene, </joey>
<joey> that's fucking amazing. - Which came out amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, it came out amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - Especially the edit you did as well on Twitter </garnt>
<joey> was fucking amazing. </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> (people cheering) (mid tempo music) </joey>
<joey> - [Guests] Congratulations (clapping)! </joey>
<joey> - Thank you all. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, so I guess going off of that same vein, </connor>
<connor> we tried to have a traditional wedding. </connor>
<connor> - We tried. </connor>
<connor> - We tried to have a traditional wedding. </connor>
<connor> But also, we're a bunch of weebs </connor>
<connor> so even though it was fucking painful </connor>
<connor> to have this wedding be delayed for two years, </connor>
<connor> it actually, I think came out to be a blessing in disguise </connor>
<connor> 'cause it really, really gave me and Sydney the time </connor>
<joey> to really add a lot of little things that were just us. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like that's the thing </joey>
<joey> that people hopefully really remember </joey>
<joey> when they think back to our wedding, </joey>
<joey> because we wanted to have some anime references </joey>
<joey> at our wedding, of course we did, </joey>
<connor> but we didn't want a full on fucking cosplay wedding. </connor>
<joey> - You don't want a full on weeb wedding. </joey>
<garnt> - What do you mean I couldn't be Sebastian Michaelis? </garnt>
<joey> - And so we gave everyone a postcard with a drawing </joey>
<joey> of either it was me and Sydney in a wedding dress </joey>
<garnt> in the end "Eva" end screen. </garnt>
<garnt> Or, it was the famous "Oreimo" one. </garnt>
<garnt> And I can't remember which one you guys got. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got the "Eva" one. - Oh, you got the "Eva" one? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't remember. - You don't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Eva", "Eva". - You guys got a lucky one. </garnt>
<connor> - Why is that lucky? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know 'cause I had a bunch of people coming to me </connor>
<garnt> to be like, "You gave me the fucking "Oreimo" one. </garnt>
<joey> - D got the "Oreimo" one. </joey>
<garnt> He was so pissed off. </garnt>
<joey> He was like, "What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> - But we tried to write a nice little personal message </joey>
<joey> to everyone who attended our wedding. </joey>
<joey> And it's little touch like this </joey>
<garnt> that I don't think we would've been able to do one, </garnt>
<garnt> if we didn't have enough time and two, </garnt>
<garnt> if there was too many people there. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<garnt> - Yours was nice. </garnt>
<connor> Sydney just insulted me. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "What the fuck, Sydney? </connor>
<joey> - She was pretty much the same with everyone. </joey>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> What did I do? </connor>
<connor> I turned up didn't I? </connor>
<garnt> - But another thing is we wanted to try </garnt>
<connor> to integrate the places we'd been to </connor>
<connor> and the cultures we lived in as much as possible. </connor>
<connor> So we had a custom made masu box made, </connor>
<connor> which if you don't know what that is, </connor>
<connor> it's one of those sake boxes. </connor>
<garnt> So we had a custom crest that we made, </garnt>
<garnt> which was a combination of both of our families. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we gave everyone masu boxes, </garnt>
<garnt> which you normally drink sake out of. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I was excited. </garnt>
<joey> I was telling everyone at the table being like, </joey>
<garnt> "Yeah, so there's this thing </garnt>
<joey> "called (speaking in foreign language) </joey>
<joey> "that you use these masu boxes for where you pour it so much </joey>
<garnt> "that it overflows into the box." </garnt>
<joey> And everyone was like, "Oh cool." </joey>
<garnt> - And then if you know me and Sydney, </garnt>
<garnt> you know that we are not sake drinkers. </garnt>
<garnt> But I dunno why, </garnt>
<garnt> but there is a drink within our group, </garnt>
<garnt> which we are really famous for drinking </garnt>
<joey> because every time we go to like a party, </joey>
<garnt> someone brings crates and crates of this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I announce in my speech </garnt>
<garnt> that we're not gonna be toasting with champagne, </garnt>
<garnt> but we're gonna be toasting with Soju. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'd heard from several people </garnt>
<garnt> that Joey's face was just like, "How dare you?" </garnt>
<joey> - I've never experienced racism at a wedding, </joey>
<joey> but I felt like my culture was extremely appropriated. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Really?" </joey>
<joey> For fuck's sake, I don't even like Soju. </joey>
<joey> I did it for you, Christ. </joey>
<garnt> - The culture appropriation, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I had several people being like, </garnt>
<joey> "Bro, Joey is pissed." </joey>
<joey> You said that. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, pissed is a strong word. </joey>
<garnt> - I know, I know, I know. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, "Yeah, fuck it, whatever." </joey>
<joey> I was too much on a happy high to give a shit. </joey>
<joey> It was the next day where I thought about it. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Those fuckers." (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> How dare you? </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna take this masu box home just because, goddam. </joey>
<connor> - Sake just tastes like ducking foot vodka, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You guys just haven't had the good shit. </connor>
<connor> - I did the 100 tasting sake thing. </connor>
<connor> All of them happen to taste like shit. </connor>
<connor> - Nah, you don't have the palette for it. </connor>
<joey> - A palette of what, like a fucking wood chipper? </joey>
<connor> - Not Japanese enough. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - That's fire shit, sake, oh. </connor>
<joey> - I used to not like sake. </joey>
<joey> I used to think it was like paint thinner. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe when I get older and I get more (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - I'm much older than you. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe I just have two years to go. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, two years. </connor>
<connor> - Ask me in two years will I like sake? </connor>
<garnt> We'll find out. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe I've lived in Japan for long enough. </connor>
<connor> I think the next thing I remember </connor>
<connor> was actually the cake cutting, </connor>
<joey> I dunno what you guys remember, but I'm trying to think back </joey>
<joey> to all the big fucking things </joey>
<joey> that I remember about the wedding. </joey>
<joey> And so obviously it's traditional for a wedding </joey>
<joey> that you have a cake cutting with the bride and groom </joey>
<joey> and everyone gathers around and take pictures </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<garnt> And I remember Sydney cuts the cake </garnt>
<garnt> and then on her second slice, </garnt>
<garnt> she completely fucks up and just goes diagonal </garnt>
<garnt> and there's footage of this. </garnt>
<garnt> And I fucking burst laughing saying, </garnt>
<garnt> "Sydney, what the fuck is that?" </garnt>
<garnt> But then she full on just grabs the slice with her hand, </garnt>
<garnt> shoves it in my face and I'm eating it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then she has a bite for herself. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Guests] Two, one, woo! (upbeat music) </garnt>
<garnt> - And obviously, everyone's laughing. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's applauding and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I turn over to Meilyne </garnt>
<garnt> and I see Meilyne's mouth moving. </garnt>
<connor> And she says, "Oh, blah, blah." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> And I think she must be saying, </connor>
<connor> oh, your size is so cute or something, congratulations. </connor>
<connor> I go closer to be like, "Meilyne, what'd you say?" </connor>
<garnt> And she goes, "Lick it, lick her." </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - What the fuck? - You fucking freak. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm like, "What the fuck?" </garnt>
<garnt> But I'm like, "I'll do it for you Meilyne. </garnt>
<garnt> "I'll do it for you." </garnt>
<connor> - That beats Meilyne's weird, it's weird. </connor>
<joey> - Well, did you just do a Bucciarati on her? </joey>
<joey> - Basically, I licked the rest </joey>
<connor> of the cake off of Sydney's face. </connor>
<garnt> - You got to go half cake, half makeup. </garnt>
<connor> You just got a mouth full of makeup. </connor>
<connor> - She was caked with makeup. </connor>
<joey> - She was caked physically. - Yeah, in multiple ways. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I've heard some funny stories about other people, </joey>
<joey> other things that have happened around the wedding </joey>
<joey> that I wasn't involved in. </joey>
<joey> Obviously everyone was drunk. </joey>
<joey> I think one of the people </joey>
<joey> who got drunk the fastest actually was Karen. </joey>
<joey> Did you guys see Karen at all Demon dice? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I did. </garnt>
<garnt> I was the one that noticed that she was slouched </garnt>
<joey> on the couch, just forward slouched like this. </joey>
<joey> And I walked up to her 'cause no one was there </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Karen, are you okay?" </joey>
<joey> And then she just turns to me, she's like. </joey>
<joey> "I fucked up, man. </joey>
<joey> "I fucked up, man." </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "What happened, what happened? </garnt>
<garnt> "Did you get in a fight or something? </garnt>
<garnt> "What happened?" </garnt>
<joey> She's like, "No, I had four double shots </joey>
<joey> "of whiskey before the food." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Why did you do that?" </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) - Good vibes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I guess she was just having </connor>
<joey> a really good time. </joey>
<connor> - I sobered up. </connor>
<connor> My bedroom was on the third floor, no elevator. </connor>
<connor> I fucking sobered the fuck up. </connor>
<connor> Every time I had to go and get something from my room, </connor>
<connor> I came back down fully sober. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, walking those stairs, fuck, dude. </connor>
<connor> To get my luggage up, fucking my entire life up. </connor>
<joey> - So I was kind of comforting her, </joey>
<joey> getting her water and shit, </joey>
<joey> and then Sydney and a bunch of other girls came to be like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, you know what? </joey>
<joey> "You can just go crash in Sydney's room, whatever." </joey>
<joey> So that was okay. </joey>
<joey> The other one that was hilarious was Jan </joey>
<joey> because he wasn't fucking there. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> I was literally talking to him. </joey>
<joey> It was me and Maki and Jan, </joey>
<joey> and we were just chatting </joey>
<joey> and it was 30 minutes before the dinner. </joey>
<connor> And then Jan was like, "Dude, I'm gonna get a nap." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Jan, dinner's in literally 30 minutes. </connor>
<connor> "We're about to go in and sit down." </connor>
<connor> And he is like, "Oh no, no, don't worry. </connor>
<joey> "I'll be back, I'll be back, bro, don't worry." </joey>
<garnt> And we never saw him again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man went for cigarettes and never came back. </garnt>
<joey> - It was like the dad going for milk and cigarettes </joey>
<joey> that was just like, "Yeah, I'll be back." </joey>
<joey> And then, and it was like 10:00 PM when I noticed. </joey>
<connor> I came out of my drunken stupor and I was like. </connor>
<connor> "Has anyone seen Jan?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I called him. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Where the fuck are you?" </joey>
<joey> 'Cause right when he was about to leave you, I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Where you going?" </connor>
<connor> And he said, "Oh, I'm gonna go sleep." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Dude, dinner right now. </connor>
<connor> "Come, it's right now." </connor>
<connor> And he was just like, "No, no, no, no, I'll be back." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "You're not gonna fucking be back. </connor>
<connor> "I know you. </connor>
<connor> "You're not gonna be back." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "At least eat the dinner and then go. </connor>
<joey> "They paid for the food, eat the food and then leave." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and that was literally the last time </joey>
<joey> I saw him until now. </joey>
<joey> And I texted him I think on the day I was about to fly out, </joey>
<joey> to LA because I just remembered. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "That was literally the last time I saw </joey>
<connor> "and talked to Jan." </connor>
<connor> So I texted him being like, "Are you alive?" </connor>
<connor> That is one question I've asked Jan more </connor>
<connor> than any other person I know in my life. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause he just disappears. </connor>
<connor> - He just disappears and you just don't know where he is. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Are you alive?" </connor>
<garnt> - Every has that one friend. </garnt>
<joey> - And he was like, "Yeah, bro." </joey>
<joey> - You were telling me about how you saw Jan </joey>
<garnt> in the most Jan place before the wedding started. </garnt>
<joey> - So it was before the wedding started </joey>
<joey> and it was Connor, myself </joey>
<joey> and I forgot who else, someone else. </joey>
<joey> Oh, it was Mudan I think. </joey>
<joey> And we were just like, let's just go get, </joey>
<joey> because dinner wasn't until 4:00 PM, </joey>
<connor> and we had gathered at midday. </connor>
<connor> So we're like, </connor>
<connor> "Well fuck, I'm gonna be starving </connor>
<connor> "throughout this reception." </connor>
<connor> So were just like, </connor>
<connor> "There's a cafe around the corner. </connor>
<connor> "Let's just go there." </connor>
<connor> And I was walking there, and we walked past this alleyway. </connor>
<joey> And I literally did a double take. </joey>
<joey> I was like that </joey>
<joey> because Jen is standing there full suit, sunglasses </joey>
<joey> with a cigarette in his hand, </joey>
<joey> just talking to a homeless dude. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> And he was the most scruffy homeless dude. </joey>
<joey> He's wearing this red bathroom with this cigarette </joey>
<joey> in his hand. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno if he was homeless. </joey>
<connor> He just dressed like fucking what's Daniel Ratcliff </connor>
<connor> in the "Guns Akimbo", but without the guns. </connor>
<connor> He was literally dressed like that. </connor>
<connor> - You mean the one where he's like this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Literally that outfit, one for one just without the guns. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just like no shoes, bathrobe just with nappy hair, </connor>
<connor> with a cigarette in his hand. </connor>
<connor> And Jan is just properly dressed up in sunglasses </connor>
<connor> with a cigarette. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Jan?" </connor>
<joey> And he looks over and he is like, "Bro, help me." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "What do you mean help you?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Oh, sorry, my friend's here." </joey>
<joey> And then he walks over to me and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Do you know that guy?" </joey>
<joey> And he is like, "No." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Why were you there?" </joey>
<joey> And he is like, "Because he asked for a cigarette </joey>
<joey> "so I just gave him a cigarette. </joey>
<joey> "And then he just started talking to me </joey>
<joey> "and I couldn't leave." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> "You can very easily leave. </joey>
<joey> "You can just be like, 'Sorry, I have somewhere to go.'" </joey>
<joey> But because of course, </joey>
<joey> Jan is just too fucking nice and naive. </joey>
<garnt> - He just sort of tries to sweet talk everybody. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, he's like speech 100 every time. </joey>
<garnt> He's like, "Oh, thanks for saving me bro." </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, "I literally did nothing. </connor>
<connor> "I just walked past and you were talking to a dude </connor>
<garnt> "in a bathrobe." </garnt>
<garnt> It's the most Jan thing I've ever seen in my life. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> Another thing that fucking cracked me up as well, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause Mudan flew in from Estonia just to basically come </garnt>
<joey> to this wedding. </joey>
<garnt> And I felt so bad. </garnt>
<garnt> This was before the ceremony. </garnt>
<garnt> We were all getting ready in the boys' powder room </garnt>
<garnt> and Mudan comes in and then Connor's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Mudan, I got something for you." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> He reaches into his bag and brings out the hard disc </garnt>
<garnt> of the previous "Trash Taste" episodes </garnt>
<garnt> that we had just filmed in England. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I didn't just spring this on him. </garnt>
<connor> I wasn't like that. </connor>
<joey> So we recorded the "Trash Taste" episodes in the UK. </joey>
<joey> But obviously in the UK and the US, </joey>
<joey> these episodes are normally about 400 gigabytes total. </joey>
<joey> - We've been blessed by Japanese internet. </joey>
<joey> - There's just no internet speed that can do it. </joey>
<joey> So it was either we ship it to him in Estonia, </joey>
<joey> it would actually be faster than trying to find somewhere </joey>
<joey> to upload them. </joey>
<joey> So he was coming to the wedding. </joey>
<joey> I messaged him like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, I know this is kind of weird, </joey>
<joey> "but can I just give you the SSD of the episodes in person?" </joey>
<connor> And he was like, "Yeah, sure." </connor>
<connor> But then obviously he was kind of playing it up in person. </connor>
<connor> He was like, "Wow, really making me work today?" </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Come on man, I'm just here with this thing." </connor>
<joey> - It's like thank you for coming all the way to England. </joey>
<connor> Here's some work. </connor>
<connor> - He specifically said, "I'm gonna bill you for this hour." </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, alright, okay, whatever." </connor>
<connor> Hey, but it all turned out okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. you guys got the episode on time </garnt>
<connor> and that's because Mudan got the work at my wedding. </connor>
<joey> And to build on the Karen story, </joey>
<connor> because you saw the girls carrying her off to her room. </connor>
<connor> So Sydney told me what happened </connor>
<connor> after they started carrying her off. </connor>
<connor> So I told you the story about my mom </connor>
<connor> at my cousin's previous wedding </connor>
<connor> where I've never seen my mom drunk before, </connor>
<connor> but I saw a sleeping dragon awaken at my cousin's wedding. </connor>
<connor> I saw that sleeping dragon awaken even harder this time </connor>
<connor> because apparently what happened was Sydney was trying </connor>
<connor> to help Karen up to her room. </connor>
<connor> She feels a tap on the shoulder, turns around, it's my mom. </connor>
<connor> And she has a beer in hand. </connor>
<connor> Sydney's trying to be polite being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh mom, are you doing okay? </connor>
<connor> "I'm trying to get my friend up to her room." </connor>
<connor> Karen is on Sydney's shoulder. </connor>
<connor> My mom's like, "Watch this." </connor>
<connor> And she downs the bottle of beer. </connor>
<connor> She doesn't even say do you want me to down this? </connor>
<connor> This time, she just goes, "Watch this." </connor>
<connor> And she downs it. - Walks away. </connor>
<connor> - Sydney's like, "Mommy, I'm kind of busy right now." </connor>
<connor> And my mom looks at Karen and my mom looks back at Sydney </connor>
<connor> and she goes, "I'll be back, wait here." </connor>
<connor> And apparently she tries to go back to do it again. </connor>
<connor> And Sydney's like, </connor>
<connor> "Mom I really need to take my friend up </connor>
<connor> "to my room right now." </connor>
<connor> This time, my mom didn't even make it to the end </connor>
<joey> of the night. </joey>
<joey> - Your mom was popping off, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, she was popping off. </joey>
<garnt> You were popping off on the fucking dance floor. </garnt>
<garnt> Holy fucking shit, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - I was with D and he can dance his arse off. </joey>
<joey> And I heard the "Kaguya-sama" opening and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I have to pop." </joey>
<connor> - It was played? </connor>
<connor> I don't remember. - Yeah, it did. </connor>
<joey> (upbeat music) </joey>
<joey> ♪ Love is war ♪ </joey>
<connor> - I was at the bar, I think. </connor>
<joey> - Because like the dance floor was kind of weird </joey>
<joey> because there was either no one there or everyone was there. </joey>
<connor> There was no in between. </connor>
<joey> So it was during the time </joey>
<joey> where it was me, D and a couple of other people </joey>
<joey> and there's like a couple of tracks playing </joey>
<joey> and then the "Kaguya-sama" theme starts </joey>
<joey> and we're just like, "Well, we gotta dance to this." </joey>
<joey> We gotta pop off to this song. </joey>
<joey> And so I just start popping off 'cause I was stupidly drunk, </joey>
<joey> not realizing someone </joey>
<joey> is behind me filming this entire ordeal. </joey>
<joey> And so when I received the video, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Wow, I'm fucked right now. </joey>
<joey> "I'm so fucked." </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I never dance 'cause I can't dance for shit. </garnt>
<joey> I was dancing like my life was fucking depending on it. </joey>
<garnt> - And then you went again </garnt>
<garnt> when "Devilman No Uta" started playing. </garnt>
<joey> - And when "Devilman No Uta" started playing, </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "All right, all right, tie is coming off. </garnt>
<joey> "I'm popping off today." </joey>
<joey> (upbeat music) </joey>
<garnt> - Woo! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause I remember it went in waves </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause everyone went on the dance floor </garnt>
<garnt> and then everyone was like, "Let's get a drink." </garnt>
<garnt> And then everyone immediately went to the bar </garnt>
<garnt> and it just kept coming in waves. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember the time when everyone started to pop off </garnt>
<garnt> was when fucking "September" played. </garnt>
<garnt> (upbeat music) </garnt>
<garnt> And that's when the video </garnt>
<garnt> of me and Joey fucking hugging came about. </garnt>
<joey> But I remember before that, </joey>
<joey> I remember I gave Connor the hug as well </joey>
<joey> because it was fucking "September" and everyone was so hype. </joey>
<joey> And that was I think the hype song. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why it was "September". </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] It's a happy song. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a happy song. </garnt>
<connor> And also every time we used to go to karaoke together, </connor>
<connor> that song was always the most hype song </connor>
<joey> so that's what I thought it was. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> I think one of the best decisions I made with my wedding. </connor>
<connor> - Wedding planning advice. </connor>
<joey> - Here's some wedding advice, </joey>
<joey> if you are planning a future wedding or something. </joey>
<joey> So even though there was only 62 people at my wedding, </joey>
<joey> which is a fairly small wedding in my eyes. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Small wedding. </joey>
<joey> - Small little wedding. </joey>
<joey> Wedding FOMO is a fucking thing </joey>
<connor> because I wanted to be with everyone at all times. </connor>
<connor> I wanted to see what was fucking popping off, </connor>
<joey> what people were talking about. </joey>
<joey> I just wanted to see what's going on </joey>
<joey> because there's only one of me </joey>
<joey> and because there's only so many hours </joey>
<joey> in this one fucking day, </joey>
<connor> you can only be at one place at a time. </connor>
<connor> I had so many regrets </connor>
<connor> because we were also really, really fucking busy </connor>
<connor> with the photographers </connor>
<connor> getting our own wedding photos or something. </connor>
<connor> Probably my biggest regret of the wedding </connor>
<connor> is that I didn't see everyone's reaction to the postcards </connor>
<connor> and all the messages and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Should've all filmed your reactions </connor>
<connor> so I could react to it later. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause we were outside taking wedding photography </connor>
<connor> when you guys were in. </connor>
<joey> So one of the best decisions I made </joey>
<joey> is that we had a GoPro there. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause of course we did. </joey>
<joey> I learned from "Trash Taste." </joey>
<connor> I learned from "Trash Taste." </connor>
<joey> I went to everyone and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Film whatever you want. </joey>
<joey> "Just film, whatever you want." </joey>
<joey> And I've seen the footage. </joey>
<joey> It gives you such an on the ground experience </joey>
<joey> to what everyone was doing. </joey>
<joey> We had videographers there and so I'm very, very excited </joey>
<joey> to see what they captured on their end, </joey>
<joey> but I think it was a totally different view </joey>
<joey> when you just have people filming their own POVs on GoPros </joey>
<joey> 'cause you got to see like the progression. </joey>
<garnt> Everyone was so well spoken, </garnt>
<garnt> so happy at the beginning of the wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you go to the end footage and it was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Garnt, fucking cut, I'm so fucking happy for you." </joey>
<joey> And yeah, it was one </joey>
<joey> of the best decisions I think regarding my wedding </joey>
<joey> 'cause I got to see so much of my wedding </joey>
<joey> that I wouldn't have got to see </joey>
<joey> if I didn't have a GoPro there. </joey>
<joey> - You got a "Trash Taste" special outta that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, "Trash Taste" special. </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately you guys are never going to see that, </connor>
<connor> but it does exist on my hard drive. </connor>
<connor> - Hell yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But yeah, like I said, fantastic day. </joey>
<garnt> I know it's a cliche to say your wedding's the happiest day </garnt>
<garnt> of your life, but it was. </garnt>
<garnt> - Top three, top three. </garnt>
<joey> - No one's that jaded where they're like </joey>
<garnt> "Yeah, my wedding was alright." </garnt>
<garnt> Of course, live it up. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause before the wedding, I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Maybe it'll be the happiest day of my life." </joey>
<joey> I didn't really think about it too much, </joey>
<joey> but yeah, looking back, </joey>
<joey> it was genuinely the happiest day of my life so far. </joey>
<joey> And so I'm glad you guys got to share that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's the best thing </connor>
<connor> about having a wedding to me. </connor>
<connor> We had a lot of mates there </connor>
<joey> and it was just having your mates around </joey>
<joey> to experience the happiest moment of your life </joey>
<joey> is something that I cannot put into words. </joey>
<connor> It's so fucking special. - Yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<connor> And Joey wore trainers. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, we're gonna talk about that. </joey>
<joey> - Joey got the Vessis on. </joey>
<joey> - I do, so because the wedding was not done in London. </joey>
<joey> It was done just outside of London. </joey>
<joey> So we were in London for about a week. </joey>
<joey> I was hanging out with a bunch of people, whatnot. </joey>
<joey> And I had forgotten </joey>
<joey> 'cause originally I was supposed to get a suit </joey>
<joey> from the suit rental place that Garnt had organized, </joey>
<joey> but because right now in the UK and just, </joey>
<joey> I guess everywhere in the world, </joey>
<joey> it's wedding craze right now </joey>
<joey> because we're approaching the end of the pandemic, </joey>
<connor> they were all booked up. </connor>
<connor> So Garnt messaged me a few days </connor>
<connor> before I was about to fly out to UK being like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, so sorry, but I wasn't able to get your suit rental </connor>
<connor> "so you're gonna have to bring your own suit." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "okay, I only have a JoJo suit." </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's fine. </connor>
<connor> That's not a problem. </connor>
<connor> - Which was okay. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Whatever, I'll just get that dry cleaned, </connor>
<connor> "wear it, whatever." </connor>
<connor> But then when I got to London </connor>
<connor> and I was sorting out my luggage, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Shit, I forgot to bring my suit shoes." </connor>
<joey> And so in the back of my head, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, I'm in London for an entire week. </joey>
<joey> "I'll just pop over to a shoe store, </joey>
<joey> "buy some nice shoes." </joey>
<joey> I got a little bit ham in London. </joey>
<connor> I was drinking every day in London </connor>
<connor> because of course you do, </connor>
<connor> meeting up, catching up with a bunch of people. </connor>
<connor> So the morning of the wedding </connor>
<connor> as I was taking my suit out, </connor>
<connor> I realized I don't have suit shoes. </connor>
<garnt> And the only pair of shoes I had were a Vessis </garnt>
<garnt> that I was wearing. </garnt>
<garnt> So I rocked up to the wedding in full suit, </garnt>
<connor> tie pin, belt, everything and a pair of Vessis. </connor>
<connor> And everyone at the wedding was giving me shit. </connor>
<joey> They were literally doing the, </joey>
<joey> "What are those?" </joey>
<joey> Fully deserved mind you, </joey>
<joey> but you know what, at the end of the day I won </joey>
<joey> because when I got onto that dance floor, dude, </joey>
<joey> I was fully prepared. </joey>
<joey> I was fully prepared with my Vessis. </joey>
<joey> Everyone had taken their shoes off to dance. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Step aside, I got the footwear for it." </connor>
<joey> Don't do that. </joey>
<joey> Bring proper suit shoes. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] You had one job, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - I had one job to buy suit shoes and I did not fulfill it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's making a statement there, making a statement. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, I was making a statement. </joey>
<garnt> - But I guess wedding aside, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess it was a reasonable amount of time in the UK. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like you got to experience more </joey>
<garnt> of the UK this time as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely, I mean, last time I was in the UK, </joey>
<connor> which was the first time was we were staying mostly </connor>
<connor> at your place in Brighton. </connor>
<connor> So I think we were only in London for maybe two days. </connor>
<connor> And even then, it was mostly just going </connor>
<joey> to all of the touristy places and whatnot. </joey>
<joey> So I think, yeah, this time around, </joey>
<connor> not only did I get to have a proper view </connor>
<joey> of London, London, but also like Chris took me out of London </joey>
<joey> as well 'cause we went filming to a bunch of places </joey>
<joey> and I actually got to see the country side of London. </joey>
<garnt> I got to see Stonehenge. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, did you actually? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we went to Stonehenge. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really disappointing, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it looks way cooler from a distance. </garnt>
<connor> So to get to Stonehenge, </connor>
<connor> you have to go to this visitor center, </connor>
<connor> buy a ticket for some fucking reason </connor>
<connor> and then you can either take a bus, </connor>
<connor> which is five minutes to Stonehenge </connor>
<connor> or you can walk across the fields for 30 minutes. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "Well, it's kind of a nice day. </joey>
<joey> "Let's just walk across the fields </joey>
<garnt> "'cause it might be nice." </garnt>
<garnt> It was not nice because it was not only nothing </garnt>
<garnt> for 30 minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> but there was also just horse shit everywhere. </garnt>
<joey> So I'm fucking dodging this horse shit </joey>
<joey> because God forbid, </joey>
<joey> these are the only pair of fucking shoes I have as well. </joey>
<joey> - Your Vessis, man. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, I was wearing the Vessis. </joey>
<joey> - No wonder why I smell shit. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "No, I have to wear these in the wedding. </joey>
<joey> "I'm not having horse shit on these." </joey>
<joey> So we got to it and then I guess </joey>
<joey> because there was like an incident some years ago </joey>
<connor> of some drawing shit on the Stonehenge stones </connor>
<garnt> so they had actually fenced it off, </garnt>
<connor> but they had fenced it off not really an arms reach away, </connor>
<connor> but at least about a 100 meters away. </connor>
<connor> So the closest you could get </connor>
<connor> to Stonehenge was 100 meters away, </connor>
<connor> which was kind of defeating the purpose I guess </connor>
<connor> because apparently you used to be able </connor>
<connor> to actually walk into Stonehenge </connor>
<connor> and actually get like a view of it. </connor>
<connor> You can't do that anymore </connor>
<connor> because I guess some people just ruined it for everyone, </connor>
<connor> which was kind of underwhelming, I guess in a sense, </connor>
<connor> but I was like, "Well, Stonehenge is that one heritage site </connor>
<connor> "that you hear people talking about </connor>
<connor> "and it's a hot tourist place." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Just weird. </connor>
<connor> - So I was just like, "Well, you know what, </connor>
<joey> "at least now I can say that I've seen Stonehenge." </joey>
<joey> But was it fascinating necessarily? </joey>
<joey> Not really. </joey>
<connor> - I'd go to a Greggs any day over Stonehenge. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, we did afterwards. </joey>
<connor> We went to a Greggs afterwards, </connor>
<connor> but I think the most enjoyment I had </connor>
<connor> on that trip out of London was the fact </connor>
<connor> that I just actually got to see the real side of the UK, </connor>
<connor> the actual countryside. </connor>
<garnt> We went past all these really small, quaint little villages. </garnt>
<garnt> There were some villages that we drove past </garnt>
<garnt> that legitimately looked like RPGs. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like an RPG medieval town, which was so fucking cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's most of the UK. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, but I had never seen that before </connor>
<connor> 'cause my experience of the UK is London and Brighton, </connor>
<garnt> which is very much not like that. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was really cool to actually stop by </garnt>
<joey> in these really small, quaint villages to be like, </joey>
<joey> oh, we got like the full experience of the UK. </joey>
<garnt> One of the best fucking stories was we stopped by. </garnt>
<connor> I was dying for a piss. </connor>
<connor> And so I was like, "We have to stop by somewhere." </connor>
<connor> But we're in the middle of nowhere. </connor>
<connor> So we're like, oh, okay, </connor>
<garnt> I guess we'll just stop by the closest village to see </garnt>
<garnt> if there's an establishment we can borrow. </garnt>
<garnt> So we stopped by this village. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even remember the name of this village. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucking tiny. </garnt>
<connor> And we got to the entrance of the village </connor>
<connor> and there's this old dude standing there. </connor>
<connor> And he kind of flags us down like, "Hey." </connor>
<connor> And so Chris was like, "All right, what's what's happening?" </connor>
<joey> And we drive up to him and he is like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, what's, the problem." </joey>
<joey> And the guy goes, "Are you here to see the duck race?" </joey>
<joey> And we're like, "What?" </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "There's a duck race happening. </joey>
<joey> "So make sure </joey>
<joey> "to drive nice and slowly across this road, okay?" </joey>
<joey> And we're like, "A duck race?" </joey>
<joey> - A duck race. </joey>
<joey> - And sure enough, we drive maybe about 50 meters </joey>
<joey> and there's just this gathering </joey>
<joey> of about 10 to 20 old people just watching these ducks. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds awesome. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "This is the most British thing I've ever seen </connor>
<joey> "in fucking my life." </joey>
<connor> - What else are you gonna do with your free time? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah and I was like, "I wanna be there at that age." </joey>
<joey> I wanna just like wake up in the morning and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, the duck race is today." </joey>
<joey> And just go down some of my local pond </joey>
<joey> and just watch some ducks. </joey>
<joey> It was fucking awesome. </joey>
<garnt> - We went to a pub the day for the wedding </garnt>
<connor> and it was this very, very quaint local pub </connor>
<connor> in this very, very small town </connor>
<connor> because where the wedding took place, </connor>
<connor> it was in a town that you could walk </connor>
<joey> from one end to the other in about 30 minutes, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was fucking tiny. - It was fucking tiny. </joey>
<joey> So it was a local pub. </joey>
<joey> And I remember there was just this poster on the wall </joey>
<joey> that just said, </joey>
<connor> "This is the place </connor>
<garnt> "for the Worldwide Annual Pea Tossing Tournament," </garnt>
<connor> or something like that. - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was the Pea Flicking Tournament. </connor>
<garnt> - What? - Well, I think it's the way </garnt>
<connor> that the streets had kind of the way the natural landscape </connor>
<connor> was is that the idea was that you threw the pea </connor>
<connor> 'cause I Googled it. </connor>
<connor> I was curious. </connor>
<connor> You throw the pea. </connor>
<garnt> This is gonna tell them wherever your wedding was </garnt>
<garnt> by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> It's only in this place. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I already have one wedding. </garnt>
<garnt> - So the way that this kind of town </garnt>
<garnt> has really cool architecture. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a village at the top and then it kind of winds down </garnt>
<garnt> towards the bottom. </garnt>
<garnt> So the idea of this pea throwing thing, </garnt>
<garnt> apparently according to Google, </garnt>
<joey> is that the idea is that you throw it </joey>
<joey> and hopefully if you throw it well enough </joey>
<joey> or you're kind of lucky, </joey>
<joey> it'll kind of bounce around the walls </joey>
<joey> and kind of go all the way down. </joey>
<joey> People will follow it </joey>
<joey> and see the furthest it goes, </joey>
<connor> which I think that's pretty fucking fun. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds fucking fun. </garnt>
<joey> - It's also extremely British. </joey>
<joey> - That's really British, but that's fun. </joey>
<garnt> I like that. </garnt>

<joey> Back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> - So you met my parents for the first time. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that was fun. </connor>
<connor> - Connor came around to my house a few days </connor>
<connor> before the wedding. </connor>
<garnt> We had a nice meal together, and Connor met my parents </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time. </garnt>
<connor> - I got out of the car and I was wearing a hat </connor>
<garnt> and I met your dad. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, hi, hi." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Oh hi, hi." </connor>
<connor> And I go inside and then your mom sees me. </connor>
<connor> She said, "Oh my God, it's Connor." </connor>
<connor> She was like, "I watch you all the time." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, oh yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah." </connor>
<connor> She's just really sweet and she gave me a hug. </connor>
<connor> And she just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, I always watch you on the TV. </connor>
<connor> "It's so nice to see you here." </connor>
<connor> - It's so wholesome. </connor>
<connor> - It was really wholesome. </connor>
<garnt> And then she whipped up the best food I'd ever had. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just amazing. </garnt>
<connor> It was really good food. </connor>
<garnt> - But there was this one moment </garnt>
<garnt> where I can't remember if it was when she first met you </garnt>
<garnt> or when you were having food or something, </garnt>
<joey> but I remember she was talking to you </joey>
<joey> and then she's never really mentioned to me </joey>
<joey> about any of our content aside from what we've talked about </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I remember. </joey>
<joey> - So she's never mentioned this to me before, </joey>
<garnt> but I remember she turns to Connor and she's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You should have won the cycling special." </garnt>
<connor> - And I'm like, "What the fuck, mom?" </connor>
<connor> - Everyone knows that, </connor>
<garnt> everyone knows that. - What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "I got betrayed by my own fucking family." </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It was true. </connor>
<connor> I was so happy. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like she's never, </connor>
<connor> ever mentioned the cycling special to me before at all </connor>
<garnt> aside from, "Oh, it looks like a really beautiful </garnt>
<garnt> "place you guys went to." </garnt>
<connor> - Glad to know where your mom's loyalties lie. </connor>
<joey> - Your mom is literally the embodiment of the sovereign. </joey>
<connor> - Bro, I got fucking betrayed, man by my own blood. </connor>
<connor> - And then I think your dad then realized who I was </connor>
<connor> 'cause he'd said hi to me, but he didn't. </connor>
<connor> And then I think when your mom had said that, he was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, he's that guy." </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Oh, it's Connor, it's Connor, hi, hi." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Oh, okay, hi." </connor>
<garnt> It was really nice. </garnt>
<connor> It was very sweet. </connor>
<connor> - It was so cute. </connor>
<garnt> - How was your experience back in England? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was good. </connor>
<connor> You know how it. </connor>
<connor> It's like going back and just like, "Hey, I'm back </connor>
<garnt> "let's drink, let's do it." </garnt>
<joey> It was weird seeing somethings </joey>
<connor> had changed kind of a little bit. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, it was interesting this time </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was very full on this time. </connor>
<joey> Every single day, there was something happening, </joey>
<connor> but that was good. </connor>
<connor> I like that 'cause I kind of hate it </connor>
<connor> when I'm not doing anything and I'm like wandering around. </connor>
<garnt> What am I gonna do today? </garnt>
<garnt> What am I gonna eat? </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause what am I gonna eat is so important. </connor>
<garnt> - I was actually really much happier </garnt>
<connor> with the food that I had there. </connor>
<connor> - That was so fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I dunno if the food quality just improved </connor>
<connor> or we just went to better restaurants. </connor>
<garnt> I dunno, it felt like there were more food options </garnt>
<garnt> in my trip back to England this time. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, just got Borough Market in London, </connor>
<garnt> best fucking food in London I swear. </garnt>
<joey> Every restaurant there goes unequivocally hard. </joey>
<joey> It's so fucking good. </joey>
<joey> - I spent an afternoon in the Borough Market </joey>
<garnt> with a friend of mine from high school </garnt>
<garnt> and it was fucking awesome. </garnt>
<joey> So cool, dude, the cheese there, to die for. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's good shit, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> I did a livestream in London as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you did it during fucking Jubilee weekend as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - That looked like hell, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I was filming with Chris at West Minister Bridge </connor>
<garnt> and you couldn't move. </garnt>
<garnt> It was so busy 'cause everyone was waiting </garnt>
<joey> because the only thing that was happening that day </joey>
<joey> was the jets and stuff were flying over, </joey>
<joey> which was kind of cool. </joey>
<joey> The jets flew over in the formation of 70. </joey>
<connor> A stupid amount of jets. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Is this where our military power is?" </connor>
<connor> Okay, never mind. </connor>
<connor> And then they did the fucking red, white and blue, </connor>
<joey> not America, UK, all that fucking came over. </joey>
<joey> It was just crazy. </joey>
<joey> It was just so busy. </joey>
<connor> Could not get phone signal anywhere </connor>
<connor> because it was just so many people were there. </connor>
<connor> It was really cool. </connor>
<connor> I got a view through a shooting bridge </connor>
<connor> 'cause we were stopping to try and set up my IRL bag. </connor>
<connor> We could not get signal anywhere to start the stream </connor>
<joey> 'cause there was just so many people. </joey>
<joey> It was cool. </joey>
<joey> I was accidentally in the right place at the right time </joey>
<joey> to see this thing happen. </joey>
<joey> And so I finally managed </joey>
<connor> to find a spot three or four miles away </connor>
<connor> from where we originally were gonna start the stream, </connor>
<connor> where it was like, okay, the signal is kind of okay. </connor>
<connor> Let's just fucking start it. </connor>
<connor> And my laptop is in my hotel room connected to the internet </connor>
<joey> and I press go live and it's one megabyte. </joey>
<joey> And for Twitch, you need about six. </joey>
<joey> It can work on three to four, but it's sketch and I had one. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Fuck". </joey>
<joey> And we'd already started. </joey>
<joey> We'd already spent an hour prepping. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Fuck." </joey>
<joey> And you know that funny thing </joey>
<connor> when your PC is connected to wifi and internet, </connor>
<connor> for some reason it'll be like, sorry, </connor>
<connor> it was connect to wifi and ethernet. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes it's like choose the wifi. </connor>
<connor> I like the wifi. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of sick. </connor>
<connor> Wireless and it's like, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Use the fucking, why would you use the slower one </connor>
<connor> when you connected to the fast one? </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's some fucking engineer in the comments </connor>
<connor> who'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, actually it's because the wifi." </connor>
<connor> And I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't fucking care." </connor>
<connor> To me, it just doesn't make sense. </connor>
<joey> So I'm remote access with my fucking phone. </joey>
<joey> I'm like trying to zoom in, click the wifi thing, </joey>
<joey> turn off the wifi </joey>
<joey> and then suddenly it's all working perfectly. </joey>
<connor> We go live and we fuck around in London. </connor>
<connor> It was great. </connor>
<connor> It was really fun. </connor>
<connor> Chris was probably the happiest I've ever seen him </connor>
<connor> in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, Chris seemed like he was in his element. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, he was in cloud nine. </connor>
<garnt> He was like, "I'm so glad to be back. </garnt>
<connor> "I just wanna go to a pub. </connor>
<connor> "I wanna have fish and chips, mash pies. </connor>
<joey> "I don't fucking know." </joey>
<joey> - My man was like cleaning up English breakfast </joey>
<joey> like it was nothing. </joey>
<connor> - I think he was doing the English breakfast tour </connor>
<connor> of the UK. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna try it here. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna try it here. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna try it here. </connor>
<connor> Man was unstoppable. </connor>
<connor> It was great time though. </connor>
<garnt> - It was so interesting just seeing the dichotomy </garnt>
<garnt> of Chris doing an IRL stream </garnt>
<garnt> with you in Japan versus in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> In Japan, he's just like, "Don't talk too loud. </garnt>
<connor> "I don't wanna be a dickhead." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> I have to be the one who's like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, we're gonna do this. </connor>
<connor> "We're gonna do this." </connor>
<connor> And in, in the UK, Chris is like </connor>
<connor> "Let's fucking go here. </connor>
<connor> "Let's do this. </connor>
<connor> "Get outta the way poor people." </connor>
<connor> It was just so fun. </connor>
<garnt> It was great, it was great. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sad I didn't get to hang out with Chris before </garnt>
<connor> because I was stacked every day before the wedding. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, of course, obviously, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean you had so much shit to do. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you had to entourage the American family </garnt>
<connor> and show them around </connor>
<connor> and make sure they weren't in trouble. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, it was a very, </garnt>
<garnt> very interesting experience showing them around </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the first night they'd just flown in </garnt>
<joey> and so they didn't wanna go too far. </joey>
<joey> But we went to my local pub, </joey>
<joey> which is literally down the road. </joey>
<connor> So it's not in central, central Brighton. </connor>
<connor> We're on the outskirts of Brighton, whatever. </connor>
<connor> So it's not somewhere you see a lot of touristy people go </connor>
<connor> because Brighton's a pretty famous touristy place. </connor>
<connor> And I remember we go there and we sit down, </connor>
<connor> we're having a pint and obviously they're American </connor>
<connor> and they got the true British experience. </connor>
<garnt> It was a local pub and we had local people there </garnt>
<garnt> and some younger people recognized their accents. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - Were there like road men or something? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, road men. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'd never seen, there's always the image </garnt>
<garnt> of how Americans think British people speak. </garnt>
<connor> And for the first time, </connor>
<garnt> Sydney's family got the true British experience. </garnt>
<joey> They got true local Brits. </joey>
<joey> And I remember there was this one kid having a conversation </joey>
<joey> with Sydney's brother, </joey>
<joey> and of course, he was talking about his fucking rap career </joey>
<joey> that was going to take off in America </joey>
<joey> 'cause he had listeners from New York, </joey>
<joey> and he had a Spotify account. </joey>
<joey> And I could see Sydney's brother's face just, </joey>
<joey> "I know you are speaking English, </joey>
<garnt> "but I have no idea what the fuck you are saying." </garnt>
<garnt> It was literally like a scene now of "The Inbetweeners". </garnt>
<joey> - Meilyne's husband, Maki had the exact same experience </joey>
<connor> when I took him to a friend's house </connor>
<connor> 'cause my friends in London, </connor>
<joey> they're not originally from London, </joey>
<joey> they're from further up north, </joey>
<connor> so they have the more northerner accent. </connor>
<connor> And one of my friends Yusuf, </connor>
<garnt> he has a really strong Leeds accent, </garnt>
<garnt> which is hard even for me to understand sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was just fucking hilarious </garnt>
<garnt> every time Yusuf opened his mouth and just said something. </garnt>
<connor> Maki would just squint like this, </connor>
<connor> like he's really trying to concentrate. </connor>
<connor> - How do I turn the subtitles on? </connor>
<connor> - He's like, "This is definitely English I think, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know." </connor>
<joey> And every time Yusuf would stop talking, </joey>
<joey> I would turn to Maki in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, "Did you understand that?" </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "No." (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> And then he got really sad. </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "I thought I was good at English, </joey>
<joey> "but I guess I'm not." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Don't worry, don't worry, Maki. </joey>
<joey> "It's fine, even I have trouble with this English." </joey>
<connor> - That should be on the TOEIC exam. </connor>
<connor> It should be, "Can you understand a man from Leeds?" </connor>
<connor> If you can, you're fluent. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - You're good to go. </connor>
<garnt> - It's funny 'cause the more Northern you go, </garnt>
<joey> the harder time it gets for anyone outside of the UK </joey>
<joey> to understand what the fuck is being said </joey>
<joey> 'cause even for me as like of southerner, </joey>
<joey> I can barely understand </joey>
<connor> what's being said in Liverpool or something. </connor>
<garnt> - That's why it's OP being from the north. </garnt>
<garnt> You just understand everyone. </garnt>
<connor> It's great, I'm like, "Yeah, super chill. </connor>
<connor> "It's all good." </connor>
<connor> The only time I struggle </connor>
<connor> is I felt ashamed at this one point. </connor>
<joey> I think there's a clip of a really, really rural Irish pub. </joey>
<joey> And then they interviewed this guy- </joey>
<joey> - Is that the guy with the three teeth? </joey>
<joey> - I think so, and he just fucking says shit. </joey>
<connor> And even at that point, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I haven't even understood three words. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the guy from "Kalani" or something. </joey>
<connor> - It might be something like that, </connor>
<joey> that was the only time where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I don't even know </joey>
<connor> "if the other people in the pub understood him." </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I'm the weird one. </connor>
<joey> - But the interviewer understood him </joey>
<connor> because he's from that part of the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that's right. </joey>
<joey> - The guy would just be like, (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> And he'd be like, "Yes, I look this pub too." </joey>
<joey> And it's like, you're conversing with this guy? </joey>
<joey> - I wish I understood that. </joey>
<garnt> That was the only time I felt inadequate. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, </garnt>
<connor> "Fuck, I thought I understood everything, everything, fuck." </connor>
<connor> - I know the exact video you're talking about as well. </connor>
<joey> 'cause I felt disappointed as well. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like, "I'm sure I can understand this. </joey>
<joey> "I'm sure I can understand this." </joey>
<garnt> I don't know, you start playing it at 0,5 speed </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Maybe I can like gauge the syllables." </garnt>
<connor> - The closed captions just say, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck it, I don't know." </connor>
<connor> - I don't even think the closed caption can determine </connor>
<joey> if it's English or not. </joey>
<connor> - I wish it was a TV ad one </connor>
<joey> so they have to had that woman who does the sign language. </joey>
<joey> Just trying to do the sign and she's like, (exhales). </joey>
<joey> - She's just like. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno, I give up. </joey>
<connor> I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Do they have strong accent in Wales to the point where? </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe nothing you wouldn't be able to understand. </connor>
<connor> Just the very like, "Oh, I'm from this village. </connor>
<joey> "We talk like this." </joey>
<joey> - Is there differing geographical differences </joey>
<connor> in Wales like the UK </connor>
<joey> or is it kind of just stronger or weaker? </joey>
<connor> - Generally, the more north west you go. </connor>
<connor> I had to fucking do that thing with my hand. </connor>
<connor> It gets a little stronger. </connor>
<connor> The south has a different accent, </connor>
<connor> but it's not completely, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't say it's that different, </connor>
<connor> but they also have different words. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like the difference is not so much in the dialect, </connor>
<joey> well, not the dialect it's a different word, </joey>
<connor> but the accent isn't as different, just the words. </connor>
<connor> So the accent sounds very similar with both, </connor>
<connor> but you get the more traditional Welsh accent </connor>
<connor> that you might hear in movies and stuff from the South. </connor>
<connor> - So it's more of a dialect difference </connor>
<connor> than a pronunciation difference. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the dialect's pretty similar. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, so it's basically like Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck, I keep fucking up. </joey>
<joey> - So it's like Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I mean it's 'cause the fucking history </joey>
<joey> is so different between the north and the south </joey>
<connor> 'cause the south was conquered by England </connor>
<connor> for a really long time and the north wasn't. </connor>
<connor> So it's way more Welsh up north. </connor>
<connor> Just watch "Vinland Saga". </connor>
<connor> They lightly touch it a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - I'm jealous 'cause Australia doesn't have that at all. </joey>
<joey> And I always thought it was really cool. </joey>
<garnt> America and the UK, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, you can immediately tell where someone is from, </garnt>
<connor> but in Australia, we don't have that at all. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I really love the history of it, </connor>
<connor> but no one gives a fuck </connor>
<connor> so it's really boring to talk about it. </connor>
<joey> And I don't wanna talk about it </joey>
<connor> if people are fucking resident sleeping, they're like. </connor>
<connor> But "Vinland Saga" is pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's super hot. </joey>
<joey> I think it's super hot. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't really cover it. </joey>
<joey> It's cool that it at least touches upon it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It's a fucking mess. </connor>
<joey> It's really cool though. </joey>
<joey> - At least you got an anime around it. </joey>
<connor> - You got England, but at least we had Askeladd, </connor>
<garnt> that's all that matters. </garnt>
<connor> - You got one of the most bad ass characters </connor>
<joey> in all of anime, man. </joey>
<joey> - The most representation we got is fucking five minutes </joey>
<joey> in a "Hetalia" episode. </joey>
<connor> - You got "Ren" from "Free!". </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, he's Australian. </connor>
<connor> - Literally the worst character. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, he fucking tears it up in the water. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, when I did watch the "Free!" Movie </joey>
<joey> and I saw Sydney station, I was like, "Yo." </joey>
<connor> - Fuck yes, let's go. - Let's go! </connor>
<garnt> - I think the most representation I've had </garnt>
<garnt> is just one guy from "Yuri!!! On ICE", and that's it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What about the "K-On!" Movie? </garnt>
<garnt> That was set in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm talking about Thailand, Thailand. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh Thailand. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> We had a one Thai ice skater in "Yuri!!! On ICE" </joey>
<connor> And I remember there's a big anime chain </connor>
<connor> in Japan called like Animate. </connor>
<connor> So we have an Animate in Bangkok, </connor>
<joey> and there was just like this one cardboard cut out </joey>
<joey> of that one Thai ice skater from "Yuri!!! On ICE". </joey>
<garnt> And it was just like, "We did it boys, </garnt>
<connor> representation in anime, let's go!" </connor>
<garnt> - To be fair, </garnt>
<connor> he's kind of like one of the most badass animate characters </connor>
<connor> as well so that's pretty cool. </connor>
<connor> He's definitely up there </connor>
<joey> and not because he's warped, </joey>
<connor> that might have bumped him up a few spots. </connor>
<joey> - We just got racially profiled by "Hetalia" character </joey>
<joey> that wasn't even accurate. </joey>
<joey> And then he was in one episode and he never came back. </joey>
<connor> - At least you got "Hetalia". </connor>
<connor> Wales didn't even get one. </connor>
<joey> - Every other country got it </joey>
<joey> except Wales apparently. </joey>
<joey> - Wales didn't get it. </joey>
<joey> They were like, what are they fucking doing in Wales? </joey>
<joey> This is it. </joey>
<connor> Again, I've said this a billion times. </connor>
<joey> Wales has a branding problem. </joey>
<joey> The post in charge of Welsh branding, </joey>
<joey> I don't know who it is, prime minister, </joey>
<joey> I dunno, needs to fucking sort this out. </joey>
<joey> We need to have a game plan of how we're gonna brand more. </joey>
<joey> - What's there in Wales? </joey>
<joey> - See, that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> What am I gonna tell you? </joey>
<garnt> Oh, do you like history? </garnt>
<garnt> Great, well there's loads, </garnt>
<garnt> but if not, go and eat some fucking sheep. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you like lamb, it's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> We also have some pretty good baked stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> We have a lot of Welsh cakes, that's kinda good. </garnt>
<connor> Nature, nature's really good. </connor>
<connor> - I've been to like Ireland and I fucking love Ireland. </connor>
<garnt> It's one of the most aesthetic places </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever been to outside outside of Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Felix went to Wales, he loved it. </connor>
<connor> No, I think it was Abergavenny, </connor>
<connor> really cool looking place. </connor>
<joey> It was inspired by like Mediterranean things weirdly </joey>
<joey> in the west of Wales. </joey>
<joey> It's a really cool area. </joey>
<joey> - He sold me on Wales. </joey>
<joey> - There's a lot of really cool areas. </joey>
<joey> You can't just rock up. </joey>
<joey> If you just rock up without researching where to go, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be like where the fuck is everything? </joey>
<joey> - What is there to do? </joey>
<connor> - Where am I? </connor>
<connor> If you know what you're going for some amazing hiking spots, </connor>
<connor> really beautiful nature parks. </connor>
<connor> A lot of the north Brecon Beacons area </connor>
<connor> is all nature reserves. </connor>
<connor> Nothing's built there. </connor>
<connor> Just go hike, having a great time. </connor>
<garnt> - Brecon Beacons is really good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Snowdonia. </garnt>
<garnt> - Snowdonia. - Snowdonia. </garnt>
<connor> - That sounds like a place from "Game of Thrones". </connor>
<garnt> - That's like a "Pokemon". </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, Chris has been up there. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, that's good. </garnt>
<joey> There's a bunch of cool seaside stuff that you can go to, </joey>
<joey> but it depends. </joey>
<joey> You really have to research. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause when you hear about people visiting the UK, </garnt>
<joey> obviously there is England. - Ireland, Scotland. </joey>
<joey> - People are like, "Oh I fucking love going to Ireland." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause every fifth person here in America </joey>
<garnt> is apparently half Irish or some shit. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you also hear people talking about Scotland. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it really helps for the UK countries. </connor>
<joey> Okay, you have London and then you can branch out. </joey>
<joey> You have Scotland, then you can branch out. </joey>
<joey> You got Dublin, then you can branch out. </joey>
<connor> You have Cardiff, </connor>
<connor> even then, Cardiff is really far from all the nature stuff. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of weird in Wales </connor>
<connor> where if you wanna travel via public transport up north, </connor>
<connor> you have to go around and back up. </connor>
<joey> You can't just go through the middle. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause there's a lot of mountains or? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's a lot of mountains </joey>
<connor> and that didn't make sense to build the trains there </connor>
<connor> because it kind of connects through England </connor>
<connor> and then it goes back in just like Shrewsbury and stuff. </connor>
<connor> So if you go really far west and it is going on, off or on, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of really annoying to get back up. </connor>
<connor> So if you're going westward </connor>
<joey> you plan your whole trip to go west and then you go back. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of annoying to go back up. </joey>
<joey> You can if you wanna go to Aberystwyth. </joey>
<connor> No, Aberystwyth is down south. </connor>
<joey> What am I saying? </joey>
<joey> No, Aberdare, there's so many. </joey>
<joey> It's all weird. </joey>
<joey> It's a really cool place. </joey>
<joey> If you plan your trip, it'll be cool. </joey>
<garnt> - I still wanna go. </garnt>
<connor> - Again, there's some amazing stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - You gotta show us around </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I've never had a guide for Wales basically. </garnt>
<connor> - You have to bear in mind, </connor>
<connor> my experience with Wales was when I was young and a kid. </connor>
<connor> If you are like, "Oh, show me Wales." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Show you Wales" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but I'm gonna be like that for Australia. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess so. </joey>
<joey> - My view of Sydney is gonna be very different </joey>
<joey> to the average tourism. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think 'cause all my tourism was done </connor>
<joey> in the confines of school trips and stuff. </joey>
<connor> So it's very warped. </connor>
<connor> What I actually would think would be fun. </connor>
<connor> My parents know though. </connor>
<connor> My parents love doing it. </connor>
<garnt> They're doing this thing </garnt>
<garnt> where they go all around Wales by walking, </garnt>
<connor> not in one go, it's in trips. </connor>
<connor> So they do a section and they go back, </connor>
<joey> and then they do another section and they go back. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's cool. - That's fucking insane, man. </joey>
<joey> - My parents love walking and exercising. </joey>
<connor> I wish that rubbed off on me. </connor>
<joey> I've got the bare minimum of wanting to walk and stuff. </joey>
<connor> But yeah, if you're interested in really convoluted </connor>
<joey> and complex history, yeah, you might wanna look into it. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of cool. </joey>
<joey> It's just about people trying to not be taken over </joey>
<garnt> by the English for 400 years </garnt>
<connor> and then they fail. </connor>
<garnt> - It's more history than what we've got, dude. </garnt>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<garnt> - It's pretty much every country in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> - I think they did a pretty good job. </connor>
<garnt> Look at the rest of them. </garnt>
<garnt> They didn't last very long against England. </garnt>
<garnt> I think we did pretty good. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, we had a pretty good run. </connor>
<garnt> It was a pretty good run. </garnt>
<joey> But I mean it's cool. </joey>
<joey> There's some pretty funny history moments. </joey>
<joey> I've told that story before </joey>
<joey> about the castle that got took over. </joey>
<joey> I fucking love that story. </joey>
<connor> It's so fucking funny. </connor>
<joey> - I wish we had fun stories like that. </joey>
<garnt> We didn't have any of that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> A bunch of convicts were just like, "Fuck you, UK." </garnt>
<garnt> And then we just started our own country and yeah, </garnt>
<joey> just a whole lot of racism and politics happen. </joey>
<garnt> - When Sydney's family were visiting, </garnt>
<joey> you take for granted just how much history the UK has </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was showing them, </joey>
<connor> even them just seeing buildings, </connor>
<connor> pubs that were just really odd, </connor>
<garnt> that was fascinating for them. </garnt>
<connor> - Many churches in the UK </connor>
<connor> have been around since over 1,400 years. </connor>
<joey> There's been a lot of churches </joey>
<joey> that were still built in 800. </joey>
<connor> This is just insane that they're still there. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] It's crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - We take for granted just having a country </garnt>
<garnt> with history in it, </garnt>
<connor> whereas I think if you're over 25 or something in America, </connor>
<connor> then you've been alive for a 10th </connor>
<connor> of the entire country's history. </connor>
<connor> Your entire country's age </connor>
<connor> and that just fucking blows my mind </connor>
<garnt> that there's a country that is that young. </garnt>
<connor> - But then you run into the issue of okay, </connor>
<connor> I wanna learn about UK history, where do I start? </connor>
<connor> And then you go with the highlights, </connor>
<connor> but then when you start digging into stuff, you're like, </connor>
<connor> this is really fucking convoluted. </connor>
<connor> So they took over, and then another guy took over </connor>
<connor> and then another guy took over, </connor>
<joey> and then England's got taken over by Vikings, </joey>
<joey> and then now it's the French. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's convoluted, but it's super fucking fascinating </joey>
<joey> if you're into that shit. </joey>
<joey> - That's what makes it even cooler </joey>
<connor> that some of these churches </connor>
<connor> and stuff have lasted being taken over 10 different times. </connor>
<connor> It's like, how the fuck did this happen? </connor>
<connor> - It's the exact same thing with Japanese history as well </connor>
<connor> and that's what makes it </connor>
<connor> so fascinating for history fanatics. </connor>
<connor> Australia's not even 250 years old. </connor>
<connor> We fucking founded 1777, I think 78. </connor>
<connor> The UK had already figured this shit out by then. </connor>
<joey> We were just like, "Oh, what the fuck do we do?" </joey>
<connor> - A lot of countries that we know today </connor>
<connor> and we're super used to are very new. </connor>
<joey> - I think Finland is only like a 100 years old. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and Germany. </joey>
<joey> To think that Germany </joey>
<connor> was a completely different fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> That's so weird. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we've been alive our whole life. </connor>
<connor> I mean, our whole life is like an Angela Merkel. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird when you're like, </connor>
<connor> these countries weren't a thing. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think Germany wanna talk about their history. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they don't want to. </joey>
<connor> Actually, they do talk about it a lot. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Be ashamed." </connor>
<connor> I don't know how we got onto countries or whatever the fuck, </connor>
<connor> but I mean, I love talking about history and countries. </connor>
<connor> I'm fucking obsessed with history. </connor>
<connor> I love it so much, but there's just too much to learn. </connor>
<garnt> - There's just too much. </garnt>
<connor> - I gotta pick an era. </connor>
<connor> I get so jealous when I meet people who are like, dude, </connor>
<connor> "I fucking love the Byzantine era." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Fuck, dude, that's just like (indistinct)." </connor>
<joey> - I heard of that from "Age of Empires". </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I'm a history buff, </joey>
<connor> but then someone talks to me about like ancient Rome </connor>
<connor> and Egypt and I'm like, "Fuck, I wish </connor>
<connor> "that was the stuff I was really interested in." </connor>
<connor> I just love the past 1000 years history, </connor>
<connor> even then, that's pushing it. </connor>
<connor> - I'm the opposite. </connor>
<garnt> I love like the ancient stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - Then you feel like is your history more better? </connor>
<connor> Is your history more better? </connor>
<joey> - More better? - Is it more significant? </joey>
<joey> It's like the Romans. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, "Okay dude, that's kind of fucking sick." </connor>
<connor> - You can't go up against that. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's been this episode of "Trash Taste" I guess. </connor>
<connor> - Look at all these people. - Welcome to the America ark. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, America ark. - Let's go! </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's welcome all the patrons as per usual, </garnt>
<garnt> Welcome to America guys. - Yeah, welcome to America. </garnt>
<joey> - How many of them are Americans? </joey>
<joey> - So the UK ark didn't actually last that long. </joey>
<joey> We filmed three episodes, </joey>
<garnt> but literally, we went to the UK for a wedding </garnt>
<garnt> and we somehow got three episodes out of that, </garnt>
<garnt> which is pretty impressive. </garnt>
<connor> - It's probably gonna be eight plus for this. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we're gonna have a lot more for the America ark. </garnt>
<joey> - You're gonna see this set for a while </joey>
<garnt> so get used to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we're gonna have a lot of guests as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Very exciting guests coming soon. </joey>
<joey> - So yeah, look forward to that. </joey>
<joey> Unfortunately, if you are one of the viewers </joey>
<connor> that like hearing us shoot shit, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna go back to that, don't worry. </connor>
<connor> - We'll figure it out. - Don't worry, I mean, </connor>
<connor> you just heard us shoot shit now, </connor>
<connor> but we have a rare opportunity </connor>
<connor> where we can get a lot of guests </connor>
<joey> in a very, very short amount of time </joey>
<joey> and we wanted to take advantage of that </joey>
<joey> rather than just waiting </joey>
<joey> for people to come to fucking Japan, </joey>
<joey> which we've been waiting for two years. </joey>
<joey> - God knows when that's gonna happen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>

<garnt> - I'm sure by the end of this, </garnt>
<connor> we're gonna have so many America stories, so many. </connor>
<connor> - Look forward to those, all right, bye. </connor>
<garnt> - Bye. - Bye. </garnt>
<connor> (mid tempo music) </connor>
