<garnt> about to like run up those steps right </garnt>
<connor> now </connor>
<connor> it's a very sports-like jumper you see </connor>
<connor> it does look like a like the </connor>
<joey> stereotypical I'm about I walked in the </joey>
<joey> office and mailing called me a fuckboy </joey>
<joey> yeah we all did yeah we all did for the </joey>
<joey> charity stream that we just finished </joey>
<connor> he's gonna be like oh my God this </connor>
<connor> episode's so they recorded this so long </connor>
<joey> ago yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> really really dating ourselves yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> just recorded the charity stream yeah </garnt>
<joey> which was for you guys was like a month </joey>
<joey> ago yeah for us it was two days ago it </joey>
<joey> was a month and a half ago yeah oh more </joey>
<garnt> than that yeah yeah we're trying to </garnt>
<garnt> we're trying to get ahead before we fly </garnt>
<joey> off once again but uh yeah if you guys </joey>
<joey> didn't know about it we just finished a </joey>
<joey> 24-hour charity stream for Doctors </joey>
<joey> Without Borders and it was extremely </joey>
<connor> successful yeah I was very surprised we </connor>
<garnt> raised uh 176 but we haven't added the </garnt>
<connor> amounts of 180 I think about 180 adding </connor>
<garnt> everything that we collected in total </garnt>
<joey> that's nuts uh which is absolutely </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] nuts I'd like I don't know what </garnt>
<garnt> we expected out of this charity stream </garnt>
<joey> no I was I was there was a part of me </joey>
<joey> when we were deciding okay what are we </joey>
<joey> going to make our goal and someone was </joey>
<joey> like 100 000. I was like </joey>
<garnt> in 24 that's a lot of money yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like maybe if we were like doing a </garnt>
<joey> week-long subathon yeah or something </joey>
<joey> like that because I don't know I I only </joey>
<garnt> did one charity stream once like years </garnt>
<garnt> and years ago with Archie and like we </garnt>
<garnt> did not raise nearly that much money so </garnt>
<garnt> I think in the back of my head I had </garnt>
<garnt> that as my Benchmark yeah so when I </garnt>
<garnt> heard a hundred thousand I was like dude </garnt>
<joey> we're not [ __ ] PewDiePie or </joey>
<garnt> jacksepticeye we're not right we're not </garnt>
<joey> going to hit those numbers right turns </joey>
<joey> out we kind of did because we were we </joey>
<joey> were like number one on Twitch for like </joey>
<garnt> that night yeah yeah nuts I think we </garnt>
<garnt> peaked uh 53 000 viewers which is insane </garnt>
<connor> yeah personal best that's definitely the </connor>
<joey> most I've I've been oh this is </joey>
<joey> definitely the most I've had yeah </joey>
<joey> definitely by far well I'm not even the </joey>
<joey> streamer so that's so that's definitely </joey>
<joey> the most so I've been a part of it's </joey>
<garnt> just ridiculous but uh how was the </garnt>
<joey> experience for you boys uh how oh you </joey>
<joey> know what even though I went into it </joey>
<garnt> with like zero sleep it was probably the </garnt>
<joey> most fun stream I've ever played yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah I would absolutely do that again </garnt>
<garnt> part of me is just like I would </garnt>
<joey> absolutely do that again not anytime </joey>
<garnt> soon yeah part of me is just like man I </garnt>
<garnt> remember those last six hours that was </garnt>
<connor> yeah I'll do it again once I forget </connor>
<connor> about how hard the last year yeah this </connor>
<joey> is fine I mean at least you at least I </joey>
<joey> had you guys and like Chris and like </joey>
<joey> Mouse there because like if I had done </joey>
<joey> it by myself I would not have lasted </joey>
<garnt> like 10 hours no like I I was I remember </garnt>
<garnt> the last two three hours I was just </garnt>
<joey> running on complete autopilot you know </joey>
<joey> when you're just using like the part of </joey>
<garnt> your brain that isn't even thinking it's </garnt>
<garnt> just like habits you've built up that </garnt>
<joey> was just me I was just like I saw bits </joey>
<joey> and pieces of the VOD where it's just </joey>
<joey> like you alone on the couch you're just </joey>
<joey> like thank you for the 20 donation </joey>
<garnt> it kind of got to a point where I was </garnt>
<garnt> just like questioning my own Insanity </garnt>
<connor> like like because it was just sanity </connor>
<garnt> sanity Yeah question my understanding </garnt>
<garnt> questioning my own sanity my favorite </garnt>
<joey> clip though is where you where you guys </joey>
<joey> were YouTube the couch and you just </joey>
<joey> started going well it's oh boy </joey>
<joey> and they got in the most unenthusiastic </joey>
<joey> way guys get hyped guys it's like the </joey>
<joey> most not hype Get Hype guys I've ever </joey>
<joey> heard it just it just had such like </joey>
<joey> house party Vibes and just like when you </joey>
<garnt> stay up too late and that there's one </garnt>
<connor> that one guy that just wouldn't leave </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah that was that was like that </joey>
<garnt> was exactly what it felt like when I'm </garnt>
<joey> just like I I need to go to bed gone is </joey>
<connor> that one guy who doesn't know that yeah </connor>
<joey> you are gone you are like at every </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like all night karaoke God is </joey>
<garnt> the last guy I mean I mean I was last </garnt>
<garnt> guy on the stream as well I'm just like </garnt>
<joey> you got you boys uh I mean not this </joey>
<joey> wasn't a competition obviously obviously </joey>
<garnt> but I I was the only one to stay awake </garnt>
<joey> right right if it was Connor that was in </joey>
<garnt> your position he would have been like </garnt>
<garnt> weak you're all weak I won that </garnt>
<garnt> conversation it was me I carried I think </garnt>
<garnt> I think because uh because I knew you </garnt>
<joey> guys were there and I was like so I can </joey>
<garnt> sleep and I was like yeah I will yeah </garnt>
<joey> but I think if it was just me alone I </joey>
<joey> would have had to I mean </joey>
<garnt> yeah I mean I mean like the reason I </garnt>
<garnt> didn't sleep was because I knew as soon </garnt>
<garnt> as I closed my eyes they were not like </garnt>
<garnt> going I could not go to sleep and come </garnt>
<garnt> back up to like stream again </garnt>
<joey> I just I just looked horrible like I I </joey>
<joey> remember the last 30 minutes when I came </joey>
<joey> back I looked half dead yeah I was like </joey>
<joey> oh good oh God I think I used all my </joey>
<connor> energy holding in the laughs </connor>
<connor> so much energy not saying anything </connor>
<connor> during like the try not to laugh </connor>
<connor> segments yeah uh that took a lot more </connor>
<garnt> energy than I thought it did it actually </garnt>
<garnt> took more energy than uh doing the quiz </garnt>
<garnt> talking or just like hanging out also </garnt>
<joey> not to mention that I think we like </joey>
<joey> greatly overestimated how much energy we </joey>
<joey> were going to have because uh we had </joey>
<joey> like a schedule like a preemptive </joey>
<joey> schedule that staff made and we probably </joey>
<joey> did maybe 40 of what was seriously </joey>
<garnt> scheduled yeah I mean it was it was it </garnt>
<garnt> was it was a few things because </garnt>
<joey> obviously Chris was scheduled for two </joey>
<joey> hours yeah stayed for six hours which </joey>
<joey> I'm not I'm not complaining I'm not </joey>
<joey> complaining he was obviously having fun </joey>
<joey> yeah uh but then we also had like a </joey>
<garnt> bunch of spring a bunch of things that </garnt>
<garnt> we were meant to be doing with iron </garnt>
<connor> Mouse but by the time Chris left and </connor>
<connor> mouse came on it was just we were so out </connor>
<joey> of energy that was like we can only </joey>
<garnt> manage talking right now yeah definitely </garnt>
<garnt> how uh how did you guys manage to </garnt>
<joey> recover afterwards where did you recover </joey>
<joey> easily I mean recover is a strong word I </joey>
<joey> I went home and like weirdly enough I </joey>
<joey> think because I was kind of like </joey>
<garnt> reliving the moment when I was on the </garnt>
<garnt> train ride home so by the time I got </garnt>
<garnt> home I was like wide awake for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason and then I I was doing a little </garnt>
<joey> bit of work and then my body was just </joey>
<joey> like I don't think so and I just [ __ ] I </joey>
<garnt> literally passed out on my desk oh my </garnt>
<garnt> God for like an hour yeah </garnt>
<joey> for like 14 hours I think oh my God and </joey>
<joey> then I just completely [ __ ] my sleep </joey>
<garnt> schedule for the next day yeah I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know like like my body's so weird after </garnt>
<garnt> an all-nighter I hate it I absolutely </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] hate him because like </garnt>
<garnt> um during the stream I'm like I'm gonna </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to pass out as as it's well </garnt>
<garnt> documented that uh how close we were to </garnt>
<joey> passing out yeah and uh so I remember uh </joey>
<joey> with the stream finishes I do not even </joey>
<joey> remember saying like goodbye to anyone </joey>
<joey> in the office even though I know we were </joey>
<joey> just like eh congratulations and they </joey>
<joey> were like see you on see you on Tuesday </joey>
<joey> see you in like two days or whatever I I </joey>
<garnt> think I said see you on Tuesday but I </garnt>
<garnt> think I just left as well I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if it seemed like I was rude or </garnt>
<joey> something I just I need to go to myself </joey>
<joey> rude girl yeah and remember like I </joey>
<joey> remember like going to my bed being like </joey>
<joey> finally I've stayed up all night for </joey>
<joey> this didn't nap didn't sleep I'm going </joey>
<joey> to finally go to sleep go on my bed my </joey>
<joey> body's just like nope you don't you </joey>
<joey> don't sleep now you stay you stay awake </joey>
<joey> you don't you don't need sleep it is </joey>
<joey> sunshine how long did you stay awake so </joey>
<joey> I stay I stay up for like a next for </joey>
<connor> like it took me three hours to get to a </connor>
<connor> point where I could sleep and then I </connor>
<connor> slept for 3 P.M 4 P.M yeah I slept for </connor>
<garnt> two hours </garnt>
<connor> so I was just my day was like just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] when did you go to bed bed then </connor>

<connor> Connor stream jumping I was just like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] how are these boys like awaken </garnt>
<connor> streaming right now I'm like fighting </connor>
<connor> for my life on Sunday I went home and </connor>
<connor> then I had like three hours sleep and </connor>
<joey> then I went out for some drinks and no </joey>
<joey> meal how the [ __ ] I was like fine how </joey>
<joey> how I got tired at around 10 p.m so I </joey>
<connor> went home and uh then I slept woke up </connor>
<garnt> early and played jumping but I finished </garnt>
<garnt> it you finished it yeah right you both </garnt>
<connor> finished it I finally finished baby the </connor>
<connor> Ascension yeah it's just like the worst </connor>
<connor> thing ever I don't ever want to do it </connor>
<joey> ever again finally finished the base </joey>
<connor> game that was uh yeah when are you gonna </connor>
<connor> do the DLC Jerry you know you know what </connor>
<garnt> sucks like at the end of that stream I </garnt>
<garnt> was like you can't pay me to play the </garnt>
<garnt> DLC I want my happiness back in my life </garnt>
<garnt> but then the moment I turned off the </garnt>
<joey> stream I was like </joey>
<connor> I want to keep playing yeah because </connor>
<connor> you're like you're like but there's more </connor>
<joey> yeah because because it was it was the </joey>
<garnt> fact that there was so much </garnt>
<garnt> encouragement online when I posted my </garnt>
<garnt> time and people were like dude you're </garnt>
<joey> actually cracked and I was like </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay give me a little more praise the </garnt>
<garnt> game almost as a way of humbling you </garnt>
<garnt> because I thought the same thing when I </garnt>
<garnt> did like the third DLC also I'm correct </garnt>
<garnt> you know I'll be able to do this new one </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah I was like I was actually like </garnt>
<joey> worried I was like What if I like beat </joey>
<joey> this DLC too fast too fast and it's like </joey>
<joey> not a good stream yeah yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> then like the first eight hours of </joey>
<joey> playing it I was like oh no oh no this </joey>
<connor> is hot this is really hard and took me </connor>
<garnt> 48 hours to beat the DLC the fan made </garnt>
<garnt> DLC but now I know what it feels like to </garnt>
<connor> be an alpha gamer yeah and now I can </connor>
<connor> finally say hey God when are you finish </connor>
<garnt> I will I'll do it I [ __ ] feel like </garnt>
<garnt> you know [ __ ] that scene in [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> my hero Academia where like oh my it's </joey>
<joey> just pointing at you so it's your turn </joey>
<joey> I'm just here watching on TV I'm not </joey>
<joey> even like involved and here you are </joey>
<joey> pointing at me be like it's your turn </joey>
<joey> you've done half of it so you have to do </joey>
<joey> the other half it's a half of it is it </joey>
<joey> half of it no God got to maybe like 40 </joey>
<garnt> yeah where did you get to I can't </garnt>
<joey> remember it's got to the [ __ ] uh </joey>
<joey> after the no he got not even there like </joey>
<joey> before that the the town in the sky </joey>
<joey> bargainville that's it I mean I will </joey>
<garnt> finish it just because I I knew it's </garnt>
<joey> like one thing when I started it and I </joey>
<joey> was just like it's I I have the same </joey>
<joey> inkling feeling in me where I just </joey>
<connor> doesn't it doesn't feel comfortable </connor>
<connor> until I'm finish it take your time yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's been a few weeks since you </connor>
<connor> last we're gonna get rusty you'll stop </connor>
<garnt> for zero again I'll be fine I'll be fine </garnt>
<garnt> it'll be uh I I will be like pure muscle </garnt>
<connor> yeah it'd be like you never left it's </connor>
<joey> gonna be like dementia the game every </joey>
<connor> time he goes back to he's like oh I </connor>
<garnt> gotta learn this actually it'll be like </garnt>
<garnt> 30 like my playthrough would be like 50 </garnt>
<joey> hours or something look if if anything </joey>
<garnt> you now have someone else to compare </garnt>
<garnt> yourself to and that's mailing because </garnt>
<garnt> she also started it as well and uh that </garnt>
<joey> stream last night was hilarious started </joey>
<garnt> it as well yeah started it Jesus Christ </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's like a virus but don't worry </joey>
<joey> if you if you thought look like mailing </joey>
<joey> just got to the bottom of the sewers and </joey>
<joey> it took her like a couple of hours to </joey>
<connor> get there so I just think it's like the </connor>
<garnt> one of the best games to stream it's </garnt>
<garnt> just so it's so intuitive there's no </garnt>
<garnt> explanation needed yeah you know like </garnt>
<garnt> some games there's like power-ups level </garnt>
<garnt> UPS you know and then there's like oh </garnt>
<joey> you can unlock this thing and then </joey>
<joey> everyone say oh what's going on but </joey>
<garnt> jumping is literally just you can see </garnt>
<garnt> one mechanic you jump one box you </garnt>
<garnt> understand immediately for from washing </garnt>
<connor> that they're trying to go up and when </connor>
<connor> they fall you're like oh I get it this </connor>
<joey> is fun to watch it's also just a pretty </joey>
<joey> game it's good it's a really pretty game </joey>
<garnt> it's good yeah I love the aesthetic you </garnt>
<joey> know I I will say you know I thought </joey>
<joey> you're bullshitting when you said oh you </joey>
<joey> know it's a fun game it's a fun game but </joey>
<garnt> no it is I I do actually genuinely think </garnt>
<garnt> it's a fun game there's a high that you </garnt>
<garnt> get when you reach like your new </garnt>
<garnt> personal business yeah you know what I </garnt>
<joey> mean you're like damn you're like this </joey>
<joey> is a good feeling and then that lasts </joey>
<joey> for like three seconds before you like </joey>
<joey> fall for the first time </joey>
<connor> I know we spoke on jumping so much on </connor>
<joey> this podcast now it's just like taking </joey>
<joey> over my life but uh on the first map </joey>
<joey> there's like a very solid checkpoint </joey>
<joey> when you get to that you feel like I can </joey>
<joey> do this the 70 one right yeah yeah when </joey>
<connor> you get to the the church the church </connor>
<joey> yeah and then you're like oh my God I </joey>
<joey> can do this yeah that's when it feels </joey>
<joey> good that's when I was like all right I </joey>
<joey> got this you got this King yeah yeah you </joey>
<joey> can do it then if you can get that you </joey>
<joey> can do it easily so uh DLC for me is a </joey>
<joey> is a hard maybe then you should do it I </joey>
<joey> think I think I want to like maybe put </joey>
<joey> in a couple of like other games that </joey>
<joey> I've been wanting to play Maybe </joey>
<joey> firmly planted on the fence like what </joey>
<connor> was your was your viewership higher than </connor>
<connor> normal when you were doing jumping oh </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah for sure for sure but you know </joey>
<connor> it's like what do I what do I prioritize </connor>
<connor> a clout or happiness it's a hard choice </connor>
<joey> I'm just waiting for when the Kobe game </joey>
<connor> comes out dude that's when that's what </connor>
<connor> real happened I play games now like when </connor>
<connor> I'm playing like when I play Pokemon </connor>
<joey> artists I'm like there's just not enough </joey>
<joey> challenge even though there was there </joey>
<joey> literally was like there definitely was </joey>
<joey> but the thing was is that I never once </joey>
<joey> thought for a moment I wasn't gonna be </joey>
<connor> able to do it whereas jumping has that </connor>
<connor> thing where it's like I don't know if </connor>
<connor> you can do it man wait but you did the </connor>
<joey> you did that last fight yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah and you struggled a lot with </connor>
<connor> it I did but like at no point did I ever </connor>
<joey> feel like this is too hard real yeah </joey>
<joey> because like to me like that was easily </joey>
<joey> the hardest in-game Pokemon fight it is </joey>
<connor> it is it is even then I I like there's </connor>
<garnt> no point by doing it where I'm like I </garnt>
<joey> don't know if I can do this yeah I don't </joey>
<connor> think like I just felt like I just got </connor>
<joey> to grind a little bit more oh man Arceus </joey>
<joey> was hot as [ __ ] okay yeah I want to see </joey>
<connor> you where's like new bay plus when I was </connor>
<garnt> playing that game with jump Kings the </garnt>
<garnt> second map yeah there was like I I did </garnt>
<garnt> it over three streams so one on stream </garnt>
<garnt> second stream third stream the the </garnt>
<garnt> second stream after it and I went to bed </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I had like anxiety I was like What </garnt>
<garnt> if I just like can't do it what if I </garnt>
<joey> can't do it yeah like I'm never gonna be </joey>
<joey> able to forget this if I can't do it and </joey>
<connor> then I woke up the next day just </connor>
<joey> Bostitch destroyed it right right damn I </joey>
<joey> think you have an addiction I do yeah </joey>
<connor> there's definitely an addiction because </connor>
<joey> you know there's been like uh I've kind </joey>
<garnt> of got out of like um multiplayer games </garnt>
<garnt> that was kind of where I got the kick </garnt>
<garnt> from yeah beating other people but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you know there's a hard ceiling in </garnt>
<joey> multiplayer games where you're like if I </joey>
<joey> want to be able to improve at this game </joey>
<connor> I have to put an absurd amount of hours </connor>
<joey> in right yeah consistently yeah wait but </joey>
<joey> is is 45 hours in one John King man </joey>
<joey> you can finish you could finish 13 cents </joey>
<garnt> think about it an FPS first person </garnt>
<garnt> shooter multiplayer game whatever yeah </garnt>
<garnt> 45 hours is nothing that's true that's </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely nothing you're competing </garnt>
<connor> against people who do 45 hours a week </connor>
<garnt> yeah how many hours have you put it into </garnt>
<connor> all of jumping right now uh 100 </connor>
<garnt> something that's that's quite a lot yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's the Persona yeah </connor>
<garnt> Apex I have like over a thousand </garnt>
<garnt> probably yeah that's true like it's and </garnt>
<garnt> even then like I'm I'm just like uh I </garnt>
<connor> got to master once and that was that was </connor>
<connor> like that was me going insane grind well </connor>
<garnt> why don't you get into more like </garnt>
<garnt> challenging games then because you you </garnt>
<connor> said you don't really play like the </connor>
<connor> souls types games or like I'm gonna I'm </connor>
<connor> gonna do Elgin but like I feel like </connor>
<connor> that's it's a different type of </connor>
<joey> challenge because with jumping it's just </joey>
<garnt> like one mechanic that you have to like </garnt>
<joey> Milestone and master whereas with </joey>
<garnt> something like Elden ring or seafood </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a lot of things going on at </garnt>
<garnt> once yeah you know there's a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> different approaches a lot of ways to </garnt>
<connor> master the game yeah yeah I just like </connor>
<joey> jumping because there's no like there's </joey>
<joey> no [ __ ] there's like if you [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> up absolutely yeah nothing there's no </joey>
<joey> other facts single Factor yeah because </joey>
<joey> with games like dark souls or like </joey>
<joey> seafood yeah it's like it's like you can </joey>
<connor> blame it on like the enemy like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> that one frame hit me with it yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah like I know I'll make up this </connor>
<connor> but a jumping there's no enemies to get </connor>
<garnt> in your way it's just it's just you </garnt>
<garnt> you're in the way of yourself you are </garnt>
<garnt> your own enemy yeah yeah exactly almost </garnt>
<joey> like [ __ ] no don't trust anyone not </joey>
<joey> even yourself </joey>
<connor> like the hdlc gets more brutal though </connor>
<connor> like on you know first jumping you can </connor>
<joey> only fold like two screens Max that's </joey>
<joey> what I'm dreading man and I fell like </joey>
<connor> 20. what if I like actually start raging </connor>
<joey> I do </joey>
<joey> but I don't want that though I don't </joey>
<connor> want to get angry not like an actual </connor>
<connor> angry though like a like an angry video </connor>
<connor> game Angry you know what I mean it's a </connor>
<connor> different kind of anger I don't know how </connor>
<connor> to explain it it's an angle where you're </connor>
<connor> like you shout but it it doesn't </connor>
<connor> actually like actually get you upset </connor>
<connor> right it's kind of like ah all right </connor>
<joey> back to it </joey>
<joey> this is it's just a slight frustration a </joey>
<garnt> slight annoyance oh no it's stubbing </garnt>
<garnt> your toe well there's there's there's </garnt>
<joey> different kinds of video games I I don't </joey>
<garnt> know what that analogy is yeah but I I </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not angry when I start myself like </garnt>
<garnt> not like a 13 year old on Xbox Live </garnt>
<garnt> anger where I just test out all the new </garnt>
<garnt> bad words I've learned right yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> you know like a just a mild frustration </garnt>
<connor> like when the website when you fill out </connor>
<connor> the whole form and then it reloads for </connor>
<connor> some reason you're like oh yeah yeah and </connor>
<garnt> then you're like really that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> the anger you feel dude when are you </garnt>
<connor> interested have you not had that I get </connor>
<connor> so angry with that that's that's like </connor>
<connor> you've like filled out a whole sign up </connor>
<joey> form put the credit card info in the </joey>
<joey> addressing all in the right space you're </joey>
<joey> about to go to the checkout for some </joey>
<joey> reason for some of your times out or it </joey>
<joey> reloads you're like </joey>
<garnt> like [ __ ] guts theme goes through my </garnt>
<garnt> head yeah it's even worth signing up </garnt>
<garnt> again I don't know I don't know if this </garnt>
<garnt> is worth it anymore I don't even want </garnt>
<garnt> the trampoline yeah the worst part is </garnt>
<garnt> when you fill out everything correctly </garnt>
<connor> except for that one field but the </connor>
<connor> websites are signed in a way that when </connor>
<connor> you press send it it goes uh this one </connor>
<connor> field is incorrect we've reset the whole </connor>
<garnt> but they reset the end </garnt>
<connor> of that one field like imagine that </connor>
<connor> happens but just it happens to every </connor>
<garnt> website you sign up that's that's like </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many Japanese websites every </garnt>
<joey> Japanese website dude like I don't know </joey>
<joey> if Japanese people are aware of ux </joey>
<garnt> designers yeah they certainly it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like the amount of times I've been like </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] cupped by not using like half </connor>
<garnt> width yeah </garnt>
<connor> my [ __ ] god this is the biggest joke </connor>
<connor> in Japan and like it's something you'll </connor>
<joey> never experience unless you've either </joey>
<garnt> tried to buy stuff in like on a Japanese </garnt>
<joey> website but for some reason they have </joey>
<garnt> full width and half width Katakana and </garnt>
<garnt> can you explain that by the way what </garnt>
<garnt> what is the point of full width and half </garnt>
<joey> half I'll tell you exactly the </joey>
<joey> difference okay there is is none that's </joey>
<joey> what's so frustrating about it someone </joey>
<connor> explained it to me one time had </connor>
<joey> something to do with how they coded way </joey>
<joey> back the the initial internet oh yeah in </joey>
<joey> Japan and it was like a layover from </joey>
<connor> that essentially that they're probably </connor>
<joey> using and they never like decided to </joey>
<joey> sort out yeah because I mean like I've </joey>
<connor> told the story of how I interned for an </connor>
<connor> I.T company and I had to fix a bunch of </connor>
<connor> like clients websites and I had to go </connor>
<connor> like through the HTML and I had like </connor>
<garnt> almost had a stroke looking at some of </garnt>
<garnt> these codes because it's like oh my God </garnt>
<garnt> you said you built this website last </garnt>
<garnt> year you're using Code literally from </garnt>
<garnt> the 90s I was like what of course this </garnt>
<garnt> like of course this page takes like 20 </garnt>
<garnt> seconds to load even though it's just </garnt>
<connor> text based because it's so much [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> code here because [ __ ] uh it's so </joey>
<connor> weird because there's so much like </connor>
<garnt> convenience stuff and stuff crazy stuff </garnt>
<garnt> you can do that you can't do in other </garnt>
<garnt> countries yeah and then they're like how </garnt>
<garnt> about websites we just </garnt>
<joey> weirdly enough the best designed </joey>
<joey> websites are the [ __ ] anime trailer </joey>
<joey> websites right yeah the ones that are </joey>
<joey> like they use like [ __ ] like pretty </joey>
<joey> like Java and like CSS it's like oh that </joey>
<garnt> looks fancy yeah like when that website </garnt>
<joey> of like when the last Pokemon like when </joey>
<joey> a guitar are you uh volume was coming </joey>
<joey> out yeah and you're just like scrolling </joey>
<garnt> down for the entire history yeah of uh </garnt>
<garnt> of the series I was like damn this is a </garnt>
<joey> beautiful looking website oh my God </joey>
<joey> someone an actual coder yeah an actual </joey>
<garnt> programmer made this dude like can you </garnt>
<joey> not add this to your UI design when I'm </joey>
<joey> trying to [ __ ] buy something exactly </joey>
<joey> sign up to a site like Rockton is just </joey>
<joey> like a hell hole of a website because </joey>
<connor> you don't know you go to like because </connor>
<connor> like on Amazon for example Amazon's so </connor>
<connor> good yeah they don't do this because on </connor>
<connor> Amazon it's like okay there's the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] picture of the thing you want to </connor>
<connor> buy there's how many is left when it's </connor>
<connor> gonna arrive here's all the information </connor>
<connor> everything's perfectly laid out with </connor>
<connor> every single item yeah meanwhile with </connor>
<connor> Rockton it's just a [ __ ] free-for-all </connor>
<garnt> it's like would you like 17 banners that </garnt>
<garnt> have nothing to do with the product </garnt>
<garnt> you're actually buying by the way where </garnt>
<garnt> is the purchase button oh it's buried </garnt>
<garnt> deep beneath this [ __ ] wall of text </garnt>
<garnt> and every time I go on a rock dead it's </garnt>
<garnt> so handy because you get so much stuff </garnt>
<garnt> on Rockton that you can't get on Amazon </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but it's a [ __ ] it's it's just a </garnt>
<joey> struggle to try and like buy anything </joey>
<joey> because it doesn't even tell you when it </joey>
<garnt> arrives I don't know that's that's not </garnt>
<garnt> the final boss the final boss is Yahoo </garnt>
<joey> oh my God where you you can't even like </joey>
<joey> immediately you can't even sign up with </joey>
<joey> an account that you want you need like a </joey>
<garnt> special you need a special Yahoo account </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh so you need to just sign up to </garnt>
<garnt> Yahoo and it just it's not your normal </garnt>
<garnt> Yahoo it's Japanese Yahoo as well so I </garnt>
<garnt> have a Yahoo email account so like </garnt>
<garnt> Duncan or something I don't know if they </garnt>
<joey> chose the name for me it's really weird </joey>
<joey> yeah of course it's a Yahoo Japan </joey>
<joey> account because no one outside of Japan </joey>
<garnt> you just [ __ ] exactly right exactly </garnt>
<garnt> so you need to sign up with a special </garnt>
<garnt> Yahoo account to sign up to this uh </garnt>
<garnt> Yahoo auctions account to then just not </garnt>
<garnt> even like I don't even know what the </garnt>
<garnt> etiquette is in terms of like bidding </garnt>
<joey> stuff and how to do it I've I've dead </joey>
<joey> ass never even used Yahoo auctions just </joey>
<joey> because I refuse used to make a Yahoo </joey>
<connor> joke because I I I have a bad rating on </connor>
<joey> it because I forgot one time to say I </joey>
<joey> got the thing oh yeah yeah okay </joey>
<joey> angry message from a dude who was like </joey>
<joey> why haven't you told me that you've got </joey>
<joey> it this has been an awful experience for </joey>
<connor> me I'm like uh I just figured if I </connor>
<garnt> didn't say anything I mean it's like I </garnt>
<garnt> got it yeah you'd think so but like </garnt>
<garnt> how'd you how'd you pay can you pay with </garnt>
<connor> like credit card or something yeah so </connor>
<connor> it's really confusing because there's </connor>
<connor> like when you Auto translate it in </connor>
<joey> Google there's like online pay and like </joey>
<joey> something else that sounds like online </joey>
<joey> pay yeah yeah and I remember that I was </joey>
<joey> confused and I clicked one of them and </joey>
<joey> then I had to do this whole weird kind </joey>
<joey> of thing with my bank where I had to </joey>
<joey> then like contact my bank to do the </joey>
<joey> online payment oh my God where there was </joey>
<connor> just another field legislate put your </connor>
<connor> credit card information in and it isn't </connor>
<connor> clear because it wasn't it didn't say </connor>
<connor> like credit card it said something else </connor>
<connor> yeah really annoying really really </connor>
<connor> annoying I hate using it yeah just don't </connor>
<connor> bother that's what I mean like as well a </connor>
<garnt> lot of the websites that offer English </garnt>
<garnt> they're like okay you click English send </garnt>
<garnt> it to a brand new website that doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> have half the [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> whereas like Amazon on its like you </connor>
<connor> changed English nothing changes except </connor>
<garnt> the language yeah it's like great it's </garnt>
<joey> exactly like you know when you when you </joey>
<joey> go to like a Chinese restaurant with </joey>
<garnt> your one Chinese mate and they're like </garnt>
<joey> bring out the special yeah </joey>
<connor> I don't know why it's like Chinese </connor>
<connor> restaurants in particular but it seems </connor>
<garnt> like every Chinese restaurant has the </garnt>
<garnt> special menu that you can only that you </garnt>
<garnt> can only get by asking in Cantonese or </garnt>
<joey> Mansion or whatever and I bet they're </joey>
<joey> not even saying like bring out the real </joey>
<joey> minions probably just like a code word </joey>
<joey> you know it's like Mandarin is an orange </joey>
<joey> and they're like I said the word all </joey>
<garnt> right we can bring it out right now I </garnt>
<garnt> just like it just it just blows my mind </garnt>
<joey> because like you know I go to a Thai </joey>
<joey> restaurant and I can ask them in Thai </joey>
<joey> whether they have you know a you know a </joey>
<joey> Thai Dish that they they only like do in </joey>
<joey> Thailand or only time most Thai people </joey>
<joey> would know but like it's just like why </joey>
<garnt> is it that Chinese restaurant just have </garnt>
<garnt> an unspoken understanding that there's </garnt>
<garnt> going to be so many people asking for a </garnt>
<garnt> special menu that they're gonna make a </garnt>
<garnt> special menu for in every single </garnt>
<joey> challenge why are they literally </joey>
<joey> gatekeeping </joey>
<joey> you can literally gay people like if </joey>
<joey> you're not Chinese you can't get the </joey>
<connor> real [ __ ] yeah it makes me feel sad </connor>
<garnt> there because I love Chinese food I know </garnt>
<connor> right I never want to go to a Chinese </connor>
<garnt> restaurant without a Chinese socks </garnt>
<garnt> because it feels like you've just </garnt>
<garnt> unlocked the starter you're the starter </garnt>
<garnt> kit right and you need to learn Mandarin </garnt>
<garnt> to to get to get like the actual good </garnt>
<garnt> gear right do you know what I mean </garnt>
<garnt> because like I love Chinese food but the </garnt>
<garnt> best Chinese food I've had has not come </garnt>
<garnt> from the normal menu no like if I go to </garnt>
<garnt> like a Chinese restaurant and I see like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] you know orange chickens sweet </garnt>
<garnt> and sour chicken fried rice all this </garnt>
<garnt> stuff I was like this is no no give me </garnt>
<garnt> the real [ __ ] please give me the real </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] but I I don't know how to access it </joey>
<joey> where is your Chinese friend I do not </joey>
<joey> know I don't see him </joey>
<garnt> you just just speak Chinese word just </garnt>
<joey> just speak Mandarin it's easy just eat </joey>
<joey> exactly could you imagine if like </joey>
<joey> McDonald's did that it's like oh where's </joey>
<connor> your American friend well I know Shake </connor>
<connor> Shack does those does it do they yeah </connor>
<connor> they have a secret they have secret </connor>
<connor> items really yeah I didn't know that you </connor>
<joey> didn't know this </joey>
<connor> no it's not Shake Shack sorry uh uh in </connor>
<garnt> and out in and out oh in and out so it's </garnt>
<garnt> a small special menu you can get like </garnt>
<connor> the you can well I I don't know it's </connor>
<connor> like animal style fries that's a secret </connor>
<connor> menu oh yeah yeah I know that yeah and </connor>
<joey> then there's like a is that a secret </joey>
<joey> menu that I feel that's like so well </joey>
<joey> known now but if you're like a if you're </joey>
<connor> a tourist from Asia you don't speak </connor>
<joey> English oh that's true you're like and </joey>

<garnt> well I know there are secret items at </garnt>
<garnt> fast food chain there are secret items </garnt>
<garnt> items </garnt>

<garnt> to make but if someone is it a marketing </garnt>
<garnt> thing also that as well yeah yeah it </garnt>
<connor> makes you seem like you're you're like </connor>

<garnt> like knocked on the door and they can't </garnt>
<garnt> so it was it was literally it wasn't it </garnt>
<joey> wasn't even just look it looked closed </joey>
<joey> it was just scaffolding and like and </joey>
<joey> like a wooden door like the place was </joey>
<joey> like being built yeah brought it off and </joey>
<garnt> you just knock on the door and like a </garnt>
<garnt> like an actual Speakeasy like the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah it opens up yeah my one had </joey>
<joey> that as well so like he knocked like he </joey>
<joey> he's like oh I have to knock a specific </joey>
<joey> way as well I'm like no [ __ ] you do </joey>
<garnt> and he did like a secret like pattern </garnt>
<garnt> and then the thing came up and he's like </garnt>
<garnt> password and </garnt>
<garnt> also and he's like friend they pointed </garnt>
<garnt> at me and he's like yeah yeah friend I </garnt>
<garnt> was like okay and then he opens it up </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just this tiny like maybe </garnt>
<garnt> three-person bar right and uh I mean it </garnt>
<joey> was all right I guess it was all right </joey>
<garnt> it was cool that I was in the coolest </garnt>
<garnt> part it was just going to uh what looked </garnt>
<joey> like a secret bar the coolest bar was </joey>
<joey> just like the dude opening up like this </joey>
<connor> I've only ever seen that in movies I </connor>
<connor> went to one where it was it was in </connor>
<garnt> London um I went to it and it was like a </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a a breakfast restaurant or </garnt>
<garnt> something on the top yeah we went in </garnt>
<connor> there and I didn't know the password and </connor>
<connor> neither did my friend and then we were </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> we don't know what the password is yeah </connor>
<garnt> he was like it's a Daft Punk song lyric </garnt>
<connor> he was like feeding it to me and I was </connor>
<connor> like it was something like I'm up all </connor>
<connor> night to get lucky or something right </connor>
<connor> okay so he said it and he was like it's </connor>
<joey> not even like an obscure Daft Punk song </joey>
<connor> you just go through the entire disciples </connor>
<joey> which album or which album are we </joey>
<joey> talking about okay okay can't be too </joey>
<garnt> many lyrics yeah if it's the Punk lyrics </garnt>
<joey> that that narrows is it around the world </joey>
<garnt> so then um we're here and then some guy </garnt>
<joey> comes and greets as we start walking </joey>
<joey> through this uh restaurant that's closed </joey>
<joey> yeah and then like in a movie we go in </joey>
<joey> the kitchen and there's people like </joey>
<joey> working in the kitchen and we're just </joey>
<joey> like walking through oh [ __ ] and we go </joey>
<garnt> down into a basement in the kitchen and </garnt>
<joey> there's like boxes of fries and [ __ ] all </joey>
<joey> around us yeah and then like like in </joey>
<garnt> like in a [ __ ] spy movie it's got the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] beads </garnt>
<garnt> but there's like no uh little like </garnt>
<garnt> chairs or anything it's kind of like a </garnt>
<garnt> a very small room that's very dimly lit </garnt>
<connor> and it didn't it wasn't that good the </connor>
<connor> drinks are okay yeah and I was like this </connor>
<connor> is the coolest part was walking to this </connor>
<joey> thing oh yeah yeah I want to leave yeah </joey>
<joey> well I've always wanted to know what why </joey>
<joey> would you opt to make a business like </joey>
<joey> that right like you you I feel yeah I </joey>
<joey> feel clearly like if you're going to opt </joey>
<joey> to be like okay I'm gonna make this so </joey>
<joey> exclusive that it's like near impossible </joey>
<joey> for a regular person to find then it's </joey>
<joey> like you're clearly not doing it as a </joey>
<joey> sustainable business you know you're </joey>
<garnt> clearly doing it as like a [ __ ] hole </garnt>
<connor> I mean it's the assumption is you'll be </connor>
<garnt> able to survive on Word of Mouth I guess </garnt>
<connor> that's that's the Hope a lot of people </connor>
<garnt> like it's so cool you've got to go yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then the drinks are very mediocre </garnt>
<joey> yeah the experience feels worth it </joey>
<connor> because you feel exclusive yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> just bragging rights right yeah you pay </garnt>
<garnt> for the experience and not so much the </garnt>
<garnt> you know the bar or the business or the </garnt>
<garnt> uh drinks itself it's like uh it's like </garnt>
<garnt> bars that are membership only right and </garnt>
<garnt> you can only get membership by having </garnt>
<garnt> someone recommend you okay that always </garnt>
<connor> seemed really silly to me but there's so </connor>
<garnt> many of them well that's like you know </garnt>
<garnt> that's like like half of like the golden </garnt>
<joey> guy yeah um </joey>
<joey> as well is like that as well yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like if you don't know someone who </joey>
<joey> either works there or goes there </joey>
<joey> frequently enough they just won't let </joey>
<garnt> you in yeah yeah but at the same time </garnt>
<garnt> like I I can get it with the bars and </garnt>
<garnt> golden guy because the bars are so small </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm sure that their regular </garnt>
<garnt> customers can keep them keep their </garnt>
<garnt> business up and running yeah anyway you </garnt>
<joey> just see like one or two patrons so you </joey>
<garnt> keep get yourself going and then you'll </garnt>
<joey> basically set that's true sure it </joey>
<joey> basically said it'd be pretty cool to </joey>
<joey> own a like tiny little bar in Golden guy </joey>
<joey> I've always thought about that but it's </joey>
<joey> like what but like it's delighted to get </joey>
<joey> a ball though yeah that's what I've </joey>
<joey> always wanted I'm like yo but like all </joey>
<joey> those bars even though they're so tiny </joey>
<joey> I'm sure they're paying out the ass to </joey>
<connor> have that space because it's a trash </connor>
<joey> Taste Bar there of trash day Spartan </joey>
<garnt> goldfish tastes special build a bar </garnt>
<garnt> build a bar in Golden guy all three of </garnt>
<joey> us build our own bars and golden guy see </joey>
<joey> who makes the most money at the end of </joey>
<connor> the night </connor>
<joey> I didn't even want a mystical nightmare </joey>
<joey> I don't even want to think about how </joey>
<joey> much it must cost to like rent out a </joey>
<garnt> space I'd get really claustrophobic </garnt>
<joey> walking uh </joey>
<connor> it's cozy I think it's cozy yeah I think </connor>
<joey> it's cozy it depends I've been in I've </joey>
<joey> been in somewhere it's like I I </joey>
<joey> literally can't stand up straight yeah </joey>
<garnt> inside of them it's literally a shoe box </garnt>
<joey> yeah it is </joey>
<garnt> um and I don't even know how they get </garnt>
<joey> into the bar let alone work well most of </joey>
<joey> them are like you know four feet tall </joey>
<joey> like orbachans right exactly they </joey>
<joey> probably don't have any problems it's </joey>
<garnt> not built for someone of my stature if I </garnt>
<garnt> stand up I literally my my like head </garnt>
<joey> literally hits the ceiling like I feel </joey>
<joey> like Gandalf in Frodo's house in a lot </joey>
<joey> of these players around I'm just </joey>
<joey> constantly can I get a drink please it's </joey>
<joey> normally if you're wide that's the </joey>
<connor> problem though not not if you're tall </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah that's true but that's why I </joey>
<joey> like going in the winter time is the </joey>
<joey> worst because you're like all puffed up </joey>
<joey> with jackets and [ __ ] you're just like </joey>
<connor> all right out of the way please sorry </connor>
<connor> excuse me so I think it's best to go </connor>
<joey> winter in the summer if it's weird I </joey>
<joey> don't know why I feel in the summer it's </joey>
<connor> way too hot it's really hot yeah even </connor>
<joey> though the AC is going and still though </joey>
<joey> either way it's very much a gamble I've </joey>
<joey> heard so many horror stories in Golden </joey>

<garnt> description back to the episode um yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I've only been to that golden guy like </garnt>
<garnt> two times I haven't been that many times </garnt>
<garnt> um and it's been a interesting </garnt>
<connor> experience every time yeah the last time </connor>
<connor> I went was with you guys and at that bar </connor>
<connor> oh yeah that was fun yeah which is </connor>
<connor> really really fun that's a good time </connor>
<joey> yeah we're like what's up uh that's the </joey>
<connor> one that uh Jan came to oh that one and </connor>
<joey> he immediately went behind the bar and </joey>
<garnt> stuff well he just basically just took </garnt>
<connor> over the box he just took over yeah the </connor>
<connor> woman who was at the bar got tired or </connor>
<joey> something yeah it was like this it was </joey>
<joey> owned by this like what looked like a at </joey>
<joey> least 70 80 year old like old lady she </joey>
<joey> was really really nice but she was like </joey>
<garnt> clearly standing at the bar all night </garnt>
<garnt> and the moment Jan came in she was like </garnt>
<garnt> oh that looks like a charismatic enough </garnt>
<garnt> guy to take over my bar for the night </garnt>
<garnt> and so she literally she literally </garnt>
<garnt> ushers Jan over because there were no </garnt>
<garnt> seats left because yeah there was like </garnt>
<garnt> us three and like two other Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> people and that that was it it was so </garnt>
<garnt> small so Jane comes in he's like I got </garnt>
<garnt> nowhere to sit old lady just like ushers </garnt>
<garnt> Jano and he's like take over and this </garnt>
<garnt> just goes behind the back and we never </garnt>
<garnt> see her for the rest of the night and </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like uh we could just like we </garnt>
<joey> could just leave if we wanted to </joey>
<connor> obviously we paid at the end of it it's </connor>
<joey> like a thousand uh yeah a drink but like </joey>
<garnt> it was like you were pouring the drinks </garnt>
<connor> so it was like yeah I could just make it </connor>
<garnt> as strong as you wanted exactly it </garnt>
<garnt> became a self-service bar I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how Jan has this effect like basically </garnt>
<joey> everywhere he goes where he just sweet </joey>
<joey> talks the [ __ ] the [ __ ] restaurant </joey>
<joey> the waiter or the bar lady to give us </joey>
<garnt> the special service or the special menu </garnt>
<joey> the menu that doesn't exist yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah you know it's always it's always </joey>
<garnt> something like John who was able to get </garnt>
<joey> Jan is the only man that can somehow </joey>
<joey> pull out a secret menu from a restaurant </joey>
<joey> that doesn't even have a secret menu </joey>
<joey> yeah it's just like oh I guess we have a </joey>
<joey> secret menu now [ __ ] all right bring it </joey>
<garnt> up this guy </garnt>
<garnt> imagine like going to like a British </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant or something and like gonna </garnt>
<garnt> get out the secret menu and it's just </garnt>
<joey> like I feel like toast sandwich </joey>
<joey> unfortunately the crisp toast sandwich </joey>
<joey> crisp sandwich I think the UK is the one </joey>
<joey> place for sweet talkie doesn't do </joey>
<joey> anything yeah they just like no really </joey>
<connor> no I've never seen anyone sweet talk </connor>
<connor> anything in the UK maybe in a bar with </connor>
<joey> one guy yeah like in a restaurant it </joey>
<joey> will never work or maybe it's because </joey>
<joey> they just don't have like secret menu </joey>
<joey> culture maybe no we don't yeah what </joey>
<garnt> would be on like the Japanese secret </garnt>
<garnt> menu there was like uh if you wanna if </garnt>
<garnt> you went to like sign abroad </garnt>
<connor> or something yeah I don't know I feel </connor>
<joey> like we don't have secret menus here </joey>
<joey> either just because like we don't even </joey>
<joey> have tipping culture here because we're </joey>
<joey> so like just so like these are the rules </joey>
<joey> we can't make any kind of exceptions if </joey>
<garnt> you're proud of it right well like like </garnt>
<joey> what I'm talking about is if you go to a </joey>
<joey> Japanese restaurant not in Japan oh like </joey>
<joey> what would be like the Foods on there </joey>
<joey> that would be something that you a </joey>
<garnt> Japanese person very accustomed to </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese Cuisine would know but not is </garnt>
<garnt> like I guess not mainstream enough to be </garnt>
<joey> on like to be so you're asking what the </joey>
<joey> most underrated Japanese food is </joey>
<joey> I would say it'd probably be something </joey>
<joey> slimy like most of the [ __ ] that we've </joey>
<joey> ended up feeling in you know what's in </joey>
<joey> the box and the Charities </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah probably something like that </joey>
<joey> like maybe like I don't know um not on </joey>
<garnt> in curry maybe because I feel like a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of Izakaya Foods would be on there oh </garnt>
<joey> yeah definitely like yeah like uh like </joey>
<joey> the Blended squid and stuff like that or </joey>
<garnt> like takawasa that [ __ ] oh that's just </garnt>
<joey> ball oh no way no way hey man you're </joey>
<garnt> you're part of my team now because </garnt>
<garnt> you're like NATO okay natto natto was </garnt>
<connor> actually right it was it was all right </connor>
<connor> The Taste is fine but the Slime is just </connor>
<garnt> Dreadful yeah really vile the Slime is </garnt>
<garnt> it's not even the worst texture I've had </garnt>
<garnt> in Japan I feel like it it looks a lot </garnt>
<garnt> worse than it tastes and feels in your </garnt>
<garnt> mouth I think like I think the bean </garnt>
<garnt> stays pretty good I mean it just tastes </garnt>
<garnt> like soy sauce I think I mean it smells </garnt>
<joey> basically what it is </joey>
<joey> soy sauce on soy beans yeah yeah soy </joey>
<joey> overload right right I mean I feel </joey>
<joey> though if because you guys ate it like </joey>
<joey> straight out of the packet you got like </joey>
<garnt> the full brunt of like the the sliminess </garnt>
<garnt> and the texture but like when you put </garnt>
<garnt> that on a bed of rice because you're </garnt>
<joey> eating it with rice it doesn't feel as </joey>
<garnt> slimy yeah I feel like I'm sure like </garnt>
<joey> with bit of rice it would be perfect it </joey>
<joey> would be absolutely fantastic yeah I </joey>
<joey> mean I I guess you know you gotta you </joey>
<joey> gotta give it a go give it a go if you </joey>
<joey> don't leave it it's totally fine maybe </joey>
<joey> maybe you'll like it maybe you're not </joey>
<joey> yeah like I to me like I I learned that </joey>
<joey> uh I just can't handle ketchup I don't </joey>
<joey> know why I don't know why like that was </joey>
<joey> the first time that was that was a lot </joey>
<connor> of kids that was the first time like so </connor>
<connor> so far live streams yeah to explain we </connor>
<connor> all had forfeits to do I had to eat </connor>
<connor> pizza crust drenched in ketchup and </connor>
<connor> mayonnaise because I hate to ketchup and </connor>
<connor> mayonnaise and you don't need the cross </connor>
<connor> and then I don't need the crust and I </connor>
<connor> remember like I was like I'm gonna give </connor>
<connor> this the best go that I possibly can </connor>
<connor> because it's for charity and it's the </connor>
<connor> first time where I've put something in </connor>
<connor> my mouth and I had like immediate gag </connor>
<connor> reflex </connor>
<garnt> like to me like the natto like I was </garnt>
<garnt> just like maybe I'm gonna gag you into </garnt>
<connor> nothing I had it and I'm just like </connor>
<connor> you expected to gag I think you expected </connor>
<joey> to like throw up so you're you're </joey>
<connor> psyching yourself out the moment you've </connor>
<joey> it touched your tongue you're like yeah </joey>
<joey> um to be fair that that smells pretty </joey>
<garnt> Dreadful but I had to do the ghost </garnt>
<garnt> pepper that was a that was how was that </garnt>
<garnt> experience that that hurt see because </garnt>
<connor> like you know you guys were saying like </connor>
<connor> oh you know and everyone in the chat was </connor>
<connor> saying oh look forward to the next </connor>
<connor> morning like you're gonna you're gonna </connor>
<connor> be [ __ ] through a straw and I was </connor>
<connor> like oh God no no the ramen was way </connor>
<connor> worse yeah the ramen was way worse that </connor>
<joey> we had but um yeah I was fine like I had </joey>
<joey> maybe like one painful [ __ ] and then I </joey>
<joey> thought that was gonna be like the </joey>
<connor> beginning of the end the one that's </connor>
<joey> spicy is the other one yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but yeah I was fine after that I just </joey>
<joey> you know I look back on the this clip of </joey>
<joey> me like shivering for 15 minutes </joey>
<joey> afterwards and I'm like I literally look </joey>
<joey> like I'm about to [ __ ] die </joey>
<garnt> yeah I was like getting slightly worried </garnt>
<joey> when you started shivering yeah I know </joey>
<joey> it's because your body is just going </joey>
<joey> into shock yeah pretty much and uh you </joey>
<garnt> you're like your body is rushing you </garnt>
<joey> with like [ __ ] adrenaline and </joey>
<garnt> endorphins and all that kind of [ __ ] and </garnt>
<joey> like I just remember seeing you like go </joey>
<garnt> like this and I'm just like so you are </garnt>
<joey> you around me and like you know I think </joey>
<joey> the worst part about it is when you </joey>
<joey> watch that out of context you see a dude </joey>
<joey> who looks clearly sleep deprived with </joey>
<joey> like huge bags under his eyes shivering </joey>
<joey> I just look like a crack addict like I </joey>
<joey> just look like I was having withdrawals </joey>
<joey> I was like sleepy like </joey>
<garnt> that's not the best lawyer I don't think </garnt>
<joey> the sleep deprivation helped as well </joey>
<joey> because I can't imagine trying like </joey>
<garnt> trying a food that you really it's like </garnt>
<garnt> seven in the morning yeah it was seven </garnt>
<joey> in the morning we were up for like 20 </joey>
<joey> hours at that point and you're like </joey>
<joey> perfect time perfect time to eat a ghost </joey>
<joey> no to be honest I couldn't taste </joey>
<garnt> anything oh yeah there was no flavor was </garnt>
<garnt> it as painful as you thought it would be </garnt>
<connor> I yeah I I find that like sauce sources </connor>
<garnt> like really like heavy sauce based </garnt>
<garnt> dishes that are spicy are the hardest to </garnt>
<garnt> eat because like you know like the hot </garnt>
<garnt> one stuff yeah I can eat all of those </garnt>
<garnt> hot ones sauce like the hottest ones on </garnt>
<joey> wings like no issue like I don't need </joey>
<garnt> milk or anything like that it's just it </garnt>
<joey> tastes good like the last dab yeah like </joey>
<garnt> I like slather everything in that right </garnt>
<garnt> and it's all it's all good because it's </garnt>
<joey> just a few bites but it's very solid </joey>
<joey> but like we did the ramen video for </joey>
<joey> yours yeah and that wasn't that spicy </joey>
<garnt> like it it I'd say like it's not as </garnt>
<garnt> spicy as like a Ghost Pepper or a </garnt>
<garnt> Carolina Reaper yeah because it's just </garnt>
<connor> sauce yeah It Coats your mouth </connor>
<connor> culture like esophagus and then it comes </connor>
<connor> in the stomach and it it hurts so much </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and then it takes a while so </connor>
<joey> you just keep eating yeah eating I </joey>
<joey> definitely struggle more I think with </joey>
<connor> that than the ghost pepper one burst of </connor>
<connor> spice is not that bad it's when you keep </connor>
<connor> eating burst of spice yeah yeah it </connor>
<garnt> builds up multiplies yeah you don't you </garnt>
<connor> don't give yourself a break that's not </connor>
<garnt> like eating one Carolina Reaper for me </garnt>
<garnt> is like totally chill I could do it now </garnt>
<garnt> and we could still film the episode and </garnt>
<garnt> it'd be chill yeah eating like those </garnt>
<joey> competitions where they eat like 40. I'm </joey>
<joey> like that's fine how has anyone not died </joey>
<connor> from that Ah that's [ __ ] I don't know </connor>
<joey> because I don't think you die from Spice </joey>
<connor> no I didn't go in the shock though you </connor>
<garnt> can go into shock but I don't has there </garnt>
<garnt> been a recorded uh recorded case or </garnt>
<joey> someone dying from Spice I'm not sure if </joey>
<joey> there is there has been you can throw </joey>
<connor> the whole through your stomach I don't </connor>
<connor> necessarily think that's true though I </connor>
<joey> think yeah you'd have to have a pretty </joey>
<connor> weak stomach that I feel yeah because </connor>
<garnt> like it's a factor of things because </garnt>
<garnt> like for me as someone who like loves </garnt>
<garnt> spicy food like trying to explain why I </garnt>
<garnt> eat spicy food or why like you know like </garnt>
<garnt> Joey's Joey's said to me all the time </garnt>
<garnt> like oh I don't know how you can like </garnt>
<garnt> get through that or something like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and I think one thing that's really </garnt>
<garnt> under like underrated about why people </garnt>
<garnt> eat spicy food is that the spicy food </garnt>
<garnt> needs to taste good yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> because we we when we think of like </garnt>
<garnt> spicy challenges we just think about </garnt>
<garnt> getting through getting through how </garnt>
<garnt> spicy this spicy meal is or getting </garnt>
<garnt> through like this [ __ ] Pepper or </garnt>
<garnt> something but a big draw of spicy food </garnt>
<garnt> is that if it's even if you're off in </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] pain and you know your mouth is </garnt>
<garnt> hurting if it tastes good with the spice </garnt>
<garnt> you want to finish it if you want to eat </garnt>
<joey> it because it tastes good I mean that </joey>
<joey> was it with the ramen video like I would </joey>
<joey> not have finished that if it didn't </joey>
<joey> taste as good as it did yeah and it </joey>
<joey> tastes really [ __ ] good if that </joey>
<joey> didn't not taste good I would just been </joey>
<garnt> like no [ __ ] this yeah like I found like </garnt>
<garnt> for example like the Coco Ichiban level </garnt>
<joey> 10 spice and it is spicy but it doesn't </joey>
<joey> taste good like it just feels like </joey>
<joey> you're making it spicy to make it spicy </joey>
<joey> just artificial it's just artificial </joey>
<joey> right sometimes it just feels like this </joey>
<joey> is just you know this is just a flex at </joey>
<garnt> the end of the day wait we can make it </garnt>
<garnt> this spice but it doesn't even like the </garnt>
<garnt> taste doesn't marry you well with the </garnt>
<garnt> spice at all and it's just like if like </garnt>
<joey> proper good spicy dishes need to taste </joey>
<joey> good in this complement the actual base </joey>
<garnt> food right yeah yeah exactly like I have </garnt>
<garnt> like for example I have like Thai food </garnt>
<garnt> without the spice and it literally does </garnt>
<joey> feel like there's a there's a component </joey>
<garnt> that's missing from the food </garnt>
<joey> um so good yeah were you gonna say uh </joey>
<joey> conversation does cause uh tissue </joey>
<joey> inflammation so a large enough dose </joey>
<joey> could cause serious damage to your </joey>
<joey> stomach I feel you'd have to have like </joey>
<joey> an egregious amount though to hit that </joey>
<joey> point uh or something really spicy and </joey>
<joey> have it all in one sitting you could do </joey>
<garnt> enough damage to potentially kill you </garnt>
<connor> um I I just uh uh my ex-girlfriend was </connor>
<garnt> Sri Lankan yeah I remember when I went </garnt>
<garnt> to to meet her parents and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> everything had chilies in it of course </garnt>
<garnt> it was amazing yeah I loved it yeah I </garnt>
<joey> was like it was like breakfast </joey>
<joey> omelette with like five of those Peppers </joey>
<joey> that you put in like Thai food yeah and </joey>
<joey> I and I I ate them all and then I don't </joey>
<joey> know if I told the story her mom came in </joey>
<joey> and was like </joey>
<connor> why did he eat the peppers and I was </connor>
<connor> like am I not supposed to eat the </connor>
<connor> peppers and she was like no you'll get </connor>
<connor> stomach cancer if you eat the peppers </connor>
<connor> I'm like why would you put them in the </connor>
<connor> food what the [ __ ] they were delicious </connor>
<connor> he was good yeah it was also like </connor>
<garnt> another restaurant because she stripped </garnt>
<garnt> me around to a bunch of the local </garnt>
<garnt> restaurants and there's one thing where </garnt>
<joey> it was like deviled mutton it was called </joey>
<joey> or something yeah and it was like that </joey>
<joey> sounds badass it was like the most </joey>
<joey> delicious marinated mutton I'd ever had </joey>
<garnt> in my life damn but it was like like </garnt>
<garnt> Doom level of spice or if it's got the </garnt>
<connor> word devil yeah and it was like I'm </connor>
<connor> tearing up but I'm like [ __ ] so good </connor>
<connor> and it was like even though I said like </connor>
<garnt> so much pain I'm like just another bite </garnt>
<garnt> that's so good that's the thing about </garnt>
<connor> spicy food if it's really good spicy </connor>
<connor> food you're like you power through it I </connor>
<connor> just just one more bite take the bite </connor>
<joey> you're in a pain but you're just like oh </joey>
<joey> it just tastes so good though I don't </joey>
<connor> know how to explain it but like when </connor>
<connor> it's super spicy and super delicious </connor>
<connor> it's almost like it's searing in the </connor>
<connor> flavor yeah so I'm like this is so much </connor>
<garnt> flavor because it's almost like if you </garnt>
<garnt> take the splice out because I'm like for </garnt>
<joey> example I've had like very you know you </joey>
<joey> know I've had unspiced Thai curry I've </joey>
<joey> had unspiced Indian curry as well </joey>
<garnt> because you're not in England and uh and </garnt>
<connor> the best way I can describe it is that </connor>
<garnt> it just tastes flat it tastes flat so </garnt>
<connor> there's something that's missing from </connor>
<connor> the taste right uh uncarbonated </connor>
<garnt> certainly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's a good analogy actually it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> you the flavor's there but there's like </garnt>
<garnt> a texture so the flavor is there but the </garnt>
<garnt> personality is gone exactly </garnt>
<connor> engine car you know if you have rice </connor>
<connor> with it too or you have none I feel like </connor>
<joey> that's so nice to have like spice with </joey>
<joey> it because yeah it kind of help smell of </joey>
<connor> it out a bit yeah yeah yeah yeah see </connor>
<connor> because like I never for the longest </connor>
<joey> time I didn't understand that concept of </joey>
<joey> like spice enhancing food because you </joey>
<joey> know up until I'd say maybe like three </joey>
<joey> or four years ago I could not handle </joey>
<joey> spice at all like if I went to Koko Ichi </joey>
<joey> I would do like level one yeah which is </joey>
<joey> like the most basic [ __ ] and I'd just be </joey>
<joey> like no too spicy I can't do it and then </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it was that like where </joey>
<joey> just one day I kind of just flipped a </joey>
<joey> dime and I was like you know what this </joey>
<joey> it hurts but I'm enjoying it for some </joey>
<garnt> reason </garnt>
<garnt> what is this see I I had like the </garnt>
<joey> opposite journey of Joey some of like </joey>
<garnt> someone who's grown up on tife with Thai </garnt>
<joey> food and stuff like that yeah so like I </joey>
<joey> would I like I remember as a kid I like </joey>
<garnt> really did not like Japanese food at all </garnt>
<joey> because a lot of Japanese Cuisine </joey>
<garnt> revolves around you know the natural </garnt>
<joey> flavor of savory mode like savoring it </joey>
<garnt> and just bringing out the natural </garnt>
<garnt> flavors of the ingredient and me a Thai </garnt>
<garnt> person being like there is not enough </garnt>
<garnt> ingredients in this dish what sushi </garnt>
<garnt> sushi what that's that's just two </garnt>
<garnt> ingredients that's rice and fish what </garnt>
<garnt> where's the spice where's the flavor </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah three ingredients like you know </garnt>
<garnt> rice yeah rice with a bit of vinegar in </garnt>
<joey> it yeah uh fish and wasabi I'm just like </joey>
<joey> where's the five million spices to go </joey>
<joey> with it what what you dip it in soy </joey>
<joey> sauce where's where's the chilies in the </joey>
<joey> soy sauce what's the kick yeah where's </joey>
<joey> the kick and uh like like Japanese </joey>
<joey> Cuisine was like my least favorite </joey>
<garnt> Cuisine because to me that just wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> weren't enough like extra spices or </garnt>
<connor> extra ingredients yeah cause the flavors </connor>
<garnt> unseasoned Sushi </garnt>
<garnt> and then As I Grew Older I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> you as as a gorilla I learned to really </garnt>
<garnt> appreciate the subtleties in the flavor </garnt>
<garnt> of like Japanese Cuisine where you it </garnt>
<connor> really enhances </connor>
<garnt> um it really enhances like you know the </garnt>
<connor> good ingredients in it just rice all the </connor>
<connor> same you know </connor>
<connor> for 20 years to get the perfect thick </connor>
<joey> rice so rice in it it's all the same </joey>
<connor> we're just Uncle Ben's what does it says </connor>
<garnt> it's a microwave brush right five minute </garnt>
<joey> rice </joey>
<connor> Minute Maid rice yeah well I [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> love the golden rice in those microwave </connor>
<joey> packets though I [ __ ] love that Rice </joey>
<garnt> oh the the ready to make ones right yeah </garnt>
<connor> it tastes so good yeah </connor>
<garnt> exactly fast food rice how do we make </garnt>
<connor> rice unhealthy super unhealthy we found </connor>
<garnt> a way </garnt>
<garnt> yeah honestly like the false food uh the </garnt>
<connor> the packeted fried rice that you can buy </connor>
<garnt> is actually pretty damn in Japan it's </garnt>
<connor> pretty good in the freezer yeah yeah I </connor>
<joey> was like oh well I made Curry and I </joey>
<joey> don't want to make I didn't have a rice </joey>
<joey> cooker at the time yeah yeah and I hated </joey>
<joey> making rice the way that my mom taught </joey>
<joey> me which was just boil a pan full of </joey>
<joey> water yes yeah which sometimes worked </joey>
<joey> sometimes didn't yeah uh but doing it in </joey>
<connor> Japan is like Blasphemous I know I know </connor>
<connor> I know but it's like it's weird because </connor>
<garnt> you'd think that like the first people </garnt>
<joey> to adapt an easier way to do it yeah </joey>
<garnt> would be white people because they love </garnt>
<joey> being lazy that's true so like you'd </joey>
<joey> think they you'd think Rush hookers </joey>
<connor> would go down like especially for the UK </connor>
<connor> where we love rice yeah like we love </connor>
<garnt> eating it with curry so like you'd think </garnt>
<garnt> too dude do people in the UK love rice </garnt>
<connor> with curry that's pretty much it though </connor>
<connor> but that's the only thing we eat half </connor>
<garnt> the time chicken tikka masala is like </garnt>
<connor> every every week that's true you'd think </connor>
<connor> that we would figure out like hey these </connor>
<garnt> rice cookies aren't so bad yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> like I remember growing up in the UK </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I'd like have my pack lunch or </garnt>
<connor> whatever my it would be like you know </connor>
<connor> you'd never make rice for a packed lunch </connor>
<garnt> it's the dinner thing yeah I know uh no </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] um </garnt>
<joey> sorry sorry the tea to me is the drink </joey>
<connor> you know </connor>
<joey> as as with as with motion as with most </joey>
<joey> of them for me is a twit longer </joey>
<garnt> awful joke awful joke no but like I </garnt>
<garnt> remember having this conversation with </garnt>
<joey> my mates but and they were like wait you </joey>
<joey> eat rice every day with every meal and </joey>
<joey> I'm like yeah yeah like you you have it </joey>
<joey> with every meal and </joey>
<joey> they couldn't like wrap their heads </joey>
<joey> around you bougie [ __ ] yeah you </joey>
<joey> eat rice with everything everything you </joey>
<joey> don't take a brace from right I break </joey>
<garnt> from Rice you just it's everything I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like yeah it's it's Asia it's Asian </garnt>
<garnt> Cuisine you could you literally eat rice </garnt>
<joey> with end every with everything I'm sure </joey>
<joey> the Asians are asking the same thing </joey>
<joey> being like wait you eat you use bread </joey>
<connor> with everything but also </connor>
<garnt> every meal is bread it's bread or </garnt>
<garnt> potatoes yeah wait is that is that it is </garnt>
<joey> that it bread or potatoes </joey>
<joey> carbs on carbs I mean I think it's I </joey>
<garnt> think it's grown a lot popularity there </garnt>
<garnt> in the last 10 years especially rice </garnt>
<garnt> yeah definitely not when I was growing </garnt>
<connor> up at all yeah because it's become way </connor>
<connor> more popular like rice based uh dishes </connor>
<connor> in general but uh you know I think uh I </connor>
<joey> I say finally right yeah yeah but I </joey>
<connor> think there's enough dishes where people </connor>
<connor> are making them wear a rice cooker </connor>
<connor> you're peeled by bread makers people are </connor>
<connor> making bread every [ __ ] and if those </connor>
<connor> things are [ __ ] massive yeah right by </connor>
<connor> the time my little rice cookers like </connor>
<connor> this big but the point was before I did </connor>
<garnt> this uh I used to just buy the microwave </garnt>
<garnt> packets they're amazing like yeah 300 </garnt>
<garnt> gram packets yeah perfect portion tastes </garnt>
<connor> great slap it on the plate they're good </connor>
<joey> to go yeah yeah amazing amazing I </joey>
<connor> actually you know I actually think those </connor>
<connor> I I also survived without a rice cooker </connor>
<joey> in University for a long time because </joey>
<joey> because the microwave packets were good </joey>
<joey> enough and the problem with a rice </joey>
<joey> cooker </joey>
<joey> um I find is that the rice goes off so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] quick so either you like cook a </joey>
<joey> tiny bit of rice in this massive rice </joey>
<joey> cooker because I'm Asian and of course </joey>
<joey> like if a mum if a mum buys you a rice </joey>
<joey> cooker it's like the biggest [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> rice cooker you could ever imagine how </joey>
<joey> many families </joey>
<joey> it's like this restaurant one where it's </joey>
<connor> like this big luckily there was a </connor>
<connor> humanitarian crisis but it wasn't for </connor>
<garnt> long because gone had his rice yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because because like my mum my mum like </garnt>
<garnt> bought me a rice cooker for University </garnt>
<garnt> because that's like that's like one of </garnt>
<garnt> the essential pieces of equipment that </garnt>
<garnt> you do for University for every Asian </garnt>
<garnt> kid that the mum provides of course and </garnt>
<garnt> you they provide you a rice cooker that </garnt>
<garnt> could survive a nuclear winter you know </garnt>
<garnt> you you you you could pretty sure you </garnt>
<joey> can like I'm pretty sure you can like </joey>
<garnt> hop inside of a Survivor blast yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right right but the problem is like I </garnt>
<joey> would always cook too much rice or too </joey>
<joey> little rice right that yeah I would </joey>
<joey> either like it would be like either too </joey>
<joey> much for the meal I was cooking I would </joey>
<joey> have some leftover rice </joey>
<joey> um or I'd have cooked too much rice and </joey>
<joey> like the rice just goes off so quickly </joey>
<garnt> even if you put it in the fridge or </garnt>
<garnt> something because unless you're this is </garnt>
<garnt> this is the Asian trap right because </garnt>
<garnt> with the rice cooker you have to eat </garnt>
<garnt> rice every day in order to cook in order </garnt>
<garnt> to eat all the rice that you could with </garnt>
<garnt> the rice cooker otherwise it's just </garnt>
<garnt> going to go off exactly um so that's why </garnt>
<garnt> actually the microwave packets were just </garnt>
<garnt> like the perfect portion yeah for for </garnt>
<garnt> like one meal and it was just like a lot </garnt>
<joey> less effort yeah because then you have </joey>
<joey> to like start experimenting like you </joey>
<joey> look in your fridge and be like all </joey>
<joey> right what can the rice go with that I </joey>
<connor> haven't tried I don't know can you </connor>
<joey> dehydrate the rice that you've cooked </joey>
<connor> turn it back into a rice grain is that </connor>
<joey> possible well I mean uh if you had the </joey>
<joey> technology I'm asking is it possible </joey>
<joey> well I mean like I I put it </joey>
<joey> no it's like popcorn you don't turn back </joey>
<connor> to it oh that that form is completely </connor>
<connor> different though the rice stays the same </connor>
<connor> I think I think if you took the water </connor>
<connor> out somehow maybe we could do it </connor>
<joey> scientists </joey>
<joey> my family uh actually a lot of Japanese </joey>
<garnt> families what they do is if they make </garnt>
<garnt> too much rice then you put it into like </garnt>
<garnt> small you know like maybe </garnt>
<joey> microwave-sized packets and then you put </joey>
<garnt> it in the freezer yes yeah that was also </garnt>
<joey> what happened as well yeah but but it's </joey>
<joey> like not the same like the next morning </joey>
<joey> you wake up and be like you know okay </joey>
<joey> there's some leftover rice if I don't </joey>
<joey> eat them my mom's gonna [ __ ] throw </joey>
<garnt> hissy fit so let's let's just get it out </garnt>
<garnt> defrost that [ __ ] but there was no space </garnt>
<garnt> in my freezer to put extra packets of </garnt>
<joey> Frozen rice you know why as a universal </joey>
<joey> here what happens when your mum comes </joey>
<joey> over she brings you eight [ __ ] eight </joey>
<joey> like Tupperware boxes full of takeaway </joey>
<joey> foods and then and then you gotta put it </joey>
<connor> in the freezer and it just lasts the </connor>
<garnt> it'll last you the entire day you know </garnt>
<connor> the entire [ __ ] term I was that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you know when you've got to </connor>
<connor> share a freezer and some [ __ ] makes </connor>
<connor> takes up the entire [ __ ] thing </connor>
<connor> because he decided that his he was going </connor>
<garnt> to meal prep like like an entire month </garnt>
<connor> yeah and you're like you're a [ __ ] you </connor>
<garnt> know that like we gotta share the </garnt>
<joey> freezer where is my Ben and Jerry's </joey>
<joey> gonna go where am I gonna put my body I </joey>
<connor> just wanted one Ben and Jerry's in here </connor>
<joey> is that too much to ask you know like </joey>
<joey> stop playing Tetris with all the rice </joey>
<connor> packets yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> like my mum would come to visit me once </garnt>
<garnt> a month in University and every month </garnt>
<garnt> she she'd bring like two full like </garnt>
<garnt> Sainsbury's bag worth of like takeaway </garnt>
<garnt> boxes of holy [ __ ] and I'm just like </garnt>
<connor> that that is I don't know I don't know </connor>
<connor> how many people were in your like were </connor>
<garnt> you sharing one fridge with </garnt>
<garnt> like uh six or seven or something like </garnt>
<garnt> that so at best you get you have half a </garnt>
<joey> shelf to yourself yeah and then you have </joey>
<joey> one like a freezer's even smaller yeah </joey>
<joey> so you had like what two items to put in </joey>
<joey> the freezer God you must have been hated </joey>
<connor> yeah I probably was they probably hated </connor>
<connor> you I would I would I would probably I'd </connor>
<connor> be like God mate either you're sharing </connor>
<connor> this with me yeah that's my real estate </connor>
<connor> or I'm putting stuff in there dude no </connor>
<joey> you gotta you gotta saying my property a </joey>
<joey> little bit I'm like I'm gonna have to </joey>
<joey> pull a shotgun man I'm gonna have to </joey>
<joey> you're gonna have to haggle with me here </joey>

<garnt> I don't think they did I I want to say </garnt>
<garnt> that no I don't think so oh I'm the last </garnt>
<garnt> house I moved into in University it was </garnt>
<garnt> like we moved in it was a bit beat up it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't like great my mum was like </garnt>
<garnt> mortified she was like oh my God this </garnt>
<garnt> place is a [ __ ] oh my God you can't </garnt>
<connor> you can't live here I'm like it's not </connor>
<connor> that bad I'll get over it I'll be fine I </connor>
<connor> just remember her reaction she was just </connor>
<connor> like I thought she's actually gonna be </connor>
<connor> like you can't you can't you have to </connor>
<connor> find somewhere else this is too old I </connor>
<joey> was like no it's fine I wasn't even that </joey>
<connor> bad it was kind of messy is this one in </connor>
<connor> Swansea yeah but it was and that one was </connor>
<garnt> the one that later had like rats oh yeah </garnt>
<joey> I don't think the rats were a part of </joey>
<garnt> the initial moving in thing they joined </garnt>
<joey> later they moved in with me they were </joey>
<joey> the other roommates </joey>
<joey> no I didn't I didn't I didn't pre-order </joey>
<joey> those unfortunately uh yeah no I mean </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] I I think that everything I I only </joey>
<joey> ever had like white roommates actually I </joey>
<joey> guess in Swansea there isn't much </joey>
<joey> diversity there was I did have some </joey>
<joey> friends here from like uh from from </joey>
<joey> Chinese schools but most of them did </joey>
<joey> Super students or they just a lot of a </joey>
<joey> lot of foreign students come together </joey>
<joey> right right yeah there's a there's a </joey>
<joey> very like the UK has a lot of foreign </joey>
<joey> students yeah that makes sense </joey>
<connor> um I mean there's a ton of universities </connor>
<joey> I think there's one every city has two </joey>
<joey> yeah you guys have like some of the </joey>
<joey> highest universities yeah yeah yeah and </joey>
<garnt> it's quite a lot of prestigious ones as </garnt>
<joey> well not Swansea </joey>

<connor> yeah but that was before the explosions </connor>
<joey> a while because it's cold so you can </joey>
<connor> kind of just sip on it throughout the </connor>
<joey> day if you if you ever get a big one </joey>
<joey> also if you're a uni student it's a </joey>
<connor> great Sugar Rush yeah concentrated I </connor>
<joey> guess everyone everyone after a while </joey>
<garnt> was like in Japan at least we're like </garnt>
<joey> all right back to Starbucks now yeah </joey>
<garnt> back to Starbucks to the way life should </garnt>
<garnt> have been I just I just I saw nothing </garnt>
<joey> with just iced tea or iced coffee I </joey>
<garnt> don't know maybe to me it was like but </garnt>
<connor> it's not fun there's no there's no </connor>
<joey> personality I'm a hot boy I like I like </joey>
<connor> my drinks hot I don't really like cold </connor>
<joey> drinks that much that hot Boba too </joey>
<joey> though right I think hot boy bridge is </joey>
<joey> not it's not the same yeah I think they </joey>
<joey> do but it's not it's not as good I </joey>
<joey> believe you can order it with like no </joey>
<joey> ice sometimes you know when you can </joey>
<joey> customize lukewarm though that's </joey>
<joey> lukewarm it's like this </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> I don't know I don't know what Maniac </joey>
<garnt> would order warm Boba but it was an </garnt>
<garnt> option in some of the Bible stores I've </garnt>
<garnt> been to it was like a specialty I'd be </garnt>
<joey> like okay if you say so is that was that </joey>
<garnt> a secret menu did you have to wait a </garnt>
<joey> secret menu did you have to speak </joey>
<joey> Chinese together it's like I'm a Chinese </joey>
<joey> friendship </joey>
<garnt> it's like oh so you know your [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know like I I don't know power </garnt>
<garnt> wire exploded but I remember it just </garnt>
<garnt> like not just in Japan but just pretty </garnt>
<garnt> much everywhere in the UK everywhere in </garnt>
<joey> Thailand you just couldn't get away from </joey>
<joey> it like even in the states it was just </joey>
<garnt> like fashionable I think this is a </garnt>
<garnt> fashionable drink yeah I guess so and I </garnt>
<garnt> think it's instagramable </garnt>
<garnt> you know let's be honest 2014 was just </garnt>
<garnt> uh was although like the Frappuccino </garnt>
<garnt> that's what it was yeah that was the </garnt>
<connor> thing everyone just wants a photogenic </connor>
<joey> drink and Boba looked photogenic but I </joey>
<joey> feel Japan took that like the </joey>
<joey> photogenicness of boba and just like was </joey>
<joey> trying to stretch it out to such a high </joey>
<connor> degree where it was just so unnecessary </connor>
<connor> it's like everything in Japan though </connor>
<garnt> everything is about taking photos like </garnt>
<garnt> afternoon tea I love my afternoon tea </garnt>
<garnt> it's much worse thing I've ever said I </garnt>
<connor> really really enjoy going for tea and </connor>
<joey> having crumpets or scones that is like a </joey>
<joey> weirdly popular subculture in Japan </joey>
<joey> isn't it it is but everywhere I've been </joey>
<joey> just does it really badly really they </joey>
<joey> they okay I mean not badly oh it's hard </joey>
<joey> to say not as good like I to me </joey>
<joey> afternoon is just as much about like the </joey>
<garnt> food you get as it is the tea yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> right and the food isn't great it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> the food here looks so aesthetic but it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't taste good yeah yeah that's </garnt>
<garnt> literally all they do is they make they </garnt>
<connor> arrange it and they get these like </connor>
<connor> beautiful colored things and then you </connor>
<connor> take one bite of the quiche you're like </connor>
<garnt> why does it taste bad yes I actually </garnt>
<garnt> agree so that this is like afternoon tea </garnt>
<garnt> is one thing that England does the best </garnt>
<garnt> that I've had so far because the the </garnt>
<garnt> afternoon tea food is actually good </garnt>
<garnt> whereas in Japan every time I've had </garnt>
<garnt> afternoon tea it just looks pretty also </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's got to be layered right yeah </connor>
<connor> so like the layers are to distinguish </connor>
<connor> the types of flavors bottom is for </connor>
<garnt> sandwiches then maybe you get like the </garnt>
<garnt> the quiches or the more like Savory kind </garnt>
<garnt> of uh like kind of the dishes it's </garnt>
<garnt> always sandwiched pastries yeah and so </garnt>
<garnt> so it's like Savory sweet Savory and </garnt>
<garnt> then sweet yeah but it's right it's </garnt>
<garnt> sweet sweet Savory and also sweets but </garnt>
<connor> it's like it's ridiculous it's like this </connor>
<connor> isn't because normally afternoon tea you </connor>
<connor> kind of have it at like and we have it </connor>
<connor> in the afternoon yeah but you know if </connor>
<garnt> it's a good place you can all we like </garnt>
<garnt> skip lunch or dinner with it because </garnt>
<joey> it's pretty hot like it's quite a lot </joey>
<garnt> yeah some places even refill yeah in the </garnt>
<garnt> UK they refill the sandwiches or stuff </garnt>
<garnt> in some places so you can just light you </garnt>
<garnt> can Chow Down dude yeah if you like the </garnt>
<garnt> sandwiches or you like the whatever </garnt>
<connor> they're offering dude it's good it's so </connor>
<garnt> you get money's worth yeah expensive </garnt>
<connor> though in London it's very expensive </connor>
<connor> yeah I bet it's good it's really good </connor>
<joey> but it's an experience you're paying for </joey>
<garnt> right yeah yeah yeah yeah one thing I've </garnt>
<garnt> only seen really in Asia as well going </garnt>
<garnt> off like the Boba thing before like I </garnt>
<connor> guess the baby crazy thing I've ever </connor>
<garnt> mentioned by the way I just realized </garnt>
<connor> privilege maybe like the tea isn't good </connor>
<garnt> enough it's disgusting no sandwiches I </garnt>
<connor> mean I mean it's one thing I feel like </connor>
<connor> Britain does well so I I think it's a </connor>
<connor> good it's no correct </connor>
<joey> but yeah like uh dessert dessert cafes </joey>
<joey> that's that's one thing like I only saw </joey>
<joey> in Asia oh yeah and I don't I don't know </joey>
<joey> if there is more dessert cafes </joey>
<joey> dessert buffets what's that it's it's </joey>
<joey> like it's literally exactly that think </joey>
<garnt> of a buffet but it's all desserts yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because whenever I'd hang out with my uh </garnt>
<garnt> like some of my friends in Thailand </garnt>
<garnt> they'd be like oh let's go to this </garnt>
<garnt> dessert cafe I'm just like wait like to </garnt>
<garnt> me growing up in England dessert was </garnt>
<joey> something you have at the end of a meal </joey>
<garnt> at a restaurant right you don't go to a </garnt>
<joey> specific place to to eat dessert right </joey>
<joey> that was that concept was just alien to </joey>
<joey> me yeah and like I to me it still feels </joey>
<garnt> weird right because I would like if I </garnt>
<garnt> want dessert after a meal I would order </garnt>
<garnt> it at the restaurant yeah but like you </garnt>
<garnt> go to a dessert cafe and it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like half a meal you know you know you </garnt>
<garnt> know because like you never you never go </garnt>
<joey> to a dessert cafe after you finish </joey>
<joey> eating at a restaurant yeah but you go </joey>
<joey> to a dessert cafe at like really weird </joey>
<joey> times the other day and yeah yeah three </joey>
<garnt> or something yeah I go to a dessert cafe </garnt>
<joey> I have to dessert and then it just [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> with my eating schedule because then I </joey>
<garnt> just don't want dinner yeah but it also </garnt>
<joey> doesn't fill me up as well it's it's </joey>
<garnt> really weird so you get hungry at like 9 </garnt>
<garnt> p.m yeah it's like a really weird time </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like oh it's kind of too late </garnt>
<joey> to eat food yeah right but I'm I know I </joey>
<joey> won't be able to sleep because I'm gonna </joey>
<connor> get hungry yeah yeah no I get that yeah </connor>
<joey> I don't I don't want it I don't know I </joey>
<joey> just don't feel satisfied if I've eaten </joey>
<joey> a lot of something sweet but yeah when I </joey>
<connor> eat like a Savory meal yeah I just feel </connor>
<joey> like happy I just feel sick if I eat too </joey>
<connor> much sweet stuff now yeah yeah I was </connor>
<connor> always like that though like I could </connor>
<connor> never eat too I like sweets but like I </connor>
<garnt> could never eat too much of it because </garnt>
<garnt> then I just get I'd be filled up but </garnt>
<garnt> then that feeling of being filled up by </garnt>
<garnt> sweet [ __ ] it just made me feel really </garnt>
<garnt> ill which just made me want to eat </garnt>
<connor> regular food anyway man I I said this uh </connor>
<joey> like a year or two ago but man I I still </joey>
<joey> don't like themed cafes in Japan they're </joey>
<joey> like collaboration cafes the food </joey>
<joey> because of the food the food and drink </joey>
<joey> is like a jerk it looks good that's the </joey>
<joey> thing is that I hate the fact that we're </joey>
<garnt> turning like food impractical we're like </garnt>
<garnt> we're we're like okay well we put a </garnt>
<garnt> little uh I went to the Square Enix one </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah and then they made me a latte </garnt>
<joey> and I was like this latte tastes really </joey>
<garnt> bad yeah yeah but they put a slime on it </garnt>
<joey> so I guess now it's worth nine dollars </joey>
<joey> yeah and I'm like what uh there's only </joey>
<joey> been I've been to so many themed cafes </joey>
<garnt> because akilov's going to them </garnt>
<joey> um like because she makes content out of </joey>
<garnt> it so it's understandable but uh I think </garnt>
<garnt> the only good one where I would actually </garnt>
<joey> go back for the food is the Kirby Cafe </joey>
<joey> and I know it's good because no no I </joey>
<joey> know it's good because the biggest Kirby </joey>
<garnt> facts </garnt>
<joey> Cafe has the best food it does water </joey>
<garnt> what a coincidence it legitimately does </garnt>
<joey> and I know I'm not the only one who </joey>
<joey> thinks that because it was a temporary </joey>
<joey> thing at uh [ __ ] Tokyo Skytree but </joey>
<joey> now they made it made it a permanent </joey>
<joey> thing so you know if a themed Cafe turns </joey>
<garnt> permanent that that's how you know that </garnt>
<garnt> the food is good because if the food </garnt>
<garnt> sucks then people don't come back it's </garnt>
<garnt> like a novelty to it that's really </garnt>
<garnt> short-lived and once you've like </garnt>
<garnt> experienced all the food and you've </garnt>
<garnt> experienced that themed cafes like you </garnt>
<garnt> know style and everything and you've got </garnt>
<garnt> grabbed all the [ __ ] merch you can </garnt>
<joey> because there's always a merch shop </joey>
<joey> attached to it as well then you're not </joey>
<connor> gonna go back I don't know because to me </connor>
<connor> it's like the food itself is is the art </connor>
<connor> yeah don't draw all over my state don't </connor>
<connor> reassemble the carrots to look like a </connor>
<joey> smiley face but I think that's why I </joey>
<joey> like the Kirby Cafe because the Kirby </joey>
<joey> Cafe they don't [ __ ] around with the </joey>
<connor> food they [ __ ] around with the cutlery </connor>
<connor> so like the plates are like certainly </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] like shaped in certain ways or like </garnt>
<connor> the cups are shaped in certain ways but </connor>
<joey> the actual food itself is normal once </joey>
<connor> you once you put it on a regular plate I </connor>
<connor> don't know if I'm like a scrooge or </connor>
<connor> something just don't enjoy fun or </connor>
<garnt> whatever but like I just don't want </garnt>
<connor> people like making faces or [ __ ] out </connor>
<garnt> with my food I don't want my food to be </garnt>
<garnt> like a toy I get I I I'm I'm exactly the </garnt>
<garnt> same way where if I go to a themed </garnt>
<garnt> something of like something I'm a fan of </garnt>
<joey> then I don't want them to [ __ ] around </joey>
<joey> with the food </joey>
<joey> look look I'm I'm here for a good time </joey>
<joey> to enjoy the thing I like I'll buy them </joey>
<garnt> give me like cool much any like cool </garnt>
<garnt> exclusive merch that I can buy in a </garnt>
<connor> better way to get one with the show than </connor>
<garnt> to digest the show I'll do like [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> typical examples when we went to the </joey>
<joey> Bucky exhibit right yeah I saw this </joey>
<joey> poster that was like oh just down the </joey>
<garnt> block there is a the Bucky Cafe like a </garnt>
<garnt> Bucky themed Cafe and my friend and I </garnt>
<garnt> were like because you know I was like </garnt>
<garnt> hitting around you know lunch time like </garnt>
<garnt> early afternoon we were like all right </garnt>
<joey> let's let's go check it out all right </joey>
<garnt> let's go see the menu and I saw the menu </garnt>
<joey> and I was like this is the laziest </joey>
<joey> attempt at a themed Cafe but one of them </joey>
<joey> was like retsukayo's Neapolitan pasta </joey>
<joey> and I'm like what the where does retsu </joey>
<joey> ever eat Napoleon pasta in [ __ ] Bucky </joey>
<garnt> it's like they are really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> stretching it they're like they're </garnt>
<garnt> really stretchy to make it on breathe </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's Mickey Mouse's world famous </connor>
<garnt> lasagna yeah </garnt>
<joey> one of them was like you </joey>
<garnt> it didn't even have uterus face on it it </garnt>
<joey> was literally just a cappuccino nine </joey>
<joey> dollars </joey>
<joey> so themed cafes are meant to in Japan </joey>
<garnt> where they have a dish on the menu </garnt>
<garnt> that's just like you know [ __ ] uh </garnt>
<joey> rin's special Curry from Fate Stay nine </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like when when did this </joey>
<joey> happen how is this on brand why did you </joey>
<joey> just add it you literally just added a </joey>
<garnt> character to a random dish you caught </garnt>
<connor> you call it Brands I find it like </connor>
<garnt> insulting it's like you're you're you're </garnt>
<garnt> insulting my intelligence yeah you're </garnt>
<connor> insulting my fandom yeah yeah I like you </connor>
<connor> think I'm just gonna buy this because </connor>
<connor> you put this character on it I'll take </connor>
<joey> two but </joey>
<joey> but like you like if you if you had put </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] like Neapolitan pasta in </joey>
<joey> front of me I would have been like oh </joey>
<connor> it's just the rail in the Paul's </connor>
<connor> impossible like do you think that if if </connor>
<connor> they were like but it's retires no </connor>
<connor> problem then I'd be like well [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> sign me up then I'm gonna eat the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> out of this like this is why like when </connor>
<connor> you go to like Wolfgang Puck's </connor>
<connor> restaurant he doesn't serve like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> smiley faces on his stage you know I </joey>
<joey> mean like I just don't want I just don't </joey>
<joey> want that like I don't want it it's like </joey>
<connor> the stage it's a really nice restaurant </connor>
<connor> yeah there's initials yeah what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> is this what is this is a horse like </connor>
<connor> we're branding it was it running away </connor>
<connor> like what's going on like this is our </connor>
<connor> state yeah like I I just don't like that </connor>
<connor> yeah to me it's like it's such if a food </connor>
<connor> has done well it itself is so beautiful </connor>
<connor> now pay for it it speaks more but you </connor>
<garnt> know just have the decor of the cafe </garnt>
<connor> have everything else be like just just </connor>
<connor> make it like everything else but the </connor>
<garnt> food have cool Cutlery have a Cool vibe </garnt>
<connor> you know have a have a cool aesthetic </connor>
<garnt> you know make make it feel like you're </garnt>
<connor> right if it's Kirby make it so that the </connor>
<connor> toilet Kirby and I can lift up his face </connor>
<garnt> yeah and I can sit and [ __ ] I think </garnt>
<joey> that's what I appreciated about the </joey>
<joey> Kirby Cafe was that they didn't [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> around with the food they [ __ ] around </connor>
<connor> with the cutlery which you can then buy </connor>
<garnt> at the [ __ ] merch store right so I </garnt>
<connor> was like oh cool this is like a thing I </connor>
<connor> can use in my kitchen and it's like kind </connor>
<joey> of neat and dope and it doesn't have to </joey>
<joey> I don't have to make a [ __ ] curb no </joey>
<connor> I've come to Japan at some point I'm </connor>
<joey> sure there'll be tons yeah please like </joey>
<connor> Kobe Cafe is great um but like it's </connor>
<connor> always a bunch yeah but like you know </connor>
<garnt> for like for me especially if when it's </garnt>
<garnt> like cafes especially that are like </garnt>
<joey> paired with like exhibits or whatever </joey>
<connor> right it's just like just just give me </connor>
<connor> some good merch didn't they have the pen </connor>
<connor> pineapple pen Cafe yeah I went to they </connor>
<garnt> actually yeah I made a video on it yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah you did yeah I made the video was </joey>
<connor> this oh when was pen pineapple maybe </connor>
<joey> like six years ago six years ago and I </joey>
<connor> think it was like 2016. yeah they made </connor>
<connor> uh they made a pop-up of pen pineapple </connor>
<connor> Apple pen I think it was at Tokyo </connor>
<garnt> Skytree or Tokyo Tower whichever one it </garnt>
<garnt> was right uh but yeah you go in and all </garnt>
<garnt> of the menu items spelled out ppap uh </garnt>
<garnt> you know that was it yeah they didn't </garnt>
<garnt> even have any uh like pineapple or apple </garnt>
<joey> based products and I'm like I feel like </joey>
<joey> you really missed the ball it's paprika </joey>
<joey> right it was like a pen pineapple Apple </joey>
<joey> pen burger and I'm like what does this </joey>
<garnt> have to do with pineapple Apple pen with </garnt>
<connor> zero pineapple yeah no pineapple in the </connor>
<connor> burger </connor>
<connor> I don't mind it if it's done well but </connor>
<connor> like even then it's like they couldn't </connor>
<connor> even put the effort to do that and it's </connor>
<connor> like oh the thing I felt the most sorry </connor>
<connor> about was the fact that like I looked at </connor>
<connor> there was like two like clerks who were </connor>
<connor> like standing behind the counter and </connor>
<connor> they looked so dead inside because pen </connor>
<joey> pineapple Apple phone is playing on </joey>
<joey> repeat in the store all day I was there </joey>
<joey> for like a couple of hours and I was </joey>
<joey> like by like minute 20 I was like I want </joey>
<joey> to get the [ __ ] out of here just like </joey>
<joey> just shove a pen in my ears just like </joey>
<joey> blur out the sound they look so dead </joey>
<garnt> well that's that's kind of how I feel </garnt>
<garnt> like all of the truck drivers who drive </garnt>
<joey> around like [ __ ] Harajuku or whatever </joey>
<joey> and they have to drive around promoting </joey>
<garnt> these Idols or whatever </garnt>
<joey> album yeah </joey>
<garnt> we talk about I swear we've mentioned it </garnt>
<garnt> there's these trucks that drive around </garnt>
<connor> Japan where they'll play music yeah </connor>
<joey> really loud yeah or decorative trucks </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah and they're awesome they're </connor>
<joey> awful it's basically just like a moving </joey>
<connor> billboard basically yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> you can't make noise in your own </connor>
<garnt> apartment but anyone can make as much </garnt>
<garnt> noise as they want on the street it's </garnt>
<garnt> really weird yeah right someone can come </garnt>
<garnt> back </garnt>
<joey> potatoes and uh intrude our like streams </joey>
<connor> running for government just scream in </connor>
<joey> public yeah it's just like what what </joey>
<joey> year are we in well you don't don't you </joey>
<joey> have like social media you could promote </joey>
<joey> uh no but no I'm sure you're really </joey>
<connor> connected with the Youth of today by </connor>
<joey> driving around a truck what do they </joey>
<joey> expect for like everyone to come out of </joey>
<connor> their houses it's like guys honey wake </connor>
<connor> up it's up for new politicians in town I </connor>
<connor> mean even if it's old older people right </connor>
<connor> well they're not gonna get up to go </connor>
<connor> outside to listen to you drive by maybe </connor>
<connor> that's why they're loud otherwise </connor>
<connor> they're not gonna like hear it right so </connor>
<garnt> they just like broadcast </garnt>
<garnt> they broadcast all the houses honestly </garnt>
<joey> probably we're going to make it through </joey>
<connor> the hearing aids </connor>
<connor> in an interesting spot where like they </connor>
<garnt> have to uh political people have to try </garnt>
<garnt> and go towards the older generation yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so all the techniques they use seem like </garnt>
<garnt> archaic as [ __ ] yeah it's the only way </garnt>
<garnt> they can get elected because if you're </garnt>
<garnt> not in someone's letterbox they're not </garnt>
<garnt> they're not getting interested isn't it </garnt>
<connor> weird isn't it like they just the whole </connor>
<connor> political system is just catered what I </connor>
<joey> just don't understand though is like </joey>
<joey> yeah I'm sure they're like you know </joey>
<joey> being loud as [ __ ] right on the street </joey>
<joey> so that again as you were saying like it </joey>
<garnt> can reach the old people's ears right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there's a lot of people yeah as old </garnt>
<garnt> age comes naturally you become hard of </garnt>
<garnt> hearing and yet these same old people </garnt>
<garnt> can hear like the tiniest Creek from </garnt>
<garnt> upstairs and be like oh my God that's </garnt>
<joey> too [ __ ] loud how dare they walk so </joey>
<joey> loud in my apartment meanwhile I'm </joey>
<joey> having a really hard time hearing this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] politician on 17 megaphones just </joey>
<joey> drive past my house you know I need them </joey>
<garnt> turn up a little bit louder </garnt>
<garnt> well well I don't know what like are </garnt>
<garnt> there any laws around like how much </garnt>
<garnt> noise you can make in Japan the past 10. </garnt>
<garnt> because it's something like that I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know like I I don't know I feel I feel </garnt>
<garnt> half the time like people just don't </garnt>
<garnt> follow those laws yeah and there's like </garnt>
<garnt> always exceptions to the rule like you </garnt>
<joey> know you could have like a bunch of like </joey>
<joey> like how come you know all these like </joey>
<joey> loud ass bikes that like drive through </joey>
<joey> like neighborhoods and you know not be </joey>

<garnt> I've learned is that you just need to be </garnt>
<garnt> like ignorantly like happy and friendly </garnt>
<garnt> towards them and then they'll start to </garnt>
<garnt> be like oh maybe maybe they're actually </garnt>

<joey> moist </joey>
<joey> oh yeah but uh I I feel like I've been </joey>

<garnt> morning of I don't know what's custom in </garnt>
<joey> in Japanese neighborhood it depends on </joey>
<joey> your area yeah normally it's like I </joey>
<joey> think the morning of yeah but I remember </joey>
<joey> I think we woke I woke up of like </joey>
<joey> slightly late that day yeah so how it </joey>
<joey> worked in my place is that </joey>
<joey> um the garbage is one day and then like </joey>
<joey> the recyclables is the next day yeah um </joey>
<joey> I think that's most I think it's most </joey>
<joey> places yeah yeah so I I thought like I </joey>
<garnt> was just on the cusp of like getting </garnt>
<garnt> like uh getting the recyclables out on </garnt>
<garnt> the right day yeah because it's garbage </garnt>
<garnt> recyclables then garbage again yeah um </garnt>
<garnt> and so I thought I was just on the class </garnt>
<garnt> maybe maybe the garbage truck hadn't </garnt>
<garnt> come yet so I go out to the garbage spot </garnt>
<garnt> and I see like some bags there I was </garnt>
<joey> like oh great I still I still met uh I </joey>
<joey> still made it in time yeah and so I put </joey>
<joey> I put uh the recyclables out went back </joey>
<joey> in my house and just continued about my </joey>
<garnt> day and then I I get I get a ring on my </garnt>
<joey> doorbell oh no I gotta ring my doorbell </joey>
<connor> and I'm just like and I'm just like oh </connor>
<connor> it must be uh it must be a delivery or </connor>

<garnt> felt like some [ __ ] Loan Sharks </garnt>
<garnt> outside my door Brewing being like it'd </garnt>
<joey> be a shame if this would have happened </joey>
<joey> again yeah yeah it's like Repo Man you </joey>
<garnt> do it again we're taking everything they </garnt>
<garnt> are basically like the gangsters that </garnt>
<garnt> run the neighborhood you know I felt </garnt>
<joey> like I just like missed out on the day a </joey>
<joey> lot on like paying the protection money </joey>
<garnt> of the days like Shame Shame what would </garnt>
<joey> happen if America has the Crips and the </joey>
<joey> Bloods we have the grannies </joey>

<garnt> waiting for the day when you're like </garnt>
<garnt> what what's that in the corner well it's </garnt>
<garnt> the wall of cardboard actually one of </garnt>
<garnt> the main attractions of the apartment </garnt>
<connor> and I have so much cardboard in fact </connor>
<connor> that I could probably uh you know house </connor>
<garnt> everyone in the half of Japan yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> mean that's that's the thing where I </garnt>
<garnt> remember when I was moving in I I felt </garnt>
<garnt> like if you missed the day of the </garnt>
<garnt> cardboard collection then you were just </garnt>
<connor> like you were just [ __ ] right yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but also you feel like am I taking </connor>

<connor> have like like a two meter high stack of </connor>
<garnt> cardboard am I am I taking up too much </garnt>
<connor> cold is that allowed am I what's the </connor>
<joey> limit on how much recycling I can </joey>
<joey> recycle I remember the only time I had </joey>
<joey> like a granny experience uh uh when I </joey>
<joey> was moving into my car and place was </joey>
<joey> when when it was like the first week I </joey>
<joey> was moving in and you know it was like </joey>
<joey> the shitload of cardboard thing yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and cardboard day comes around I </joey>
<joey> was like finally here we go this is this </joey>
<garnt> is where the cleansing starts right so I </garnt>
<garnt> take out like way too much cardboard </garnt>
<joey> like probably [ __ ] half the Amazon </joey>
<garnt> rainforest worth of cardboard right </garnt>
<joey> naturally and then uh and then uh that </joey>
<garnt> the next morning I I come out you know </garnt>
<joey> to leave for the office right and a </joey>
<joey> grandma like stops me </joey>
<garnt> and uh she points at the mountain of </garnt>
<connor> cardboard and she's like that's that's </connor>
<connor> all your cardboard right yeah and I was </connor>
<connor> like I mean not all of it but yeah like </connor>
<connor> come on now it's like 90. it's like yeah </connor>
<garnt> like yeah most of it and she's like I </garnt>
<garnt> think uh that you know you're you're </garnt>
<garnt> really causing the the you know rubbish </garnt>
<joey> people a lot of trouble with that much </joey>
<joey> cardboard and then I just reverse UNO </joey>
<joey> card and I'm like I moved in yesterday </joey>
<joey> what's my sunglasses </joey>
<joey> but Logistics was just like oh I'm sorry </joey>
<joey> then yeah I'm sorry about that yeah but </joey>
<garnt> that felt good that was the one time </garnt>
<joey> where I trumped the granny I was like </joey>
<garnt> you don't control it silence silence </garnt>
<joey> woman you can actually um some moving </joey>
<joey> companies like call them up yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah I did that but even they </joey>
<joey> even I had so much cardboard that the </joey>
<joey> moving company could only take so much </joey>
<joey> yeah cardboard yeah because I bought </joey>
<joey> like because I bought because you know I </joey>
<joey> moved into a much bigger place and I </joey>
<garnt> needed to buy all this new furniture to </garnt>
<joey> fill up the space so yeah yeah but it's </joey>
<garnt> not good felt good to reverse you know </garnt>

<garnt> slid this in my letterbox just like the </garnt>
<connor> schedule for the garbage for like the </connor>
<garnt> week and the garbage collection </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like I was just like oh this </garnt>

<joey> oh my God I love it you have this like </joey>
<joey> spreadsheet of like items that very </joey>
<connor> specifically cannot be recycled and </connor>
<joey> stuff I have an app for a dude oh my God </joey>
<joey> yeah like our Ward created an App being </joey>
<joey> like if you put in a certain item it </joey>
<garnt> tells you exactly what day it sucks is </garnt>
<garnt> that there's like some items you're like </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] is this it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> like you know like Styrofoam right yeah </garnt>
<joey> have you had that packaging that's like </joey>
<joey> thin it's like a paper styrofoam yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah like what the [ __ ] is this is this </joey>
<connor> burnable is this paper is this plastic I </connor>
<connor> don't know what this is this is a </connor>
<connor> mystery and every time I ask anyone </connor>
<connor> they're like I have no idea I I think </connor>
<connor> it's burnable but no one's like 100 </connor>
<connor> they're like </connor>
<joey> that's the thing it's like there's all </joey>
<connor> these rules that are laid out that like </connor>
<connor> the grannies will enforce you on but </connor>
<connor> like when you put it all into a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> bag and just didn't put it out I heard I </joey>
<connor> heard I heard that apparently they were </connor>
<connor> cycling even though they they make you </connor>
<connor> shorter very strict actually when it </connor>
<connor> goes to the planet apparently I don't </connor>
<joey> know how true this is that it's not </joey>
<joey> actually like they don't recycle it as </joey>
<joey> well as you think they are yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah I would believe that yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> fair enough yeah </joey>
<joey> um but [ __ ] dude I I one time I went </joey>
<joey> down to my recycling thing in my current </joey>
<joey> place I thought hmm </joey>
<joey> I I was just I was putting out my </joey>
<joey> bottles in the bottle thing I noticed </joey>
<joey> that there was like </joey>
<garnt> plus Bombay Sapphire </garnt>
<garnt> gin bottles right and I was like who who </garnt>
<garnt> has drank this much Bombay Sapphire this </garnt>
<connor> is a lot </connor>
<connor> I was gonna say I thought that was like </connor>
<connor> another person who enjoys Bombay </connor>
<connor> soundtracks and I was like huh I wonder </connor>
<connor> who's bought this much Bombay well I'm </connor>
<joey> gonna keep saying it's very satisfied </joey>
<connor> well it is another British person in </connor>
<connor> your building I was like either </connor>
<connor> somebody's running a bar secretly in </connor>
<joey> their apartment but specializes in </joey>
<garnt> Bombay Sapphire cocktails someone had a </garnt>
<garnt> good night well there's a really </garnt>
<garnt> depressed British person somewhere in </garnt>
<garnt> this apartment building who is really </garnt>
<garnt> really spending a lot of money on gin </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I just thought why would you have </garnt>
<garnt> this many they're all neatly stacked </garnt>
<joey> like almost like a jenga-esque stacking </joey>
<joey> style I'm like this is a prep this is </joey>
<joey> definitely one person who brought I </joey>
<joey> wonder if they collect them for a long </joey>
<joey> time they thought no this is ridiculous </joey>
<joey> I can't collect this many bottles </joey>
<joey> because some people keep their alcohol </joey>
<joey> containers afterwards yeah yeah it's </joey>
<connor> like a memory but yeah I guess when you </connor>
<joey> drink too much you're like yeah okay how </joey>
<joey> many how many Bombay sapphires is too </joey>
<joey> many I just thought I was like this is a </joey>
<joey> lot I'm like yeah what's going on here I </joey>
<joey> wonder I was like what a weird trash do </joey>
<connor> you ever see people's trash and you </connor>
<joey> think what's going on oh yeah yeah get </joey>
<joey> on with that many times I remember the </joey>
<joey> weirdest one I saw was uh it was a </joey>
<joey> vacuum cleaner that had been perfectly </joey>
<joey> cut in half down the middle </joey>
<joey> and I was like </joey>
<connor> what happened someone's like damn man I </connor>
<joey> just wanted to ask you to see what's </joey>
<joey> inside it was like it was like a Dyson </joey>
<joey> it was like the body of a Dyson but it </joey>
<joey> had been perfectly split down the middle </joey>
<joey> but there was only one half and I'm like </joey>
<garnt> where did the other half go serial </garnt>
<garnt> killer yeah just one half it was only </garnt>
<joey> one half and I was I was kind of I was </joey>
<joey> like I feel like five minutes I was kind </joey>
<joey> of like looking around seeing like I </joey>
<joey> wonder where the other half is I </joey>
<garnt> couldn't find it so he's either kept the </garnt>
<garnt> other half or I've witnessed uh some </garnt>
<joey> crucial evidence of a crime scene or </joey>
<garnt> something like I don't I don't know what </garnt>
<joey> specifically it was the weirdest thing </joey>
<joey> at least I was like oh well now I know </joey>
<joey> what's inside of a Dyson </joey>
<garnt> I was like something you see for like a </garnt>
<joey> YouTube channel yeah I know how what </joey>
<joey> happened what's inside of a dice what's </joey>
<garnt> inside of a Dyson but if I cut this </garnt>
<joey> Dyson in I just want to know how they </joey>
<joey> did it they must have like that it's </joey>
<joey> either someone has a laser cutter inside </joey>
<joey> of their house or they just went ham </joey>
<joey> with a saw I don't know either they have </joey>
<joey> a shorn in their house yeah it's </joey>
<joey> somewhere else and then they brought </joey>
<joey> half a dachshund to your apartment </joey>
<connor> building and then they decided that they </connor>
<connor> are done with half a dice they're gonna </connor>
<joey> throw it away it was the weirdest thing </joey>
<garnt> I've ever seen so annoying having to get </garnt>
<garnt> rid of big stuff in Japan it is you buy </garnt>
<garnt> those stupid stickers from the comedian </garnt>
<garnt> and then you can't throw out a a if it's </garnt>
<joey> bigger than I think 30 centimeters in my </joey>
<joey> apartment yeah something like that which </joey>
<joey> is nothing yeah there's so many things </joey>
<joey> that are 30 centimeters or bigger and if </joey>
<joey> you want to throw it away you have to </joey>
<joey> book and it's normally like three weeks </joey>
<joey> away yeah usually it's like a month so </joey>
<joey> normally now I figured out genius Strat </joey>
<connor> which is just break the thing down yeah </connor>
<connor> below 30 seconds oh yeah yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> then you're good yeah yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like uh you know how like in prison </connor>
<connor> movies right when they when they escape </connor>
<joey> from prison that they start dumping the </joey>
<joey> soil one like one by one yeah in the </joey>
<joey> courtyard or something yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> right you gotta you gotta break this </joey>
<connor> wall this cabinet into like small pieces </connor>
<connor> and slowly recycle it every week </connor>
<connor> I remember because like I remember </connor>
<connor> seeing like I would go take the garbage </connor>
<connor> out and one day I'd saw like the bottom </connor>
<connor> offs like the Wheels part and I'm just </connor>
<connor> like why is I'm just getting rid of like </connor>
<garnt> the [ __ ] Wheels part and then next </garnt>
<garnt> week I go go go to put the garbage again </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like the seat then this is and </garnt>
<garnt> then it's the sea eat and I'm like oh </garnt>
<garnt> someone's just playing junk with office </garnt>
<garnt> chairs and then next week hold it's like </garnt>
<connor> the backrest it's slow but it's </connor>
<connor> offensive it's the exact reason why I </connor>
<connor> bought a saw I'm not kidding I bought a </connor>
<connor> sword just to Source [ __ ] oh yeah I </connor>
<joey> don't have to deal with that I had like </joey>
<joey> a lot of wooden [ __ ] and I'm just like </joey>
<joey> I'm not paying to get rid of this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] wooden playing I'm just gonna </joey>
<connor> saw this yeah it's also annoying because </connor>
<joey> you have to you have to measure it </joey>
<garnt> exactly yeah yeah and if it's even a </garnt>
<garnt> little bit off though they won't take it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you need to wait another three </garnt>
<connor> weeks and buy those stupid sticker </connor>
<garnt> things again I don't I had like a </garnt>
<connor> metallic like coat hanger or a coat rack </connor>
<garnt> yeah kind of thing and of course it was </garnt>
<garnt> like way too big even if I took the </garnt>
<joey> parts off so what did I do I I put it </joey>
<joey> back up I put it on my balcony and just </joey>
<joey> let the weather wear it down as much as </joey>
<joey> possible so the point where I could just </joey>
<connor> snap it in here </connor>
<joey> I just want to rust to [ __ ] and then </joey>
<joey> grab the saw or like just snap it in </joey>
<garnt> half to the size I'm like perfect just </garnt>
<garnt> let nature take its course </garnt>
<joey> erosion like three months later I was </joey>
<connor> like all right I can finally see the </connor>
<connor> worst way to recycle something but I </connor>
<connor> have respect I respect the the the </connor>
<joey> effort you'd go to to not deal with the </joey>
<joey> beauty yeah yeah dude it probably would </joey>
<joey> have taken just as long to [ __ ] book </joey>
<connor> a time to throw this [ __ ] coat hanger </connor>
<connor> out I just don't want to deal with it </connor>
<connor> you know I just or I just wait for </connor>
<joey> someone to come over and be like do you </joey>
<connor> want this shitty thing I don't need just </connor>
<connor> take it dude it made me feel like such a </connor>
<connor> bastard for you for using batteries like </connor>
<connor> I just I just want to use some double a </connor>
<connor> batteries yeah and they make it seem </connor>
<connor> like I I was like like using like some </connor>
<connor> kind of radioactive material the way </connor>
<connor> they're gonna get rid of it I'm like </connor>
<garnt> what's wrong with me yeah I don't think </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever like properly gotten rid of my </garnt>
<joey> batteries right because I'm just like </joey>
<joey> okay I'll get rid of them next time the </joey>
<joey> other time um so I have like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> draw just full of like two batteries </joey>
<connor> used dead batteries that I've not been </connor>
<connor> able to get rid of because I've always </connor>
<connor> draw an existence yeah I'm sure we've </connor>
<connor> got a whole draw full of batteries </connor>
<connor> Sydney go and grab a pair none of them </connor>
<connor> are working gone that's all you should </connor>
<joey> do is like a joke just be like just get </joey>
<joey> one like actually working better and put </joey>
<joey> it in that draw and being like there was </joey>
<joey> one way battery </joey>
<connor> I mean I'm getting special I'm gonna get </connor>
<connor> rid of it someday but just like I I just </connor>
<joey> keep </joey>
<joey> getting rid of the batteries </joey>
<joey> there's one working battery you have 15 </joey>
<garnt> minutes </garnt>
<garnt> find the working battery </garnt>
<connor> oh my God yeah I don't really use a lot </connor>
<connor> of batteries but for a lot of the uh </connor>
<garnt> filming stuff that we have yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> basically all for the filming because </garnt>
<connor> that's all for like yeah Mike's camera </connor>
<garnt> accessories it's all batteries it's </garnt>
<garnt> really annoying because you have to get </garnt>
<connor> batteries for that and it kind of sucks </connor>
<connor> I was like get rechargeable ones yeah </connor>
<garnt> but I always forget to recharge yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but then if you get rechargeable </garnt>
<garnt> ones you forget to recharge the before </garnt>
<garnt> the shoots which is yeah and luckily you </garnt>
<garnt> can buy AAA batteries like everywhere </garnt>
<connor> Yeah man so yeah pretty good for that </connor>
<connor> it's pretty good always always done well </connor>
<garnt> anything else you guys been up to this </garnt>

<connor> Just because it felt like it just </connor>
<garnt> wrapped everything up yeah I was like </garnt>
<connor> we're done aren't we yeah also it </connor>
<connor> weirdly seemed like I didn't think it </connor>
<connor> was as popular on the surface did you </connor>
<garnt> watch it made it out to me I watched it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> oh how we never talked about it I don't </joey>
<joey> know I thought I told you I finished it </joey>
<joey> no you no you didn't no I would remember </joey>
<joey> this because it's so rare I would </joey>
<joey> remember if you told me you'd finished </joey>
<garnt> an anime Joey what the [ __ ] I liked it </garnt>
<joey> yeah I liked it it was good but yeah </joey>
<joey> again like I was surprised not only </joey>
<joey> because yeah as as you said like the the </joey>
<joey> Show wrapped up nicely where it was like </joey>
<joey> how are they gonna make a movie out of </joey>
<joey> it but also it's like I don't know I </joey>
<joey> feel all taxi was one of those shows </joey>
<joey> where like it got really popular from </joey>
<joey> Word of Mouth yeah where like is it like </joey>
<joey> I was like did it really get that </joey>
<garnt> popular to Warrant a movie that's what I </garnt>
<garnt> know how popular it got because I </garnt>
<garnt> remember when I made my video on it I </garnt>
<joey> was just like I made it because no one </joey>
<garnt> was talking about it yeah right at all </garnt>
<joey> and uh I thought it was kind of like The </joey>
<connor> Underdogs everyone who watches it I know </connor>
<joey> likes it yeah yeah yeah right sure but </joey>
<joey> that's the thing it's like it's one of </joey>
<joey> those shows where like I feel you start </joey>
<joey> watching it because someone who gave it </joey>
<garnt> a go was like it was really [ __ ] good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I feel like it had a similar Arc to </garnt>
<garnt> uh made in Abyss because when made in </garnt>
<joey> the best came out it just no one was was </joey>
<joey> watching Maiden the best at all because </joey>
<joey> everyone saw the art style and everyone </joey>
<joey> was just like oh this is children </joey>
<joey> children show which uh couldn't be more </joey>
<garnt> further from the truth honestly </garnt>
<connor> um but then like there's a lot of </connor>
<connor> children in the show I mean yeah it is a </connor>
<connor> children's show in some sense yeah </connor>
<connor> that's one for the kids one for the </connor>
<joey> whole family they can relate the </joey>
<joey> children's conversations </joey>
<joey> which is uh </joey>
<garnt> um but yeah I mean like it it kind of </garnt>
<joey> like that was another show that really </joey>
<joey> spread through word of mouth and then it </joey>
<joey> eventually like it won like anime of the </joey>
<joey> year the year it came out yeah uh odd </joey>
<garnt> taxi I feel had a similar thing where it </garnt>
<garnt> didn't really have much promotion or </garnt>
<garnt> anything like that at least not not that </garnt>
<garnt> I could see outside of Japan in Japan it </garnt>
<garnt> actually had some kind of decent </garnt>
<joey> promotion because every time I remember </joey>
<joey> when it was airing every time you go in </joey>
<joey> a taxi they would have an odd taxi </joey>
<joey> advertisement today yeah yeah did you </joey>
<joey> not see no I didn't like they'd always </joey>
<joey> have it like playing </joey>
<joey> um in like you know little TVs that they </joey>
<joey> have on yeah yeah yeah the taxis yeah at </joey>
<garnt> least I did I I saw it I think I didn't </garnt>
<connor> go on enough taxis did we did I talk </connor>
<connor> about Tokyo Avengers I watched that I </connor>
<garnt> think you have not talked about tokens </garnt>
<joey> Maybe not maybe not on episode I was </joey>
<connor> trying to watch all the animes of the </connor>
<garnt> year that were nominated </garnt>
<garnt> um when did you get time to launch anime </garnt>
<connor> I mean an episode here and there it's </connor>
<garnt> very right </garnt>
<garnt> um I was like oh sonny boy looks kind of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] I I didn't yeah you're not gonna </garnt>
<garnt> enjoy something I looked at it and I was </garnt>
<garnt> like oh yeah it's for those anime fans </garnt>
<joey> that think that they're really </joey>
<joey> intelligent and want something deep your </joey>
<joey> IQ wasn't kind of thing </joey>
<connor> I'll tell you you would enjoy sonny boy </connor>
<garnt> I think you would really enjoy sunny boy </garnt>
<connor> what okay you are not listening you're </connor>
<joey> just the first person to say that soon </joey>
<connor> and to me I took one like a sunny boy </connor>
<connor> and I was like oh this is what [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> Reddit anime fans are gonna be like this </connor>
<joey> is the best anime of the Year actually I </joey>
<joey> I I listen to Two soundtrack songs from </joey>
<joey> it and I was like okay if the soundtrack </joey>
<joey> is as good as the actual show I think </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna enjoy this one I just can't I </connor>
<connor> just cannot stand shows where I feel </connor>
<garnt> like people like it just to be </garnt>
<joey> pretentious all right and that's like </joey>
<garnt> one of those shows that like I felt like </garnt>
<connor> the fans make me want to not watch it </connor>
<garnt> and despite it more than the show yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> get that yeah I mean like I </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know if I enjoyed sunnyboy </garnt>
<joey> uh it's it's a really [ __ ] weird show </joey>
<joey> and it left an impression on me whether </joey>
<joey> I enjoyed it or not oh that sounds like </joey>
<connor> something else yeah I I've watched it </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like this is such a jelly </connor>
<joey> show and then like I thought you give it </joey>
<garnt> out of 10. I don't even [ __ ] know </garnt>
<joey> like to me it's still to me or like to </joey>
<connor> me like it's still sinking in it could </connor>
<connor> be like it's it's one of those I mean </connor>
<connor> what does it [ __ ] mean </connor>
<garnt> I got The Perfect Analogy have you </garnt>
<garnt> watched like Donnie Darko yeah what did </garnt>
<garnt> you think of it I like time darker what </garnt>
<connor> did you like about it </connor>
<joey> of course it's been so long exactly </joey>
<joey> I remember I liked it it's been a very </joey>
<connor> long time since I watched Johnny yeah </connor>
<garnt> one of my favorite movies </garnt>
<garnt> okay so it's kind of like can you watch </garnt>
<garnt> it so then I don't feel bad about </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] on it because right now I just </garnt>
<connor> feel like I'm [ __ ] into the void </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like 80 boys yeah it's </connor>
<connor> like 86 when I shoot on 86 I thought oh </connor>
<connor> No One's Gonna contest me on this </connor>
<connor> meanwhile the entire internet </connor>
<connor> but to be fair I watched eight episodes </connor>
<connor> of that and it was boring as [ __ ] excess </connor>
<garnt> 86 is false sunny sunny boy is just 12. </garnt>
<garnt> it's only boys just 12 episodes </garnt>
<connor> um it's like what what actually like </connor>
<connor> because I remember watching the first </connor>
<connor> three episodes of Sunny Boy I thought it </connor>
<garnt> was boring as [ __ ] I thought it was like </garnt>
<garnt> boring as [ __ ] this is like if you this </garnt>
<connor> is like this is like holy [ __ ] I'm gonna </connor>
<connor> be like this is like [ __ ] our house </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pretentious [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> um and then like the soundtrack got </garnt>
<garnt> recommended to me and I'm just like holy </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah this soundtrack just </garnt>
<garnt> like is everything I want it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of soft rock alternative rock in the </garnt>
<garnt> soundtrack yeah if you listen to some </garnt>
<garnt> tracks I'm just like I kind of want to </garnt>
<joey> watch a show just because it's yeah </joey>
<joey> soundtrack I found it because I was </joey>
<garnt> buying a bunch of vinyls and yeah on the </garnt>
<garnt> front page of the store the online store </garnt>
<garnt> that I go to buy my vinyls it just would </garnt>
<joey> not leave the front page and I was like </joey>
<garnt> what is this sunny boy thing so I went </garnt>
<joey> onto YouTube real quick looked up one </joey>
<joey> song and I was like yep sold yeah right </joey>
<garnt> yeah right and that's like the best </garnt>
<joey> thing I could say is like the soundtrack </joey>
<joey> just sets the vibe of the anime okay </joey>
<joey> yeah where it's less about the plot </joey>
<joey> points and it's more about the feeling </joey>
<joey> that it gives you did you end up </joey>
<joey> finishing it oh yeah I did end I'm </joey>
<joey> finishing it </joey>
<joey> um I mean like I I finished it and I </joey>
<joey> didn't know what to think about it but I </joey>
<joey> like I knews like some of the ideas </joey>
<joey> presented in sonny boy it's just kind of </joey>
<joey> like it's one of those shows that you </joey>
<joey> don't know exactly what you think </joey>
<joey> immediately but the like I I just </joey>
<joey> remember some scenes so it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like fully Coley in that sense yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> kind of kind of like fully cool right </joey>
<joey> right where it's just like fully cooly </joey>
<joey> Donny darker that kind of thing where </joey>
<garnt> you watching you're like I don't really </garnt>
<garnt> know what I watched but some parts of it </garnt>
<garnt> just really stick with you and just </garnt>
<connor> refuse to leave right that's how I feel </connor>
<connor> with sonny boy yeah okay do you think it </connor>
<garnt> deserves to be nominated for an anime of </garnt>
<garnt> the year I don't think you deserve to be </garnt>
<connor> nominated for anime of the year didn't </connor>
<connor> it win like the Reddit one though like </connor>
<garnt> the Reddit yeah yeah of course </garnt>
<joey> it won the hot house pretentious one the </joey>
<joey> Reddit it's not not the user not the </joey>
<joey> user the critical oh my God </joey>
<joey> which [ __ ] which doesn't help which does </joey>
<joey> not help its uh image at all yeah the </joey>
<garnt> Reddit armchair critics uh gave it the </garnt>
<garnt> the award for like anime you know I hate </garnt>
<connor> bashing on low-hanging fruit but yeah I </connor>
<garnt> mean there is sometimes normally an </garnt>
<garnt> indication yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean like you know whenever I say </garnt>
<connor> like Donnie dog is one of my favorite </connor>
<joey> movies I'm I'm waiting for it like I'm </joey>
<joey> I'm like dangling the low hanging okay </joey>
<connor> he's normally that guy yeah in our </connor>
<connor> podcast is like the pretentious </connor>
<garnt> did you like it immediately no yeah no I </garnt>
<garnt> I only liked it maybe after like my </garnt>
<garnt> second or third viewing sort of young </garnt>
<garnt> when I watched it yeah yeah exactly yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that was the problem like when I first </garnt>
<garnt> watched it I was like maybe like 13 14 </garnt>
<garnt> years old right and when you was when </garnt>
<garnt> you watch those kinds of movies at 13 14 </garnt>
<garnt> you don't know what the [ __ ] going on </garnt>
<garnt> all you think is oh creepy bunny wow </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but then I watched it again when I </garnt>
<garnt> was like 17 18 which is like the peak of </garnt>
<joey> pretentiousness well when it comes to </joey>
<garnt> consuming media I definitely had that </garnt>
<joey> Facebook yeah do you understand Lonnie </joey>
<joey> Darko only after I watched like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> load of like analysis videos on it right </joey>
<garnt> uh but like I had a I had a friend who </garnt>
<garnt> recommended me Donnie Darko during like </garnt>
<garnt> high school or like Middle School uh who </garnt>
<garnt> was like a massive fan of it so like he </garnt>
<garnt> would tell me like his theories yeah on </garnt>
<garnt> it and we would kind of like bounce off </garnt>
<garnt> ideas and I'm like I found that I think </garnt>
<garnt> that's the reason why I like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> those kinds of media because it's like </garnt>
<garnt> especially when you have another person </garnt>
<garnt> or like a group of people like discuss </garnt>
<garnt> it and like kind of like theorize and </garnt>
<garnt> hypothesize like oh this might be this </garnt>
<garnt> or this might be that whatever right </garnt>
<garnt> like that's kind of fun </garnt>
<garnt> um and then you know once you actually </garnt>
<garnt> like sit down and like read into what </garnt>
<garnt> it's actually about according to the </garnt>
<garnt> Creator or whatever then you just </garnt>
<joey> realize oh it's not as deep as all these </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] pretentious critics made it out </connor>
<connor> to me my favorite thing is when uh </connor>
<connor> people like speculate about media and </connor>
<connor> stuff and then the Creator is like no </connor>
<connor> that's not it and then they're like no </connor>
<connor> no no no I don't think you I don't think </connor>
<garnt> you understand what you did I think it's </garnt>
<garnt> actually this shirt that's literally </garnt>
<connor> it's literally like no no no no no no </connor>
<connor> yeah my theory is right please uh yeah </connor>
<connor> no I mean yeah I I I think there's anime </connor>
<connor> that don't appeal to me as much </connor>
<joey> unfortunately yeah no and I totally </joey>
<garnt> don't blame it no like it doesn't even </garnt>
<garnt> appeal to me it's just like I I had to </garnt>
<garnt> be I have to be like in in a really </garnt>
<garnt> specific mood that comes along once a </garnt>
<garnt> year or once every two years where I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like I just want to watch something </garnt>
<garnt> and just not understand it and make me </garnt>
<connor> feel things I mean the thing I like </connor>
<connor> about this podcast is that the viewers </connor>
<garnt> can like align their who they trust's </garnt>
<garnt> opinion on a show based on what type of </garnt>
<garnt> media they like right right so if you if </garnt>
<garnt> you get if you're like more to me I'm </garnt>
<garnt> like and I'm like I don't like 86 and </garnt>
<joey> I'm like you shouldn't then trust my </joey>
<joey> opinion for other anime right yeah </joey>
<joey> because I I that's like that sheriff </joey>
<garnt> weirdly is like people are obsessed with </garnt>
<joey> it and I just didn't enjoy it and I </joey>
<connor> didn't know anything about the series I </connor>
<garnt> didn't know anyone's talking about it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I just didn't like it yeah but I I </garnt>
<garnt> think it's like I think part of being a </garnt>
<joey> good critic uh at least or like or talk </joey>
<joey> like on the online at least or part of </joey>
<joey> being a good critic is acknowledging </joey>
<joey> that you have taste because people look </joey>
<joey> at like people who talk about media </joey>
<joey> online and they should be like you </joey>
<joey> should be able to judge every single </joey>
<joey> piece of media objectively equally you </joey>
<joey> know you could you should be able to be </joey>
<joey> able to judge them with no bias and I'm </joey>
<joey> just like that's complete [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> like you're not a [ __ ] robot yeah </joey>
<joey> like when I look at you know for example </joey>
<joey> like donkey for example when I look at </joey>
<garnt> one of his video game reviews I know </garnt>
<garnt> exactly what his taste is and that gives </garnt>
<garnt> me a better perspective than a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] IGN reviewers right because at </garnt>
<garnt> least one one donkey like I think </garnt>
<garnt> recently like I saw his review of like </garnt>
<connor> Horizon forbidden West and like he like </connor>
<connor> he didn't like he completely okay he </connor>
<joey> like he's shocked not not completely </joey>
<joey> like compared to some jrpgs yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah but like I I saw his criticisms and </joey>
<joey> I was just like wow that this is like I </joey>
<joey> can completely understand why he feels </joey>
<joey> this way and I could and like but me </joey>
<joey> knowing what kind of gaming games I </joey>
<joey> understand and that gives me a better </joey>
<garnt> perspective of what this game is like </garnt>
<joey> compared to to a lot of other critics </joey>
<joey> yeah I would say like the best critics </joey>
<garnt> online are the ones where you continue </garnt>
<garnt> to keep watching even though you </garnt>
<garnt> disagree with most of their opinions </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just because like they because </garnt>
<garnt> their opinion holds like even though you </garnt>
<garnt> don't agree with it they explain it and </garnt>
<garnt> they're articulate enough and they're </garnt>
<garnt> honest enough with what they like and </garnt>
<garnt> the fact that you know there's no way to </garnt>
<joey> completely get rid of bias with anything </joey>
<joey> and and they own that and you're like </joey>
<joey> well you know I I knew before coming </joey>
<joey> into this review that you are probably </joey>
<joey> going to think a certain way about it </joey>
<joey> and I might not agree with it but I </joey>
<joey> respect the fact that you can still </joey>
<garnt> stick to this yeah because it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like probably everything I like in a </garnt>
<joey> game Conor's gonna complain about </joey>
<joey> exactly it's just like I you know and </joey>
<joey> vice versa probably yeah yeah and and </joey>
<joey> vice versa you know but that just comes </joey>
<joey> with our taste and games yeah and that's </joey>
<garnt> fine it's the same could be said about </garnt>
<connor> anime and stuff yeah I think I cut you </connor>
<garnt> off there no no no no no no I didn't </garnt>
<joey> want to know what I was gonna even gonna </joey>
<garnt> say yeah yeah I took Avengers is okay I </garnt>
<joey> really like the first half and then it </joey>
<joey> got really [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and now he's going to have Tokyo </joey>
<garnt> Avengers fans on his throat tiger </garnt>
<garnt> Avengers was like I saw the first four </garnt>
<garnt> episodes and I'm just like this is a </garnt>
<garnt> read the Manga show like I definitely </garnt>
<garnt> felt that you know what I mean like like </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a fight at the end have you </garnt>
<garnt> watched all of any anyone watched all of </garnt>
<joey> it here I I watched the first like two </joey>
<joey> episodes there's um there's a fight that </joey>
<garnt> goes on for like nine or [ __ ] nine or </garnt>
<garnt> eight episodes at the end and it is like </garnt>
<joey> the dumbest fight I've ever seen in my </joey>
<joey> life that sounds like some eyes and [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> dude it's like it's like it's like just </connor>
<connor> constantly it is literally the fight of </connor>
<connor> weight there's more yeah like something </connor>
<connor> happens wait there's more yeah wait </connor>
<garnt> there's more and it's like this is </garnt>
<connor> stupid just just [ __ ] resolve it this </connor>
<connor> is ridiculous this isn't Dragon Ball </connor>
<joey> fight story has been somewhat concise </joey>
<joey> yeah they drag on a little bit here and </joey>
<joey> there yeah they have had some long </joey>
<joey> fights but never more than four or five </joey>
<joey> episodes I think it was just it just </joey>
<connor> felt like this last fight in particular </connor>
<connor> just took the absolute piss yeah so the </connor>
<connor> point where I was like this is just </connor>
<connor> stupid yeah and yeah I had a good </connor>
<connor> Cliffhanger but like the the last I was </connor>
<connor> so bored for like four episodes but it </connor>
<joey> doesn't matter man all the characters </joey>
<joey> are hot as [ __ ] but like according to </joey>
<connor> the fan base one of these characters and </connor>
<connor> like yeah I like some of the characters </connor>
<connor> in the show but my God there's so many </connor>
<connor> of them insufferable and like I I just </connor>
<connor> oh God I mean I like the show I thought </connor>
<connor> it was good but [ __ ] man I felt like </connor>
<garnt> just it like they like blew its load and </garnt>
<garnt> then it just like is it even over is it </garnt>
<garnt> even over no it's not over it's not and </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like where they left it was </garnt>
<connor> pretty good and it might it might pick </connor>
<connor> up but like it just felt like every </connor>
<connor> single time something happened it was </connor>
<connor> like oh my God there's more oh my God </connor>
<joey> there's more I don't know like I know </joey>
<joey> this is gonna sound really unfair and </joey>
<joey> this is totally my bias but like I I </joey>
<joey> think I only managed to make it through </joey>
<garnt> like the first two or three episodes </garnt>
<garnt> because I immediately saw what kind of </garnt>
<garnt> theming they were going for with the </garnt>
<garnt> story you know like just like a bunch of </garnt>
<joey> dudes just like you know fighting you </joey>
<joey> know you know it's weird as well good </joey>
<connor> stuff but in my I I hate the fact that </connor>
<joey> the moment I knew where the story was </joey>
<joey> heading in my head I was immediately </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> I'd just rather read Bucky to be honest </joey>
<joey> I was kind of pissed off as well that </joey>
<joey> like all of these kids are like 13 14. </joey>
<connor> yeah I was like why not why just just </connor>
<joey> make them 17. it would make this story </joey>
<joey> so much </joey>
<joey> makes so much more sense but here's the </joey>
<joey> thing isn't it weird that you felt that </joey>
<joey> about that show and yet you see hanaya </joey>
<joey> mccolder who's 14 years old you're like </joey>
<joey> perfectly understandable have a nice day </joey>
<connor> because it makes it for some reason it </connor>
<joey> like it checks out like I'm like </joey>
<connor> I don't doubt it right because backy </connor>
<joey> never asks me once to like actually </joey>
<joey> believe this world is a real world yeah </joey>
<joey> it just completely is like listen bro </joey>
<garnt> this is literally like the the </garnt>
<garnt> equivalent of an Internet Forum like </garnt>
<garnt> debate where like can Goku beat saitama </garnt>
<connor> like that is like it never once asks you </connor>
<joey> to be invested in this world that's true </joey>
<joey> whereas like Tokyo Revengers for me felt </joey>
<joey> like it was trying to it was trying to </joey>
<joey> get me to get invested in the gangs and </joey>
<joey> the culture and stuff but at the same </joey>
<joey> time how are you gonna make me believe </joey>
<garnt> that this is how 13 year old and 14 year </garnt>
<garnt> olds react that they like that they </garnt>
<garnt> drive by motorcycles they do all this </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] and it's like they're willing to </connor>
<joey> like Rob and kill each other listen if </joey>
<connor> you made these kids 18 they can still be </connor>
<joey> in school yeah although this would still </joey>
<connor> make sense yeah and it's like just just </connor>
<garnt> do that wow that's like that's like </garnt>
<connor> basically 90 of anime where it's like </connor>
<garnt> they don't need to be that age because </garnt>
<garnt> nobody actually their age actually acts </garnt>
<connor> like them this is one where I actually </connor>
<joey> felt like it was to a massive detriment </joey>
<joey> that they were like super young and this </joey>
<joey> every single plots </joey>
<joey> not so unbelievable but like it made it </joey>
<garnt> so to the fact that you're like it's </garnt>
<garnt> constantly asking you to just have this </garnt>
<garnt> level of disbelief right yeah to give it </garnt>
<garnt> like okay I guess this is how 14 year </garnt>
<garnt> olds would react and respond to this </garnt>
<garnt> situation and it's like just just add on </garnt>
<connor> four years they're still in school this </connor>
<connor> can work in college it all still works </connor>
<joey> the universe totally works it can work </joey>
<joey> if when you're an adult as well yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah and now they can ride motorcycles </garnt>
<garnt> no question about it this is in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> yeah no one is breaking the law injury </garnt>
<garnt> people don't even like they they the </garnt>
<garnt> only law they break is stealing </garnt>
<garnt> umbrellas that's literally it that's all </garnt>
<garnt> they do they don't do it that's what </garnt>
<garnt> they do yeah no one is gonna how the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] are they gonna get </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like when I like the last time I </garnt>
<garnt> felt that like when when I felt like the </garnt>
<connor> characters just weren't acting their age </connor>
<joey> at all uh was when I watched a race </joey>
<joey> was just like man these five year olds </joey>
<joey> how old were they like they're like nine </joey>
<garnt> they're like nine year olds acting like </garnt>
<connor> you're like three they're like yeah </connor>
<connor> she's in the forms of Relativity and </connor>
<garnt> quantum mechanics we can actually </garnt>
<garnt> predict when we were really </garnt>
<joey> they were like more capable than like </joey>
<joey> like like veteran detectives in the </joey>
<joey> force and all this [ __ ] and I'm just </joey>
<garnt> like bruh these are like nine year olds </garnt>
<joey> and they're acting like that's what it </joey>
<joey> does that's why I just couldn't get into </joey>
<joey> a race this is the exact same thing </joey>
<joey> where I'm like this nine-year-old like </joey>
<garnt> girl is like solving Mysteries that like </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] 30-year veterans </joey>
<connor> I know we've ranted about this before </connor>
<joey> yeah and that we've we've you know we've </joey>
<joey> talked all about the age and stuff and I </joey>
<joey> do understand that like a lot of shows I </joey>
<joey> don't give a [ __ ] like it's totally fine </joey>
<joey> it's fiction whatever it doesn't matter </joey>
<joey> yeah but like again there are some </joey>
<joey> shares like a race where I feel like </joey>
<joey> doing this is just completely to the </joey>
<connor> detriment of the show and it makes you </connor>
<connor> send suspend belief Beyond Reasonable </connor>
<garnt> Doubt yeah I don't know there's a lot of </garnt>
<connor> one of the shows where I'm like this is </connor>
<garnt> just stupid I mean like there's also </garnt>
<garnt> like your line April as well where a big </garnt>
<garnt> thing that took me out of the show is </garnt>
<garnt> like I feel like they're in middle </garnt>
<garnt> school or something right I think </garnt>
<joey> they're 14 yeah 15. but like everyone </joey>
<garnt> talks like a [ __ ] poet you know you </garnt>
<joey> know everyone everything the writing </joey>
<garnt> needs to match the Apes </garnt>
<joey> I don't give a [ __ ] if you put them in </joey>
<joey> the school yeah you've got to write 13 </joey>
<joey> year olds like 13 year olds so Corsair </joey>
<garnt> was talking like [ __ ] Mozart was back </garnt>
<garnt> then you know and it's like dude you </garnt>
<garnt> should be you're 15 when I was 15 all I </garnt>
<connor> was thinking about was poo poo peepee </connor>
<joey> like that's all I think about that </joey>
<joey> that's all I think about now you know </joey>
<joey> it's like you are you you always way </joey>
<joey> more sophisticated than you should be </joey>
<garnt> for a 15. like this this guy like came </garnt>
<garnt> out the womb speaking in sonnets and all </garnt>
<joey> this [ __ ] like he was studying </joey>
<joey> Shakespeare by the age of three like </joey>
<joey> Michael like my my God like that that </joey>
<joey> took me out so much and uh it was a </joey>
<joey> small thing but it was just like you </joey>
<joey> could have easily made them at a higher </joey>
<garnt> age to make them feel like they were you </garnt>
<garnt> know they had the ability to speak like </garnt>
<garnt> this but it was just they were 14 years </garnt>
<connor> old and yeah that was that was the </connor>
<connor> biggest thing that uh just it's annoying </connor>
<connor> so sometimes it shows where like they </connor>
<connor> write the characters like 17 year olds </connor>
<connor> they act and talk like 17 year olds they </connor>
<connor> they behave like 17 year olds why not </connor>
<joey> just make them [ __ ] 17. that's that's </joey>
<joey> why I think to this day the most perfect </joey>
<joey> example of like a perfectly aged uh and </joey>
<joey> you know a character's acting age </joey>
<joey> appropriate in a super realistic way was </joey>
<joey> golden time because it was like they </joey>
<joey> were in college and yet they were super </joey>
<joey> immature like most college students yeah </joey>
<joey> you know like that's that's a realistic </joey>
<joey> character that's why I love golden yeah </joey>
<joey> and that's why that show was so good and </joey>
<joey> it was so immersive because it's like </joey>
<joey> yeah I I know people who are like this </joey>
<connor> you're such a breath of fresh air to </connor>
<joey> have say in college yeah yeah but they </joey>
<joey> were acting more like high school </joey>
<joey> students than most high school students </joey>
<joey> were you know in other shows and it's </joey>
<garnt> like that's so [ __ ] ironic yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> that's what I feel like that's why to me </garnt>
<joey> even now golden times like one of my </joey>
<garnt> favorite romances in all of anime just </garnt>
<joey> just because it actually felt like these </joey>
<garnt> were believable characters set in the </garnt>
<garnt> world that felt like it was based in </garnt>
<joey> reality yeah not in this anime world </joey>
<joey> where 15 year olds 15 year olds are </joey>
<joey> doing quantum physics 15 year olds are </joey>
<garnt> doing quantum physics </garnt>
<garnt> um like [ __ ] I mean you look at </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] like Naruto and Sasuke like they </garnt>
<connor> Hunter Hunter was another one where I </connor>
<connor> felt like they got the characters ages </connor>
<garnt> like actually reflected their </garnt>
<garnt> personality you know yeah like gone was </garnt>
<connor> an idiot </connor>
<garnt> like he he would like be convinced to do </garnt>
<connor> stuff by strangers like a child like a </connor>
<connor> 13 year old unfortunately no no one over </connor>
<joey> the age of 18 is hanging out with hisoka </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean let's be honest for </joey>
<connor> good reasons </connor>
<connor> everyone's like oh he's talking to me </connor>
<connor> okay I'll talk back you know I mean like </connor>
<connor> I I appreciate it when shows like </connor>
<joey> actually treat the characters like they </joey>
<garnt> right yeah pissed me off because like a </garnt>
<joey> lot of people like for example Naruto </joey>
<joey> like a lot of people forget that like in </joey>
<joey> the OG Naruto they're like he's like 10. </joey>
<joey> they're 11 and 12 years old yeah and and </joey>
<joey> like you you look at some of the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> they go through like Sasuke's like </joey>
<garnt> trying to Revenge his entire [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> plan at the age of 11 11. he's he he's </garnt>
<garnt> right he's doing that right this man's </garnt>
<joey> listening to too much my chemicals </joey>
<joey> I'll avenge my [ __ ] Big Mac if </joey>
<joey> someone slaps it out of my hand so I </joey>
<connor> believe that actually I was a very most </connor>
<joey> realistic character </joey>
<joey> no I don't know man I just I just kind </joey>
<joey> of wish that it would it would it would </joey>
<joey> change a little bit and then you know </joey>
<joey> and that was one of the main reasons why </joey>
<garnt> I I was was a bit harsh on Tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> adventures and that's why I got it more </garnt>
<connor> annoyed at it because it felt like it </connor>
<garnt> was just getting stupid right now I mean </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if I'm just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> I've just seen so Adam so much anime </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm just like immune to this [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> but just like it's it's I it's it's very </joey>
<joey> rare that a character his age really </joey>
<joey> comes into like any kind of specific </joey>
<joey> plot point or any bearing on the plot </joey>
<joey> itself because there's no like it's so </joey>
<joey> hard to tell a character's age and Anime </joey>
<garnt> based on just their looks and their </garnt>
<garnt> actions because the range the range of </garnt>
<joey> Anime characters from like 13 to [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> 28 yeah they they all look the same and </garnt>
<joey> they all act the same it's it's almost </joey>
<garnt> like kind of like Japanese people in </garnt>
<connor> real life isn't it maybe that's why </connor>
<joey> right they turn into adults yeah like </joey>
<joey> you look at it like you look at like a </joey>
<joey> Japanese girl and you're like you can be </joey>
<joey> 12 or 30. did you see this one I'm kind </joey>
<connor> of afraid to ask as well for the Tokyo </connor>
<joey> uh Revengers they had to they mean </joey>
<joey> uncensored version </joey>
<garnt> um where because they used a Sim the </garnt>
<joey> temple symbol a lot oh unfortunately uh </joey>
<garnt> he's you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and uh really unfortunate and then </garnt>
<joey> they just that's a sense of that they </joey>
<connor> sent they made a censored version where </connor>
<garnt> they just don't use the symbol in the </garnt>
<connor> title </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah it's weird in some ways I'm </connor>
<connor> like I mean I feel like they didn't need </connor>
<connor> to do that but I also kind of get it why </connor>
<garnt> they wanted to be careful yeah I don't </garnt>
<garnt> know yeah I mean I I can see why they </garnt>
<joey> did that it's uh it's unfortunate but I </joey>
<joey> mean with how international anime is now </joey>
<joey> a lot of people could have taken it the </joey>
<joey> wrong way also maybe a good a good </joey>
<joey> moment to learn about another culture </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> you'd be like what the [ __ ] I'm gonna </joey>
<connor> Google is this okay you know to me when </connor>
<connor> that when I first saw it I was like whoa </connor>
<connor> and then you Google it you're like oh </connor>
<joey> yeah oh okay it's only been assemble </joey>
<joey> it's been around for like a lot longer </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's very important did they censor </garnt>
<garnt> a narrator as well because I remember </garnt>
<garnt> like neji's like Clan symbol that he had </garnt>
<garnt> on his like forehead or something was </garnt>
<garnt> originally based on that I believe I </garnt>
<joey> don't there's a lot of shows that I </joey>
<joey> think use those symbols and yeah because </joey>
<connor> it means like like uh yeah </connor>
<joey> it's yeah it's a Buddhist right it's </joey>
<joey> very unfortunate dichotomy of uh yeah </joey>
<garnt> is that the anime verb what is that the </garnt>
<joey> anime version of the Manga version it </joey>
<joey> was the enemy bit okay so so the manga </joey>
<connor> what was the Manga version of that </connor>
<connor> yeah they made a whole version where </connor>
<connor> they they added it and then a whole </connor>
<connor> nother version where they just went </connor>
<connor> through and got rid of it yeah it's </connor>
<connor> really odd yeah never mind all the </connor>
<joey> violence I feel like if you're just </joey>
<joey> gonna get rid of it just get rid of it </joey>
<joey> yeah I mean it's not gonna be a bit it's </joey>
<connor> not gonna be that big of a deal but </connor>
<joey> actually here's the uncensored one for </joey>
<joey> you cultured interviews out there </joey>
<joey> actually culture in a different in a </joey>
<joey> different religion yeah yeah so like in </joey>
<joey> the manga yeah it was legitimate yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah that's what I thought that's </garnt>
<garnt> what I thought so yeah it was I get it </garnt>
<joey> if you want to avoid the </joey>
<garnt> misunderstanding I get it yeah have the </garnt>
<joey> awkward guys we promise not a Nazi it's </joey>
<joey> the same thing with the Google Maps </joey>
<joey> oh yeah yeah because on Google Maps they </joey>
<connor> use that symbol to mean uh I have that </connor>
<garnt> on mine I'm in English Google Maps oh </garnt>
<garnt> really yeah it's there yeah yeah maybe </garnt>
<joey> in other other languages I'm I swear to </joey>
<connor> God I'm on my on my Google Maps in </connor>
<joey> English I still see the the symbol oh </joey>
<connor> was like what is this on the Google Maps </connor>
<garnt> maybe if you're like not in Japan yeah I </garnt>
<connor> I feel like it's it's on the person who </connor>
<connor> comes to Japan to educate themselves </connor>
<joey> kind of yeah because they're the ones </joey>
<joey> that are going to throw a hissy fit and </joey>
<connor> look like an idiot yeah like I said it's </connor>
<joey> a very unfortunate thing obviously with </joey>
<connor> whom Japan Allied themselves with yeah I </connor>
<connor> can understand why the mistake might be </connor>
<joey> made it's scary how 45 degrees changes </joey>
<joey> everything you know right it's just a </joey>
<joey> slight shift just completely changes </joey>
<joey> the power of angles do you still want uh </joey>
<joey> do you either want peace or you want </joey>
<joey> something that's definitely definitely </joey>
<joey> the opposite of Peace </joey>
<joey> Buddhism </joey>
<joey> Buddhism doesn't actually distinguish </joey>
<joey> between the orientation and like which </joey>
<joey> direction the swastika's facing is </joey>
<joey> technically all of them are mean the </joey>
<joey> same right right right but yeah I mean </joey>
<joey> most people wouldn't know that though </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah you know like obviously when I </joey>
<garnt> saw it I didn't feel like I was like oh </garnt>
<joey> my God this I was just like oh what </joey>
<connor> don't I know yeah clearly I'm missing </connor>
<garnt> yeah I'd like to be educated yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> exactly I felt exactly the same way I </connor>
<joey> was just like that's it's weird seeing </joey>
<connor> that symbol but I'm sure they would not </connor>
<joey> be there's a good reason I'm sure they </joey>
<garnt> wouldn't be putting that symbol if there </garnt>
<connor> wasn't enough for that yeah I'm sure </connor>
<connor> these 13 year old get uh these this gang </connor>
<garnt> is not into that I mean I mean </garnt>
<connor> I I mean I know it's a gang see if only </connor>
<garnt> everyone on the internet thought you </garnt>
<joey> know had rational thinking like that you </joey>
<connor> know and instead it was immediately like </connor>
<joey> oh how dare you we've said it a number </joey>
<joey> of times people aren't willing to give </joey>
<joey> the benefit the doubt people anymore </joey>
<connor> that that's that's gone out the window </connor>
<garnt> in the end of the year 2022 so also they </garnt>
<garnt> forget that different cultures have </garnt>
<garnt> different backgrounds and histories </garnt>
<connor> that's what's strange is that people </connor>
<garnt> really want to give benefit the doubt to </garnt>
<garnt> the country or even hide behind the </garnt>
<garnt> country's flaws uh when it's convenient </garnt>
<joey> for them yeah but when they don't </joey>
<joey> understand something they're like oh </joey>
<joey> well you know what I mean I don't know I </joey>
<garnt> don't know they should have explained it </garnt>
<joey> better anyway keeping on anime I guess I </joey>
<garnt> guess I guess since since I finally get </garnt>
<garnt> to talk about anime come on uh I guess </garnt>
<garnt> uh it's like I didn't actually watch </garnt>
<garnt> much anime this previous season because </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think there was actually much </garnt>
<connor> good things oh God don't say that </connor>
<connor> everyone get angry there's no good anime </connor>
<garnt> I'm 2021 well I think 2026 has been a </garnt>
<garnt> pretty weak year for anime so far but I </garnt>
<garnt> don't like I yes like the only real </garnt>
<garnt> recommendation I would have since you </garnt>
<garnt> were going through like last year uh is </garnt>
<connor> uh ranking of Kings that's literally the </connor>
<connor> last one I've been meaning to watch oh </connor>
<joey> yeah I've done with last year I mean </joey>
<joey> it's it's continuing on to this year so </joey>
<joey> last last year was it I mean it's a 23 </joey>
<joey> episode show so last year we only had </joey>
<connor> like 12 episodes oh I mean I guess I'll </connor>
<connor> just wait then yeah I'll actually wait </connor>
<connor> till it's finished yeah I mean it's </connor>
<connor> almost finished but uh I feel like it's </connor>
<connor> only going to be a part one of the story </connor>
<connor> but yeah ranking Kings is [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> incredible I've heard it's amazing yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> unironically a lot of people like you </connor>
<connor> know Maiden best didn't watch it because </connor>
<garnt> they looked like a children's cartoon no </garnt>
<garnt> I also didn't I didn't I I also didn't </garnt>
<garnt> watch it because it looked like a </garnt>
<garnt> children's cartoon initially but it's </garnt>
<joey> kind of like a it's kind of like the </joey>
<joey> closest thing to like a Ghibli movie I </joey>
<joey> guess in terms of like aesthetic yeah </joey>
<joey> and I I really don't like Ghibli movies </joey>
<joey> but it kind of gave me that kind of you </joey>
<joey> know you know when you're like watching </joey>
<joey> an anime fairy tale that yeah it feels </joey>
<joey> like that's like I I can only point to </joey>
<garnt> Ghibli that gives you that same kind of </garnt>
<garnt> feeling but that's the kind of feeling </garnt>
<garnt> it's giving me </garnt>
<garnt> um but it also is written really really </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] well like it's been a while </garnt>
<garnt> since I've seen just an anime just this </garnt>
<garnt> well written and with characters this </garnt>
<garnt> interesting as well damn </garnt>
<garnt> um it's like it's like to me like the </garnt>
<garnt> spring season no sorry the winter season </garnt>
<garnt> was like basically Attack on Titan and </garnt>
<garnt> demons layer everyone was like talking </garnt>
<garnt> about yeah but like to me ranking of </garnt>
<garnt> Kings is like close to that level of </garnt>
<garnt> quality in my opinion or just like how </garnt>
<joey> good the show is I mean there's also my </joey>
<garnt> dress up darling as well there's also my </garnt>
<garnt> dress up darling but that like that that </garnt>
<joey> occupies a different space in my opinion </joey>
<joey> you know it's a different faction that's </joey>
<garnt> a different faction yeah sure there's </garnt>
<joey> the there's the attack on Titan Demon </joey>
<joey> Slayer like core and then the [ __ ] my </joey>
<joey> drones darling all the way over here </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah which is like </garnt>
<garnt> it was surprising to see like in in </garnt>
<garnt> Japan my ranking of Kings has really </garnt>
<garnt> like shot up in popularity I think I </garnt>
<garnt> think it's like the most watched anime </garnt>
<joey> right now it's because there's a lot of </joey>
<garnt> voice actors who are saying how good it </garnt>
<garnt> is so like they're like they're all like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah this is really fun there's a lot of </garnt>
<joey> power here yeah yeah they do I mean the </joey>
<garnt> top tier celebrities here I mean yeah </garnt>
<garnt> they're just like they're not even just </garnt>
<joey> voice actors here they're just actors </joey>
<garnt> with uh celebrities they're just like </garnt>
<joey> select going to celebrity status as well </joey>
<joey> and that's why they can make uh </joey>
<joey> questionable decisions like hanazawakana </joey>
<garnt> selling nfts you know </garnt>
<joey> which uh I saw that and I was like this </joey>
<connor> has to be a joke and then I watched the </connor>
<joey> video I was like please say psychonicana </joey>
<connor> please and then I saw a lot of people </connor>
<connor> are like no no I'm sure it's just a </connor>
<joey> management I'm sure it's just her </joey>
<joey> management yeah and I'm like yeah but </joey>
<joey> like but she agreed to it yeah someone </joey>
<connor> has to give the go ahead yeah yeah like </connor>
<joey> even if it is like her Management's idea </joey>
<joey> or whatever yeah she might have a </joey>
<connor> management but she's allowed to say no </connor>
<connor> yeah I love that it's like you know no </connor>
<connor> one ever uses that excuse for Western </connor>
<joey> celebrities or anything yeah it's always </joey>
<connor> the Japanese subject also it's like I </connor>
<connor> feel that only implies to like you know </connor>
<connor> kind of low ranking uh Talent right who </connor>
<connor> maybe where the management has a little </connor>
<joey> more power because like we're giving you </joey>
<connor> guys </connor>
<connor> literally top one percent of voice </connor>
<connor> actors like she can she can say no to </connor>
<joey> whatever the [ __ ] she wants she only </joey>
<garnt> knows she said yes to the nft she takes </garnt>
<joey> any role she wants you know she can do </joey>
<joey> any role she wants if she says I want to </joey>
<joey> be in this anime the directors will be </joey>
<connor> scrambling over themselves to be like </connor>
<joey> yes let's get Hannah Khan in this so the </joey>
<connor> whole management thing is just [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> I think there's never been like one of </connor>
<connor> my favorite uh memes is just like I </connor>
<joey> think it's like a Kuma image of just </joey>
<joey> like think and it's like like a like a </joey>
<joey> depressed guy which is like a Japanese </joey>
<joey> thing and it's just like let him </joey>
<garnt> lighting up you know we've seen that </garnt>
<garnt> image </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just this is so true when an </garnt>
<joey> image is more pertinent than uh this the </joey>
<joey> the other version of that that I love is </joey>
<joey> like uh every Instagram post it's like </joey>
<joey> somewhere and it's like really dark and </joey>
<garnt> it's like somewhere Japan </garnt>
<garnt> I mean that's basically just the trash </garnt>
<garnt> taste podcast </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> but no like I remember seeing that post </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just like oh why did it have </garnt>
<joey> to be you why did it happen right it's </joey>
<joey> like if it was like some like DT like </joey>
<joey> you know I voiced like one [ __ ] it's </joey>
<connor> passing by a person selling an NFC I </connor>
<connor> would be like whatever the [ __ ] ever but </connor>
<connor> you're literally one of the most notable </connor>
<garnt> voice actors today I'm just like is this </garnt>
<garnt> how is this how idle fans felt when </garnt>
<garnt> their favorite Idol gets through like a </garnt>
<garnt> controversy or they find out they have </garnt>
<garnt> like a boyfriend or something like I </garnt>
<garnt> think I get it now man like I'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like I felt betrayed you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's like why did it have to be you kind </garnt>
