<joey> and giggles like </joey>
<joey> we're going to be talking about </joey>
<joey> kombini's as it's called in japan </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> japan i feel is the only country where </joey>
<joey> the word convenience </joey>
<joey> in the word convenience store actually </joey>
<garnt> you know means what it means i i think </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of places in asia where </garnt>
<garnt> asia where convenience stores are very </garnt>
<garnt> convenient but definitely as someone </garnt>
<garnt> who's traveled around </garnt>
<garnt> japan's up there it's still different </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> japan's up there some of the best </garnt>
<garnt> convenience stores in the world </garnt>
<connor> absolutely and you've seen all those </connor>
<connor> videos those youtubers with the </connor>
<connor> you know kevin macleod or whatever the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] he's called copyright free music </connor>

<garnt> want to represent our team because i am </garnt>
<joey> team 711 </joey>
<garnt> he is team lawson and he's team family </garnt>
<joey> martial i just think lawson </joey>
<joey> is built different they've just figured </joey>
<joey> it out like family mart okay honestly </joey>
<garnt> like i could </garnt>
<garnt> 7-eleven i respect the choice family </garnt>
<garnt> mart you're actually just like you have </garnt>
<garnt> seriously i i agree family martial </garnt>
<garnt> is the clown pick right here we are we </garnt>
<garnt> are </garnt>
<garnt> global conglomerates we have not just </garnt>
<garnt> taken over japan </garnt>
<joey> we are freaking everywhere in asia and </joey>
<joey> that's why they've been tainted by all </joey>
<garnt> the other countries and i'm going to </garnt>
<garnt> prove </garnt>
<garnt> why today 7-eleven is the biggest my </garnt>
<joey> views there's more than these three </joey>
<joey> convenience stores in japan there's like </joey>
<connor> the smaller ones like mini stop </connor>
<joey> daily yamasaki i think i [ __ ] with daily </joey>
<connor> yamazaki do you </connor>
<connor> i have everyone i know i i think i asked </connor>
<connor> chris i'm like do you like daily </connor>
<joey> yamazaki and chris was like no [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> chris is the whitest man alive what does </joey>
<joey> he know uh he's like me </joey>
<garnt> that's why i can trust his opinion so </garnt>
<joey> finally another one </joey>
<joey> i need another white british man opinion </joey>
<garnt> what is this good no </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] all right whenever i go to like </garnt>
<garnt> daily yamazaki one of the smaller chains </garnt>
<garnt> it's like going to </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] audis or iceland you never know </garnt>
<connor> you never see these convenience stores </connor>
<connor> now if you don't know anything about </connor>
<connor> convenience stores they are pretty much </connor>
<connor> found in every </connor>
<connor> 100 meters yeah literally </connor>
<joey> every every block of land there's at </joey>
<garnt> least one convenience yeah literally </garnt>
<garnt> when you like look into houses to rent </garnt>
<garnt> one of the selling points </garnt>
<garnt> is literally the meters away from the </garnt>
<garnt> nearest convenience store </garnt>
<garnt> when you're looking at listening for </garnt>
<garnt> houses that's that's how much they care </garnt>
<connor> about convenience and if you live in </connor>
<connor> tokyo they'll most </connor>
<joey> hundred percent be like three within </joey>
<joey> your vicinity </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah absolutely um and even when </joey>
<garnt> you go rural areas you're driving around </garnt>
<connor> there'll be nothing and then </connor>
<joey> suddenly there's a corner you'll just </joey>
<garnt> see this perfect immaculate 7-eleven </garnt>
<garnt> just there yeah and </garnt>
<joey> it's great because it's not like a gas </joey>
<joey> station where you're like yeah [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> god i gotta get with those hot dogs that </joey>
<garnt> are probably gonna give me salmonella </garnt>
<joey> yeah i'm probably not gonna like this </joey>
<garnt> it's legit good food so yeah we've </garnt>
<garnt> picked a bunch of items today that we </garnt>
<garnt> all kind of like </garnt>
<connor> yeah uh that we could find because </connor>
<connor> sometimes the items aren't available we </connor>
<garnt> we </garnt>
<garnt> pick the items that we we normally buy </garnt>
<garnt> when we go to our convenience store of </garnt>
<connor> choice </connor>
<connor> and then we got our intern to buy a lot </connor>
<connor> of other random [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> from convenience stores just to show to </connor>
<connor> you guys what comfort zone a little bit </connor>
<connor> yeah going out of our comfort zone </connor>
<garnt> just to show you what is available at </garnt>
<joey> japanese combinations yeah we definitely </joey>
<garnt> haven't tried all the things we're going </garnt>
<garnt> to talk about today so </garnt>
<garnt> kind of a learning experience also if </garnt>
<joey> you're an audio only listener this is </joey>
<joey> just going to be eating asmr </joey>
<garnt> this is very this is going to be the </garnt>
<garnt> closest to the figure episode that we've </garnt>
<garnt> released </garnt>
<garnt> um in a while where if you're an audio </garnt>
<garnt> only listener i apologize </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah shall we just kind of jump </garnt>
<garnt> right into it </garnt>
<connor> now i i think i know what i want to </connor>
<connor> start off with because this is the </connor>
<connor> debate </connor>
<connor> that i think started this i episode idea </connor>
<garnt> which is fried chicken right now i don't </garnt>
<garnt> care about </garnt>
<garnt> how good the rest of the combini food is </garnt>
<garnt> how i judge companies </garnt>
<garnt> is the fried chicken right right okay </garnt>
<garnt> because when i moved to japan you know </garnt>
<garnt> we we've we think that </garnt>
<garnt> a lot a lot of americans you know they </garnt>
<garnt> they would like to </garnt>
<garnt> stand their fried chicken but a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the best fried chicken i've had has come </garnt>
<garnt> from asia </garnt>
<garnt> and combini fruit fried fried chicken is </garnt>
<garnt> way too [ __ ] good it it it should be </garnt>
<garnt> illegal to make fried chicken </garnt>
<joey> taste this good it's like restaurant </joey>
<connor> quality yeah yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> when you go to the combini there'll be </connor>
<connor> hot food sections right where you can </connor>
<joey> get various amounts of hot food but the </joey>
<joey> fried chicken is like the selling point </joey>
<joey> they'll often have a whole section </joey>
<joey> probably the first thing you'll see yeah </joey>
<joey> and it normally comes in as the </joey>
<connor> gentleman will show you it comes in this </connor>
<connor> little pouch like this </connor>
<garnt> right but it does it doesn't come in the </garnt>
<garnt> pouch it comes it's on display on like a </garnt>
<garnt> heater </garnt>
<garnt> but they put it in a pad and then they </garnt>
<garnt> put it in a pouch and what you can do </garnt>
<garnt> is you just rip off half half the pouch </garnt>
<joey> unless you're a lawson </joey>
<joey> and you have to open it from the top </joey>
<connor> left i don't mind that i don't mind </connor>
<connor> squeezing it out this is the lawson </connor>
<connor> fight look at that look at that man is </connor>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> family look convenient okay convenience </garnt>
<garnt> store points down because look how </garnt>
<joey> convenient yeah exactly look at the </joey>
<connor> convenience of this look at that look </connor>
<connor> at that where's the [ __ ] seasoning on </connor>
<joey> that there's nothing on there okay </joey>
<joey> i'd like to just give a huge disclaimer </joey>
<joey> i'm personally not a huge fan </joey>
<joey> i think i'm like one in a million where </joey>
<connor> i almost never buy the fried chicken at </connor>
<connor> convenience stores </connor>
<joey> right because i don't really fried </joey>
<connor> chicken to begin with </connor>
<connor> now this is the the standard just pepper </connor>
<connor> and salt fried chicken but in lawson's </connor>
<connor> you can get like </connor>
<connor> a ton of different variations they have </connor>
<connor> one that is like it's like uh </connor>
<connor> it's like chinese sweet and sour one </connor>
<connor> and it's like black and i don't know why </connor>
<connor> it doesn't look good at all but it's </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing </garnt>
<connor> i i i don't know that just i've i've </connor>
<connor> never tried it but it just </connor>
<connor> it just because it's it's a it's a </connor>
<connor> literal black chicken </connor>
<garnt> and it looks like someone it looks it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's like someone took a chicken and </garnt>
<garnt> just dunked it </garnt>
<garnt> in um squid oil that's what it looks </garnt>
<joey> like what i think we should do is we </joey>
<joey> should cut up three pieces </joey>
<joey> you should trade pieces okay we should </joey>
<joey> we should trade </joey>
<connor> we get like napkins galore by the way </connor>
<garnt> okay i'm gonna i'm gonna take the knife </garnt>
<joey> and then </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna cut up three pieces now here's </joey>
<joey> the thing these chick </joey>
<joey> these chicken right now they're not </joey>
<joey> gonna look at peak condition because we </joey>
<garnt> had to microwave these </garnt>
<garnt> normally they're crispy they're nice and </garnt>
<garnt> crispy fresh </garnt>
<joey> and hot fresh out the oven it's got two </joey>
<joey> pieces so you guys can take it i'll just </joey>
<garnt> take this okay </garnt>
<garnt> fan [ __ ] testing there you go there's </garnt>
<connor> two pieces of you boys and also if </connor>
<connor> you're not really into like a whole </connor>
<connor> breast that's fine because a lot of them </connor>
<connor> also have like the like nuggets </connor>
<joey> like substitute thank you all right here </joey>
<joey> i'm i'm gonna hand these over to you </joey>
<connor> i'm gonna show you the shot all right </connor>
<connor> let's this is like the last supper but </connor>
<joey> family matter </joey>
<connor> we're sharing we're not sharing the </connor>
<connor> bread we're sharing the chicken i'll </connor>
<garnt> show you if you will do me the honor </garnt>
<joey> okay grab one of these i'll try it let's </joey>
<connor> should try the family more chicken first </connor>
<garnt> okay let's let's let's let's let's let's </garnt>
<connor> go bottom </connor>
<connor> let's start with you know what the </connor>
<connor> crispiness that looks good the color </connor>
<connor> looks good i'm down for it that was yeah </connor>
<joey> that's very wet though look at the green </joey>
<garnt> it is </garnt>
<garnt> like the family one has almost left the </garnt>
<connor> puddle </connor>
<connor> it's you this is actually like kind of </connor>
<garnt> i'm gonna eat it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like you look you can tell this is </garnt>
<garnt> family mart chicken </garnt>
<garnt> because it's the oh it's like compared </garnt>
<joey> to the seven chicken this one ain't </joey>
<joey> this one this one can't be white because </joey>
<joey> it's gonna stain the white one </joey>
<garnt> it's gonna go straight it's gonna go </garnt>
<connor> straight through so i'm gonna i'm gonna </connor>
<connor> it is very fatty and very greasy like i </connor>
<joey> feel like there's no breast </joey>
<connor> um you know what i mean it's it's not </connor>
<joey> good </joey>
<joey> obviously if you know i'm in the middle </joey>
<joey> of nowhere i mean i'm in a hokkaido </joey>
<connor> i want a beer and a fried chicken it's </connor>
<connor> going to do the job </connor>
<connor> but when there's lawsons and and you </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> again i will happily take this over </joey>
<garnt> fried chicken to begin with yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay my problem with family mart fried </garnt>
<garnt> chicken is that </garnt>
<garnt> it tastes like death you know sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> when you're eating and you realize </garnt>
<garnt> wait a minute i'm eating a dead animal </garnt>
<garnt> right now that is what family mart </garnt>
<joey> chicken tastes like </joey>
<garnt> it feels like they inject it with stuff </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like that's a yeah let's try a </garnt>
<joey> 7-eleven one there shall we okay </joey>
<joey> okay this is this which one's the </joey>
<garnt> 7-eleven uh it'll be this one this color </garnt>
<joey> there's this </joey>
<connor> slightly orange one yeah now it's pretty </connor>
<connor> good </connor>
<garnt> the reason the reason i stand 7-eleven </garnt>
<garnt> and the reason </garnt>
<garnt> it's my favorite one it's close to that </garnt>
<joey> fried chicken this one's also quite </joey>
<garnt> fatty though it's fatty enough where </garnt>
<garnt> it's less than the family art chicken </garnt>
<garnt> it's the perfect amount you know you </garnt>
<garnt> know when you </garnt>
<garnt> you know when you want a beer and you </garnt>
<garnt> just want to eat something healthy this </garnt>
<garnt> is the perfect amount of oil </garnt>
<garnt> and unhealthiness that doesn't make you </garnt>
<garnt> feel like you're eating death it it </garnt>
<garnt> still makes you feel like you're eating </garnt>
<garnt> like something that you shouldn't be </garnt>
<joey> enjoying every day </joey>
<joey> it's it's a bit of a it's i have to say </joey>
<joey> i think in terms of the seasoning they </joey>
<garnt> season the </garnt>
<garnt> out of all of them this like with </garnt>
<garnt> lawson's they have </garnt>
<garnt> way more choice in the chicken seasoning </garnt>
<garnt> like there's like the spicy i i do think </garnt>
<garnt> this is gonna be the weakest one out of </garnt>
<garnt> like that the choices that lawsons have </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not trying to like you know about </garnt>
<garnt> myself in the corner but like </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just saying like out of everything </garnt>
<garnt> 7-eleven just just </garnt>
<connor> just does the basic fried chicken the </connor>
<connor> best has the best seasoning doesn't it </connor>
<connor> doesn't need anything fancy no spicy </connor>
<connor> chicken </connor>
<connor> it's just pure here's what fried chicken </connor>
<garnt> should taste like </garnt>
<garnt> salt and pepper seasoned perfectly the </garnt>
<garnt> right amount of oil </garnt>
<garnt> it is the best fried chicken yeah let's </garnt>
<joey> try this lawson one because i've </joey>
<joey> realized immediately that </joey>
<joey> in terms of the thickness of chicken </joey>
<joey> this is probably the thickest it's a </joey>
<joey> thick </joey>
<joey> yeah this is like you're getting good </joey>
<joey> chocolate that's like a problem this is </joey>
<joey> a proper amount of here's the chicken </joey>
<connor> and here's the that could be a candy do </connor>
<joey> that's so good yeah exactly it honestly </joey>
<connor> tastes like a tandy as well </connor>
<connor> for the right amount of juicy actually </connor>
<joey> you know what i think that might be my </joey>
<connor> favorite right </connor>
<connor> it tastes more like a chicken tender </connor>
<connor> than a like a breast </connor>
<garnt> that's like the closest to kfc for </garnt>
<garnt> something yeah i mean i agree </garnt>
<garnt> i think it needs more seasoning yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i mean like take that </garnt>
<garnt> chicken </garnt>
<connor> right and actually put like a [ __ ] ton </connor>
<connor> of seasoning on it make it spicy because </connor>
<connor> that's the best that's that's the reason </connor>
<connor> i stand the 7-eleven chicken </connor>
<connor> it is it is like i'd say there's less </connor>
<connor> fat </connor>
<connor> than the 7-eleven chicken but the </connor>
<connor> 7-eleven chicken just has the best </connor>
<joey> seasoning </joey>
<joey> and why why do we eat fried chicken it's </joey>
<joey> because of the seasoning like </joey>
<joey> you know 11 secret herbs and spices like </joey>
<joey> imagine </joey>
<joey> imagine buying kfc chicken and then all </joey>
<joey> the skins off no one would want to eat </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] let's be honest that's the </joey>
<garnt> you eat it because of the skin because </garnt>
<garnt> of the seasoning on the fried chicken </garnt>
<garnt> so i will go you know </garnt>
<joey> let's write let's write one two three i </joey>
<joey> would say i personally would say </joey>
<joey> lawson seven eleven family mart i'd say </joey>
<connor> the same for me personally </connor>
<connor> i'd say i'd say you saw a little more </connor>
<garnt> bias yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'd say seven eleven lawsons family mart </garnt>
<joey> right at the bottom we can all agree </joey>
<connor> that family martial </connor>
<joey> in this case that's the third opinion in </joey>
<joey> the room joey i suppose you've put it </joey>
<connor> over the edge for lawson's right i would </connor>
<connor> i would have to give a point to lawson </connor>
<connor> just because </connor>
<connor> the seasoning for 7-eleven is good but i </connor>
<connor> i think it's like too much seasoning </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah uh they also do nuggets now </connor>
<garnt> these are the basic kind which i i you'd </garnt>
<garnt> never catch me finding i just i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<garnt> i want a spice there's like there's a </garnt>
<garnt> hot version and i think there's a cheese </garnt>
<connor> version </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't [ __ ] with the cheese </garnt>
<connor> versions because it's like injected </connor>
<connor> cheese </connor>
<connor> i don't trust that cheese should be on </connor>
<garnt> top it should never be injected right </garnt>
<garnt> there's some things that should be </garnt>
<garnt> injected and cheese isn't one </garnt>
<garnt> of the vaccines check yeah medicine </garnt>
<garnt> medicine </garnt>
<connor> check and uh these have been microwaved </connor>
<joey> because we've heated them up but uh </joey>
<joey> yeah they don't look too great not gonna </joey>
<garnt> lie you guys want to try and nugget </garnt>
<garnt> the color on this chicken is kind of </garnt>
<garnt> tragic looking honestly </garnt>
<garnt> i did eat one before recording something </garnt>
<garnt> this looks actually </garnt>
<garnt> this is the most depressing chicken you </garnt>
<joey> know what this looks like this looks </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> like this is like frozen yeah yellow </garnt>
<garnt> this is it was once frozen and i just </garnt>
<garnt> defrosted it it's it's like it does it </garnt>
<garnt> lacks </garnt>
<garnt> any kind of color that makes it look </garnt>
<garnt> that wouldn't make it look oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> oh no that ain't good no they had to </connor>
<connor> slime down walson </connor>
<joey> 711 family mod and then whatever the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i just said okay </joey>
<garnt> that was worse than the family mart </garnt>
<joey> chicken </joey>
<connor> i said the family mart chicken tastes </connor>
<garnt> like death oh my god </garnt>
<connor> that was this looks this tastes right </connor>
<joey> out the freezer yeah </joey>
<joey> oh my god you know what this tastes like </joey>
<joey> this tastes like can you show can you </joey>
<garnt> put it like stab it and show it to the </garnt>
<garnt> camera </garnt>
<joey> okay this look at that look at that this </joey>
<connor> for real tastes like </connor>
<joey> the skin is like dying to get off it </joey>
<joey> this is like one of those kadages you </joey>
<joey> order at a really really cheap </joey>
<connor> yeah it's like it's like 50 yen friday </connor>
<joey> 50 yen for one yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah that ain't chief man the </connor>
<connor> fight but i mean honestly you can't </connor>
<connor> really go wrong unless you go family </connor>
<garnt> mart </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i would say the reason that </garnt>
<garnt> i mean we okay so where we live right </garnt>
<garnt> now we live right next to a family mart </garnt>
<joey> and we live right next to a lawsons </joey>
<joey> unfortunately we don't live next to a </joey>

<connor> to explain what this is </connor>
<joey> yeah so this is uh ozeki's one cup sake </joey>
<joey> which is essentially the like trailer </joey>
<joey> trash </joey>
<joey> level of sake that you can get at the </joey>
<connor> convenience stores </connor>
<connor> imagine if budweiser try to make a cheap </connor>
<connor> version of budweiser </connor>
<garnt> and this is what you would this is the </garnt>
<garnt> blue lightning of sake </garnt>
<joey> right so how much does one of these cost </joey>
<joey> these cost like a dollar a pop right </joey>
<joey> it's like 100 yen yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> 200 okay 250 yen that's too much for </joey>
<joey> this yeah </joey>
<joey> so that this is this costs about two </joey>
<garnt> dollars it's a </garnt>
<garnt> literally a jar of sake and we all know </garnt>
<connor> how much i love sake yeah from the </connor>
<joey> episode </joey>
<connor> honestly i have none of us have tried </connor>
<connor> this right i've never i've never tried </connor>
<garnt> this either so i'm not even a big fan of </garnt>
<joey> sake </joey>
<joey> i like it's like wine right like i need </joey>
<joey> the right food for it and this is not </joey>
<connor> the right food </connor>
<connor> if you calculate the uh the price per </connor>
<connor> milliliter </connor>
<connor> this is actually more expensive than one </connor>
<joey> chris brought us so </joey>
<joey> actually if it's two 250 yen yeah pretty </joey>
<joey> well yeah </joey>
<connor> well it doesn't smell horrible well it's </connor>
<joey> sac it never smells of anything much </joey>
<joey> it doesn't it doesn't smell too bad i </joey>
<garnt> mean it smells like sake what does bad </garnt>
<joey> sake smell like a bad sake will smell </joey>
<joey> sour </joey>
<garnt> like you'll know why why okay that why </garnt>
<garnt> what that's like having milk and being </garnt>

<joey> so she all do at the same time yeah she </joey>
<joey> is gentleman </joey>
<connor> okay successful podcast i hope yes all </connor>
<connor> right let's give it a shot shall we </connor>
<connor> oh god that's actually no that's not </connor>
<garnt> bad at all what that i was not i was </garnt>
<garnt> expecting a burn </garnt>
<garnt> or a bad aftertaste that's not </garnt>
<joey> you know what i can't believe i'm saying </joey>
<joey> this i'm kind of [ __ ] with this like </joey>
<connor> it actually tastes alright you want mine </connor>
<connor> come on </connor>
<connor> i don't [ __ ] this man just cannot </connor>
<joey> drink saga this is actually </joey>
<joey> i was expecting it to feel like i'm </joey>
<garnt> drinking petrol </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's what i was expecting as well </garnt>
<garnt> japan </garnt>
<garnt> this is the cheap alternative to like </garnt>
<garnt> getting pissed in japan </garnt>
<joey> i can see why all these like you know </joey>
<joey> like old people go </joey>
<joey> into uh you know 7-eleven or wherever </joey>
<joey> buy one of these and just chill at the </joey>
<joey> front of the seven left yeah </joey>
<garnt> i would probably be there as honestly </garnt>
<garnt> this is why we like uh this is why </garnt>
<garnt> kombini's are great because sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> you buy something and it's </garnt>
<garnt> way better than you expect to buy at a </garnt>
<garnt> convenience store this sake you taste </garnt>
<garnt> way too good too for something that just </garnt>
<garnt> came out of a 250 yen convenience store </garnt>
<joey> sake okay </joey>
<joey> it's actually not bad wow it doesn't </joey>
<joey> really taste of much that's why i mean </joey>
<joey> it's easy to drink yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's really easy to drink because a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of like cheap sake usually has like a </garnt>
<joey> very </joey>
<garnt> harsh honestly it's less i think it's </garnt>
<joey> less offensive than the one that chris </joey>
<connor> wrote the other day actually this </connor>
<joey> actually tastes better than on the </joey>
<joey> christmas yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> so chris [ __ ] us over thanks so much </joey>
<connor> i'm still going to stay what i'm saying </connor>
<connor> is the milliliter that's </connor>
<connor> a price ratio but god you have two more </connor>
<garnt> hot food outlets i do </garnt>
<connor> i do i don't know what ashley has bought </connor>
<connor> me but let's let's have a look okay so </connor>
<joey> the first one </joey>
<joey> looks like a karaoke what the which </joey>
<joey> potato yeah yeah there's so what a </joey>
<garnt> karaoke is it's kind of just like a </garnt>
<joey> potato katsu right that's that's the </joey>
<joey> right way to describe it </joey>
<joey> so sometimes oh that is that is very </joey>
<joey> oily </joey>
<garnt> that is </garnt>
<garnt> that is literally see-through that is </garnt>
<joey> that is the same that is like the </joey>
<joey> simpsons episode yeah </joey>
<connor> simpsons episode right here so what this </connor>
<connor> is i don't know what kind of crocodile </connor>
<connor> should we want to crack that open on the </connor>
<connor> table </connor>
<joey> yeah that's all right let's let's let's </joey>
<garnt> do it oh okay it's not a </garnt>
<garnt> karaoke what is it oh okay so it's not a </garnt>
<joey> karaoke it's katsu it's like minced meat </joey>
<garnt> katsu basically </garnt>
<garnt> okay i've never had this so essentially </garnt>
<joey> you know what this is this is literally </joey>
<garnt> a deep-fried hamburger </garnt>
<garnt> this is what this is this is literally </garnt>
<garnt> what this is it's a </garnt>
<garnt> it's a deep-fried hamburger this is look </garnt>
<garnt> at that this this is this is a </garnt>
<garnt> basically a hamburger this is a smell </garnt>
<connor> you know what it smells like it reminds </connor>
<connor> me like pies in the uk </connor>
<garnt> it does a little bit yeah it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> minced pie it has it has a very pie </garnt>
<garnt> smell </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god i don't know if you can see </garnt>
<garnt> this on camera but the oil </garnt>
<garnt> has seeped the oil has seeped through to </garnt>
<garnt> the table doesn't really taste of </garnt>
<connor> anything </connor>
<connor> like meat and grease that's all i tell </connor>
<garnt> you </garnt>
<garnt> there's like no seasoning oh my god this </garnt>
<garnt> tastes </garnt>
<garnt> like how how do you know what actually </garnt>
<garnt> you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how do you eat something and just have </garnt>
<connor> zero opinion about the taste </connor>
<connor> right yeah just nothing this literally </connor>
<garnt> tastes like cardboard </garnt>
<garnt> because there's no taste in it at all </garnt>
<garnt> like you'd </garnt>
<garnt> like you'd expect some kind of burger to </garnt>
<garnt> have some kind of seasoning on it this </garnt>
<garnt> tastes like batter </garnt>
<joey> yeah granted i've had a really good </joey>
<connor> mensch katsu and this is definitely a </connor>
<connor> weak sauce like </connor>
<connor> weak sauce compared to what i had what </connor>
<connor> else did you get okay </connor>
<garnt> okay you wanted you want to see this </garnt>
<joey> yeah sure it's a spring roll </joey>
<connor> you ever all gotten the spring roll from </connor>
<garnt> look at that this i i do not stand this </garnt>
<garnt> look at that </garnt>
<garnt> okay let's i'm gonna cut this up you </garnt>
<joey> know this is this is </joey>
<joey> this you know it's not good when you're </joey>
<joey> cutting a spring roll and it turns flat </joey>
<garnt> it's a soggy spring roll right you know </garnt>
<joey> wow </joey>
<garnt> i i don't like spring rolls in general i </garnt>
<garnt> i yeah i don't like spring rolls they're </garnt>
<joey> way too oily for me </joey>
<joey> it's not bad actually that's not bad at </joey>
<connor> all how's it taste how does it taste </connor>
<connor> it's quite fatty somehow like very fatty </connor>
<connor> you know what it's like </connor>
<garnt> it tastes like a dim sum yeah oh a </garnt>
<joey> little bit it's like the kind of </joey>
<joey> oil yeah it's like an oiliness of a dim </joey>
<joey> sum </joey>
<connor> it's like you know you know when you </connor>
<connor> because in the uk we have these like </connor>
<garnt> party platter things </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you get from ice that's what it </garnt>
<garnt> looks like yeah so you thought you were </garnt>
<garnt> just gonna get a bite of just pure like </garnt>
<garnt> pastry whatever was it pastry is that </garnt>
<garnt> what it is oh yeah i think it's pastry </garnt>
<connor> pastry and then just maybe like a crumb </connor>
<joey> of meat yeah and like that's normally </joey>
<joey> how it is that's why i hate spring rolls </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> that one was packed i you know i i i'd </joey>
<connor> get that i would actually honestly </connor>
<garnt> honestly </garnt>
<garnt> i did not expect it to taste that good </garnt>
<garnt> it tastes like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like you said like a mini dim sum </garnt>
<connor> yeah but in a spring roll pastry yeah </connor>
<garnt> um wow that was that was not the taste i </garnt>
<connor> was that's </connor>
<connor> that's the point i thought they would </connor>
<connor> somehow make this one work and [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> the spring yeah right </joey>
<joey> it's the opposite way around you </joey>
<joey> surprise us but there's there's tons of </joey>
<joey> stuff that we don't have here hot foods </joey>
<joey> like a change all the time like for </joey>
<connor> example lawson's has like </connor>
<connor> hot dogs that have like different </connor>
<connor> toppings like salsa there's like meat i </connor>
<joey> mean let's not forget as well about </joey>
<joey> the nikumans and the pizza monsters </joey>
<garnt> right yeah yeah i think all of the </garnt>
<joey> convenience stores yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah what's what's it called just like a </joey>
<joey> steamed bun yesterday so like </joey>
<garnt> you can get like the chinese steamed </garnt>
<joey> meat buns cinnamon all the animes </joey>
<joey> yeah honestly all like all of the meat </joey>
<joey> buns and all three of the companies are </joey>
<garnt> lit </garnt>
<garnt> and they taste really good they taste </garnt>
<connor> way too good and yeah those are really </connor>
<joey> good i i [ __ ] with the hot dogs hot dogs </joey>
<joey> are pretty [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> what are they called the goo dogs dogs </joey>
<joey> they're called and at one point </joey>
<joey> okay so they they also go through at all </joey>
<joey> the chains they all go through seasonal </joey>
<connor> items </connor>
<connor> at one point they had like like uh mini </connor>
<connor> burritos </connor>
<connor> money burritos yeah like microwavable </connor>
<joey> burritos that were like </joey>
<joey> they're probably like proper burritos no </joey>
<garnt> if if there's one food item that i think </garnt>
<connor> is really hard to get in japan or one </connor>
<connor> food cuisine </connor>
<connor> mexican food it's so hard to get good </connor>
<connor> mexican food in japan you can get </connor>
<garnt> any other any other food i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> i've had i've gone to a restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> and i've been like yeah this is almost </garnt>
<joey> the only way you can get mexican food is </joey>
<joey> to go to like international chains that </joey>
<joey> just happen to be here right yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<connor> even then like we've been to some </connor>
<connor> mexican restaurants we can get rid of </connor>
<garnt> this [ __ ] we've been to some mexican </garnt>
<joey> restaurants and i've always felt </joey>
<joey> underwhelmed </joey>
<garnt> oh yeah it's always it's always felt </garnt>
<joey> like the mexican but it's sad because </joey>
<joey> that's the best you're gonna get yeah </joey>
<garnt> exactly </garnt>

<joey> yeah like it's like a solid like frozen </joey>
<joey> broth i'm not really sure </joey>
<joey> it's like freeze-dried it's freeze-dries </joey>
<joey> block and it basically when you </joey>
<joey> microwave it </joey>

<connor> lawson's does a ton of like </connor>
<joey> over there's the pastas as well i </joey>
<joey> remember as well yeah the pastas are </joey>
<connor> lit pastas uh weird combinations of </connor>
<connor> pastas as well like stuff that like you </connor>
<connor> would never see </connor>
<joey> everything very very japanese twist on </joey>
<connor> italian food yeah </connor>
<connor> what's a weird combination they have </connor>
<connor> they'll have like um </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like egg and tomato sauce or </connor>
<connor> something that like i was like </connor>
<garnt> yeah sometimes they put hot dogs in </garnt>
<joey> their pastas </joey>
<garnt> some of the pastas literally look like a </garnt>
<garnt> kid's meal it's true it's true </garnt>
<garnt> they look like the dairyli the like </garnt>
<garnt> dairy meal lunch pack lunchbox </garnt>
<garnt> you know when you get you're a kid and </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of make your own like sandwich </garnt>
<garnt> out of the </garnt>
<garnt> lunchables yeah that's what they that's </garnt>
<garnt> like the equivalent of putting into </garnt>
<garnt> japanese </garnt>
<connor> uh sorry italian cuisine yeah lawson's </connor>
<connor> has like a premium hot food section </connor>
<connor> which is doesn't include any of that </connor>
<connor> pasta [ __ ] right it's only japanese and </connor>
<joey> not normally fried food yeah but it's </joey>
<joey> there is udon </joey>
<joey> which is like udon is uh just like i </joey>
<connor> guess strips of </connor>
<connor> beef and then grilled and then put with </connor>
<connor> rice and you normally get like a sauce </connor>
<connor> or a mayo to dip it in </connor>
<connor> right nice and then butter which is my </connor>
<joey> favorite is just pork </joey>
<garnt> like strips of pork pork on spoon </garnt>

<garnt> and i have to say </garnt>
<garnt> i have used the razor myself it's a very </garnt>
<garnt> clean shave i highly recommend it that </garnt>
<garnt> gothic arch </garnt>
<garnt> is working wonders might i say it's that </garnt>
<garnt> german engineering right it's an </garnt>
<garnt> incredibly great deal but act fast while </garnt>
<connor> supplies last go to harrys.com </connor>
<connor> trash taste to redeem your offer back to </connor>
<garnt> the episode okay so as the </garnt>
<garnt> good on that connor was talking about i </garnt>
<joey> have some 7-eleven goudon </joey>
<joey> right here so not a liar doesn't look </joey>
<joey> appetizing </joey>
<joey> i have also never seen that before have </joey>
<joey> you ever seen this before it's it </joey>
<connor> honestly it [ __ ] slaps it tastes </connor>
<connor> great vertically to the camera okay </connor>
<connor> i can't show it vertically because it's </connor>
<connor> got it's got sources in it but look </connor>
<connor> what happens is that it comes it comes </connor>
<connor> with two compartments right </connor>
<connor> okay there we go juices the juices </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of juices in here so what </connor>
<connor> happens is </connor>
<connor> it's basically just grilled like what is </connor>
<garnt> it grilled </garnt>
<garnt> beef beef strips uh in whatever juices </garnt>
<garnt> they </garnt>
<garnt> cook it in and it comes with two </garnt>
<garnt> compartments ah that is </garnt>
<garnt> that is that is hot it comes with the </garnt>
<connor> rice compartment that's a common mistake </connor>
<garnt> that people comes with the rice </garnt>
<garnt> compartment </garnt>
<connor> or you can just dump it all on or you </connor>
<garnt> can just take a piece at a time yeah </garnt>
<connor> exactly </connor>
<joey> whatever works best you've got two </joey>
<garnt> compartments you can eat it however you </garnt>
<joey> like i like to dump it i'll give it a </joey>
<joey> shot </joey>
<garnt> the reason the reason why they split it </garnt>
<connor> up is the spices on this [ __ ] as well </connor>
<garnt> yeah some uh some like heat this is just </garnt>
<garnt> an excuse for us to uh film our eating </garnt>
<garnt> our dinners right </garnt>
<connor> you know we're not gonna lie you can </connor>
<connor> tell this is like super cheap because </connor>
<connor> like it's </connor>
<connor> this beef is half just fat look at that </connor>
<connor> like that is you know the reason though </connor>
<joey> why they started it </joey>
<garnt> that's the good part you know the reason </garnt>
<garnt> why they split it up into two layers </garnt>
<garnt> though </garnt>
<garnt> so that the rice doesn't soak up yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah you wouldn't want the rice </garnt>
<garnt> being sorry </garnt>
<garnt> come on okay honestly if you come to </garnt>
<garnt> japan try the beef bowls because the </garnt>
<garnt> beef bowls are </garnt>
<garnt> by far my favorite like 7-eleven or </garnt>
<joey> whatever convener you decide well you </joey>
<joey> can go to the top three beef ball chains </joey>
<connor> oh yeah you could just go outside </connor>
<connor> they'll probably be at matsuyazukiya or </connor>
<connor> it's my favorite cheap japanese dish </connor>
<connor> throw some of that on my plate </connor>
<connor> yeah so do you get this often i get this </connor>
<garnt> whenever like i'm traveling </garnt>
<garnt> and i just you can never go wrong with </garnt>
<connor> beef balls yeah if i have to get a meal </connor>
<connor> in lawson's right they basically do like </connor>
<connor> uh katsudon </connor>
<connor> and they have like uh it's really </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] good really clean cuts it on </connor>
<connor> with just rice it's just like perfect </connor>
<connor> it's so good </connor>
<connor> and they give you like a [ __ ] ton as </connor>
<connor> well so good [ __ ] god you probably </connor>
<connor> powered that on there </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> ratio did you actually like mayo with </garnt>
<garnt> mine you like mayo </garnt>
<garnt> will give you mayo and sometimes it's so </garnt>
<garnt> nice to have mayo with it i know some </garnt>
<connor> people think that's disgusting but </connor>
<connor> you're really like because sometimes all </connor>
<connor> you're getting is just grease grease </connor>
<connor> grease and mayo helps like </connor>
<joey> i i always get mine with mayo yeah i </joey>
<connor> mean i like the fats i i like </connor>
<joey> but sometimes you need to like mellow it </joey>
<joey> out a little bit yeah but this man </joey>
<joey> doesn't like condiments </joey>
<garnt> that's not bad actually yeah it's good </garnt>
<garnt> right and how much is this this is 400 </garnt>
<garnt> yen this whole box </garnt>
<garnt> this is this is literally yeah this is </garnt>
<garnt> about four bucks and you can get an </garnt>
<garnt> entire meal </garnt>
<garnt> and it [ __ ] slaps like a one-off </garnt>
<connor> that's pretty [ __ ] good yeah </connor>
<connor> like if you're desperate and you want a </connor>
<connor> good meal that's actually not bad </connor>
<joey> yeah i'm pretty surprised if you don't </joey>
<joey> man says so then it must be good </joey>
<connor> it is obviously you know if you go to </connor>
<connor> matsuya yoshinoya or whatever </connor>
<connor> they literally cook it in front of you </connor>
<garnt> yeah like from honestly like this is </garnt>
<garnt> this is like </garnt>
<garnt> this is not bad if you're if you're out </garnt>
<garnt> about and you just want a quick meal and </garnt>
<garnt> you you know can't you there's no </garnt>
<garnt> matsuya or there's no like chain around </garnt>
<garnt> you </garnt>
<garnt> look he's going on for seconds that's </garnt>
<joey> how good it is that that's that says </joey>
<connor> more than </connor>
<connor> a little fatty but yeah that's pretty </connor>
<joey> actually i'd eat this would it be good </joey>
<joey> for with uh some mayonnaise on it </joey>
<connor> yeah but a managed yeah not bad though </connor>
<joey> points to 7-eleven for that one i guess </joey>
<connor> yeah so there was tons of other hot food </connor>
<connor> that we couldn't get and also we just </connor>
<connor> don't want to waste all of it um </connor>
<connor> we don't want to throw away too much </connor>
<joey> food the staff is eating all of it don't </joey>
<connor> worry </connor>
<connor> so yeah i mean that's that's most the </connor>
<connor> hot food that we want to talk about </connor>
<joey> today yeah and the rest is just a bunch </joey>
<joey> of snacks yeah there's the </joey>
<joey> if there's one thing that all three </joey>
<joey> convenience stores have it's snacks yeah </joey>
<joey> they have way more snacks they do hot </joey>
<joey> food i think oh way way more all right </joey>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> before we move on before we move on from </garnt>
<garnt> the hot foods um </garnt>
<garnt> so how long do you guys feel like you </garnt>
<garnt> can </garnt>
<garnt> survive on convenience store food before </garnt>
<connor> you start to get bored of it </connor>
<joey> well i actually tried that out once uh </joey>
<garnt> when i </garnt>
<connor> was why because it was the only option i </connor>
<garnt> had so </garnt>
<garnt> basically when i was which mean it was </garnt>
<garnt> the only option you had well let me let </garnt>
<joey> me explain when i was working i was like </joey>
<garnt> 16 i was working at the ski fields in </garnt>
<garnt> hokkaido right right i'm in the middle </garnt>
<garnt> of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] nowhere in hong kong oh in the </garnt>
<joey> mountains the only thing they had </joey>
<garnt> i'm 16 as well so i can't drive to the </garnt>
<garnt> next you can't afford a fancy meal </garnt>
<joey> i can't afford fans basically i'm living </joey>
<garnt> day by day with what they're paying me </garnt>
<garnt> right yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and also because it's snowing [ __ ] 24 </garnt>
<connor> 7 there right </connor>
<connor> without a car you're basically [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like you can't walk in </connor>
<joey> you know into a snowstorm to like go to </joey>
<connor> the next town financial advisor </connor>
<joey> not even my financial advisor could save </joey>
<joey> me but so </joey>
<joey> the only thing they had around where i </joey>
<garnt> was staying was a family mart </garnt>
<garnt> oh that's why you're a family master so </garnt>
<joey> i literally </joey>
<joey> throughout that entire month i i would </joey>
<garnt> want to say minimum </garnt>
<garnt> two meals a day every day for a month </garnt>
<garnt> was family mart yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and you know what i felt like i wanted </garnt>
<connor> to die by the end of it </connor>
<connor> there's only so much like first week </connor>
<garnt> you're just like all right i'm going to </garnt>
<garnt> try that bento i'm going to try that </garnt>
<joey> bento basically </joey>
<joey> i like i like fully completed the </joey>
<joey> pokedex of like family my food </joey>
<connor> yeah i was like yeah i tried everything </connor>
<connor> and once i did finish everything i was </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i highly regret that i did that because </joey>
<joey> i feel so </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] unhealthy right now because the </garnt>
<garnt> thing is when you come </garnt>
<garnt> when you come to japan for the first </garnt>
<garnt> time and you see how </garnt>
<garnt> just how much choice of meals there are </garnt>
<connor> in every convenience stores especially </connor>
<connor> for me </connor>
<connor> coming from england where the only </connor>
<connor> choice i have is </connor>
<garnt> the tesco's meal deal don't don't come </garnt>
<connor> on don't don't talk ill of like the best </connor>
<garnt> thing that we have about our country </garnt>
<garnt> but there's in terms of like let's say </garnt>
<garnt> packageable </garnt>
<garnt> lunches or meals that you can get away </garnt>
<garnt> with </garnt>
<garnt> pastries that's kind of about it really </garnt>
<garnt> we do have something you've got </garnt>
<connor> sandwiches you got i think we all have </connor>
<connor> the problem with the uk </connor>
<garnt> stuff that you can like kind of take </garnt>
<connor> quickly it's all in like the same genre </connor>
<garnt> and the food the thing like it doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> there's no there's no variety yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> and the thing is only say only </connor>
<joey> like the big super mega stores have the </joey>
<joey> hot food like the fresh </joey>
<joey> chicken food is good like sometimes you </joey>
<joey> you go to like sainsbury's it's the big </joey>
<garnt> sainsburys and they have like the hot </garnt>
<garnt> rotisserie chickens </garnt>
<connor> those actually slap but tesco's have </connor>
<connor> like the sausage like yeah like </connor>
<connor> foot long sausage that you can eat </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing but those but those are </garnt>
<garnt> limited to like the really really big </garnt>
<garnt> stores </garnt>
<garnt> um so the good thing about convenience </garnt>
<garnt> stores is that all this </garnt>
<garnt> like everything you see is basically </garnt>
<garnt> homogeneous throughout basically every </garnt>
<garnt> convenience store you can find </garnt>
<garnt> there are some that are bigger that have </garnt>
<garnt> even more choice </garnt>
<garnt> of what you can buy but we are </garnt>
<garnt> showcasing stuff that you can buy in </garnt>
<garnt> basically every convenience store you </garnt>
<connor> can get </connor>
<garnt> living here it's sort of like you view </garnt>
<garnt> convenience food almost like mcdonald's </garnt>
<garnt> in my mind like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it starts to have like a almost </garnt>
<garnt> it's not a mcdonald's characteristic to </garnt>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> taste of how you know it's not like it's </connor>
<connor> not all fresh it doesn't all </connor>
<garnt> taste quite like something's been a </garnt>
<joey> little too </joey>
<joey> healthy as they package it up yeah right </joey>
<joey> i mean there are definitely some healthy </joey>
<joey> things like there's some decent salads </joey>
<joey> there's some stuff like that and like i </joey>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> after the gym i think we always uh we </connor>
<connor> always just get like this just chicken </connor>
<garnt> breasts salad chicken yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> so they have literally you have one of </garnt>
<connor> them right do i have a chicken breast </connor>
<connor> joey might have one </connor>
<garnt> did you did you buy a chicken breast the </garnt>
<garnt> only thing i have is this sauce </garnt>
<joey> it's just a sausage just it's called </joey>
<joey> it's from johnsonville amazing name </joey>
<connor> it's an american brand i think so and </connor>
<connor> you can just rip it open and you start </connor>
<joey> eating it </joey>
<connor> one sausage what what what i do have </connor>
<connor> it's not a chicken breast </connor>
<connor> something similar like that but but they </connor>
<connor> literally have uh this is </connor>
<connor> this this is a a salad chicken ball i </connor>
<connor> don't know what a salad chicken bar is </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> um it's like a salad in a bar with </connor>
<connor> chicken what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> no chicken has ever been in that shape </joey>
<joey> what is that it's like a chicken </joey>
<joey> sausage almost so normally the ones that </joey>
<garnt> i get and they also have a family mart </garnt>
<garnt> and lawsons i don't know why they </garnt>
<garnt> wouldn't uh have them at some point it's </garnt>
<garnt> like a salad chicken </garnt>
<garnt> nuggets imagine literally a chicken </garnt>
<garnt> breast seasoned </garnt>
<joey> i think the one that i always go for is </joey>
<joey> tandoori flavor </joey>
<joey> chicken tandoori it's literally just a </joey>
<connor> chicken breast just in a </connor>
<connor> vacuum sealed package that is just </connor>
<garnt> vacuum sealed vacuum seal package like </garnt>
<joey> this yeah you crack that bad boy open at </joey>
<connor> like three a.m </connor>
<joey> you go for a workout right you know you </joey>
<joey> want to get some protein what's the best </joey>
<connor> source of protein just eat a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> whole chicken breast yeah </connor>
<connor> 20 grams of protein boom you're talking </connor>
<garnt> because normally like if </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's it's it makes it so convenient </garnt>
<garnt> because no matter what mood or no matter </garnt>
<garnt> what kind of food you want </garnt>
<garnt> they probably have it at your </garnt>
<garnt> convenience store if you want something </garnt>
<garnt> healthy </garnt>
<garnt> you can oh god that looks awful this </garnt>
<connor> this this this this that looks </connor>
<garnt> like oh show the gloss to the camera </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god look at that yo give me a bite </garnt>
<connor> of that give me yo </connor>
<garnt> let's cut that this is glossier than </garnt>
<garnt> some nails jesus christ </garnt>

<joey> oh this feels you know what this it </joey>
<joey> feels plastic i'll try it but i'm not </joey>
<garnt> gonna happen </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not gonna like it this looks like a </garnt>
<garnt> like a hot dog with extra peppers on it </garnt>
<connor> honestly oh my god it tastes like a </connor>
<connor> chicken hot dog that's [ __ ] weird </connor>
<garnt> okay that's just a chicken hot dog </garnt>
<joey> i don't know if you were supposed to </joey>
<connor> take the skin off of those though no </connor>
<connor> no no it's a chicken hotdog i like how </connor>
<garnt> they call it a </garnt>
<garnt> salad chicken when it's just a chicken </garnt>
<joey> hot chocolate </joey>
<joey> well then japan's not not going to know </joey>

<garnt> that's [ __ ] awful yeah do you know </garnt>
<joey> what they call corn dogs here yeah </joey>
<joey> american dogs america dogs i mean </joey>
<joey> honestly that's a pretty [ __ ] good </joey>

<connor> america </connor>
<connor> corn dogs all right gentlemen we all </connor>
<connor> have sandwiches from our respective </connor>
<connor> stores </connor>

<joey> your go to for me it's always this one </joey>
<connor> tuna and tamago oh [ __ ] my bag got </connor>
<connor> crushed but </connor>
<connor> honestly i'm not making this look </connor>
<connor> appetizing but same joey yeah </connor>
<connor> you'll notice though the difference </connor>
<connor> between the family mart and the lawson </connor>
<connor> sandwiches with especially with the egg </connor>
<joey> yeah the egg in family mod is kind of </joey>
<connor> like sliced event yeah they slice the </connor>
<connor> eggs </connor>
<connor> fully scrambled and honestly yeah this </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] slaps this [ __ ] is honestly both of </joey>
<joey> them slap i feel and what what the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> this guy </garnt>
<garnt> this this uh they didn't have the </garnt>
<garnt> sandwich they asked for which is just </garnt>
<garnt> like a katsusando </garnt>
<garnt> so katsusando is literally just like a </garnt>
<garnt> pork katsu </garnt>
<garnt> um just with some bread slapped on the </garnt>
<garnt> side and some uh katsu sauce </garnt>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is i see i've always seen </connor>
<connor> so this is </connor>
<connor> just show it to the camera so i've </connor>
<connor> always seen this right you put it in </connor>
<connor> frame with us so that it's it's an okay </connor>
<joey> it's literally like a strawberry </joey>
<joey> shortcake turned into a sandwich </joey>
<connor> that looks awful can you can you crack </connor>
<connor> that open </connor>
<joey> okay okay i've always seen those because </joey>
<joey> they sell those at family mart too </joey>
<connor> i've never tried them also the genius </connor>
<joey> japanese packaging you just there's a </joey>
<joey> little slip that you pull open and boom </joey>
<joey> it's ready to go </joey>
<connor> everything falls outwards like that </connor>
<joey> isn't that amazing that's just beautiful </joey>
<joey> that is japanese engineering to define </joey>
<connor> you've got a little picnic for your </connor>
<garnt> sandwiches how do you feel about uh the </garnt>
<garnt> lack of cross boys </garnt>
<connor> it's disappointing i mean i mean look at </connor>
<connor> this right like there's something </connor>
<connor> missing </connor>
<joey> it's the bite of the crust yeah it's not </joey>
<joey> good it's beautiful </joey>
<garnt> it's beautiful do you guys give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> if i just rip some off and hand it to </garnt>
<garnt> you yeah okay </garnt>
<garnt> so you try that egg gone that's the real </garnt>
<garnt> egg okay that's the look at the color </garnt>
<connor> look at the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bright the saturation has been pumped to </connor>
<joey> ten thousand on that you know that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> this one's got some slices in it i've </joey>
<connor> had this one oh that that feels like a </connor>
<joey> weak bread you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> they're all weak branches what are you </joey>
<joey> talking about oh god it's been dunked in </joey>
<connor> the grease </connor>
<connor> okay i i don't know how to properly </connor>
<garnt> smear this </garnt>
<joey> [Laughter] </joey>
<connor> oh it's cross-contaminated oh no which </connor>
<garnt> which which tomato were you trying first </garnt>
<joey> let's try the family one so the </joey>
<garnt> one with the slices on it honestly like </garnt>
<garnt> what i love about japanese eggs </garnt>
<garnt> is that they just have the color in them </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know every every japanese egg </garnt>
<garnt> just is like it's like they took the egg </garnt>
<garnt> the egg yolk </garnt>
<garnt> put it in photoshop and turned out the </garnt>
<joey> saturation it looks beautiful </joey>
<joey> it's like way too yellow for it to be </joey>
<joey> real yeah i like the egg </joey>
<connor> the problem i have with this sandwich </connor>
<connor> sorry i'm eating my mouth </connor>
<connor> was the tuna taste like [ __ ] you think </connor>
<joey> so and this found this sandwich i think </joey>
<joey> i think the tuna tastes the same </joey>
<joey> no you see what i mean honestly i i </joey>
<joey> really like the egg i like the egg to be </joey>
<garnt> solid um i love the egg slices yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> i do like that all right let's try the </joey>
<garnt> lawson egg sandwich then so this one is </garnt>
<joey> no egg slices just </joey>
<garnt> fully mashed okay what i don't like </garnt>
<garnt> about this one and why </garnt>
<garnt> i've never bought this one is because </garnt>
<garnt> this egg looks like runny yolk </garnt>
<garnt> it looks like the [ __ ] that comes out </garnt>
<garnt> your nose it's like runny egg yolk </garnt>
<joey> definitely a lot more of like a </joey>
<garnt> mayonnaise flavor in this yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> now i prefer to chew on my eggs you know </garnt>
<connor> what and i feel it </connor>
<connor> you know what i'll give you that one </connor>
<connor> that that like there is something about </connor>
<connor> knowing there's like an </connor>
<joey> egg slice in there that's way more </joey>
<joey> comforting i don't know i'm gonna try </joey>
<connor> and [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> dissect this this isn't working </joey>
<garnt> sandwiches were just not meant to be </garnt>
<joey> shared let's be honest </joey>
<connor> i'm just gonna rip it off sorry there </connor>
<joey> you go joey oh [ __ ] [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> try some real [ __ ] tuna tasting </joey>
<connor> sandwich action </connor>
<joey> can you give me some of that sandwich </joey>
<joey> honestly like when it comes to the tuna </joey>
<joey> it all tastes the same whatever what i </joey>
<garnt> want to mention though </garnt>
<garnt> is that all the breading for all the </garnt>
<garnt> sandwiches in japan </garnt>
<garnt> it it's so fluffy it's so light and </garnt>
<garnt> fluffy that's why it's </garnt>
<garnt> some of my favorite breads i think oh my </garnt>
<joey> gosh i just realized we're breaking </joey>
<joey> bread guys </joey>
<joey> like true comrades which one are we </joey>
<joey> eating first i'm the family </joey>

<joey> spot which one </joey>
<connor> that one's uh okay no that's that's </connor>
<joey> that's a little stupid </joey>
<joey> i can tell the difference ah no actually </joey>
<garnt> i don't know i'm a cool sauce on this </garnt>
<connor> one no no no </connor>

<connor> know what i'm sure i smell on the table </connor>
<joey> you'll know what i mean you're not </joey>
<joey> honestly gone like you're you're the </joey>
<joey> mediator in this one </joey>
<connor> try both of those and tell me if there's </connor>
<joey> a [ __ ] difference </joey>
<connor> different like the family mart one it's </connor>
<joey> great no no it's got weird tinge to it </joey>
<joey> let's try the last one okay so this </joey>
<garnt> one's the lawson one right yeah </garnt>
<joey> okay let me try both it tastes the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] secret oh actually hold on yeah </joey>
<garnt> see see what i mean </garnt>
<joey> lawson one's better yeah okay i agree </joey>
<joey> the lawson one actually tastes like </joey>
<connor> it's so clean i don't know what it is </connor>
<connor> man the lawson tuna sandwich </connor>
<garnt> like like it's amazing it's like like </garnt>
<garnt> the initial taste i i bit into both and </garnt>
<garnt> the initial taste was just like </garnt>
<joey> okay they both taste the same and then </joey>
<joey> the aftertaste from the lawsons tuna </joey>
<garnt> you actually get a taste it tastes like </garnt>
<joey> fish yeah it tastes it tastes like fish </joey>
<joey> so if you like the like the taste of </joey>
<garnt> fish i'd say the lawson one is better if </garnt>
<garnt> you don't like the taste of fish i'd say </garnt>
<garnt> the family might want is better yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'll give that all right let's try the </garnt>
<connor> now let's try this abomination </connor>
<garnt> honestly there's a part of me there's a </garnt>
<joey> part of me that's thinking this is going </joey>
<connor> to be good </connor>
<connor> this is my only strawberry this is this </connor>
<garnt> is i've already got one strawberry as </garnt>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> honestly one thing that the sandwiches </connor>
<joey> are guilty of doing here is that they </joey>
<joey> look </joey>
<joey> loaded in the front they look like </joey>
<joey> they're filled and then you take one </joey>
<connor> bite and you realize there's nothing </connor>
<garnt> they click bait </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's literally it's it's literally </connor>
<connor> like the walker's crisp yeah where or </connor>
<garnt> like it's </garnt>
<garnt> you bite into it and most of it's just </garnt>
<garnt> air and i found that family mart does </garnt>
<connor> that the worst </connor>
<garnt> family members has this sandwich right </garnt>
<garnt> that i used to get from valuable which </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> egg and ham i think and in the front man </garnt>
<garnt> it looks like it's </garnt>
<garnt> bursting it can't wait to get out and </garnt>
<garnt> you take one bite and then you realize </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> it goes from like this like it's so </connor>
<garnt> thin let's give this a shot all right </garnt>
<connor> that's not a sandwich honestly it's just </connor>
<joey> a cake that's just </joey>
<joey> yeah it's a dessert it's a strawberry </joey>
<garnt> shortcake that's </garnt>
<garnt> really [ __ ] weird because you know </garnt>
<garnt> what it tastes like a strawberry </garnt>
<garnt> strawberry shortcake but then you're </garnt>
<connor> just chewing bread proof that bread </connor>
<garnt> works with [ __ ] anything </garnt>
<garnt> no i i that that tastes wrong i'm not a </garnt>
<joey> fan of that i would i would rather just </joey>
<garnt> eat a strawberry </garnt>
<garnt> that's the that's like the equivalent of </garnt>
<connor> putting </connor>
<connor> a burger or like putting a patty between </connor>
<garnt> two two bread </garnt>
<connor> two breads uh slices and calling it a </connor>
<joey> burger </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i've always seen those being </joey>
<joey> sold because i think they sell all of </joey>
<connor> those at like </connor>
<connor> lawson and seven have dessert sandwiches </connor>
<connor> which is just [ __ ] weird i was the </connor>
<garnt> one with like uh i saw one where was </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> uh cream and lime cream no no no no no </garnt>
<garnt> i'm sorry uh kiwi kiwi it was kiwi </garnt>
<garnt> slices </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and i was like that looks </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] wack one thing i say i will say </garnt>
<garnt> the whipped cream they use here in japan </garnt>
<joey> it's s </joey>
<joey> tier whipped cream uh i agree i whip </joey>
<connor> cream to me doesn't really [ __ ] taste </connor>
<garnt> like anything i just kind of like you </garnt>
<garnt> you taste japanese whipped cream and </garnt>
<connor> you think it tastes like you you taste i </connor>
<connor> can i can stand that better i don't like </connor>
<garnt> like you telling me that the whipped </garnt>
<garnt> cream did not carry what you just </garnt>
<connor> ate right there because it looks like </connor>
<connor> the bread kind of carries </connor>
<connor> get out of here i have like one quarter </connor>
<connor> of a [ __ ] strawberry there's nothing </connor>
<joey> happening i used to i used to [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> despise like </joey>
<joey> all cakes and stuff like that like </joey>
<garnt> strawberry shortcake i was like nah </garnt>
<garnt> that's some boring [ __ ] but then i had </garnt>
<garnt> strawberry shortcake here yeah i was </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god strawberry caught uh i i was </garnt>
<garnt> exactly the same strawberry shortcake </garnt>
<garnt> here </garnt>
<garnt> blew my mind because the the cake part </garnt>
<garnt> is so fluffy </garnt>
<connor> and the cream the whipped cream japanese </connor>
<connor> whipped cream is the best i've tasted </connor>
<connor> in the world i will i will stand by that </connor>
<connor> and that's why japanese sweets taste so </connor>
<garnt> good a lot of it </garnt>
<garnt> but talking what do we use so what are </garnt>
<connor> we trying next lads </connor>
<connor> we try like the more like savory snacks </connor>
<connor> maybe like the fish and the meats next </connor>
<garnt> do you guys have any of those </garnt>
<connor> sure so gentlemen as you know one of the </connor>
<connor> most </connor>
<garnt> um well-known food items </garnt>
<garnt> i was trying to say but one of the most </garnt>
<connor> well-known food items from japan </connor>
<connor> is of course the jelly doughnuts aka </connor>
<connor> actually </connor>
<connor> you took me back the onigiri uh which if </connor>
<joey> you've seen if you've basically watched </joey>
<joey> any anime you've seen characters eating </joey>
<garnt> onigiri </garnt>
<joey> the rice balls this is this is basically </joey>
<garnt> the closest we get to an actual japanese </garnt>
<connor> sandwich because it's a </connor>
<connor> rice sandwich basically right this is a </connor>
<connor> wait wait </connor>
<connor> oh okay oh oh oh my god i did not </connor>
<garnt> where's the seaweed where is the seaweed </garnt>
<garnt> the best part it's like </garnt>
<connor> it's like the hot dog wrapper right yeah </connor>
<garnt> the best part of a hot dog is the crunch </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right what is that it is a grilled </garnt>
<joey> salmon onigiri </joey>
<joey> oh i have a grilled salmon one as well </joey>
<garnt> okay we want also a grilled salmon </garnt>
<connor> salmon onigiri so yeah as you know me </connor>
<connor> and gan actually ate onigiri and this is </connor>
<connor> actually one of them that i was eating </connor>
<connor> and it was </connor>
<connor> quite delicious as much as i was </connor>
<connor> complaining uh show business honestly </connor>
<garnt> that is that is my favorite onigiri to </garnt>
<joey> get so from </joey>
<joey> lawsons i've never seen that one from </joey>
<connor> i mean from all of the places gone now </connor>
<connor> lawson's </connor>
<joey> like every good big brain company has </joey>
<joey> their own </joey>
<joey> product line specifically for onigiri </joey>
<joey> they have the bit the basic [ __ ] on </joey>
<joey> igiri yeah it's like 100 yen now this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] is like 190 yen </joey>
<joey> oh that's a premium shirt you can't even </joey>
<connor> see it that's how premium is it honestly </connor>
<garnt> i i will stan </garnt>
<garnt> um 7-eleven hot foods and fried foods </garnt>
<joey> i don't i don't understand it's honest </joey>
<joey> this is the most depressing looking </joey>
<joey> onigiri i've ever seen </joey>
<connor> i'm sorry it's it's like it's like </connor>
<joey> someone put the condom on wrong </joey>
<joey> they put the condom on sideways instead </joey>
<connor> of on top now let me gentlemen let me </connor>
<garnt> show you what a good honey giri </garnt>
<garnt> okay actually it looks the same it's </garnt>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> it's just it's just a bigger condom no </joey>
<joey> no that's how it should look look at </joey>
<joey> that that's just the bigger condom </joey>
<joey> that's a beautiful honestly it's </joey>
<garnt> beautiful because every bite you get you </garnt>
<joey> get a bit of seaweed </joey>
<joey> i think here's the thing that </joey>
<garnt> differentiates between a good on your </garnt>
<garnt> gear and bad noise </garnt>
<garnt> it's the rice to insides ratio 100 100 </garnt>
<garnt> yes if there's like if the first bite </garnt>
<joey> you bite into an onigiri and you </joey>
<joey> immediately hit the inside that's a good </joey>
<connor> one yeah too fair a lot of the cheap </connor>
<connor> ones or even sometimes like if they've </connor>
<joey> just filled it not not quite right that </joey>
<joey> one time you do just get like four bites </joey>
<joey> in you're like </joey>
<joey> where is the [ __ ] where's the feeling uh </joey>
<joey> i gotta ask </joey>
<connor> do you boys actually eat on a gear </connor>
<connor> anymore yes yeah i still do you do i </connor>
<garnt> gave up </garnt>
<garnt> i do whenever i need to quit when i </garnt>
<garnt> whenever i literally need a quick snap </garnt>
<connor> yeah i'm sure i'm just never in the mood </connor>
<joey> for a block of carbs you know what i </joey>
<joey> mean </joey>
<connor> that's the problem and like there's not </connor>
<joey> enough filling i'd rather wait and yet </joey>
<joey> you get the [ __ ] microwavable gu dogs </joey>
<garnt> that's if like i want to [ __ ] i want </garnt>
<joey> to pig out </joey>
<connor> i haven't had a goo dog in a long time </connor>
<garnt> just like that she's dreadful </garnt>
<garnt> honestly because sometimes sometimes i </garnt>
<connor> miss my lunch and i have like a filming </connor>
<connor> or something </connor>
<connor> and i just need to fill up my stomach as </connor>
<connor> quickly as possible and that's when i </connor>
<connor> get </connor>
<garnt> just like one onigiri that lasts me </garnt>
<garnt> until dinner and it does everything it </garnt>
<connor> needs to do what is your favorite </connor>
<connor> filling of the </connor>
<garnt> year so there's different flavors that </garnt>
<garnt> you could have in it normally all </garnt>
<garnt> fish there is sometimes grilled chicken </garnt>
<joey> but honestly i'm not a fan of the </joey>
<joey> don't get it like cause the good part </joey>
<connor> about the fish one is that normally like </connor>
<connor> seeps into the rest of the area yeah the </connor>
<connor> chicken one just is a ball </connor>
<joey> i'd have to say the tuna it's probably </joey>
<connor> true is my favorite as well </connor>
<connor> i actually you are holding my favorite </connor>
<joey> one which is the salmon belly </joey>
<joey> it's really really good premium uh </joey>
<joey> salmon </joey>
<joey> uh i in terms of the chicken how do you </joey>
<joey> guys feel about the onigiri where it </joey>
<joey> doesn't really have a filling </joey>
<joey> it's just kind of like the grilled </joey>
<joey> grilled rice with grilled chicken or </joey>
<joey> whatever i used to eat those when i was </joey>
<garnt> little </garnt>
<garnt> but as i got older i was like nah i just </garnt>
<joey> want i want something more like </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah it feels like satisfying </connor>
<connor> yeah fake meal i don't know why </connor>
<joey> um but yeah i don't know why when i </joey>
<joey> first visited japan i [ __ ] all i ate </joey>
<joey> was like onigiri i think </joey>
<joey> everyone's like because you're like oh </joey>
<connor> my god i'm in japan i'm gonna eat the </connor>
<connor> japanese things i can't get this at home </connor>
<connor> i can get a sandwich at home yeah but </connor>
<connor> then when i started living here i'm like </connor>
<garnt> yo the sandwiches are pretty [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> bomber have you tried these sandwiches </garnt>
<joey> and they're like nearly the same price </joey>
<garnt> what am i doing man and sandwich is </garnt>
<joey> easier to eat because sometimes onigiri </joey>
<connor> falls apart if you like if you're you </connor>
<connor> know sometimes you're going to write </connor>
<garnt> a bad idea yeah like i didn't give to me </garnt>
<joey> i never eat onigiri as a meal like if </joey>
<garnt> i'm having a lunch i never pick </garnt>
<joey> onigiri as the lunch onigiri is a </joey>
<garnt> convenience if i need to stuff myself </garnt>
<garnt> and have it not taste awful i just </garnt>
<connor> realized </connor>
<connor> there's like no way for us to like share </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> to be fair i've never tried the family </joey>
<garnt> mart branded i have never tried the </garnt>
<connor> seven onigiri </connor>
<garnt> i've had this one before and it's good </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm just gonna do a bite just to </garnt>
<joey> prove that it's good again </joey>
<joey> oh look at that immediately wait like </joey>
<connor> okay how many how deep would i have to </connor>
<garnt> bite draken to get the filling jay </garnt>
<garnt> all right i just bit a whole ton of rice </garnt>
<garnt> and it didn't even have any seaweed </garnt>
<garnt> i hit like once one millimeter of first </garnt>
<connor> birth </connor>
<connor> let me give it a bite i mean how deep </connor>
<connor> this do you yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that's i already broke into salmon yeah </connor>
<joey> look at that </joey>
<joey> mine mine like my salmon actually has </joey>
<joey> like a little bit of like soy sauce in </joey>
<joey> it so the soy sauce kind of seeped into </joey>
<joey> the rice a little bit </joey>
<connor> that's really flavorful that's good </connor>
<connor> that's nice fatty salmon this is this is </connor>
<garnt> awful this is all foreign </garnt>
<garnt> honestly this this this is the most </garnt>
<garnt> depressing looking grilled simon </garnt>
<joey> fix your shirt okay so we can say family </joey>
<joey> martin lawson have got their </joey>
<joey> branded onigiri damn pretty down pat </joey>
<connor> yeah if you want the best onigiri from a </connor>
<connor> uh chain i would highly recommend </connor>
<garnt> i would highly recommend lawson's as </garnt>
<garnt> well lawson's especially the grilled </garnt>
<garnt> salmon belly </garnt>
<connor> that is [ __ ] bomb um what other </connor>
<connor> cold or savoury snacks do you guys tend </connor>
<connor> to go over okay we have the </connor>
<connor> you don't eat that i do not eat this you </connor>
<connor> know what this is this is the seafood </connor>
<connor> sticks </connor>
<connor> that you see in every asian restaurant </connor>
<garnt> and i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> why every asian restaurant serve this </garnt>
<joey> serves these well i don't want to make </joey>
<garnt> sense </garnt>
<joey> measuring contest but mine's bigger </joey>
<garnt> but every now and then aki asked me to </garnt>
<connor> come and buy like one of these crab </connor>
<connor> sticks </connor>
<connor> why okay i tried it it's actually kind </connor>
<connor> of good i don't </connor>
<connor> like crab especially this isn't just </connor>
<connor> like crab or fish this is fish paste </connor>
<connor> cheese and cod row that sounds dreadful </connor>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> my god my one's got like mayonnaise like </joey>
<connor> inside of it </connor>
<connor> why it's a seafood steak spicy roast </connor>
<joey> that looks [ __ ] awful oh my god that </joey>
<garnt> looks </garnt>
<garnt> good look at that look at that oh my god </garnt>
<connor> this this is just like oh smell it smell </connor>
<connor> it that smells awful </connor>
<joey> that smells like off tuna oh it just </joey>
<joey> dribbled </joey>
<garnt> smell that oh </garnt>
<joey> that is like the fishiest fish smell </joey>
<joey> ever yeah you know what i'm not even </joey>
<garnt> gonna open this i'm just gonna eat yours </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you know when you just have fish </garnt>
<garnt> that's been left out for a few days </garnt>
<garnt> um that's what this smells like it </garnt>
<joey> smells like the thing is i usually [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> with the crab sticks at like uh </joey>
<joey> summer festivals and stuff like that so </joey>
<connor> i hope this is something like that </connor>
<connor> it's not good it's just it's bad not </connor>
<connor> good for home </connor>
<garnt> oh god no that is </garnt>
<garnt> uh that is bad that's awful that is i </garnt>
<connor> just prefer the normal crab stick don't </connor>
<connor> put [ __ ] in a double cheese in it i </connor>
<joey> can't even taste the cheese i don't like </joey>
<joey> it i definitely taste </joey>
<joey> okay i don't like crab sticks because i </joey>
<joey> don't mind like crabs </joey>
<joey> crab is one food that i think just </joey>
<garnt> doesn't taste good processed </garnt>
<garnt> and crab sticks just feel like they they </garnt>
<connor> feel like such </connor>
<connor> processed foods it's like canned lobster </connor>
<connor> you want canned lobster no one wants </connor>
<joey> like you gotta you gotta have with the </joey>
<joey> with the crab sticks </joey>
<joey> i used to think the same but like you go </joey>
<connor> to like a summer festival and you get </connor>
<connor> the ones that are like on the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> grill with like the things oh yeah but </joey>
<connor> that's [ __ ] that [ __ ] is fire yeah </connor>
<garnt> but it's not i </garnt>
<garnt> i i don't think it's the crab that </garnt>
<garnt> tastes good it's the fact that it's </garnt>
<garnt> grilled and it's got the sauce on it </garnt>
<joey> and i'd rather have another it can be </joey>
<garnt> good i think it's really good yeah this </garnt>

<connor> is the sweet um </connor>

<joey> these are all the </joey>
<connor> sour ones no these are the sweet ones </connor>

<joey> one okay this is sweet yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> and what universe is this sweet </joey>
<garnt> yeah this is the sweet one so if you </garnt>
<garnt> have the sour one it's literally </garnt>
<garnt> like what's the what's the most sour </garnt>
<garnt> thing you can normally get </garnt>
<garnt> in like south africa it's way it's way </garnt>
<connor> more south you know that one video we </connor>
<connor> did with joe's channel we had </connor>

<garnt> of that yeah that's basically that's </garnt>
<joey> basically pickled </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like there's i bought this </joey>
<joey> thing for my channel which is pure </joey>
<joey> extract and it's considered one of the </joey>
<joey> most sour things in the world that's </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] awful </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's basically you start you start </garnt>
<garnt> salivating immediately </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of the most sour things you can </garnt>
<garnt> just naturally get </garnt>
<joey> it's really good okay </joey>
<joey> my grandma used to hand make these okay </joey>
<connor> that's why i have like i do think there </connor>
<connor> is a lot of at play of like i am not </connor>
<connor> used to these foods </connor>
<connor> and although i'm more than happy to try </connor>
<connor> every single item um </connor>
<connor> it doesn't mean i have to like every </connor>
<garnt> single item yeah of course what i don't </garnt>
<garnt> understand understand about pickled </garnt>
<garnt> plums </garnt>
<garnt> is that why do you like eating something </garnt>
<garnt> that sour </garnt>
<garnt> like it's so sour it's more sour than </garnt>
<garnt> any kind of sweet </garnt>

<connor> used to like hand make </connor>
<connor> the umeboshi and would just sand it in </connor>
<connor> tupperware right </connor>

<garnt> basically look like fish crisps </garnt>
<connor> right that's crazy that's kind of epic </connor>
<garnt> like that's kind of epic that's an epic </garnt>
<garnt> game </garnt>
<connor> so i'll hold on up right so look at that </connor>
<connor> that could be like a square </connor>

<connor> yeah that's like the unhealthier version </connor>
<garnt> of this i saw </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because it's basically this is </garnt>
<garnt> basically that with a bit more batter </garnt>
<joey> so you've got a bit more i think i might </joey>

<joey> particles actually like </joey>
<connor> celery on this it's like fried black </connor>
<garnt> sugar right i'm pretty sure that sounds </garnt>
<garnt> like a physics type but when you pull it </garnt>
<joey> out it </joey>
<joey> straight up just looks like a turd okay </joey>
<garnt> i i don't know what this is that's a </garnt>

<connor> i honestly don't really like that really </connor>
<joey> that wasn't [ __ ] it's it's a black </joey>

<connor> stuff that looks interesting okay first </connor>
<connor> of all </connor>
<garnt> one of my favorite japanese snacks it's </garnt>
<garnt> got to be top it's top tier for me this </garnt>
<garnt> estie </garnt>
<garnt> what's your senbei senbei in general </garnt>
<joey> though oh yeah in general it's not mochi </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> senbei in general there's a senbei store </joey>
<joey> not too far from mars yeah i go there </joey>
<joey> like every week to get my weekly yeah </joey>
<joey> it's so good oh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> senbei is so good if you don't know it's </joey>
<joey> like a rice cracker but </joey>
<connor> it's basically like it doesn't feel too </connor>
<connor> heavy and you can have like one or two </connor>
<connor> and you feel like really satisfied it's </connor>
<connor> not too bad for you either yeah i mean </connor>
<garnt> it's just like it feels like it feels </garnt>
<garnt> like a crisp but just </garnt>
<garnt> lighter and for some reason it's more </garnt>
<joey> filling than a single crisp </joey>
<joey> oh yeah an entire packet of senbei is </joey>
<connor> like this yeah oh my god whoa this just </connor>
<joey> has a funky texture to it </joey>
<joey> okay is it soft yeah it's like a soft </joey>
<connor> cookie a soft baked sembe </connor>
<garnt> oh okay is it chewy it looks chewy oh my </garnt>
<garnt> god what is that </garnt>
<joey> okay oh this is yeah so mochi senbei is </joey>
<connor> kind of in the same </connor>
<connor> so there's different types there's hard </connor>
<connor> senbei and then there's soft so </connor>
<garnt> there's hard senbei and then this rock </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] solid ship </garnt>
<garnt> there are some senbei where i've had </garnt>
<garnt> there was one the there was like it was </garnt>
<garnt> like yuzu pepper or something and i was </garnt>
<connor> like oh that sounds amazing </connor>
<connor> so i order it right and i [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> break my teeth i swear biting on this </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> what is it like a jawbreaker honestly </garnt>
<connor> there's like there's the perfect </connor>
<joey> hardness which is just cracks </joey>
<joey> immediately </joey>
<connor> it's like a rice cooker right that's </connor>
<joey> what you want and then some of them it </joey>
<joey> just feels like you're biting into a </joey>
<garnt> stomach that's really what it is </garnt>
<garnt> like if this if this was a cookie i </garnt>
<joey> would think this is the perfect </joey>
<joey> kind of there's yeah there's actually </joey>
<joey> one more level </joey>
<joey> above this called which literally means </joey>
<joey> wet samba </joey>
<joey> and it's like actually like wet but they </joey>
<joey> but they make it for old people who </joey>
<joey> can't like </joey>
<joey> break it down that's wholesome okay </joey>
<connor> let's give it a shot okay </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] whoa that's weird </connor>
<joey> yeah so mochi rice is actually different </joey>
<joey> from regular rice mochi rice is a lot </joey>
<connor> softer and a lot more like squishier </connor>
<connor> so you get something like this yeah it's </connor>
<joey> a little it's a little whack ain't it </joey>
<joey> oh that's so bizarre yeah i don't like </joey>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> okay so two you know what it is it's </joey>
<joey> it's moist </joey>
<connor> to explain what to explain laughing </connor>
<connor> what's funny marlene </connor>
<garnt> to to explain what i just experienced so </garnt>
<garnt> as we said this this has the perfect </garnt>
<garnt> texture </garnt>
<garnt> for like a good cookie and like my </garnt>
<garnt> my experience has told me that this is </garnt>
<garnt> good i'm going to bite into this and </garnt>
<garnt> it's going to taste sweet </garnt>
<garnt> and what i tasted was a salted cracker </garnt>
<garnt> with a moist cookie texture </garnt>
<connor> that isn't bad though i i'd eat it like </connor>
<connor> i wouldn't i wouldn't search for it but </connor>
<garnt> i'd eat it </garnt>
<garnt> that that was that texture and taste </garnt>
<joey> just doesn't belong together i don't </joey>
<joey> know some something about that whatever </joey>
<joey> you've kind of been conditioned right </joey>
<joey> yeah maybe it's not because i i i </joey>
<joey> i taste it and it tastes good and i feel </joey>
<garnt> the texture and the texture feels good </garnt>
<garnt> but together it just does not synergize </garnt>
<garnt> at all </garnt>
<joey> it's like anti-umami man it's like a </joey>
<joey> plus and a minus </joey>
<joey> kabuki yoyo these ones i i buy these i </joey>
<connor> like these </connor>
<joey> but when you have like four or five you </joey>
<connor> start to feel sick oh yeah </connor>
<joey> so like uh what's the what's the word to </joey>
<garnt> describe everything </garnt>
<joey> these are really good yeah so there </joey>
<garnt> it's like how would you describe the </garnt>
<connor> texture it's </connor>
<connor> cavernous it's like a it's like the </connor>
<connor> thing from fantastic forwards </connor>
<connor> i don't know what it is that's like </connor>
<connor> amazing for like one or two bites but </connor>
<connor> really like sickly after like three you </connor>
<joey> know what i mean </joey>
<joey> i i don't know man i could i could just </joey>
<joey> maybe maybe it's just me it's probably </joey>
<joey> just yeah yeah yeah it's not bad though </joey>
<joey> i mean </joey>
<joey> these are my favorite types of sandbags </joey>
<garnt> i think so this tastes exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> as what we just had but this is the </garnt>
<garnt> texture i imagine that tastes having </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like it's a nice salty cracker </garnt>
<joey> just with a bit more air </joey>
<joey> in between or like it's it's it's fatter </joey>
<joey> than the cracker but it's lighter than </joey>
<joey> the cracker yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> it's kind of like eating like cotton </garnt>
<joey> foam </joey>
<connor> just like flavored right so what are we </connor>
<garnt> having from yours okay so i've never </garnt>
<connor> actually seen this before </connor>
<garnt> but i know this brand baby start army uh </garnt>
<garnt> so basically </garnt>
<connor> it's like yeah it is so basically baby </connor>
<connor> style ramen is like the kind of </connor>
<garnt> really uh what's the word it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> dried out ramen </garnt>
<garnt> oh is it the instant ramen it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> instant ramen looking things but it's in </garnt>
<joey> a snack form </joey>
<joey> and i guess this is like the mozzarella </joey>
<joey> flavor right right which i've never seen </joey>
<connor> that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> let me just </connor>
<garnt> oh my god that looks next level i i need </garnt>
<connor> to try this here you go you know </connor>
<connor> i hate this is my first concern but this </connor>
<connor> just cannot be even remotely healthy </connor>
<garnt> right of course it's not healthy it's </garnt>
<joey> literally fried in some ramen noodles </joey>
<garnt> it's fine i kind of like it okay </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know if you did the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> but as a child </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you would sometimes i would </garnt>
<garnt> take instant ramen like harden instant </garnt>
<garnt> ramen </garnt>
<garnt> and just kind of like smash it up into </garnt>
<garnt> little pieces put </garnt>
<garnt> like put like the seasoning on it and </garnt>
<joey> just eat it like it was like yeah we had </joey>

<joey> seasoning like msg yeah it's like pure </joey>
<connor> empty </connor>
<garnt> yeah like it's as as a kid i was told to </garnt>
<garnt> never do that because it's unhealthy as </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] but </garnt>
<joey> it's this but i guess someone someone </joey>
<garnt> grew up </garnt>
<garnt> this literally tastes like childhood </garnt>

<garnt> with it's if it's like made out of </garnt>
<connor> chocolate okay so open up a napkin and </connor>
<connor> rip that [ __ ] over so to explain what </connor>
<garnt> curry bread is normally like </garnt>
<garnt> it's literally you take japanese curry </garnt>
<garnt> and then you deep fry it in a katsu </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> and uh cuts your bread and then it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of it's kind of like a jelly </garnt>
<garnt> filled doughnut </garnt>
<garnt> except imagine the filling was curry </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's correct and it's [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> good curry normal curry bread is [ __ ] </joey>

<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> like how is the synergy of chocolate and </connor>
<connor> coconut </connor>
<garnt> if i like this what is that okay i would </garnt>
<garnt> say for um experience points </garnt>
<garnt> one of the worst combinations i've had </garnt>
<garnt> was when i went to the wisconsin state </garnt>
<connor> fair </connor>
<connor> in the usa and they were and they were </connor>
<connor> selling </connor>
<connor> uh chocolate bacon they would literally </connor>
<connor> take bacon </connor>
<joey> and dip it in chocolate i'm going i'm </joey>
<garnt> about to find out if </garnt>
<garnt> there is a worse combination right now </garnt>
<garnt> than chocolate bacon </garnt>
<joey> i don't know chocolate bacon sounds </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] horrible okay well chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> curry bread </garnt>
<connor> that's also sounds horrible all right oh </connor>
<connor> okay look at that okay so </connor>
<joey> it looks like it literally looks like a </joey>
<connor> curry in between chocolate bread </connor>
<garnt> that smells like just a contradiction </garnt>

<garnt> like a weird bitter aftertone </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's even worse than chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> bread because it's not even sweet </garnt>
<garnt> it's the you can taste the cocoa in the </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> and then you bite into it and then you </garnt>
<garnt> get a mouthful of curry </garnt>
<joey> it's the worst it's an aftertaste that </joey>

<garnt> at the front okay yeah i want to talk </garnt>
<garnt> about this </garnt>
<garnt> i really like these these are the ramune </garnt>
<garnt> flavored </garnt>
<garnt> um what is candy candy i have </garnt>
<joey> an ancient video on my channel from like </joey>
<connor> six years ago where </connor>
<connor> i bought like a box of those candy right </connor>
<connor> and i said to myself </connor>
<joey> would i be able </joey>
<joey> i emptied like 30 of these into a bowl </joey>
<joey> and i crushed them into a powder and </joey>
<joey> then i mixed it with the carbonated </joey>
<joey> water </joey>
<joey> to see if it would go back into a ramen </joey>
<joey> spoilers it doesn't go back into ramen </joey>
<connor> um i've only ever had the drink a few </connor>
<connor> times it's quite nice but i mean </connor>
<garnt> it's basically what how do you how would </garnt>
<garnt> you describe ramen it's basically like a </garnt>
<garnt> japanese uh lemonade right yeah japanese </garnt>
<joey> wow yeah i love these is this this you </joey>
<joey> love this </joey>
<garnt> i do i grew up with this [ __ ] yeah okay </garnt>
<connor> i was like eating a kid </connor>
<joey> i i i eat this and i'm like i taste a </joey>
<connor> childhood i never had </connor>
<connor> no wonder you look like 10 gone because </connor>
<connor> you're [ __ ] eating kids [ __ ] all the </connor>
<connor> time </connor>
<connor> probably what were you drinking like </connor>
<connor> breast milk still all the time like </connor>
<joey> what's going on </joey>
<joey> like i would secretly i would eat this </joey>
<joey> what connor has the right there </joey>
<connor> chocolate babies i love these </connor>
<connor> these are great these are like these are </connor>
<connor> terrible though because like </connor>
<connor> you think you're not eating a lot of </connor>
<garnt> chocolate because it's so [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> dense i i look at this and i thought it </garnt>
<connor> was going to be a tic tac </connor>
<connor> that's that right the first time i just </connor>
<joey> tried it i thought it was a picture </joey>
<joey> it looks like a tic tac and you bite </joey>
<joey> into it and it's just </joey>
<joey> it's just like chocolate it's pure </joey>
<joey> chocolate chocolate as well though </joey>
<garnt> it's the most inoffensive chocolate that </garnt>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's the good chocolate you would eat as </garnt>
<joey> a kid </joey>
<connor> yeah literally just tic tac chocolate </connor>
<garnt> version yeah pretty much </garnt>
<garnt> it makes chocolate way too easy to eat </garnt>
<connor> because because you just </connor>
<garnt> the supermarkets have the big versions </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and if i get them it's almost </garnt>
<connor> impossible </connor>
<garnt> it's like it's like eating sprinklings </garnt>
<garnt> and oh that's that's my childhood right </garnt>
<joey> there like this big as well </joey>
<joey> tiny that's my childhood very nice milk </joey>
<connor> chocolate </connor>
<joey> that's good the other thing though that </joey>
<joey> is my childhood </joey>
<garnt> is these things um i bought i hate these </garnt>
<connor> these suck </connor>
<connor> have you tried these no oh yeah you can </connor>
<joey> try it okay </joey>
<joey> so these they're literally called umaibo </joey>
<joey> which means tasty stick </joey>
<joey> that's literally what it's called okay </joey>
<garnt> and it's basically </garnt>
<garnt> oh god how do you even explain it so </garnt>
<garnt> basically there's like these have been </garnt>
<garnt> around since like the [ __ ] 20s like </garnt>
<joey> these are ancient </joey>
<joey> and they're 10 yen each all right </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] nothing but feel how light that </garnt>
<connor> is these are the spacers </connor>
<garnt> these are the space raiders of japan i </garnt>
<garnt> think this this is because this is </garnt>
<joey> packaged air </joey>
<joey> yeah if you throw this high enough into </joey>
<garnt> the air it'll just go off this has </garnt>
<connor> no weight at all what's the actual </connor>
<joey> weight written on the package </joey>
<joey> uh oh dozens </joey>
<joey> six grams six grams </joey>
<joey> but i guarantee i'm pretty sure most of </joey>
<garnt> the grams is the packaging </garnt>
<joey> is this the [ __ ] packaging i'm </joey>
<joey> literally holding air here so i'm i have </joey>
<joey> the corn portage flavored </joey>
<joey> it's like cornstarch dude this this just </joey>
<joey> looks like monster this just looks like </joey>
<garnt> monsters </garnt>
<connor> i've got the cheese one you should try </connor>
<joey> it </joey>
<garnt> what is this flavor those are the mint i </garnt>
<joey> call flavor the skoda </joey>
<garnt> this is just monsters crisps yeah isn't </garnt>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> crisps if they were made by space </connor>
<joey> raiders do you have space traders in </joey>
<joey> australia i've heard of those yeah </joey>
<connor> all right let's try this there's a big </connor>
<connor> watcher </connor>
<joey> it takes away all the moisture in your </joey>
<garnt> mouth yeah it's a monster's crisp it's </garnt>
<connor> just a what's it yeah it's a big what's </connor>
<connor> it man this is </connor>
<garnt> usually just a watson honestly i mean i </garnt>
<connor> could i can understand why you that was </connor>
<connor> your childhood americans this is a </connor>
<connor> cheeto </connor>
<garnt> i mean honestly dude like imagine like </garnt>

<connor> or whatever </connor>
<connor> just just cheese sticks oh cheek </connor>
<connor> yeah i can guarantee though that these </connor>
<connor> are probably not the best tasting cheese </connor>
<joey> well i also grew up with these but </joey>
<joey> uh after about age eight i stopped </joey>
<joey> eating them because i had proper cheese </joey>
<joey> in australia </joey>
<connor> when you have real cheese you can't eat </connor>
<connor> this but if you're american </connor>
<joey> i'm not funny this is not just cheese </joey>
<joey> this is cheese with kama boko which is </joey>
<connor> fish cake </connor>
<connor> you should have said that you should let </connor>
<connor> him try it just give it a go you want to </connor>
<connor> try it girl </connor>
<joey> sure you're on the show there's you </joey>

<garnt> what the [ __ ] is this what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> how the hell do i </garnt>
<garnt> eat these joey i'm gonna be honest this </garnt>
<connor> is probably the least </connor>
<connor> appetizing looking thing that we've had </connor>
<joey> on today oh </joey>
<joey> dude you kind of just rip it open like </joey>
<connor> that we've had some pretty gross [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> but this looks vile </connor>
<garnt> this actually looks disgusting this </garnt>
<garnt> looks like on the same level with squish </garnt>
<connor> what's the ratio of cheese to like </connor>
<joey> fish you don't want to smell them </joey>
<joey> how do i open this this immediately just </joey>

<joey> yeah it tastes exactly how i remember it </joey>
<connor> oh we want to try this japanese snack </connor>
<garnt> for first time honestly </garnt>
<connor> it doesn't taste as bad as i thought it </connor>
<connor> would it oh </connor>
<connor> it tastes like you're eating plastic </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> it tastes like you're eating plastic and </connor>
<connor> then you get the fish aftertaste </connor>
<connor> the fish where is the cheese in there i </connor>
<joey> don't taste anything that was not </joey>
<garnt> cheese that was plastic you can't you </garnt>
<joey> can't </joey>
<joey> that's a plastic fish sausage that's </joey>
<garnt> fish </garnt>
<connor> that's fish flavored plastic i have a </connor>
<garnt> melty kiss </garnt>
<garnt> as they're called as they say in all the </garnt>
<garnt> commercials </garnt>
<garnt> yeah um and uh i don't particularly like </garnt>
<connor> these you know </connor>
<connor> ah it's just uh mochi right what have </connor>
<joey> you been watching </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like mochi with like chocolate </joey>
<joey> on it yeah well </joey>
<joey> let's give it a shot you're not a fan of </joey>
<connor> mochi </connor>
<joey> ah mochi's hair mystery of course </joey>
<joey> because japan they're individually </joey>
<garnt> packaged yeah </garnt>
<garnt> love the packaging you say you will it's </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] pretty like the </connor>
<garnt> box makes you want the thing the thing </garnt>
<garnt> about melty kiss is one of those </garnt>
<garnt> uh brands in japan that is always </garnt>
<garnt> seasonal they always have a seasonal </garnt>
<garnt> flavor of melty kiss you </garnt>
<garnt> you can tell what time period you are in </garnt>
<garnt> when you go to a supermarket or a </garnt>
<garnt> company and you see what melody kisses </garnt>
<joey> around and as the name suggests uh they </joey>
<garnt> melt pretty [ __ ] fast </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i i really like it it's </garnt>
<garnt> i like him it is just basically mochi we </garnt>
<garnt> have chocolate </garnt>
<connor> and it's just basically actually you </connor>
<connor> know what that's really good yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't know what melty kiss you had i </connor>
<connor> think i had an awful like tasting one </connor>
<connor> this is just chocolate this is [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> good this is chocolate chips this is </garnt>
<garnt> really rich chocolate it's just </garnt>
<joey> chocolate truffle right </joey>
<connor> there's no mochi in this is that yeah </connor>
<joey> does it think so </joey>
<connor> there might be a mochi variant oh i </connor>
<connor> thought it was mochi so </connor>
<garnt> i tasted that i didn't taste any more </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> and thank god they're all individually </joey>
<joey> wrapped so we can enjoy those later yeah </joey>
<joey> um i also have this is my channel that's </joey>
<joey> the mod </joey>
<connor> what is this oh my god i can't read </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] the phone come on you're nihongo </joey>
<joey> josu you can do it </joey>
<joey> you're just trying to try to figure it </joey>
<connor> out bro it's the fancy fonts [ __ ] me up </connor>
<connor> in japanese so </connor>
<joey> that's cute so it's separated into cute </joey>
<joey> little packages oh cute </joey>
<joey> so that's like perfect for dates yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah man you and your gf </joey>
<joey> rocking up okay how do you feel about </joey>
<connor> mochi um mid-tier </connor>
<joey> it depends it depends on the time like </joey>
<connor> mochi ice cream and like regular mochi </connor>
<garnt> and like sweet small cheese is like </garnt>
<garnt> completely different in my opinion so </garnt>
<garnt> what is what is mochi again </garnt>
<garnt> mochi is just rice it's rice pudding </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so mochi is just rice </garnt>
<joey> so basically they grab uh mochi rice </joey>
<joey> which is a specific type of rice </joey>
<garnt> and they just [ __ ] mash it with a </garnt>
<joey> hammer until it turns into </joey>
<joey> mochi that's good it's very chewy it's </joey>
<garnt> just good shape </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's clean </garnt>
<garnt> how i always feel about mochi is that </garnt>
<garnt> it's just very inoffensive </garnt>
<garnt> i would never not eat mochi but i would </garnt>
<garnt> never go out my way to get it but you </garnt>
<joey> know like a lot of </joey>
<garnt> old people die from choking on mochi i </garnt>
<garnt> can see why </garnt>
<connor> yeah so when you eat mochi make sure </connor>
<garnt> you're like yeah make sure you like </garnt>
<joey> properly chew this [ __ ] otherwise it </joey>
<connor> will get stuck in your throat </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry i was laughing because i saw </connor>
<connor> one of gaunt's item i keep forgetting </connor>
<connor> it's called this it's called the </connor>
<connor> chocolate pound cake </connor>
<connor> for some reason that feels so that is </connor>
<joey> such a sexual energy </joey>
<joey> i never thought about that i was like </joey>
<joey> yeah pound cake of course </joey>
<connor> but when you say it in english it's </connor>
<garnt> really weird that's the chocolate pound </garnt>
<garnt> pound you want to give you want to get </garnt>
<garnt> some chocolate pound cake that feels </garnt>
<connor> yeah see that that has like that </connor>

<connor> sexual energy but that has it i mean </connor>

<joey> like a brownie </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean i mean like it's just a </garnt>
<garnt> brownie you don't i don't need to do </garnt>
<joey> this but it's </joey>
<joey> way more sexually sounding than a </joey>
<garnt> broccoli a pound cake </garnt>
<garnt> pound cake does sound better than </garnt>
<connor> brownie yeah </connor>
<joey> that's nice right yeah that's not bad </joey>

<joey> open the stuff that is like only </joey>
<joey> what is like that the [ __ ] is that kid </joey>
<garnt> this is a </garnt>
<garnt> melon kitkat you're kidding me wow </garnt>
<joey> because they don't have a kitkat they </joey>
<joey> have </joey>
<joey> yeah like uh like that's a hokkaido </joey>
<joey> melon cake cat so that's the good melon </joey>
<garnt> see the thing about like hokkaido melons </garnt>
<connor> is that it is expensive as [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<garnt> because apparently it's super amazing </garnt>
<joey> let's </joey>
<joey> uh poke melons for preference like </joey>
<garnt> one like maybe about that big but a </garnt>
<garnt> regular thing will cost you like two </garnt>
<garnt> three hundred dollars </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's like the top class of </garnt>
<joey> melon </joey>
<garnt> oh this is the bowl variety that we </garnt>
<garnt> tried yeah is this </garnt>
<garnt> just gonna taste like kitkat again whoa </garnt>
<joey> i [ __ ] with that </joey>
<joey> i love melon flavored [ __ ] oh [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> that's good yeah </garnt>
<joey> that is really good oh my god </joey>
<joey> that might be one of the best ones of </joey>
<garnt> china hey give me some of that </garnt>
<garnt> that's probably the best kitkat i've </garnt>
<connor> ever had in my life that is </connor>
<connor> that is such a clean flavor to it like </connor>
<joey> that straight up tastes like you're </joey>
<connor> eating a melon yeah </connor>
<garnt> wow that's crazy it's it's like the </garnt>
<connor> crunchiness of a biscuit and a kitkat </connor>
<garnt> but with the clean taste of them of a </garnt>
<garnt> fruit wow i can't </garnt>
<garnt> that's really good wow you know how you </garnt>
<garnt> buy </garnt>
<garnt> a melon and it's god damn you know how </garnt>
<connor> you bite into a melon and it just like </connor>
<joey> it feels like clean because it feels </joey>
<joey> like you're eating like a really watery </joey>
<joey> fruit yeah yeah for some reason that was </joey>
<joey> a completely dry </joey>
<connor> snack that we just had but it felt </connor>
<joey> watery </joey>
<garnt> we don't need to try that it's called </garnt>
<connor> sugar butter sand tree the [ __ ] is that </connor>
<connor> it just looks like a custard it's a 7-11 </connor>
<connor> brand too yeah </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that i have um </connor>
<connor> wasabi sticks it looks like is that </connor>
<joey> cheese and what's happening </joey>
<joey> oh that's jagariko which is like a brand </joey>
<garnt> of like uh savory steaks </garnt>
<connor> i guess this is like wasabi show you </connor>
<garnt> flavor right dude do you like wasabi </garnt>
<joey> snacks no i do not get them i like the </joey>
<joey> wasabi like beans </joey>
<joey> the wasabi seed like flavored things i </joey>
<joey> forgot what they were called but like </joey>
<garnt> i know we talked about peanut butter </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there's there's like there's like </garnt>
<joey> beans that are covered in wasabi yeah i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] with those </joey>
<joey> i mean let me smell this for me wasabi </joey>
<garnt> just doesn't feel like something that </garnt>
<garnt> should be snacked on </garnt>
<garnt> that's basic as [ __ ] did you chase </garnt>
<connor> anything i don't say something i taste </connor>
<connor> the wasabi yeah </connor>
<garnt> i barely oh a little bit tiny bit oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there it is because when we eat </garnt>
<joey> something wasabi flavor we're </joey>
<joey> used to the whole like kickback right </joey>
<joey> but this is just like literally just a </joey>
<joey> hint of wasabi flavor honestly it's not </joey>
<garnt> too overpowering i like that </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] yes i literally were just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> on wasabi </garnt>
<garnt> snacks literally five minutes ago and </garnt>
<garnt> that's because the wasabi normally what </garnt>
<garnt> happens with wasabi snacks is that it </garnt>
<garnt> overpowers whatever </garnt>
<joey> you think like i can probably taste the </joey>
<garnt> soy sauce on that as well yeah and like </garnt>
<garnt> i i </garnt>
<garnt> i i ate that and i was like i can't even </garnt>
<garnt> taste the wasabi but then </garnt>
<joey> you get that aftertaste you literally </joey>
<joey> just did like the kombucha girl like </joey>
<joey> you're like no wasabi actually these are </joey>
<garnt> pretty good yeah because you know you </garnt>
<garnt> know when you have bad sushi </garnt>
<garnt> and then you you kind of like try to </garnt>
<garnt> overpower it with wasabi just to get rid </garnt>
<joey> of the taste like that </joey>
<joey> what who does that do you do that </joey>
<joey> sometimes sometimes really </joey>
<joey> but like i don't find myself in a bad </joey>
<joey> sushi restaurant i know a good one no no </joey>
<connor> no no no joey </connor>
<joey> was louis he didn't go into a bed again </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> you go to some sushi restaurants </garnt>
<garnt> especially with friends from abroad and </garnt>
<garnt> you see them </garnt>
<garnt> like put a little bit of soy sauce and </garnt>
<garnt> then [ __ ] wasabi yeah and then it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's like 90 wasabi </garnt>
<joey> 10 soy sauce and they just basically </joey>
<garnt> just dipped the entire season </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] drown it in and i don't know how </joey>
<garnt> they can taste the fish that's the </garnt>
<connor> incorrect way </connor>
<garnt> to eat sushi yeah finally okay and i </garnt>
<connor> feel like this is the perfect kind of </connor>
<garnt> balance </garnt>
<joey> of like how how a good sushi should </joey>
<joey> taste like actually i really like those </joey>
<garnt> damn what's the gigger video coming on </garnt>
<joey> about these you went on a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> but final thing we have is matcha </joey>
<joey> classic </joey>
<joey> we could have had about a bazillion </joey>
<garnt> match items we wanted to i think </garnt>
<garnt> honestly i think matcha is my favorite </garnt>
<garnt> kind of </garnt>
<connor> weren't you the guy like sit like seven </connor>
<garnt> months ago thought match was overrated </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think so no i don't think that </garnt>
<joey> was gone or someone else goes on </joey>
<garnt> i think that's like that shows overhyped </garnt>
<joey> i feel like i feel that's like okay </joey>
<garnt> so you're you are the guy who think </garnt>
<joey> matches i think matcha is awesome i feel </joey>
<joey> that's the two dichotomies with matcha </joey>
<garnt> though it's either you think it's </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] amazing with everything or you </garnt>
<garnt> think it's overrated </garnt>
<garnt> i think i think it's great i mean in the </garnt>
<garnt> last podcast we were we </garnt>
<garnt> recorded i had a matcha latte </garnt>
<joey> to me matcha is kind of like sometimes </joey>
<garnt> i'll eat one sometimes like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like handing a cigarette over all </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<joey> gentlemen i've had these before these </joey>
<garnt> are great yeah these are great </garnt>
<connor> i mean it's fine much snacks </connor>
<garnt> are great i'd rather a chocolate based </garnt>
<garnt> thing honestly have you okay </garnt>
<connor> one one question have you ever had </connor>
<garnt> matcha soft served </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because matcha soft serve is </garnt>
<garnt> literally the </garnt>
<garnt> single-handedly changed my opinion of </garnt>
<connor> matcha because after i had much a soft </connor>
<connor> serve i'm like </connor>
<garnt> much tastes [ __ ] great oh yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> oh we have moles sorry </connor>
<garnt> okay we have this thing which is gohan </garnt>
<joey> gohan which is basically this like i </joey>
<joey> don't even know what the flavor of it is </joey>
<joey> it's just gohan this your flavor but </joey>
<joey> basically you put it on </joey>
<joey> a bed of rice and it basically </joey>
<joey> it's good on rice that's all it is </joey>
<connor> bro you're kidding me that's all that </connor>
<joey> smells like seaweed </joey>
<joey> it's a seaweed it's a seaweed paste but </joey>
<connor> you would give this to like kids </connor>
<connor> i think i inhaled an x amount of salt </connor>
<joey> just from being near there </joey>
<joey> well that's the thing because it's so </joey>
<joey> salty you put that on a better rice and </joey>
<joey> it mellows it out perfectly </joey>
<connor> this is uh this is i'm not gonna eat </connor>
<connor> that i'm not eating now this is this is </connor>
<garnt> jagger </garnt>
<garnt> choco and it's just potato chips it </garnt>
<garnt> looks like to be </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate which is chocolate it looks </garnt>
<garnt> like chocolate potato chips looks like </garnt>
<garnt> it hasn't been um </garnt>
<garnt> you're not [ __ ] i can make </garnt>
<garnt> assumptions all day as </garnt>
<garnt> the great lord says let's just jump </garnt>
<garnt> right into it </garnt>
<garnt> oh oh okay okay okay that's uh </garnt>
<joey> uh yeah i think i've tried these before </joey>
<garnt> looking a little anemic </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's literally just a chocolate </garnt>
<connor> potato chip will it be salty though </connor>
<joey> that's what i'm curious about </joey>
<joey> yes they are weirdly salty you can't </joey>
<connor> taste the chocolate there's too much </connor>
<garnt> salt </garnt>
<garnt> i'm having a kombucha tea my own right </garnt>
<garnt> now </garnt>
<joey> it's like not gonna lie </joey>
<joey> no that's a little too much salt for me </joey>
<joey> oh too much </joey>
<joey> you know what that tastes like it tastes </joey>
<joey> like you ate </joey>
<joey> a bag of crisps and then you instantly </joey>
<connor> downed with like a hot chocolate if i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna </connor>
<joey> that's what that tastes like get double </joey>
<connor> calories of eating crisps and chocolate </connor>
<connor> i want to enjoy </connor>
<joey> both right i don't want to like have one </joey>
<joey> and then just eat calories from no </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i'm going to cleanse my palate with this </joey>
<joey> what is that one thing you have over </joey>
<connor> there </connor>
<joey> what's that polar bear thing you have uh </joey>
<joey> it's basically </joey>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] is this </garnt>
<connor> i think it's it's just basically melty </connor>
<garnt> kiss this is this give me this </garnt>
<joey> oh it's kind of the same thing let's try </joey>
<joey> it out it's like a brownie i guess let's </joey>

<connor> crisis don't you keep eating it </connor>
<joey> oh they're big whoa look at the </joey>
<joey> packaging it comes in dude that's fancy </joey>
<joey> oh what is that i don't know let's crack </joey>
<connor> it open though </connor>
<connor> aren't you okay no i'm not okay it's not </connor>
<connor> good god why why are we deciding </connor>
<garnt> if it's good or not because it tastes </garnt>
<garnt> good and then it doesn't and then it </garnt>
<garnt> does and then it doesn't and then it </garnt>
<garnt> i'm so [ __ ] confused it's like it's </garnt>
<joey> yeah again it's like a melty kiss but </joey>
<connor> huh kind of more fancy looking </connor>
<garnt> just grab one let's pop it out </garnt>

<joey> oh actually it says powder snow </joey>
<joey> chocolate </joey>

<joey> i'm gonna be the mediator i would have </joey>
<joey> to </joey>

<connor> don't [ __ ] care </connor>
<joey> all we know is that family my friend </joey>

<connor> cheat day right yeah </connor>
<joey> um what about the best like sandwiches </joey>
<joey> then oh </joey>
<joey> sandwich probably lawson's have i </joey>
<connor> converted you into seeing the way of the </connor>
<joey> tuna sandwich </joey>
<joey> i mean look the tuna the tuna sandwich </joey>
<joey> is lawson is definitely better but the </joey>
<connor> egg sandwich family mods better </connor>
<connor> if only they could join forces yeah i </connor>
<joey> would agree if only they could join </joey>
<garnt> forces </garnt>
<joey> like runny egg sandwiches should never </joey>
<garnt> be a thing it's not ronnie </garnt>
<connor> it it does i don't know about it it's a </connor>
<connor> paste it's mashed up </connor>
<connor> it's the collab we want to happen </connor>
<connor> like egg paste shouldn't be a thing it's </connor>
<garnt> not paste it's just it's mashed down </garnt>
<joey> i wanna like i wanna taste the eggs i </joey>
<joey> want the texture </joey>
<connor> i don't need it i don't need it i need </connor>
<garnt> it like even i prefer it </garnt>
<garnt> even even scrambled egg has a texture </garnt>
<garnt> this was like scrambled egg that was put </garnt>
<garnt> into a paste </garnt>
<joey> it is it is i like it it's like egg </joey>
<connor> flavored gluten </connor>
<joey> to me the egg is like they're both very </joey>
<joey> strong </joey>
<joey> but to me the tuna is just so much </joey>
<joey> better the tuna is hands down better </joey>
<connor> it's like why would i want it and also </connor>
<connor> uh like </connor>
<joey> there's supermarkets that like aren't </joey>
<joey> any of those that get like the </joey>
<joey> sandwiches as well and the tuna always </joey>
<joey> tastes like the family </joey>
<connor> one for some reason yeah yeah for some </connor>
<joey> reason i feel the awesome one they </joey>
<joey> actually took like the canned tuna and </joey>
<garnt> juice yeah it's good [ __ ] yeah good </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] chicken i feel like the lawsons </garnt>
<garnt> one the tuna sandwiches is better </garnt>
<joey> definitely better the egg sandwiches </joey>
<joey> family mart will definitely better </joey>
<joey> i don't eat that many sandwiches from </joey>
<garnt> the combinies so i don't really have </garnt>
<joey> too much of a strong opinion what about </joey>
<joey> what about the uh onigiri the rice balls </joey>
<garnt> lawsons lawsons </garnt>
<joey> yeah hands down lawson's hands down size </joey>
<connor> of one type </connor>
<connor> yeah i did not realize though that </connor>
<connor> because we we saw </connor>
<connor> two seven on the yuri's i don't know if </connor>
<joey> one will not will make it to the final </joey>
<joey> cut but we opened up two </joey>
<joey> they both looked as depressing as each </joey>
<joey> other my god </joey>
<connor> pretty sad the awesome one was clean it </connor>
<garnt> was it was nicely wrapped around that </garnt>
<garnt> was an </garnt>
<garnt> art piece right yeah yeah and the </garnt>
<joey> fillings were in every single bite like </joey>
<joey> that's </joey>
<connor> no matter where i buy i need to get a </connor>
<joey> bit of filling yeah absolutely </joey>
<garnt> lost lawson's definitely by far the best </garnt>
<garnt> on a year thank you guys thank you </garnt>
<connor> appreciate you appreciate it uh what </connor>
<joey> about </joey>
<joey> the what else did we cover i guess </joey>
<connor> snacks like we had like the </connor>
<connor> like fish snacks meat snacks i mean the </connor>
<joey> fish snacks and meat snacks i think we </joey>
<joey> can all agree are all pretty mid </joey>
<connor> yeah they're all they're all like the </connor>
<garnt> same level they're all oh no i like the </garnt>
<garnt> fish crisps </garnt>
<joey> and fish crisps yeah yeah yeah yeah i </joey>
<garnt> think that the the way that lawsons do </garnt>
<connor> the squid as well i was really [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah we unfortunately didn't get to </garnt>
<connor> try any like dried squid or white fish </connor>
<connor> or something but </connor>
<connor> like it's it's something that a lot of </connor>
<connor> people from </connor>
<connor> you know america and england that i've </connor>
<connor> met have because i bring this [ __ ] from </connor>
<connor> thailand </connor>
<garnt> to england and people like why are you </garnt>
<connor> eating fish food </connor>
<connor> it kind of it kind of does smell a bit </connor>
<connor> like food a little bit yeah </connor>
<connor> it does but it tastes [ __ ] awesome </connor>
<connor> it's the perfect amount of salty it's </connor>
<connor> perfect to go with your beer </connor>
<connor> absolutely uh fish snacks just you can't </connor>
<garnt> like you you don't know the full </garnt>
<garnt> enjoyment of fish snacks until you've </garnt>
<connor> had a cold beer with them </connor>
<connor> yeah you could have a beer with them i </connor>
<joey> don't know and i must say i'm thoroughly </joey>
<garnt> impressed with the one cop personally </garnt>
<joey> i thought i was gonna [ __ ] you you know </joey>
<connor> what i finished it i i'm impressed i'm </connor>
<joey> impressed i thought it was gonna taste </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] and it tasted </joey>
<joey> not great but drinkable but way better </joey>
<joey> than chris i would </joey>
<joey> i would i would buy another one of those </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] did did chris just bring </joey>
<joey> us like </joey>
<connor> just like the spices yeah yeah the worst </connor>
<connor> one he could find </connor>
<joey> he's just like pissed in a bottle he's </joey>
<connor> like yeah trust me </connor>
<connor> he's so </connor>
<joey> i also really like these though i love </joey>
<joey> it i like them but i think the kitkat </joey>
<connor> melon was just </connor>
<connor> above the rest and then obviously all </connor>
<joey> the breads disappointed me </joey>
<joey> yeah the breads were kind of made this </joey>
<garnt> though no no no no </garnt>
<connor> no no no it's not let me let me just </connor>
<connor> choco babies get go get the [ __ ] out of </connor>
<joey> here yeah and again like you know like </joey>
<joey> the ramen and stuff like that the </joey>
<joey> chocolate baby the stuff that i grew up </joey>
<joey> with this shit's great </joey>
<garnt> oh you're having another existential </garnt>
<garnt> crisis right now </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] i i took a bite and i was just like </garnt>
<garnt> this tastes awful and i'm just like no </garnt>
<garnt> this tastes good </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta [ __ ] try this please try </garnt>
<garnt> this </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have to okay no i i got it the </garnt>
<garnt> initial taste tastes [ __ ] awful </garnt>
<garnt> all right and then the aftertaste kicks </garnt>
<garnt> in and i'm like this tastes like uh </garnt>
<garnt> what does taste the aftertaste gives me </garnt>
<joey> the same kind of taste i </joey>
<joey> when when you're cooking like a brownie </joey>
<joey> or something and you have like cooking </joey>
<joey> chocolate </joey>
<joey> and you took you're cooking like a </joey>
<joey> chocolate pudding and then as a kid you </joey>
<joey> kind of just like </joey>
<garnt> have a bit of the chocolate you know you </garnt>
<joey> see it doesn't </joey>
<joey> i wasn't listening i was just enjoying </joey>
<connor> connor looking dead over there </connor>
<connor> it doesn't taste like that you're </connor>
<joey> chatting [ __ ] but all in all </joey>
<joey> i'd have to say you can get like this </joey>
<connor> you're a woman </connor>
<connor> you're a winner if you're in japan is </connor>
<joey> not even all of that this is not even </joey>
<joey> a corner of what you can get at a </joey>
<garnt> company [ __ ] the best </garnt>
<connor> tasting thing what was the worst tasting </connor>
<connor> thing oh god okay </connor>
<garnt> because i'm having a hard time deciding </garnt>
<connor> between this </connor>
<connor> and this oh no honestly the crab cake </connor>
<connor> the crab cake oh the crab cake was </connor>
<garnt> pretty cool no actually </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's this for me this is this has </garnt>
<garnt> the worst </garnt>
<connor> aftertaste and crab cake i still have </connor>
<joey> the aftertaste of this in my mouth right </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<connor> after eating all that [ __ ] was gross </connor>
<joey> yeah chica i mean </joey>
<connor> i i grew up i grew up with chico and </connor>
<connor> there's a reason why i stopped eating it </connor>
<joey> because it's </joey>
<garnt> it's literally right it literally smells </garnt>
<joey> like vomit yeah it ain't rich </joey>
<garnt> that was probably the worst flavored one </garnt>
<garnt> was the worst thing but yeah again </garnt>
<garnt> like this is nowhere near the variety </garnt>
<garnt> that you can get at a convenience store </garnt>
<garnt> right like </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many more snacks i mean you </garnt>
<connor> know i haven't even talked about the </connor>
