<garnt> - Hey guys, do you like charity? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Gamers, we have a big announcements. </garnt>
<garnt> We are going to be doing
a 24-hour Charity Stream. </garnt>
<garnt> You heard that, right.
(Joey jubilating) </garnt>
<joey> - So the whole situation
kind of messed up right now </joey>
<joey> for all sorts of different reasons. </joey>
<joey> So we thought we would come together, </joey>
<joey> stream for 24 hours to support </joey>
<joey> Doctors Without Borders
on our Twitch channel. </joey>
<joey> twitch.tv/trashtastepodcast. </joey>
<joey> What are we gonna be doing
on that stream though, </joey>
<joey> is the question you're probably asking. </joey>
<joey> - Games. </joey>
<connor> (chuckling) </connor>
<connor> We have a bunch of
different things planned, </connor>
<connor> including guests, games and humiliation. </connor>
<connor> And Joey will eat a ghost
pepper, maybe who knows, </connor>
<connor> if we raise enough money.
- Maybe. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, maybe.
- Maybe. </connor>
<connor> - So make sure to open up that wallet </connor>
<connor> to make sure that Joey can suffer. </connor>
<joey> - That's the reason we're doing it. </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm not here for the charity. </connor>
<connor> I'm here to make Joey suffer. </connor>
<joey> - So the event will be starting 11:00 AM, </joey>
<joey> Japan time, on the 19th of March. </joey>
<joey> If you live anywhere else in the world, </joey>
<connor> here are some just basic time
zones, that hopefully Munah </connor>
<connor> is putting on screen right now. </connor>
<connor> If not,
- 6PM PST. </connor>
<connor> - Look it up yourself on time converter. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, it'll be going on 24 hours </connor>
<joey> and we'll hopefully change
the world for the better, </joey>
<joey> even for a little bit. </joey>
<garnt> - And on with the episode. </garnt>
<joey> (burping) </joey>
<joey> - What?
- Why do you have to do that </joey>
<connor> on the mic? </connor>
<connor> - Why not? </connor>
<connor> - Pretty sure that's how down
with the Sickness starts. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is, yeah. </connor>
<joey> (burping) </joey>
<joey> Oh. </joey>
<connor> - The way that kick off very quickly. </connor>
<connor> - You can't, you can't right? </connor>
<connor> Not for that. </connor>
<connor> - Hm, I thought I was too perfect </connor>
<joey> in my impression of Disturbed. </joey>
<connor> (bright cheerful music) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Welcome to this
episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> And today we're gonna be
comparing our musical tastes. </connor>
<garnt> - Our trash taste in music, or good taste, </garnt>
<garnt> who knows, maybe one of us
has good taste in music. </garnt>
<joey> - And I've five.
- Said no one watching this. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Unfortunately we can't plead the fifth </joey>
<connor> in Trash Taste episodes,
which I would love to do, </connor>
<connor> cause I don't really know how
to describe music very well. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, I've.
- We've established that </garnt>
<connor> very early on in the
Trash Taste wall, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, see, we've
established that with Connor, </connor>
<connor> but, I also have been shitting myself </connor>
<connor> with the thought of this episode </connor>
<connor> and especially when it came
to like picking my choices. </connor>
<garnt> One, it was super difficult
because I didn't know like, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know how to describe why I liked, </garnt>
<garnt> like the picks that I picked. </garnt>
<garnt> I just know that they were important to me </garnt>
<garnt> at a time in my life.
- We gotta see why we like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah?
- Fuck. </garnt>
<connor> I'm fucked, I'm fucked. </connor>
<connor> - Well.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I guess like, on what
basis did you pick it? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's like, I guess,
Garnt was saying that, </connor>
<connor> it was an important, </connor>
<joey> like important artist in your life, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Mine is all also kind of </joey>
<joey> based on that, in a sense. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Joey chuckling) </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, actually, first question, </garnt>
<garnt> how did you boys, what method did you use </garnt>
<garnt> to like pick your artist?
- I've said, I've said. </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno, I dunno. </garnt>
<connor> - Song they sang good I put down. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Connor's like, </joey>
<connor> Connor's method is,
- Song good. </connor>
<joey> - Do I remember the artist's name? </joey>
<joey> I'll put it down. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause actually like, my
biggest difficulty, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that I like a lot of songs, </garnt>
<garnt> but I dunno if I like a lot of artists, </garnt>
<garnt> - Why?
- I like certain songs </garnt>
<garnt> from certain artists, but I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm more like, I get into genres of music </garnt>
<garnt> or like I get into like a certain genre </garnt>
<garnt> then more than I get into
this one specific artist </garnt>
<garnt> or this one specific band. </garnt>
<garnt> And if I do, it's like
very, very, very rare. </garnt>
<connor> - I think that's pretty normal. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the food, </connor>
<joey> It's like, "I like French food. </joey>
<joey> "I don't like all French food" </joey>
<connor> So it's like, that's the way I see it. </connor>
<joey> It's like, "but I do
like all Mexican food. </joey>
<joey> "It's pretty fucking good." </joey>
<connor> So I guess also I'll say
that's kinda how I view it, </connor>
<connor> or how I see it. </connor>
<connor> for me it was like, </connor>
<joey> I couldn't just like reach
into the nether and grab a band </joey>
<joey> because I'm sure if I did that, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there'd be like
a million other bands </joey>
<joey> that I just completely forgot about. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, "all right,
I'll split it into genres." </joey>
<joey> So I was like, "all right,
I like metal music, fuck." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> That didn't make it any easier. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like SpongeBob writing
the, my first fourth. </connor>
<connor> My first fourth picks. </connor>
<connor> I'm like so confident like, "oh this one. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, that one. </connor>
<connor> "Okay, oh this one. </connor>
<connor> "Okay, wait, what else do I listen to? </connor>
<garnt> "Oh shit."
- Yeah, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I literally went. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, we had our first
four, five picks that was </garnt>
<garnt> easy he came to our head.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I went through
my Spotify to try and see </garnt>
<garnt> if I could narrow down anything
else that I could talk about </garnt>
<garnt> or was important to me. </garnt>
<garnt> And the more I scrolled,
the more I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck is my music taste? </garnt>
<garnt> What is actually, this
like collection of songs </garnt>
<garnt> that I've put together
that defines who I am. </garnt>
<garnt> I tried to psychoanalyze
this and I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> "I don't know </joey>
<joey> "what this fucking person like." </joey>
<garnt> - That's what I love about doing </garnt>
<garnt> these three by three episodes. </garnt>
<joey> Is that, more so than our
audience trying to figure out </joey>
<connor> what our tastes are, </connor>
<joey> we find out what our own tastes are. </joey>
<joey> We truly are.
- All right, </joey>
<connor> I do really you wanna change </connor>
<connor> some of my picks, but we'll go with it. </connor>
<garnt> We'll go with it.
- We'll go with it. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, some of my picks were
like, I chose one band, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was more of just like, </garnt>
<connor> I wanted to pick one band </connor>
<connor> just to,
- Talk about </connor>
<connor> which you don't know?
- Talk about </connor>
<connor> several bands that I
want to put in this spot. </connor>
<connor> - Get those excuses out now, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> Get them out.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Get 'em out, set 'em up,
set up the, set 'em up. </connor>
<joey> (conversing) </joey>
<joey> Oh this one?
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> But this one is what I often,
that one time that I saved, </joey>
<connor> he loved this song. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing)
I also love it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess it's been, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, now that I think about it, </garnt>
<garnt> I have like such a different
relationship to music </garnt>
<garnt> than I do to like other forms of media, </garnt>
<garnt> I have like really games that
I could talk about forever. </garnt>
<garnt> About like, why I've really
fucking liked this game. </garnt>
<garnt> Same thing with movies, same
thing with anime, obviously. </garnt>
<garnt> But with music's always
been this one enigma for me, </garnt>
<garnt> because music's just been this one thing </garnt>
<garnt> where I like certain
things, I dunno why like it, </garnt>
<garnt> I just like it. </garnt>
<joey> - It's because most people, </joey>
<joey> when they listen to music,
(Connor whispering) </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I just like it. </joey>
<joey> No explanation. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Sorry, that was terrible. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's just because most people </joey>
<joey> when they're listen to music, </joey>
<joey> don't think that deeply about
what they're listening to. </joey>
<joey> - No, no.
- There isn't a guy </joey>
<joey> that like runs into
the room and he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Explain what you are
listening to right now." </joey>
<joey> He's like, "ah, the drums are good." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- It's like, </connor>
<connor> when someone's like, </connor>
<connor> "what's your tasting music?" </connor>
<connor> You can just be like, "ah, metal." </connor>
<connor> You don't, too bad.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And then he was like, "okay." </garnt>
<connor> And then that's it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, when people ask me
what on a taste music is, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "ah."
- Yes. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, I like so, I like everything. </joey>
<joey> I like,
- I like songs. </joey>
<connor> - I hate being that guy who just goes, </connor>
<connor> "I like a bit of everything." </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's just like the generic answer, </connor>
<garnt> but I literally don't know
how to answer that question </garnt>
<garnt> aside from, "Yeah, I like
a bit of everything." </garnt>
<connor> - Should we stop giving
excuses to ourselves, </connor>
<connor> and just get on with it?
- Go on, </connor>
<joey> this is it. </joey>
<joey> - All right, are we gonna do trash boxing? </joey>
<joey> - Bring him back trash.
- As per tradition. </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - All right, so I guess, </joey>
<connor> - I don't want Joey to go first. </connor>
<joey> - I don't wanna go first either. </joey>
<joey> - Because I don't want Joey,
- I don't wanna follow Joey. </joey>
<connor> - I don't wanna have Joey. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like give him this, his
fucking presentation, </connor>
<joey> this PowerPoint with animations. </joey>
<joey> - I don't.
- Why he likes </joey>
<joey> this kind of call.
- My goal for this episode </joey>
<joey> is to not be that pretentious music song. </joey>
<garnt> - No, we need you to be </garnt>
<joey> that pretentious music.
- I don't want to be </joey>
<joey> that pretentious music.
- Because you need to </joey>
<joey> counter rights me and
Connor going, "Oh, boo, boo. </joey>
<joey> "I like the beeps and the boos." </joey>
<garnt> And I'm being like, "Well,
the voice sounded nice. </garnt>
<garnt> "I like the voice." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like,
- I like the voice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, it's Connor first.
- It's Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, perfect, alright. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is gonna be tough. </garnt>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> - This is like my mom's gonna walk in </connor>
<connor> and there's a shit everywhere. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Listen, I can explain. </connor>
<connor> "This has a reason." </connor>
<connor> - All right, go on, man.
- This is a weird </connor>
<connor> three by three, I think.
- All right. </connor>
<connor> - Some of them you'll expect,
some of them you won't </connor>
<connor> or so I chose, I try
to choose a funny image </connor>
<connor> for some of them. </connor>
<joey> - I can think of at least three bands. </joey>
<connor> - That's good, that's good.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It can't be actually, can you really? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought only one. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<garnt> There's at least,
- I think of definitely one. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I can think of at least three. </joey>
<joey> - Aright, we'll find out. </joey>
<joey> - All right.
- Let's find out. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Do like the initial
I chose for the Weeknd? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Where did you get the
image of the Weeknd? </connor>
<garnt> - That's like the famous picture. </garnt>
<joey> This is a weird one. </joey>
<connor> I can explain
- Yeah, </connor>
<connor> I got the three that I thought. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, that's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the three that you thought. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] I knew Daft
Punk, Weeknd and Tempo. </joey>
<connor> That's good then.
- I knew </connor>
<connor> he was gonna put that on them. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] But Joey knows
I love Tempo and Parlor. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Joey knows that and Daft.
- And Daft Punk. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I put Bo Burnham on the left. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I got by Burnham.
- Okay, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> That shouldn't surprise me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anri.
- Do you know, </garnt>
<garnt> this is kind of like, we'll get into this. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - This is more about city pop in general. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay.
- We'll talk about that. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I don't
think I know the rest. </connor>
<connor> - This is Parcels. </connor>
<connor> - Parcels? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so they kind of not well known, </connor>
<connor> but it's very similar vibes to Daft Punk </connor>
<joey> plus this is a Breakbot over there. </joey>
<joey> You know, Breakbot? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> you know Breakbot. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know their song though. </joey>
<joey> - You know the "Baby I'm yours?" </joey>
<garnt> The ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em song. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, that's that's Breakbot? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's Breakbot. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay.
- But I knew, </garnt>
<connor> the rest their songs are amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Okay, </connor>
<connor> I've listened to some of their music. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, their songs fucking slap. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know if I know them. </connor>
<garnt> - You know them. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've definitely heard the meme. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, you know the meme song? </garnt>
<joey> - Probably. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt blabbering) </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, yeah that's nice. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, that's nice. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, have you ever
listened to that song </joey>
<connor> without it being base boosted? </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No. </connor>
<connor> I only know that song bass boosted. </connor>
<connor> - Well, okay. </connor>
<connor> So I mean, there's not
much I can, I kinda. </connor>
<connor> The band I listen to the most. </connor>
<connor> It's definitely these five </connor>
<joey> are the ones I listen to right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - I love The Weeknd. </joey>
<joey> He also drop the new album,
and I fucking love that album. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's a great album. </joey>
<joey> - I guess, who do I
wanna talk about first? </joey>
<connor> Who's should I talk about first? </connor>
<joey> Who'd you want me to talk about first? </joey>
<garnt> - I guess you've talked about,
- Who's the parcels? </garnt>
<connor> - Parcels?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Let's talk about Parcels,
cause I don't think gone, </joey>
<connor> - So they've a band right now, I believe. </connor>
<connor> Okay, this is gonna be hard to talk about. </connor>
<connor> Cause I don't know a lot
about a lot of these people. </connor>
<connor> All I know is that I play
their music an awful lot. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- I think they're a band </connor>
<connor> that is based in Germany. </connor>
<connor> I don't think they are German. </connor>
<connor> But they live in Germany
and they do kind of like, </connor>
<connor> it's very funk, but also, </connor>
<connor> ah how do I describe music to people? </connor>
<connor> I only know people.
- Because like the guy, </connor>
<garnt> the guy in that,
- I can literally see </garnt>
<garnt> Connor's brain cells committing suicide. </garnt>
<garnt> As he's like trying to process this. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know how to explain.
- I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<joey> I looked at this picture of Parcels </joey>
<joey> and the guy at the back in the middle </joey>
<joey> looks like George Harrison.
- Yeah, yeah, </joey>
<joey> he's weird, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they look like Beatles
if they were around today. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how to explain it. </connor>
<connor> It's like they don't. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - [Munah] Parcels are an
Australian electropop. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, they're are Aussies.
- I like electropop, man. </joey>
<garnt> - Aussies?
- Aussies? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah.
- Oh, okay, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - I like electropop.
- Let's go. </connor>
<joey> - I like electropop. </joey>
<joey> There we go.
- Electropop. </joey>
<joey> - If you know, a lot of
the things you can see, </joey>
<joey> like the influence of like, </joey>
<connor> if you look Daft Punk in the middle </connor>
<connor> and be kind of like
little parts of Daft Punk, </connor>
<connor> they've experimented in. </connor>
<connor> That's probably where I
like, cause it's like, </connor>
<connor> I think my favorite Daft
Punk album is Discovery, </connor>
<joey> which I've put there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yep. </joey>
<joey> - But I don't think there's many songs </joey>
<connor> of Daft Punk I don't like. </connor>
<connor> Given the first album is
probably the one I don't like </connor>
<connor> the most, cause it's very
like more experimental </connor>
<connor> as opposed to the other stuff they did. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's all more
like rudimentary for sure. </joey>
<connor> - And a lot of, some of the
songs in the first album, </connor>
<connor> I cannot remember the
name of the first album, </connor>
<connor> the one with the AM on the front of it. </connor>
<garnt> Literally, I think it
might just be called AM. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like I
only started listening </garnt>
<connor> to Daft punk after like,
was it the Homework album? </connor>
<connor> Is that the one?
- Homework was their first. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not sure of this.
- Homework was the first one </connor>
<connor> where I properly got
into Daft Punk as well. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's why most
people got into Daft Punk. </joey>
<joey> Either Homework or Discovery. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I think it was like, </joey>
<connor> I think the first big hit was
Around The World, wasn't it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- That was what put them </connor>
<joey> on the map my friend. </joey>
<joey> - Which is the most
repetitive song in existence. </joey>
<joey> - Is it a AM, FM, is that the album? </joey>
<joey> - [cameraman] About Daft Punk or? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, what's the album name? </connor>
<connor> You have to fact check
me on a lot of these. </connor>
<connor> - We're gonna need a
lot of fact check here. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we're good.
- We're good. </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone behind the camera check time, </garnt>
<connor> fact check time, all right?
- We're gonna find the facts. </connor>
<joey> - We need like seven facts checkers. </joey>
<garnt> - [Cameraman] Parcels
collaborated with Daft Punk </garnt>
<garnt> on their 2017 single or not. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't even know that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, there you go. </connor>
<connor> That's probably where the.
- That's probably where, why? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause a lot of these
our artists that I find </connor>
<joey> that I've no idea who they are, </joey>
<joey> it's like YouTube recommends me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you know who I'm surprised </joey>
<joey> is not on your three by three.
- Who? </joey>
<connor> - Joji.
- Joji? </connor>
<connor> I don't listen to Joji that much. </connor>
<joey> - Every time I go to your
house, you're playing Joji. </joey>
<connor> - That is true, that is true. </connor>
<connor> - I've played a lot of Joji, </connor>
<connor> but I think I had faces of Joji. </connor>
<connor> I like Joji a lot. </connor>
<connor> I like Joji a lot, but. </connor>
<connor> - That just sounds like
a band faces of Joji. </connor>
<joey> - I love Joji's music, but
there's only four songs </joey>
<connor> that I actually listen to. </connor>
<connor> The rest of the album,
I don't really like. </connor>
<connor> I think at least for the first five, </connor>
<connor> I've listened to like everything, </connor>
<connor> from Tempo and Parlor, Weeknd,
Daft Punk, Breakbot, Parcels. </connor>
<connor> I've listened to like everything. </connor>
<connor> And so the Parcels,
Daft Punk and Breakbot, </connor>
<connor> I can just put on their albums. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Any song and I'll have a good time. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "This is great." </garnt>
<garnt> Like if I'm in a car, those
are the three I'm playing. </garnt>
<garnt> - So this is all like recent taste, then. </garnt>
<garnt> Or as,
- Within the past five years, </garnt>
<connor> unfortunately my tastes
haven't really changed much </connor>
<garnt> in the past six years. </garnt>
<connor> It's kind of like I have phases </connor>
<connor> where I go into something else, </connor>
<connor> but it always comes back
to that type of music. </connor>
<joey> - What did you listen
to when you were a kid? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is a good question. </connor>
<connor> Well, right in the bottom
bottom right, is Biffy Clyro. </connor>
<connor> Do you know Biffy Claro? </connor>
<garnt> - No idea.
- No idea who Biffy Clyro is. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know but that
album covers is cool. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So Biffy Clyro is a Scottish rock band. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they've done a. </garnt>
<joey> - Biffy Clyro. </joey>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I'd say un-Scottish. </joey>
<connor> - Watched it for Foo Fighters a few times. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - So if you like Foo Fighters. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you want a more Scott
version of Foo Fighters. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - I might be butchering </connor>
<connor> and doing an absolute
disservice to Biffy Clyro, </connor>
<connor> but I liked Foo Fighters a
lot and the way I found them </connor>
<connor> is that a lot of my friends
in school really liked </connor>
<connor> Foo Fighters and when we were growing up, </connor>
<connor> that's the kind of stuff they liked. </connor>
<connor> And then I got into Biffy Clyro from that. </connor>
<connor> And I went to watched them live. </connor>
<joey> That was the first concert I ever went to. </joey>
<joey> - A Biffy Clyro concert? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was amazing. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, fuck it.
- I loved it so much. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I would say this is a
good album to listen to. </joey>
<joey> They had the really famous
one that came out before this. </joey>
<connor> I can't remember the name of it. </connor>
<connor> It's got like two big
colors on the front of it. </connor>
<connor> (man chuckles) </connor>
<joey> It's got the name of it. </joey>
<joey> - Do they singing like a
Scottish accent as well. </joey>
<connor> - Yes, so that's what I love about them, </connor>
<joey> - Oh, hell, yeah.
- Is that like, </joey>
<joey> you know how sometimes a
lot of bands whether they're </joey>
<connor> from Scotland, but they
just sound American somehow. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's actually like,
"Hey, yo, how yo doin?" </connor>
<connor> (blabbering, laughing) </connor>
<connor> Something like that, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - [Cameraman] Something
that I'm only looking for </connor>
<connor> is only revolution. </connor>
<connor> - That's it only revolution. </connor>
<connor> - [Cameraman] Daft Punk
first album was Homework. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Homework was the first album. </connor>
<connor> - Homework, oh shit, I
thought AM came first, my bad. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay.
- I'm fake that much. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it was their first album? </garnt>
<joey> - [Cameraman] They've
got Random Access Memory, </joey>
<joey> I thinking about RAM. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no.
- No, no. </garnt>
<connor> - Random Access Memory,
- That's probably like </connor>
<connor> an EP or something.
- Yeah, it might have been. </connor>
<connor> - EP first album.
- Oh, my bad then. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I must have. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I want
more bands to do though. </connor>
<connor> Because the one thing I
like sing in the accent </connor>
<connor> of the country that they're from. </connor>
<connor> - You should, I think you
quite like Biffy Clyro. </connor>
<connor> - Because that's what I love about, </connor>
<connor> that's what I love about
Proclaimers, right? </connor>
<connor> Cause like when they
sing The 500 Mile song, </connor>
<joey> they couldn't sound any
more fucking Scottish </joey>
<joey> than that song, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I find it so weird
when I hear an artist, </garnt>
<garnt> and you hear, you hear them sing. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you hear them speak
and there is such a dissonance </garnt>
<connor> between how they sing and how they speak. </connor>
<connor> I remember one of the first
time I heard Adele speak. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it's like the most Northern accent. </connor>
<connor> - You're British, why you surprised? </connor>
<connor> You're British. </connor>
<garnt> - Because she doesn't sound anything </garnt>
<garnt> like that which she sing. </garnt>
<joey> - Wow, probably for good reason. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Could you imagine an Adele song </garnt>
<garnt> in the accent that she speaks?
- Oh my. </garnt>
<joey> Like there's no way she would've blown up. </joey>
<joey> Cause no one would've
been able to understand </joey>
<joey> what she was saying.
- Put your body to the rain. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But like, </joey>
<connor> - Oh, Adele getting dragged to the media. </connor>
<connor> - Rolling into deep. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> Rolling in the deep I am. </joey>
<joey> Like that she wouldn't
have walked off, I'm sorry. </joey>
<garnt> - No, cause it's like, cause I had no idea </garnt>
<garnt> she was British until I heard her speak. </garnt>
<joey> And she was, then I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh this is the most Northern person </joey>
<garnt> "I've ever heard speak in my life, and," </garnt>
<joey> - I feel a lot of Australian
artists are like that too. </joey>
<garnt> Like Sia for example, </garnt>
<joey> is the most Australian sound
- I'm not sure I listen </joey>
<joey> to Sia a lot.
- Posts in an interviews. </joey>
<joey> But when she sings, everyone
thinks she's America. </joey>
<joey> We lose our accents for some
reason, I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we can't like, I find it hard to, </joey>
<garnt> do an accent, but it's not hard to. </garnt>
<garnt> For some reason it's less hard
to sing an accent, I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> It's weird, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I find it easier </garnt>
<joey> to sing in an American accent </joey>
<joey> than I do speak in an American accent. </joey>
<connor> - I don't understand
at all, how it works.` </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't how accents work. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how it works
when you sing though. </garnt>
<connor> It's a bit different register. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's why when
I hear an accent in a song, </garnt>
<garnt> it immediately like just
sticks out to me, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause you always hear like
the neutral American accent </garnt>
<garnt> with like a lot of songs. </garnt>
<garnt> So when you hear an accent
that is just anything </garnt>
<garnt> that's not like the stereotypical
neutral American accent, </garnt>
<garnt> it immediately just sticks out in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what, that's what I
want more artists to do though. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause otherwise everyone's just
gonna sound the same, right? </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, if there's
the best way to make you </connor>
<connor> as an artist stand out, is
to just sound different. </connor>
<joey> Like just sing in a different accent. </joey>
<joey> Cause then immediately you'll be like, </joey>
<joey> you'll listen to a Biffy Clyro song </joey>
<joey> and you'll be like, "Oh
they sound Scottish, </joey>
<joey> "must be a Biffy Clyro song." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean they're very, very Scottish </connor>
<joey> when you hear them. </joey>
<joey> It's fun, I love it.
- Could you imagine </joey>
<joey> if Biffy Clyro, obviously
I don't know Biffy Clyro. </joey>
<joey> But you said they kind of
sound similar to Foo Fighters? </joey>
<connor> - Well, I'd say it's
kind of in the same vein. </connor>
<joey> - Okay.
- Its kind of feeling </joey>
<connor> of the way they sing song. </connor>
<joey> - So would you say that if per chance </joey>
<connor> the Biffy Clara lead singer.
- Dies? </connor>
<connor> - Sang in an accent
- No, it wouldn't </connor>
<connor> even sound same.
- like Dave Grohl, </connor>
<joey> then it would sound
like Foo Fighters or no? </joey>
<connor> - No, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> That's weird because the
songs are so Scottish, </connor>
<connor> if you listen to them, you'll, </connor>
<connor> I think you might like them. </connor>
<connor> They kinda seem like your
kind of band actually. </connor>
<joey> You love Foo Fighters, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I love Foo Fighters. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think you'll probably like that. </joey>
<joey> - I like Foo Fighters as well. </joey>
<joey> - But you'll probably like them as well, </joey>
<connor> if you like Scottish
kind of my take on it. </connor>
<garnt> Again, I must be offending
like Biffy massive fan. </garnt>
<joey> - Massive Biffy Clyro fans? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- So shake your hands </joey>
<joey> like this.
- But like that's the only way </joey>
<joey> that I know cause I'm, </joey>
<connor> I don't understand how to talk about music </connor>
<connor> like a normal human being. </connor>
<connor> So this is the only way I
can imagine explaining it. </connor>
<connor> But also it was like the first album, </connor>
<connor> I ever bought out of like physical, </connor>
<connor> I think I only ever bought
like three albums in my life. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right, right. </garnt>
<connor> - And I think this was the first one. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think after that, I think about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I've ever bought an album. </garnt>
<connor> - I love this so much. </connor>
<connor> I remember I loaded that onto my PC. </connor>
<connor> I don't know I put it on my Xbox. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you could play the albums on Xbox </connor>
<connor> while playing another game. </connor>
<joey> I would open up that
fucking (blabbers) menu. </joey>
<joey> The fucking big one.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I will press play, the
volume was just dreadfully </joey>
<connor> like not managed correctly. </connor>
<connor> So I'd play Modern Warfare two </connor>
<connor> and just I thought that
I want you to feel it. </connor>
<connor> No, like that and I was like, it's great. </connor>
<joey> Its awesome. </joey>
<connor> - No, I had a CD player
like the fucking chunky. </connor>
<connor> - No, I had one of those two CD. </connor>
<connor> - You know, what's the
first album I bought on CD. </connor>
<connor> - What?
- What? </connor>
<connor> - Fucking Simple Plan? </connor>
<joey> - Great.
(clapping) </joey>
<connor> - Classic Joey, classic Joey. </connor>
<joey> - That album slaps, I don't
care what anyone says. </joey>
<joey> - Man, but yeah, </joey>
<joey> I have a Tame Impala as
well, I love to Tame Impala. </joey>
<joey> My favorite album is the
Slow Rush, not the other one </joey>
<joey> that everyone, that you see everywhere </joey>
<joey> and everyone talks about it.
- Oh, Currents. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the one
that everyone praises. </joey>
<connor> - Slow Rush is a good album.
- I love Slow Rush. </connor>
<connor> Breathe Deeper is not my
favorite song for Tame Impala. </connor>
<connor> I love that fucking song.
- Great song. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, driving
to Tame Impala is like </connor>
<connor> another level of enjoying it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - Have you listened to
his side project Pond? </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - It like Tame Impala you'll like that. </connor>
<connor> It's just,
- I probably pretty will. </connor>
<joey> - It's just Tame Impala but harder. </joey>
<connor> - Well, YouTube recommend
it to me, I'll find out. </connor>
<connor> - Probably not. </connor>
<connor> - You're right. </connor>
<connor> Basically, that's how my music is decided. </connor>
<connor> Have the algorithm gods
decided it's fit for me. </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> If so, yes I listen. </connor>
<connor> But unfortunately, sometimes
it recommends me artists, </connor>
<joey> there's like one song I really like. </joey>
<joey> And I check out the other
stuff and I'm like (blabbers) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's lots of artists like that. </joey>
<connor> - It's like that happens like that. </connor>
<joey> - Who is the one on the
left, above The Burner? </joey>
<connor> - Oh this is, you know them. </connor>
<joey> Snail's House. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, Snail's House, okay.
- Oh, is that Snail's House? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I love Snail's House. </joey>
<joey> - Snail's House is good. </joey>
<joey> - Again, no lyrics, let's go.
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> I didn't recognize the art. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I love Snail's House. </joey>
<joey> It's probably like if I
can encapsulate all my, </joey>
<connor> I guess I don't even
if it is a disservice, </connor>
<connor> to call it Weib Music? </connor>
<connor> It's kind of like.
- No, it is Pond </connor>
<garnt> - Weib nostalgic gaming site. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's subculture of like Weib. </garnt>
<joey> - He's half Japanese, right?
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like Weib nerdy shit. </connor>
<connor> - I like how,
- Weib nerdy shit. </connor>
<garnt> - I like how this one makes me feel. </garnt>
<connor> I like this one.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There was a phase in my life </connor>
<garnt> where I feel like I listen.
- How does it make you feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Happy. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna say happy emotion.
- Happy. </garnt>
<garnt> - So there was like,
before I moved to Japan, </garnt>
<connor> I wanna say I listened
to this for like, God, </connor>
<joey> like a whole year straight. </joey>
<connor> I must listening.
- Were you prepping </connor>
<connor> your Japan visit with some.
- With? </connor>
<joey> Before I even started the move to Japan, </joey>
<joey> I was listening to them </joey>
<joey> and then weirdly it was like.
- Fun? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I just love this album a lot. </joey>
<joey> Not this album, sorry. </joey>
<connor> I love all of his songs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Absolute all bangers. </connor>
<connor> All kind of different moods </connor>
<connor> even though like it's the same style, </connor>
<connor> I like how it, it doesn't
always feel the same. </connor>
<connor> There's a bunch of variations. </connor>
<connor> Shout out to Snail's House, banging. </connor>
<connor> If you like anime music
or anything like that </connor>
<connor> or like electronic,
you're probably like this, </connor>
<joey> it's really good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I call, I call
this genre, a Weep Call. </joey>
<connor> - Weep Call. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It's Wee.
- It is, it's like Weep Call. </connor>
<connor> - It's Weep Daft Punk? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Question mark. </joey>
<connor> I don't know.
- Weep Call. </connor>
<garnt> - There's no, there's no lyrics. </garnt>
<garnt> It's life.
- It's just a name for it. </garnt>
<connor> It is Weep Call. </connor>
<connor> - It's Weep Call.
- Weep Call. </connor>
<connor> - It feels like a rollercoaster you're on. </connor>
<connor> That you're not on it, you're not on it. </connor>
<connor> But you are a rollercoaster. </connor>
<connor> How describe? </connor>
<connor> How the fuck do I describe music? </connor>
<connor> How do you do this? </connor>
<connor> How's Anthony Fantano do this. </connor>
<joey> How, what the fuck is he doing? </joey>
<joey> - Just a lot of adjectives. </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - This is like how I describe this music. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like if you go to an artist </garnt>
<joey> if you go to an artist alley
in any convention and put that, </joey>
<joey> and take that experience, put
that in the genre of music, </joey>
<connor> that is like,
- We can, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's Weep Call basically, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty much.
- It's not anime. </garnt>
<connor> - You know that feeling
before you go to a convention, </connor>
<connor> obviously not now, cause
you're miserable adults, </connor>
<joey> a few years earlier when
you're like kind of excited, </joey>
<joey> you're like bubbly, you're like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh my God, I'm so excited." </connor>
<connor> That's the feeling, like
fucking shoved it into a job </connor>
<joey> that I can just like, anytime I want. </joey>
<connor> (burping) </connor>
<connor> I can just take it. </connor>
<connor> (moaning) </connor>
<joey> - Snail's House to me is
like what it must sound like </joey>
<joey> to live in the Kirby universe. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, as well.
- That's, </joey>
<joey> that's what it sounds like to me. </joey>
<connor> - It's like fucking your enemies come up? </connor>
<connor> (burps)
- Yes. </connor>
<connor> - Everything is like, everything is like. </connor>
<joey> - Done.
- You can suck on everything. </joey>
<joey> - Done, over.
- Everything is like round </joey>
<joey> and like bubbly and pastel
colored and like overly happy. </joey>
<joey> But in a good way.
- I could fall over. </joey>
<connor> But the floors is made of mush, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I dunno how to, that's
like in a good way. </connor>
<joey> Not unlike it's a kids way.
- No, no. </joey>
<joey> Not like a condescending way. </joey>
<joey> But like.
- I don't know </joey>
<joey> how to describe it. </joey>
<connor> - It's just like it's pillowy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, dude, it's great. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's great.
- It's such a. </connor>
<connor> If you wanna be, </connor>
<connor> feel happy, and have a good time </connor>
<connor> and you wanna feel vibes, </connor>
<garnt> trust Snail's House and
you don't want lyrics. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I honestly, sometimes
lyrics get in the way. </garnt>
<garnt> Somehow these lyrics get away. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nah, no, I disagree. </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes, sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - Someone who doesn't
even listen to lyrics, </connor>
<connor> I feel something missing
without vocal track. </connor>
<connor> - Well, wait can talk about that. </connor>
<garnt> - We can talk.
- I have other picks </garnt>
<connor> that we can talk about by the way. </connor>
<connor> The other one I wanna talk about, </connor>
<connor> I love the Weeknd and this is a weird one </connor>
<connor> because I feel very long. </connor>
<connor> Very, very long time. </connor>
<connor> Just kind of felt indifferent
towards the Weeknd. </connor>
<connor> I felt like it was that artist </connor>
<connor> that just all always got like number ones, </connor>
<connor> but like, you know it was
kinda like (blabbers) whatever. </connor>
<connor> But then like the last album came out, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "okay,
no, this is all fire." </connor>
<connor> This is all like really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> Okay, I think he's actually like insane. </connor>
<connor> And then I went back and
listened to the other stuff, </connor>
<joey> I appreciated it way more now, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - After seeing how far he's grown </joey>
<connor> and how much his albums
have like just improved. </connor>
<joey> - No, I was definitely the same. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, this
is just like another," </connor>
<connor> - The generic pop guy.
- Yeah, there's another. </connor>
<connor> - Bruno Mars X Figure.
- Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> Cause like when I listened
to House of Balloons, </connor>
<connor> which was his first album, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Ah, this is like, it's good. </connor>
<connor> "But it's like nothing special." </connor>
<connor> And then after Hours came out, </connor>
<joey> with like blended lights and I like it. </joey>
<joey> That album, I was like, "Okay,
okay I see it, I see it." </joey>
<joey> And then the new album was like, </joey>
<connor> "All right, solidified
it, you're pretty good." </connor>
<connor> - Dude, this album, it's
been like out for like, </connor>
<joey> I don't know, like two
months at this point. </joey>
<connor> And I've literally just
listened to that album nonstop. </connor>
<connor> It's so good, it's so good.
- I think The Weeknd actually </connor>
<joey> is right now the most
streamed artist on Spotify. </joey>
<joey> - It wouldn't surprise me. </joey>
<connor> - He's number one right now. </connor>
<connor> - This album has so
many bangers that like, </connor>
<joey> it's so fun talking this album to people </joey>
<joey> because everyone I've spoke to </joey>
<joey> has a different favorite song. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's not like other
albums where I'd say, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, everyone likes X song the most, </joey>
<joey> "and it's very predictable." </joey>
<joey> But it's like, everyone is just telling me </joey>
<joey> about other songs they like the most. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh yeah, that
one is a banger too." </connor>
<connor> - That's the best kind
of artist though, right? </connor>
<connor> Where it's like.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you can't pick like a top, </connor>
<connor> I would think it's really difficult </connor>
<connor> for someone like The Weeknd, </connor>
<connor> to make like a greatest hits album. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true.
- Because it's like, </connor>
<connor> which songs do we not
put in that album, right. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<joey> - Because every song's great. </joey>
<connor> - Also I love that like, </connor>
<connor> I wasn't paying attention to lyrics, </connor>
<connor> but then I started actually
paying attention to the lyrics, </connor>
<connor> this current album, I'm like,
"Man, this is really sad." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What's going on with this man? </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Yeah, I've gotta see a woman </connor>
<connor> "and she's fucking another man." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then he's like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm so sad that she's
fucking another man." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "What, what!" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "I loved her. </connor>
<joey> "And then she stepped on my heart." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Whoa!" </joey>
<joey> - While in middies it's
like funk bass like plays </joey>
<connor> in the background.
- And then he's like, </connor>
<joey> "Get that harmer, get
over, it's so good though. </joey>
<connor> "It's so good, it's so good." </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, I feel that it. </connor>
<connor> - He's like, </connor>
<connor> "I wanna marry her bush,
we're best friends now." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Oh no, oh no, oh no. </connor>
<garnt> "What's going on, this is so sad." </garnt>
<connor> - It's funny I love that.
- It's so fun, I love. </connor>
<connor> - How often do you listen to like mu, </connor>
<connor> lyrics in never in songs.
- Never, literally, never. </connor>
<connor> - So what made you listen
to the lyrics in this song, </connor>
<connor> in this album?
- And I listened to it </connor>
<connor> so many times, after a
point I started like, </connor>
<connor> just that he would say stuff
and I was like, "Hold on." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like The Rock behind me.
- Rewind that back, </connor>
<connor> rewind that back. </connor>
<connor> - I listened to,
- Rewind that, rewind that. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "Hold on, what, what?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Jesus Christ man." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God." </connor>
<connor> - And then.
- But we're like, </connor>
<connor> we're his therapist, you
know, we're just hearing it. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly.
- Bo Burnham? </connor>
<connor> You know, Bo Burnham
was one of those things </connor>
<connor> where you kind of have
to listen to the lyrics </connor>
<connor> to enjoy the music.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it really made me
see that like, "Okay." </connor>
<connor> Cause to me, comedy music before was like </connor>
<connor> just fucking Lonely Island. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like "Weird AI" Yankovic,
kinda thing, not really. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- I mean it's, </connor>
<joey> it was like parody music. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Where they were kind of, for me, </joey>
<connor> it would like they would take a song </connor>
<connor> or an established genre of music </connor>
<connor> and just kind of like parody that. </connor>
<garnt> On like a surface level,
if that makes sense? </garnt>
<garnt> - And Tim Minchin is obviously very, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone always loved him.
- Loved him, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like even there that music
I wasn't like super into it </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> When I've watched my Bo Burnham
specials like all of them. </garnt>
<garnt> Like at least four plus times now, </garnt>
<garnt> and I just love it to death. </garnt>
<garnt> And I really like the
songs, they're really funny, </garnt>
<connor> but also really good. </connor>
<connor> Some of them are like absolute bangers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I love the one at the end of Make Happy. </connor>
<connor> You've got the one where it is, </connor>
<connor> but it's when he's talking
about Burritos had put the hand </connor>
<connor> in the Prickle Ken, I can't
remember it, so to say. </connor>
<connor> (chuckling)
What's the fucking term? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing)
- That sounds </connor>
<connor> like something you'd really do. </connor>
<connor> - But it's so good though. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's like, it starts off as a joke </connor>
<connor> and then it turns into this whole, </connor>
<connor> the struggle of being a creative </connor>
<connor> and what people expect things from you </connor>
<connor> and how do you struggle with that, </connor>
<connor> And he's somebody who creates stuff. </connor>
<joey> I was like, "Oh shit,
whoa this is fucking. </joey>
<joey> "Whoa, this is weird." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Fuck it. </connor>
<connor> - Did you ever like get
into Lonely Island though, </connor>
<connor> back in then? </connor>
<joey> - I loved Lonely Island. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right.
- And I was, </joey>
<joey> when I was like 14, I
thought this shit was like </joey>
<connor> peak comedy and music.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh my God, he
threw it on the ground." </connor>
<garnt> Oh my dude, </garnt>
<garnt> that song is so good.
- Oh my God, </garnt>
<connor> he put a dick in a box? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Like, what the fuck! </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, "This song, </garnt>
<connor> "is talking about three song."
- We're just advancing. </connor>
<joey> Damn, man. </joey>
<connor> - This song's about three songs? </connor>
<connor> (sarcastic laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know, cause I was a kid and
I thought she was hilarious. </connor>
<garnt> Like I just had sex. </garnt>
<connor> I thought that was like
the peak comedy, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Nah, for me it was like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm on a bar."
- I'm on a bar. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, just like heard T-Pain </joey>
<garnt> in there, for no fucking reason. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm,
- It was that and Like a Boss. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Like a Boss. </connor>
<connor> - Also remember when those were like </connor>
<connor> the most viewed fucking videos on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they were like, I literally
remember cause I have this </connor>
<connor> weird memory of me playing Black Cops 1 </connor>
<connor> and just playing Lonely
Island songs on repeat </connor>
<joey> while I'm playing and I
literally did nothing, </joey>
<joey> but listen to the Lonely Island. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, everyone was like that </joey>
<joey> in the early stages of YouTube though. </joey>
<joey> - But to me it was like Bo
Burnham is like it kind of took </joey>
<joey> the best of like comedy and
then added it with like amazing, </joey>
<joey> funny standup with
amazing lyrics and great, </joey>
<garnt> and I love the song. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like one minute long. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the fucking Jeff
Bezos song from inside. </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking love that one.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You gotta listen to that. </connor>
<connor> - All right.
- It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I've only seen inside, </connor>
<connor> but obviously it is one of the few artists </connor>
<connor> where I did listen to their
songs, cause he is like. </connor>
<garnt> I guess, I dunno how
you categorize or put, </garnt>
<joey> how do you categorize these kind of songs? </joey>
<joey> But it's like comedy songs. </joey>
<joey> But it also like, his songs
also make you think, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Like the message </joey>
<joey> kind of like sticks </joey>
<joey> with you for a while.
- It's funny and deep. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Actually the best of all.
- Like the best of all. </joey>
<joey> - It's too, is it too deep for you? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> But it's the Evan Gillion of comedy music. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Just shut the fuck up. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, know. </garnt>
<connor> I wanted put it on, cause
I wanted to talk about it </connor>
<connor> and I thought that </connor>
<connor> it was really interesting
- Yeah, he's great. </connor>
<connor> - And you know, there's a lot of artists </connor>
<connor> I could have put on. </connor>
<connor> I could have put a, I love Pendulum. </connor>
<connor> - Pendulum is fantastic.
- I wanted to see Pendulum. </connor>
<garnt> - I almost put Pendulum. </garnt>
<garnt> - I went to watch Pendulum live </garnt>
<joey> and it was probably like their greatest </joey>
<joey> fucking experience ever.
- I'm sure, they're also good </joey>
<connor> - I nearly died like four times
being stepped on to death. </connor>
<garnt> But it was amazing.
- That must, </garnt>
<garnt> that must have been like audio crack, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude it was insane. </connor>
<connor> So I went to go and watch Pendulum </connor>
<connor> it was in a warehouse, like
this concrete warehouse. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it was just like,
some kind of Satanic ritual </connor>
<connor> that looked like. </connor>
<connor> Cause it was just, this thing was so tall. </connor>
<connor> So you just see this
massive hunk of concrete </connor>
<garnt> and then just depends on
just going hard on scene. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Holy shit. </joey>
<joey> When I remember when Tarantula
came on, that was insane. </joey>
<connor> Everyone insane.
- Holy. </connor>
<connor> - It was just like, </connor>
<connor> I've never been in such a
like, just intense atmosphere. </connor>
<connor> It was so fun. </connor>
<connor> I don't normally like going to concerts, </connor>
<connor> but that almost really fun. </connor>
<connor> Cause I need the lyrics as well, somehow, </connor>
<connor> so I brought 'em into my memory. </connor>
<garnt> Cause I listened.
- Are there that many lyrics </garnt>
<connor> through Pendulum songs?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I can't remember.
- In some songs. </joey>
<connor> - I mean everyone.
- With Color, it's very easy. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone remembers the
opening to Witchcraft. </connor>
<connor> That's the one song everyone
would just start singing. </connor>
<joey> - She Ran, She Ran?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I've been listening to the Pendulum </joey>
<connor> since I was like fucking 12 </connor>
<joey> and I would listen them on and off. </joey>
<joey> - They were pretty inescapable back when. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Blood Sugar. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember the remix.
- Propane Nightmares as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Sugar was, Prodigy of
what am I talking about </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like Pendulum and Prodigy. </garnt>
<connor> - Prodigy that's it.
- Prodigy, </connor>
<connor> was that fucking massive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I like, they were
inescapable at a point where, </connor>
<connor> like I remember, like they came out, </connor>
<connor> as like in the age where I
just started going clubbing </connor>
<garnt> and like, you'd hear a Pendulum song </garnt>
<garnt> and a Prodigy song, at least
once in every fucking club </garnt>
<garnt> we goes, man.
- Pendulum is so good man, </garnt>
<garnt> so good. </garnt>
<connor> But I said like Pendulum was
definitely my early inspiration </connor>
<connor> before I found I started
really getting into Daft Punk. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously Intastella, is amazing. </connor>
<connor> And all the music videos
just go so goddamn well </connor>
<joey> with the songs and I just, </joey>
<joey> - Not the movie, the album. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I understand that perfectly </joey>
<joey> - Not the soundtrack to the movie. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's amazing. </connor>
<joey> - And then you got ANRI. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so this is just like city pop. </connor>
<connor> This is the, I can't
Stop The Loneliness song. </connor>
<connor> Have you heard that one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love that song. </connor>
<connor> ♪ I can't stop the loneliness. ♪ </connor>
<connor> I dunno why I love that song. </connor>
<joey> - Oh man, we're gonna get
coffee, we're be right back. </joey>
<connor> You're too good.
- That's why </connor>
<connor> I'm singing it bad. </connor>
<connor> I'm singing it bad on purpose. </connor>
<connor> - You're too good. </connor>
<connor> - But I love, I love city pop. </connor>
<connor> Obviously, I dunno how to
encapsulate all of city pop. </connor>
<connor> I could just put plastic
love and call it day, </connor>
<connor> but, you know, I feel like
city pop has definitely </connor>
<connor> blown up in the past. </connor>
<connor> What, four or five years, it's gone crazy. </connor>
<connor> Even The Weeknd on his new album, Samples. </connor>
<connor> A lot of city pop.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's so Goddamn good. </connor>
<connor> It's like city pop with
the vocals for God. </connor>
<connor> It's just amazing, it's so good. </connor>
<connor> And I mean, I absolutely adore city pop. </connor>
<connor> It makes me nostalgic for that
time that I lived in Japan </connor>
<connor> in the '80s, Strait outta the Window. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - And was in the bubble period. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] It was a good. </connor>
<garnt> - It was a good time. </garnt>
<connor> - Was it literally Plastic Love
that literally like kind of </connor>
<connor> reinvigorated this city pop trends </connor>
<connor> that's happening right now.
- I think so </connor>
<garnt> cause used to hear city pop occasionally, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't think anyone
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - The movement hadn't really taken off. </connor>
<connor> I think Plastic Love is
what really got people </connor>
<connor> into thinking abouts
listening to other songs. </connor>
<connor> cause I definitely heard city love, </connor>
<connor> city pop songs before this.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - But never enough to make me
be like, "Is this a genre?" </connor>
<connor> I dunno what this is. </connor>
<joey> - and so, it was also
just like such a mystery </joey>
<joey> as to why it was that song that blew up. </joey>
<joey> I've seen like documentaries
on YouTube about like, </joey>
<joey> why did Plastic Love blow up and shit. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, because. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like,
"Cause it's a good song." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like,
- Nothing more. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also like the YouTube
algorithm just works </garnt>
<garnt> in fucking mysterious ways. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, there's two ways
I get recommended song </garnt>
<connor> that's memes or YouTube algorithm. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly memes is like
a really underrated way </garnt>
<connor> to discover new music. </connor>
<connor> Cause a lot of memes.
- Bro, great pop, </connor>
<connor> it's so good. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of meme songs are
actually like good songs. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- That you don't, </connor>
<connor> you'd forget that they're good songs </connor>
<connor> - That's true.
- Because you've just heard </connor>
<garnt> it base boosted so many times. </garnt>
<connor> - Baby I'm Yours is an ironically </connor>
<connor> like a fucking amazing song
and it's so fucking stupid </connor>
<connor> that I can't listen to the song, </connor>
<connor> without thinking of ladies
and gentlemen, we got it him. </connor>
<connor> And the fall like,
(blabbering) it's awful. </connor>
<connor> Ruin my life. </connor>
<garnt> - No, cause I remember when I heard, </garnt>
<garnt> first heard that song,
- Shut up, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - It got recommended to me on
YouTube and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh it's the meme song." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was waiting for like
the base boost to come in </garnt>
<joey> and then it just, it was just the song. </joey>
<joey> And I remember thinking, </joey>
<joey> "Damn, why did they bass boost </joey>
<joey> "this fucking masterpiece man?" </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like taking the Mona
Lisa and like spitting on it. </joey>
<connor> You know?
- Un-ironically </connor>
<connor> like crap dance song. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's a good song. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the Shooting Star song. </garnt>
<garnt> Remember that one? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh that was a good song. </garnt>
<connor> Sounds good.
(shooting star beats) </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- You know that one. </connor>
<connor> That one was like good. </connor>
<connor> Actually.
- That's was good. </connor>
<connor> That's a great song. </connor>
<connor> They're great songs. </connor>
<connor> - Right, well that's my three by three. </connor>
<connor> Go and check some of them out,
- All right. </connor>
<connor> - You might like it. </connor>
<connor> If you like Daft Punk, you'll
probably like a lot of these. </connor>
<connor> - Others are Parcels. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you shouldn't try it. </connor>
<connor> I love Parcels, man. </connor>
<connor> Some of their songs are so fucking good. </connor>

<connor> - All right, well that's my
initial Trash Tasting in music. </connor>
<garnt> Thank God that's outta way.
- Initial Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - And before we move on, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously you talked
about a lot of your music </garnt>
<joey> that you're into now, but like what? </joey>
<joey> I'm curious were you listen to as a kid? </joey>
<garnt> Do you remember, or did you just not want </garnt>
<garnt> any of them on.
- Plague, plague. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, as all as you can remember. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I like Foo Fighters. </connor>
<connor> That was a big one, Biffy
Clyro, Pendulum, Prodigy. </connor>
<connor> Then I had that weird
phase where I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, Calvin Harris is really good." </connor>
<connor> (chuckling) </connor>
<garnt> - I was actually like this close </garnt>
<connor> with Calvin Harrison.
- No (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Just to be like,
- Well, did I end racism. </connor>
<connor> He did end racism.
- I would have. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, he did.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I would be like, if I
didn't go through a phase </garnt>
<garnt> where I listened to a
fucked ton of Calvin Harris. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, I'm not immune
to shit taste, right? </connor>
<connor> There was a point where
I listened to a lot, </connor>
<joey> a lot of Calvin Harris. </joey>
<joey> - Did you listen to a lot
of David Guetta as well? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God, sure I did. </joey>
<connor> You know when you listen to that </connor>
<connor> - Swedish House Mafia?
- The Aeroplanes </connor>
<connor> in the night sky song? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're like, how about
I, I just want all music </connor>
<garnt> that sounds exactly like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Like IPS, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - When I have like no, no
fucking personality of my own, </garnt>
<garnt> I would just listen to
what the charts told me </garnt>
<garnt> was good music.
- Well, the Billboard was like </garnt>
<garnt> the Billboard top 100.
- It's top 20. </garnt>
<connor> I wanna, I wanna fit in. </connor>
<connor> I wanna see normal, I'm
gonna say I like this song. </connor>
<connor> I love that new Calvin Harry song. </connor>
<connor> I felt like I almost like
listening to that music </connor>
<connor> just so I could have, </connor>
<connor> I could keep up with what
people were talking about, </connor>
<connor> - You keep up with, yeah.
- Cause I didn't wanna get </connor>
<garnt> bullied for like, you're
like Scottish bands </garnt>
<connor> that no one talked about.
- No, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck's wrong with that? </connor>
<connor> - Well, you know, </connor>
<garnt> it's back when,
- A lot liked it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was a lot of social pressure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like me listening to Calvin
Harris was the equivalent </garnt>
<garnt> of me watching football matches. </garnt>
<garnt> So I could have something to talk about. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, "Oh yeah, you see a," </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you see a latest football match? </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh yeah."
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The you hear Calvin
Harrison song came out. </garnt>
<garnt> That was pretty good, wasn't it? </garnt>
<connor> - But I feel like I never
really had defined music taste </connor>
<connor> cause I was kind of, you know. </connor>
<connor> Well, back then I had to find
a means to get ahold of it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that often was a big limiting factor </connor>
<connor> on what I could discover. </connor>
<joey> - I did the opposite. </joey>
<joey> I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh I listened to that
recent Calvin Harris song, </joey>
<connor> "but its shit innit." </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I've never had.
- It's bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - Well, you have good taste show. </joey>
<joey> You,
- Shit tasting music. </joey>
<garnt> Shit taste.
- You have good taste as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I didn't even like to think that. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, I didn't even listen to it. </connor>
<connor> All right, I'm just
giving you a hard time. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - All right, we should we
get on with the next pick. </joey>
<joey> - All right.
- All right. </joey>
<connor> - Do you wanna pick it or should I pick? </connor>
<connor> - You can go for it, man. </connor>
<connor> Meal gone, it doesn't really matter. </connor>
<garnt> - Matters too me. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's not gonna matter. </connor>
<connor> - I see a T. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's me. </joey>
<joey> - Thank God, you're saved, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, thank you. </garnt>
<joey> Thank God, Joey can carry the podcast </joey>
<joey> after I finished talking about that. </joey>
<joey> - My pleasure.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> So how I tried to pick
this, I tried to pick this. </joey>
<garnt> I tried to pick music, and artist, </garnt>
<garnt> and songs that really defines
every stage of my life. </garnt>
<garnt> So this might be a little bit random. </garnt>
<connor> - We're gonna see pepper
take the full album. </connor>
<garnt> What do you mean diaper music? </garnt>
<connor> Like, let's see, witty spider? </connor>
<connor> - Bob the Builder soundtrack. </connor>
<connor> - It was a cold summer night. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, the age of three. </connor>
<connor> I decided it was on a summer. </connor>
<connor> - You know, twinkle, twinkle, little star. </connor>
<connor> Fucking banger.
- Thomas the Tank. </connor>
<garnt> - What can I fucking say? </garnt>
<connor> - Has an absolute banger soundtrack. </connor>
<garnt> There's no like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bob the Builder </garnt>
<garnt> that opening was like.
(Connor laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Postman Pat.
- Bob the Builder still slap. </connor>
<connor> - Postman Pat. </connor>
<connor> - Postman Pat, I fucking love that song. </connor>
<garnt> - All right, Ashley, put
it up, Ashley, put it up. </garnt>
<garnt> Go on. </garnt>
<connor> - This motherfucker will
not leave my record. </connor>
<connor> (Joey, Garnt laughing, clapping) </connor>
<connor> - Yes, yes. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So I guess, I'll go through it from right, </garnt>
<joey> from left to right, sorry. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] I wonder all of these. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] You know, all these? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know the one.
- I do get. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] I don't know this one. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't know that one? </garnt>
<garnt> That's the, that's one of the two Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> ones from their charts. </garnt>
<garnt> I know three Japanese ones. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's true.
- So top left is Muse. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Really? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> We got we got Muse.
- You know what I'm saying? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] We got Muse
and then we have Bradio </connor>
<connor> and then we have The Kooks or is it? </connor>
<connor> No, it's just Kooks, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Kooks, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] We have The Killers. </connor>
<garnt> We have Michael Jackson. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] MJ. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] We have MJ, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> We have Zutomayo. </garnt>
<garnt> We have Daft Punk, Arctic Monkeys </garnt>
<garnt> and obviously the Fooly Cooly Sound. </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno why I thought
those Ben's still off, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just saying.
(Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, Ben still does not,
does not like that bag. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Damn Ben still got the." </joey>
<garnt> All right.
- All right. </garnt>
<connor> So, where do you want to start off? </connor>
<connor> - Dude, who Kooks? </connor>
<connor> I like 'em that much. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so the reason I
put The Kooks there, right? </joey>
<joey> Or Kooks I can't. </joey>
<joey> Is it the Kooks or is it just kooks? </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't matter.
- I'm obviously a fan. </joey>
<connor> - [Cameraman] Is that Kooks? </connor>
<connor> - Is it the Kooks? </connor>
<connor> - I thought it was the Kooks.
- That's what I thought. </connor>
<connor> This is specifically inside
in, the inside out the album. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's one of the
few albums I actually </connor>
<connor> have listened to all of the way. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And the reason I put the Kooks in there, </joey>
<joey> is because they are originally
a band from Brighton, right? </joey>
<joey> - We gotta represent our home country. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, exactly. </connor>
<connor> But its like, I did not know this. </connor>
<connor> I did not know this for the longest time. </connor>
<connor> But listening to their music </connor>
<connor> and listening to this album, especially. </connor>
<connor> Before I found out they
were from Brighton, </connor>
<connor> I was just like fuck, </connor>
<connor> this literally epitomizes
the Brighton vibe. </connor>
<connor> Unlike what it is like being a teenager </connor>
<connor> growing up in Brighton. </connor>
<connor> It literally epitomizes
the vibe of going to </connor>
<connor> like this random fucking beach party, </connor>
<connor> or just going to a random house
party in England sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - That privileged lifestyle. </connor>
<connor> trying to pick up chicks or just you know, </connor>
<connor> just heavily binge drinking or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Like if I had to pick
a show, for example, </connor>
<connor> a TV show that epitomized,
British teenage life, </connor>
<connor> it is The Inbetweeners. </connor>
<connor> If you've seen The Inbetweeners, </connor>
<connor> I've not seen a more
accurate representation </connor>
<connor> of what it is to be like growing up, </connor>
<connor> growing up at around like college age, </connor>
<connor> which college age is kinda
like high school age, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And to me, The Kooks is,
if you listen to this album, </connor>
<connor> it is growing up in Brighton college age. </connor>
<connor> So about 16 to about 16 to 18 years old. </connor>
<garnt> And that's why it's on there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like I only know one song. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think there were like
two big songs on there. </garnt>
<garnt> There's like Naive. </garnt>
<connor> And like.
- Yeah, Naive. </connor>
<connor> Say naive. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's really like,
- Perfect accent. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like really drawn out. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like every, every word, I think. </connor>
<connor> - And I think just like
She Moves in Her Own Way. </connor>
<joey> That's the other side.
- Oh, I know that song. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> ♪ Oh, oh. ♪ </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That one, that one is
like burned into my head. </garnt>
<connor> - It is because.
- It all the time in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - That was the song that like
introduced me to the Kooks. </garnt>
<garnt> But I feel like those are
the two most, like Naive </garnt>
<connor> and She Moves in Her Own Way, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I like the two most poppy
songs in their album </connor>
<connor> because definitely their
later albums, they got like, </connor>
<connor> they like way got way, like way
on the poppy side of things. </connor>
<connor> They were kind of like, </connor>
<connor> kinda like a Maroon 5 in that sense. </connor>
<connor> You compare early Maroon 5 albums </connor>
<joey> to the later Maroon 5 albums. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, this is,"
- like night and day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this is night and day. </joey>
<joey> This is like, okay. </joey>
<joey> There was a point where I like Maroon 5 </joey>
<joey> and then there's just like
billboard 100 Maroon 5. </joey>
<joey> You know?
- You know like, </joey>
<garnt> - Does she moves like Jacamo. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't like. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, you're right. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't like sugar? </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't like sugar? </garnt>
<garnt> They're going soon. </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I love sugar. </connor>
<garnt> - But I will stick off
for like early Maroon 5. </garnt>
<garnt> I think early Maroon 5 was
actually pretty damn good. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't really know </garnt>
<garnt> what else to say about the Kooks. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why the Kooks is on there. </garnt>
<garnt> If you want to have a.
- It's a good band, eh? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's a good band,
it's a good Indie band. </garnt>
<garnt> So a lot of these, a lot of these, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of bands I wanted
to put on were of course, </garnt>
<garnt> Indie bands, especially a lot
of Indie bands from England, </garnt>
<joey> I guess, because I did, I did go through, </joey>
<joey> I think the period of life,
my life, where I went, </joey>
<joey> where I listened to the
most music is probably </joey>
<joey> in between high school and university </joey>
<joey> where I listened to a lot
of fucking Indie bands. </joey>
<joey> And a lot of that was
because I was actually </joey>
<joey> in a band myself. </joey>
<joey> I don't, I dunno if I've,
- Were you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I dunno if I've
ever talked about this. </joey>
<joey> - No, you've never talked about this. </joey>
<joey> - We've never talked about this. </joey>
<connor> - Have I ever, never mentioned </connor>
<connor> this to you guys?
- Never mentioned it. </connor>
<joey> What did you play.
- What did you play? </joey>
<joey> - I play guitar. </joey>
<connor> - What?
- Are you serious. </connor>
<connor> - I'm serious, I'm serious.
- I didn't know this. </connor>
<connor> Can you still play guitar? </connor>
<garnt> - Why have we not started a band? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean.
- Do you know how long </connor>
<joey> I've been waiting. </joey>
<connor> - Me on vocals?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Joey on.
- No, Connor on vocals, </joey>
<joey> obviously.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt on guitar </joey>
<joey> And I'll just fill the rest.
- Whatever, Joey's the prince. </joey>
<connor> You can do everything else. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Have I never mentioned this before? </garnt>
<connor> - No.
- Never, never mentioned this. </connor>
<joey> - I must have. </joey>
<joey> - You've mentioned that </joey>
<joey> you used to play guitar like a little bit. </joey>
<connor> - This feels like, so
you should mention more. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - This feels like a personality trick. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel betrayed that you
haven't mentioned this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess I'll go again. </garnt>
<garnt> Tell again to this story then. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, let's start right at the beginning. </garnt>
<joey> - Next, you gonna say that you
were a member of the Kooks. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I was one of them. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolutely Garnt was a
platinum selling artist. </connor>
<garnt> - So I guess the reason
I just wanted to learn </garnt>
<connor> how to play guitar in the first place, </connor>
<connor> is my first choice on that, it's Muse. </connor>
<connor> - I love the Muse.
- I remember the first time </connor>
<connor> hearing Plug in Baby, and
just hearing that riff. </connor>
<connor> - Ugh. </connor>
<connor> - And like just something. </connor>
<connor> - God like. </connor>
<connor> - Something just clicked in my mind. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "I need
to be able to play this." </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> I need to be able to play this. </connor>
<connor> And like I remember before, </connor>
<connor> my mom had always tried
to get me to learn guitar, </connor>
<connor> cause she's just like, </connor>
<connor> I really like people playing guitar. </connor>
<connor> Oh cool. </connor>
<connor> You know, my mom thinks this is cool </connor>
<connor> when I'm just like, she set
me for like guitar lessons </connor>
<connor> as a kid and I never
really took them seriously. </connor>
<connor> I was just like, "I'm doing
this cause my mom wants me </connor>
<connor> "to do it." </connor>
<garnt> I can play fucking Oasis, Wonderwall, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the fuck, </garnt>
<joey> - Which I would argue is the
only song you need to know. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, the only
song you need to know. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I was just like, "Whatever." </garnt>
<connor> And we only own a acoustic
guitar at the time. </connor>
<joey> And the I went, I remember I
went into secondary school, </joey>
<joey> which is like just, I guess
just before high school age, </joey>
<connor> in the UK or is it high school age? </connor>
<connor> I dunno, secondary school. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I remember the first
time hearing Plug in Baby. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Why did they never teach us </connor>
<connor> "how to play this in guitar lessons? </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck!" </connor>
<connor> I know how to play a
barcode, a bar chords, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - what do I need to do to
learn how to play this? </connor>
<connor> And so the first thing I did was I, </connor>
<connor> - Ditch your acoustic. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I ditched my acoustic. </connor>
<connor> I signed up for guitar lessons, </connor>
<connor> in my secondary school. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Mother, I would like
an electric guitar now." </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Did she get you one? </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - Did she get you one? </connor>
<connor> - I remember we got a fucking
cheap ass electric guitar </connor>
<connor> from like,
- Amazon basics. </connor>
<connor> - No, not even Amazon basics. </connor>
<connor> I got one lap that was
on like a carbon sale </connor>
<connor> or something like that.
- Thought of that. </connor>
<connor> - Which was.
- Which is a trick. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> That did a trick. </connor>
<connor> So I can't even remember
what my first guitar was. </connor>
<joey> It was a shit guitar. </joey>
<joey> It was one where I had to like replace </joey>
<joey> all of the fucking strings on the guitar. </joey>
<joey> Cause all of the strings
were like rusted already. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh my gosh. </joey>
<joey> - Like at that point, I didn't even know </joey>
<joey> how to like properly tune or
change the strings of a guitar. </joey>
<joey> So my teacher at the time
had to teach me how to do it. </joey>
<joey> I mean that's when I like, </joey>
<connor> that's when I like first
properly got into learning </connor>
<connor> how to play the guitar, </connor>
<connor> and at that point, as the
point where I was building up </connor>
<connor> my skill level to you know,
be able to play Plug in Baby, </connor>
<connor> which eventually I did. </connor>
<connor> - Hell, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then, actually now
that I think about it, </connor>
<connor> once I learn how to play Plug in Baby, </connor>
<garnt> that my drive to improve my skill level, </garnt>
<garnt> just kinda just stopped. </garnt>
<joey> - I have reached peak top. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm like you know when you,
- There's never a need </garnt>
<connor> to play it again. </connor>
<garnt> - You know, when I like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know when you've reached
the goal you set for yourself </garnt>
<garnt> and I just never found a
next goal, to set for myself. </garnt>
<connor> So for me, it was just like play guitar, </connor>
<connor> to play Plug in Baby, I can do it now. </connor>
<connor> Mother, I can stop playing the guitar now. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- Disposing of this. </connor>
<garnt> - I was one of the play guitar hero </garnt>
<connor> more than one of the play guitar. </connor>
<connor> [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And then, so then in that
time, one of my friends, </garnt>
<garnt> he wanted to start a band and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Why not? </garnt>
<garnt> "I've got nothing bad to do at this time. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I can play the guitar. </garnt>
<garnt> "I might as well use it for some," </garnt>
<joey> - First first day lessons. </joey>
<joey> Do you know, Plug in Baby? </joey>
<garnt> - Tickle, tickle little star,
- We can play that. </garnt>
<joey> - And so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I joined because
I wasn't doing really, </joey>
<joey> doing anything with the guitar
aside from trying to learn </joey>
<joey> how to play Plug in Baby. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, "Maybe
I'll just join the guitar, </joey>
<joey> "maybe I'll just join a band for fun." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I don't think
we were the greatest band, </connor>
<connor> but you know, 'em after me.
- Did you ever play? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> We played like a bunch of gigs. </connor>
<connor> Actually I got like,
- What? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I've like, I think the
biggest crowd we played in </connor>
<connor> was kind of like 500 to a thousand people. </connor>
<connor> - What!
- What? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - What?
- Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - How have you never told the story? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so I remember when we were tryna </garnt>
<garnt> think of a band name. </garnt>
<joey> I think we have like a
fucking stupid band name. </joey>
<joey> Okay.
- They're always stupid, </joey>
<joey> trust me.
- Our band name. </joey>
<joey> We're like try to brainstorm
a bunch of fucking band names </joey>
<connor> and nothing just seemed
to click because nothing, </connor>
<connor> everything sounded either like too metal </connor>
<connor> or too campy or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And then we just went on, </connor>
<connor> we just went with the name,
Nine and A Half Pounds. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Because the month before my mate, </connor>
<connor> one of the lead singer went on a diet </connor>
<connor> and he lost nine and a half pounds, </connor>
<connor> and that was like, we were
just like, "You know what? </connor>
<connor> "We don't know what we're
gonna call our band. </connor>
<connor> "Let's just use this as just the name </connor>
<connor> "until we think of the
actual name for the band." </connor>
<joey> And then that just, </joey>
<joey> and then that was just like,
- That's a amazing. </joey>
<joey> - As with a lot of names </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it just sticks, right?
- You pick a fill name </garnt>
<garnt> and you just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can't be us a stranger now." </garnt>
<connor> - So you would just like play any song? </connor>
<garnt> What kind of songs did you play? </garnt>
<connor> - So I mean.
- Muse. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, just Muse? </connor>
<connor> - No, I mean, we wrote our own songs. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - So we'd go. </connor>
<joey> So my mate had, we went
to the drummer's house </joey>
<joey> because our drummer, </joey>
<joey> - You always gather at
the drummer's house, </joey>
<joey> - You always gather at
the drummer's house. </joey>
<joey> Cause you can bring your fucking guitar, </joey>
<connor> you can bring your bass or
whatever to someone's house. </connor>
<connor> You can't transport a drum kit everywhere. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> So at first we went to the
drummer's house to practice </connor>
<connor> and then, and write songs. </connor>
<joey> And eventually we had this really </joey>
<joey> like fucking old music studio
that friend of a friend </joey>
<connor> of a friend's dad owned,
you know that kinda thing? </connor>
<connor> - That's pretty cool. </connor>
<connor> - And you walk in, it's like a back alley </connor>
<connor> and like the fucking door hinges, </connor>
<connor> like when broken in 10
million times or something. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "I
might get stabbed here, </connor>
<connor> "but they have a drum kit
and a recording studio here." </connor>
<connor> - Right, right.
- It's so cool. </connor>
<joey> - So whatever, let's just,
- That's amazing. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember the
biggest gig we played, </joey>
<connor> was like, we signed up to,
what was the equivalent </connor>
<connor> of a battle of the bands kind of deal? </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck. </connor>
<joey> Bro, you had Anatomy Arc? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like,
- This is just a Beck. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, part of the reason </garnt>
<garnt> why I got so into Beck
and why Beck was one </garnt>
<garnt> of my favorite.
- How the fuck, </garnt>
<connor> didn't you say this when
you were talking about band? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I think I did mention it. </connor>
<connor> - You did not.
- You didn't. </connor>
<garnt> - I must have mentioned this. </garnt>
<joey> - No.
- You didn't not. </joey>
<joey> I would remember if you were like, </joey>
<joey> "By the way I was in a battle
of bands and performed," </joey>
<garnt> - I think I would remember the
name, nine and a half pounds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so we were just a band for fun. </garnt>
<garnt> We weren't taking this seriously. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - But we met like a lot of bands </garnt>
<garnt> who were fucking amazing
that came out of our school. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I guess part of the other
reason why we formed a band </garnt>
<garnt> was because we are, the school I went to </garnt>
<garnt> was a performing art school. </garnt>
<garnt> So a lot of people there were doing, </garnt>
<garnt> were doing performing arts, </garnt>
<garnt> whether it was theater
or music or something. </garnt>
<garnt> So there were some people in my school, </garnt>
<garnt> and like my classmates,
who were taking music, </garnt>
<garnt> really, really seriously. </garnt>
<connor> We were just like, "Whatever,
I'm learning guitar. </connor>
<connor> "I'll just play in, </connor>
<connor> "I'll just play in the band </connor>
<connor> "because whatever, that
seems like a cool way </connor>
<connor> "to spend my time." </connor>
<connor> And so I remember for
this Battle of The Bands, </connor>
<connor> we literally had to do audition </connor>
<connor> to get into this battle of bands, right. </connor>
<connor> And it was a pretty big deal at the time </connor>
<connor> because this gig was pretty famous </connor>
<connor> for like a lot of students. </connor>
<connor> And there was like, there was, </connor>
<connor> sometimes there would even
be people from music labels </connor>
<connor> who would attend events like this. </connor>
<connor> - That's cool, though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So we weren't expecting
anything to come out of this. </connor>
<connor> We were just like, "You know what? </connor>
<connor> "they're holding auditions at our school </connor>
<connor> "and we could sign up." </connor>
<connor> So we're just like, "What
have we got to lose?" </connor>
<connor> We didn't really.
- Yeah, why not? </connor>
<connor> - We didn't really expect anything </connor>
<connor> because we didn't really think </connor>
<connor> that we were that good of band. </connor>
<connor> So we obviously auditioned
and it was literally like </connor>
<garnt> the fucking X Factor kind
of thing, kinda deal, right. </garnt>
<joey> Because.
- The big golden </joey>
<joey> buzzer in the middle. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because literally we'd, </garnt>
<garnt> because our school was a performing arts, </garnt>
<garnt> so we had like a theater set up, right. </garnt>
<connor> And the theater, we had like
a drum kit in the middle </connor>
<connor> and we had, there were judges on there. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - And we had to, we had to play two songs. </connor>
<connor> We had to play two songs
in front of the judges. </connor>
<connor> And I remember,
- That's where Garnt </connor>
<garnt> plays Plug in Baby. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- And the crowd goes wild. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, sorry.
- Now for our second song, </connor>
<connor> Plug in Baby. </connor>
<joey> One more time, baby. </joey>
<connor> - It's where the montage starts,
everyone gets up on there. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, they're gonna tell you. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I remember we were like, </garnt>
<connor> we were hearing some of our fucking, </connor>
<connor> some of the other bands
that were playing before us. </connor>
<connor> And we were just like, "Fuck my life. </connor>
<connor> "We gotta follow these guys. </connor>
<connor> "We go fuck, we go fuck. </connor>
<connor> "We gotta follow these guys. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> And so I remember thinking,
"we're not gonna get on." </connor>
<connor> Because there were a lot of other bands </connor>
<connor> that were fucking better than us. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna say that. </connor>
<connor> But so we went on, we
just played our songs. </connor>
<connor> The judges you know,
waved us off, whatever. </connor>
<connor> We didn't expect much. </connor>
<connor> And so we didn't get into
the Battle of the Bands. </connor>
<connor> We actually became like a backup choice. </connor>
<connor> Just in case, just in case, you know? </connor>
<connor> - All right.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And so we went on with our lives </connor>
<connor> and then we get a call, like
a week before the events. </connor>
<connor> - You're in. </connor>
<connor> - And they were just like, </connor>
<connor> "So one of the bands is dropped out </connor>
<garnt> "and we got an extra space in this </garnt>
<garnt> "Battle of the Band's concerts. </garnt>
<garnt> "Do you wanna do you wanna come on?" </garnt>
<joey> And we're like, "what the fuck!" </joey>
<joey> - This is literally Carole & Tuesday. </joey>
<garnt> Like that's exactly what
happened in Carole & Tuesday. </garnt>
<joey> - This is an animate, bro. </joey>
<joey> - And so we were just like, </joey>
<garnt> I mean, yes, but how the fuck
can we prepare in a week? </garnt>
<garnt> For this Battle of the Bands, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like other
bands have prepared for, </garnt>
<garnt> for like a good month or two. </garnt>
<garnt> Playing with a band is
fucking much more difficult </garnt>
<garnt> than you imagined it. </garnt>
<garnt> If you've never played in band before, </garnt>
<connor> because you're in a live setting, right? </connor>
<connor> And a lot of things can go wrong </connor>
<connor> and you need to be on the same wavelength </connor>
<connor> as your other band members. </connor>
<connor> We've had, I've played plenty of gigs </connor>
<connor> and some gigs are better than others. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you make
mistakes, and sometimes, </connor>
<connor> you're not in sync with
the rest of the band </connor>
<connor> and you need to be tight. </connor>
<connor> You need like the performance
needs to be tight. </connor>
<connor> So you need a lot of practice. </connor>
<connor> So we said yes, but we didn't really, </connor>
<connor> we didn't really have
time to practice the songs </connor>
<connor> that we wanted to of practice. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But there was like, </connor>
<connor> well, there was like one joke
song that we had practiced, </connor>
<connor> we had practiced before, </connor>
<connor> because we didn't really
have any gigs coming up. </connor>
<connor> And it was. </connor>
<connor> - I just had sex by Lonely Island. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, it was an Indie rock version </connor>
<connor> of Hit Me Baby One More
Time by Britney Spear. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - It was Hit Me Baby One
More Time by Britney Spears. </connor>
<connor> - Hell yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And we were just like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, we don't really
have time to practice </connor>
<connor> "some of our more complicated songs. </connor>
<connor> "So let's just put that in the set, </connor>
<connor> "whatever right, whatever right." </connor>
<connor> And I remember we had the
conversation before of, </connor>
<joey> we always wanted the experience
of having the audience, </joey>
<joey> having audience, seeing part of the song, </joey>
<joey> like a lot of bands do. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember we were
having this discussion </joey>
<joey> of the perfect point
of this song would be, </joey>
<garnt> what's the line. </garnt>
<garnt> How does Hit Me Baby
One More Time, go again? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Camera Man] ♪ Baby,
hit me one more time ♪ </garnt>
<connor> - I think he's thinking
about the chorus, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Oh fuck.
- Hit me baby one more time. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, I go again. </garnt>
<garnt> No, no, no, here it is. </garnt>
<joey> It's when the line goes is my loneliness </joey>
<joey> is killing me.
- Is killing me and yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I. </connor>
<connor> And we were saying that
would be an awesome point </connor>
<joey> for like the audience to chime in. </joey>
<joey> But we were just to do, </joey>
<connor> do the, and to, to do the and diet. </connor>
<connor> Cause that would be that, </connor>
<connor> that would be like an
awesome feeling we thought. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - But we were just like, </connor>
<connor> "no, we're not gonna do it." </connor>
<connor> Because like, what's more embarrassing </connor>
<connor> than stop because then stopping a song, </connor>
<connor> letting the audience sing and,
- And no one sings. </connor>
<connor> - And no one sings, </connor>
<connor> we did not have the fucking balls </connor>
<connor> to do this, right.
- I've been there. </connor>
<connor> - And so I remember we go to </connor>
<joey> the Battle of the Bands </joey>
<joey> and it's like the biggest audience so far. </joey>
<joey> Normally we're used to performing </joey>
<joey> for like 50 to a hundred people. </joey>
<joey> So this was like,
- Which is still a lot. </joey>
<joey> - Which is still a lot,
you know, which is a lot. </joey>
<joey> But this was like about 500 people. </joey>
<joey> It was at like Concorde
2, which if you know, </joey>
<connor> and if you know Brighton, </connor>
<connor> Concorde 2 is actually
one of the biggest venues. </connor>
<connor> That's not like the Brighton, </connor>
<connor> that's not the main Brighton venue. </connor>
<connor> It's a lot of big Indie bands go there. </connor>
<connor> - That's cool. </connor>
<connor> - And so we go on stage
and we're just like, </connor>
<connor> "Guys, we're not gonna
take them seriously. </connor>
<connor> "A lot of these bands are fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> "We're just gonna have fun. </connor>
<connor> "We're just."
- Which is so anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- "We're just, </connor>
<connor> "we're just going to have fun, right?" </connor>
<connor> And I remember, so we go on stage, </connor>
<connor> we play the set and this is
me playing on pure adrenaline. </connor>
<connor> So we're not practiced at all. </connor>
<connor> We're not as tight as we want to be </connor>
<connor> in terms of our performance. </connor>
<connor> But I'm seeing like, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> just playing in front
of the biggest crowd, </connor>
<connor> kinda like hyped us up. </connor>
<connor> And I can't really explain the feeling, </connor>
<connor> but it just like something
that day just clicked. </connor>
<connor> You know some days where
you're just like in the zone? </connor>
<connor> That day, for some reason, all
of us were just in the zone. </connor>
<connor> We were like at peak performance, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then I remember we decided </connor>
<connor> because we were of meme it up, </connor>
<connor> we were decided we were
going to end it on, </connor>
<connor> Hit Me Baby One More Time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The rest of it was just
going to be our original songs </connor>
<connor> and we were gonna end it on that, </connor>
<connor> because we were just like,
"we don't care, whatever." </connor>
<connor> The audience is probably
not gonna like it, </connor>
<connor> cause it's fucking Britney Spears, </connor>
<connor> but we're just gonna have fun with it. </connor>
<connor> And then I remember when
we start playing the song, </connor>
<connor> somehow the audience
just like erupts, right. </connor>
<connor> The cause this is not the type of audience </connor>
<connor> that would listen to
fucking Britney Spears. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They're here for like Arctic Monkeys, </connor>
<connor> they're here for Block Party or you know, </connor>
<connor> The Clarks or some shit like that. </connor>
<connor> And I remember playing this song. </connor>
<connor> And obviously, we had
agreed that we weren't </connor>
<connor> going to stop the music
with The Anri, right? </connor>
<connor> But you saw, we saw
the energy in the crap. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing)
- You had no choice. </connor>
<connor> - And we were like, it was such a, </connor>
<connor> it was one of the most
surreal moments in my life. </connor>
<connor> Where we had this, </connor>
<connor> we had this performance where
we were just all like in this. </connor>
<connor> We were in flow, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We were just in, we were like
Karaoke basket in the zone. </connor>
<connor> I remember the moment was coming up. </connor>
<connor> And I looked over, </connor>
<connor> I looked over at the drummer.
- Over the drummer. </connor>
<connor> That's so adamant. </connor>
<connor> We all look at him.
- We all at the drummer. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, cause I remember, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "I want do this." </connor>
<connor> But we agreed that we wouldn't. </connor>
<connor> And I remember, I remember thinking </connor>
<garnt> I wanna do this.
- Do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember looking at the drummer </garnt>
<garnt> and he had like the same look, as I did. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing, clapping) </garnt>
<garnt> I looked over the bases
and the bases just like, </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - And then, he nodded at me. </connor>
<connor> And then, I looked over to the
singer and in the corner of, </connor>
<garnt> he sees me, on the corner of my eye, </garnt>
<garnt> at the corner of his eye. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And then he nods back and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, it's going to happen." </garnt>
<garnt> And so he goes, </garnt>
<garnt> ♪ My loneliness is killing me ♪ </garnt>
<garnt> Silence. </garnt>
<garnt> ♪ And I ♪ </garnt>
<joey> And like the fucking entire
concert hall, just like fucking. </joey>
<joey> They complete the line. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> I can't explain, that fucking feeling. </joey>
<joey> It is.
- It's better than sex. </joey>
<joey> - It is like the biggest orgasm, </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing)
I've had in my life, like. </connor>
<garnt> - For Sydney. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Cause it was, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> It was kinda like a Disney moment for me. </connor>
<garnt> Cause like somehow everything
just fucking came together </garnt>
<connor> and then we just, we
could continued the song </connor>
<connor> and it was the best,
like the best reaction </connor>
<connor> that we've ever got from a crowd. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - So the Battle of the
Bands was done by votes </connor>
<connor> and there were 10 bands there. </connor>
<connor> We came in third. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow.
- Oh shit. </connor>
<connor> - Did you get anything, any prize? </connor>
<connor> - No, we didn't get any prize.
- Oh fuck. </connor>
<joey> - We didn't get any prize. </joey>
<joey> But that would. </joey>
<joey> - They did get the biggest
orgasm of his life. </joey>
<connor> - That, that was the peak of my. </connor>
<connor> - Music career. </connor>
<garnt> - That was the peak of my music career. </garnt>
<joey> It all went down from that.
- I mean, </joey>
<garnt> that's pretty ridiculous considering this. </garnt>
<garnt> What? </garnt>
<garnt> How many hundreds of bands </garnt>
<joey> that have probably never experienced that. </joey>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> And from that down onward, </connor>
<connor> he relinquished the name Garnt. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> He became gone. </connor>
<connor> He wasn't right to use the name really. </connor>
<connor> - Like Leveled Up and Evolved. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they can't use the name anymore. </connor>
<garnt> That must be crazy. </garnt>
<connor> How the fuck have you
never brought this up? </connor>
<connor> - How did you never brought this up? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I just. </connor>
<garnt> I swear, I've said, "I've
been in a band before." </garnt>
<garnt> And no one's ever just. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone's been in a band before. </garnt>
<connor> No, everyone's been in a band before. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've been in a band for like 10 seconds </connor>
<connor> until I realize it's horrible idea. </connor>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I dunno that. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, that's why I've
really liked Beck because I'm, </garnt>
<connor> I looked up Beck and I'm
just like, "Fuck, I get that. </connor>
<connor> "I get that."
- That's my life. </connor>
<connor> - So you were actually good at guitar? </connor>
<connor> - I was like competent at guitar. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you've played in front of people. </connor>
<connor> That's pretty good. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- I mean, </garnt>
<connor> I've played in front of people, but. </connor>
<joey> - I mean that's, I've in my
mind, but that's pretty good. </joey>
<joey> - So we're starting a band
called 10 and a half pounds soon. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - 10 And a half.
- I look forward to you guys. </connor>
<connor> - You like unlocked memories in me. </connor>
<connor> I heard the Zelda (blabbers)
thing when you were like, </connor>
<connor> I remember I tried to learn guitar. </connor>
<connor> What I tried?
- All right. </connor>
<connor> - I think my parents nudged me towards it. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
I just remember being </connor>
<connor> in someone's house playing guitar, </connor>
<connor> trying to do twinkle, twinkle little star. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- I just was like, </connor>
<joey> - I dunno.
(laughs) </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I don't get this." </joey>
<connor> And then he was like, gave me
this device that was a tuner, </connor>
<connor> but I didn't know what it did. </connor>
<connor> He was like, "You gotta do
it, until it goes green, </connor>
<connor> "the light."
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And I was like, "why?" </joey>
<connor> (both laugh) </connor>
<connor> "It all sounds the same. </connor>
<connor> "It all sounds very similar." </connor>
<garnt> - It's just one beep to one, </garnt>
<connor> - And my parents bought this tuna for me. </connor>
<garnt> And I remember just, </garnt>
<connor> even at that time when
I was eight, I was like, </connor>
<connor> Why my parents just wasted
their money on this tuna? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm never gonna get good at this. </connor>
<connor> I'm never gonna good at this. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I'd never, never learned guitar. </connor>
<connor> And then I remember I went to learn drums, </connor>
<joey> which seems pretty fitting
for me cause I'm, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you just need a
sense of rhythm, that's it. </joey>
<joey> And hand eye coordination.
- Which is great. </joey>
<joey> I've had great hand, eye coordination. </joey>
<connor> Unfortunately, no rhythm. </connor>
<connor> So that was the crux of that one. </connor>
<connor> And that was over with it, and
I never really learned drums. </connor>
<connor> I went for like a year and I
never really learned anything. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- They try to meet, </connor>
<connor> they try to teach me how
to read the Sheet music. </connor>
<joey> - Ah.
- Oh, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And that's where I was like,
"No, I don't wanna do this." </connor>
<garnt> - That's like jazz drumming methods. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I didn't enjoy it.
- I think, </joey>
<connor> I stopped learning at the point </connor>
<connor> when cheap music started to
become a thing of my lessons. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> "I don't like this anymore." </garnt>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This used to be fun
when we were just talking </connor>
<connor> about beeps and boobs, now
you brought reading into this. </connor>
<connor> That's what I draw the line. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like I, I
think we said this last time </garnt>
<joey> where I go by feeling
and that's what I went </joey>
<joey> when I wrote the songs.
- Animate Protagonist </joey>
<joey> that you ever said.
- Cause I don't understand </joey>
<joey> a single thing about fucking music theory. </joey>
<joey> I know which chords sound nice in my head. </joey>
<garnt> And sometimes I have like a nice, </garnt>
<garnt> like beat or rhythm in my head. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> "Let's try to play this out with guitar." </garnt>
<garnt> I do not wanna know </garnt>
<joey> what fucking music theory is.
- You're literally </joey>
<garnt> Yuri from K-ON, like a 100%. </garnt>
<connor> Like in the way you think
is 100%, it's exact same. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "I can't read shit. </connor>
<joey> "I just feel, and I complain." </joey>
<connor> - I remember at one
point, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> one of my friends was like,
"Yeah, we need to sing." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Ah, alright, I'll do it. </connor>
<connor> "I'll do it."
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - "I'll do it." </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I couldn't sing at all. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't have any confidence in it. </connor>
<joey> The first song, I'm not even kidding. </joey>
<joey> The first song that we had to learn, </joey>
<joey> is the only one I ever bothered learning. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We never did anything. </joey>
<joey> This died by this song. </joey>
<connor> Guess what song we had to sing. </connor>
<connor> - Muse song? </connor>
<connor> - No, it was fucking Smash Mouth. </connor>
<connor> (laughing, clapping) </connor>
<connor> I remember like actually,
- why did you not pursue it? </connor>
<connor> - I have like very vivid memories </connor>
<connor> of me actually, seriously
trying to learn how to sing </connor>
<connor> fucking All Star before it was a meme. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And I remember when
this became a huge meme, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "this is like
I had Nam flashbacks, </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> This is the song. </connor>
<connor> - I need to hear it.
- Nam. </connor>
<connor> - An actual serious cover of Smash Mouths. </connor>
<connor> All star.
- We go to karaoke. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we,
- Because every time you go, </connor>
<joey> every time we go to karaoke,
of course, All Star comes up. </joey>
<joey> Like at least four or five
times throughout the night. </joey>
<joey> And every time, it's just kind
singing like a dumb voice. </joey>
<joey> I want you to actually like be serious, </joey>
<connor> and like try and like view.
- If I seriously try and sing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I feel vulnerable. </joey>
<joey> - What?
- I feel open criticism. </joey>
<joey> I can't do that.
- No it's, no, no, I won't. </joey>
<joey> - If I'm the clown it's safe. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no.
- Safety. </connor>
<joey> - Come on.
- I get that Connor, </joey>
<joey> I get that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm at something.
- No, you can't hide. </joey>
<joey> You can't hide.
- I'll hide behind my. </joey>
<joey> - Now that you've said that.
- I'll hide, </joey>
<connor> behind my clown makeup,
thank you very much. </connor>
<joey> - Now, that you said
that you have to do that. </joey>
<garnt> - So what's your first pick? </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - That was my first pick, Muse. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, it's been like four hours. </joey>
<garnt> - It is, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I mean Muse is one of the only bands </garnt>
<garnt> I've also seen live as well.
- I didn't know Bradio, </garnt>
<connor> had such amazing hair look at that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> Bradio's got the best shit.
- Holy shit. </joey>
<joey> - Michael Jackson's running for his money </joey>
<garnt> on that fucking Afro.
- Honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> This is like the early
days of Bradio as well. </garnt>
<joey> Bradio like his Afro, </joey>
<joey> like now is fucking massive.
- It's huge, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - He looks like dinosaur.
- It's huge. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I've also seen
Bradio alive as well. </connor>
<connor> I mean the reason I put
Bradio you up there, </connor>
<connor> it's because I discovered
Bradio with Sydney </connor>
<connor> during a really tough and time trying time </connor>
<connor> in our lives, when like,
I was living in London, </connor>
<connor> working for the BBC. </connor>
<connor> And every day like was like
depressing a shit of course. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, especially with
the computer that I had. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - But for some reason, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> no matter how down my day was, </connor>
<connor> I put on a Bradio song,
and I am instantly happy. </connor>
<connor> For just like the five minutes
or three minutes, whatever. </connor>
<garnt> I could just feel glad
and happy for a second. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it bad? </connor>
<garnt> I can't remember which songs they've done, </garnt>
<joey> which animates they've done?
- They did Death Parade OP. </joey>
<connor> - That's it.
- They like, </connor>
<connor> - That's the like I thought it was that. </connor>
<connor> I didn't wanna say,
cause I didn't wanna look </connor>
<connor> as an ass-hole.
♪ Everybody ♪ </connor>
<joey> ♪ Put your hands. ♪ </joey>
<joey> - That song does hard.
- Yeah, I mean like, </joey>
<joey> - Goes so hard. </joey>
<connor> - It was not only that song, </connor>
<connor> but I remember what really
sold me on Bradio was, </connor>
<connor> first time I heard that song,
of course it was a banger. </connor>
<connor> Everyone heard the Death Parade OP opening </connor>
<connor> and they knew it was a banger, </connor>
<connor> but it was actually
their music video, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause if you see their music video, </connor>
<connor> it's just like four dudes having
fun with the green screen. </connor>
<connor> And it's like got such this,
it's got such a charm to it. </connor>
<connor> Because they do a, they do this a lot </connor>
<connor> with some of their music videos </connor>
<connor> where they're just taking a person like, </connor>
<connor> trying to like either
replicate this anime opening </connor>
<connor> because what they did in this music video </connor>
<garnt> was they've tried to
replicate the anime opening </garnt>
<garnt> of death parades, just with a green screen </garnt>
<garnt> and four of them and
it was just using like, </garnt>
<garnt> very basic cosplay and a green screen </garnt>
<garnt> and makeup and all this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just, it's got
such a charm to them </garnt>
<garnt> because it just shows
that, it just feels like </garnt>
<garnt> it's four dudes having
fun, having a fucking blast </garnt>
<garnt> and not really giving a shit </garnt>
<garnt> about what the world thinks
about them, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - My other favorite music
video by them is a Golden Liar. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, Golden Liar.
- Where they're just like, </joey>
<garnt> it's literally just like them on stage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're just having
the time of their life. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's such a good song and
it's such a good music video, </garnt>
<joey> it's so fun. </joey>
<joey> - Such a good baseline as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh.
- Guys, </joey>
<joey> like the funk in that baseline. </joey>
<garnt> Whoa. </garnt>
<garnt> - So good, so fucking good.
- Actually, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna listen to them? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You should. </joey>
<garnt> I feel like you like
them, because they're. </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly, like the
rest of their discoveries </joey>
<garnt> is like nothing will be bangers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck, yeah.
- I haven't heard </garnt>
<joey> a bad Bradio song. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, before we move
on from Muse though, </garnt>
<garnt> I have a funny story or not a funny story </garnt>
<connor> because I remember when I saw them live, </connor>
<connor> it was in Thailand.
- In Chelsea. </connor>
<connor> - And like I, I.
- They went to Thailand? </connor>
<connor> - No, that's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> It was when I was living in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And it was so fucking random. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'd gone my entire life, </connor>
<connor> being a massive Muse
fan living in England. </connor>
<connor> No, and just never getting
the chance to fucking see them </connor>
<connor> at all because they never
performed when I was in England. </connor>
<connor> And so, the first time in my life </connor>
<connor> that I actually got to see them perform, </connor>
<connor> was it in Bangkok, Thailand? </connor>
<joey> Like what the fuck?
- Probably good. </joey>
<joey> - So I remember like, I
remember thinking this, </joey>
<joey> is this this real? </joey>
<joey> This is so surreal that
I'm going to be able </joey>
<joey> to see Muse in Thailand, out
of all the places in the world, </joey>
<connor> I could see Muse. </connor>
<connor> So I remember going to this concert </connor>
<connor> where dragging Sydney
along, because of course, </connor>
<connor> even though she wasn't as
big of a Muse fan as I was. </connor>
<connor> So I needed something to go with me. </connor>
<connor> And so I remember like, </connor>
<connor> this was like the highlight of my month, </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm like, "Fuck me, man. </connor>
<connor> "I get to see Muse. </connor>
<connor> "I get to fucking see Muse." </connor>
<connor> And I remember, I remember
going to the concert </connor>
<joey> and I remember going to the stage </joey>
<joey> and just like eagerly
excited for them to come on. </joey>
<joey> And I remember the
first band that came on, </joey>
<joey> was a band called The Ruse. </joey>
<joey> The Ruse.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so that's R-U-S-E, </joey>
<joey> right?
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I forgot that they needed
a supporting band, right? </joey>
<joey> So my first thought was, </joey>
<joey> have we just gone to the
wrong fucking concert? </joey>
<joey> Is this some Muse concert? </joey>
<joey> - Or is this a Ruse concert? </joey>
<joey> - Like what? </joey>
<joey> Is this the tie knockoff of the Muse? </joey>
<joey> What's going on? </joey>
<joey> And then they start playing and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, maybe they're just
gonna play one song." </joey>
<connor> And then they play the second song. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "okay, maybe
they're gonna play two songs, </connor>
<connor> "and then Muse is gonna come on." </connor>
<connor> They play five songs. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no. </connor>
<connor> - And after the fourth song, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "have I
made a terrible mistake?" </connor>
<connor> "And we've just come to Bangkok,
Thailand, to see the Ruse." </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, no.
(Joey laughing, clapping) </connor>
<joey> - Did they end up coming or? </joey>
<joey> - But they did, </joey>
<joey> I kind of thank God.
- OK, thank God. </joey>
<joey> - But I was just like, I
just remember thinking, </joey>
<joey> at first I was like, "You know,
maybe it's a sporting band" </joey>
<joey> and then like four songs later. </joey>
<joey> I really hope, I didn't
just spend all this money </joey>
<joey> to see a ducking knock
off Muse, band, man. </joey>
<joey> - You're juiced by The Ruse. </joey>
<garnt> - Did they do that on purpose? </garnt>
<connor> They had The Ruse, supporting The Muse? </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, maybe.
- Impossibly. </connor>
<garnt> - They must have done that on purpose. </garnt>
<connor> - They must have chosen
- Must have, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Them on purpose, right? </connor>
<garnt> There's no fucking way. </garnt>
<connor> - If you're supporting artist,
you should change your name. </connor>
<connor> You should change your name to Bruce. </connor>
<connor> And no reason why, just do it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but.
- Don't copy </joey>
<joey> my homework too hard. </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> - I would be breaking it, if I got there, </connor>
<connor> they're like welcome The Ruse. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Check the ticket
right now, check it, right." </connor>
<garnt> - Cause I literally went, </garnt>
<garnt> I literal had to go outside just to check, </garnt>
<garnt> that the main poster, </garnt>
<garnt> said Muse.
- Muse. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then like I was coming
in to see Muse perform. </garnt>
<connor> I go outside and it is
like, "Yes, it is Muse." </connor>
<connor> Go back in, still the Ruse. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Maybe they made
a mistake out front on the, </connor>
<connor> "maybe they got the
letters wrong, I dunno." </connor>
<joey> - I would be breaking,
I would be breaking. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, there's. </connor>
<joey> I've seen enough knock off
things in Southeast Asia </joey>
<joey> to be like, "Maybe they
just pretended to be Muse </joey>
<connor> "it's entire time." </connor>
<connor> - It's the Thai version of Muse. </connor>
<connor> That thing is stubbornly funny. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- But yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I saw them live and they were absolutely, </garnt>
<garnt> absolutely fucking incredible.
- So killing it. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] I'm shocked, you
put the killers on here. </connor>
<connor> Do you like more than the one song? </connor>
<garnt> - Do you like more than Mr. Brightside? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> I like.
- Ruby, Ruby? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey, Garnt] That's Kaiser Chiefs. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that is Kaiser. </connor>
<joey> - That's how little I
know about The Killers. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - They sounds so similar.
- To be honest I, </connor>
<joey> to be honest, I only know Mr. Brightside. </joey>
<garnt> - Do they have any other songs? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they have Mr. Brightside. </garnt>
<joey> - Apparently their latest
albums really good. </joey>
<garnt> They kinda launch like year, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - I actually haven't
heard that latest album. </connor>
<connor> - Listen, why are they on the list, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - Why are they on the list? </connor>
<connor> Because I think the killers
was my University life. </connor>
<connor> My university life. </connor>
<connor> I was actually like already
into The Killers before, </connor>
<connor> Mr. Brightside came to
takeover the UK scene. </connor>
<joey> - You were fans before they were popular. </joey>
<joey> - Well kind of, but they
also really just exploded </joey>
<joey> onto the UK scene with Somebody Told Me. </joey>
<joey> That was like,
- Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that was real.
- That was like the first song </joey>
<joey> that really exploded. </joey>
<joey> And I was already into
Indie rock at the time. </joey>
<connor> And for the longest time, </connor>
<connor> I thought they were a British rock band. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone does. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - They're like a Mormon
American's, though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So like for the longest time, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that they
were a British rock band </garnt>
<garnt> the same way as like Arctic Monkeys were, </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of other British Indie bands. </garnt>
<garnt> Because they came out in that time. </garnt>
<garnt> But I didn't know they were from America, </garnt>
<garnt> but they were like the one
Indie band that I listened to </garnt>
<garnt> still throughout university. </garnt>
<connor> Because the reason I stopped listen to, </connor>
<connor> listening to a lot of Indie music </connor>
<connor> is because my band broke up, </connor>
<connor> because we all went to university. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Right? </connor>
<connor> But, I listened to The Killers </connor>
<connor> and I don't know which
album is which songs, </connor>
<connor> but I know I listened to a lot of Killers. </connor>
<connor> See I'm drawing a blank right now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I just know I've listened
to a lot of Killers </connor>
<connor> and the real reason it's on here, </connor>
<connor> is not only because I listened
to them a lot in university, </connor>
<connor> but it's also the first band
that me and Sydney bonded over. </connor>
<connor> - Oh.
- Oh, so cute. </connor>
<connor> - So I remember, okay. </connor>
<connor> So, Sydney likes to quote a lot of songs </connor>
<connor> to a lot of people that
she hung out with, right. </connor>
<connor> And apparently she told me,
that the only time someone </connor>
<connor> had completed a song
lyric that she had quoted </connor>
<connor> instead of just being like Sidney, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> Was when she quoted The
Killers to me via text, </connor>
<connor> and she was, she just randomly said. </connor>
<connor> Oh shit.
- Somebody Told Me. </connor>
<connor> - Not, Somebody Told Me, I Got Soul. </connor>
<connor> And I'd reply her back. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, fuck! </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Oh man, I'm. </connor>
<joey> - I reply her back, fuck. </joey>
<joey> And she was like, "Oh my God,
you're the ones Garnt I want?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- The absolute irony. </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck me. </garnt>
<connor> I'm drawing a black right now.
(clapping) </connor>
<joey> What's the.
- It's like I Got Soul. </joey>
<connor> Then you're just like,
- I'm not a soldier. </connor>
<connor> Is that the line? </connor>
<connor> This is like me trying to remember lyrics. </connor>
<connor> - I think it is I have a soul, </connor>
<connor> not I'm a soldier, I think.
- Cause I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like I got soul, soul, </connor>
<connor> I'm not a soldier or something like that. </connor>
<connor> Okay, like I said, I
don't listen to lyrics. </connor>
<connor> Like I just, I just know. </connor>
<joey> I just knows,
- But you managed </joey>
<joey> to quote back that one? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Huh? </joey>
<joey> That's the one line he
managed to quote back. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the one line
I managed to quote back </garnt>
<connor> and she was like, "Well,
you're a Killers' fan. </connor>
<connor> - You are the one.
- You are the one you, </connor>
<connor> you are the first person.
- You took a very big gamble </connor>
<garnt> replying with that. </garnt>
<connor> You gotta look like a fucking idiot. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "What's wrong with Garnt?" </connor>
<garnt> He said, "He's not a soldier
or something bizarre." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So The Killers holds a very, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, a very deep place in my heart. </garnt>
<garnt> Not only because I listen to The Killers </garnt>
<garnt> and I am reminded of University life, </garnt>
<garnt> but also because it's part
of the reason that I met </garnt>
<garnt> and bonded with my
partner that I'm with now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cute.
- And I also saw them live </garnt>
<garnt> in Bangkok, Thailand as well. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's so weird.
- You sure you want this? </connor>
<connor> - So we saw The Drillers, </connor>
<connor> we saw The Drillers live at Bangkok. </connor>
<garnt> We're just construction team.
- Supporting act, The Fillers. </garnt>
<garnt> - We saw The Drillers. </garnt>
<connor> I remember like the first,
I remember seeing them live </connor>
<connor> and the first song that they
played was Mr. Brightside. </connor>
<connor> - Of course.
- And obviously, </connor>
<connor> Mr. Brightside is.
- You gotta start us strong. </connor>
<connor> - Is the song that
everyone, everyone knows. </connor>
<connor> And I remember it such
a surreal experience, </connor>
<connor> just hearing a song that I'd listened to </connor>
<connor> so much in my childhood. </connor>
<connor> And it was almost like it was, </connor>
<connor> it was almost like a weird outta fuck, </connor>
<connor> outta fucking body experience. </connor>
<connor> Where I had heard the song
that meant so much to me </connor>
<connor> when at one point in my life. </connor>
<connor> And I saw them now at the age of 25, 26 </connor>
<connor> or something like that, like way later. </connor>
<connor> And it just like a wave of
just like, it was so surreal. </connor>
<connor> Cause at what, </connor>
<connor> it was a wave of memories and nostalgia, </connor>
<connor> but also like me living in the moment. </connor>
<connor> It's so weird to describe
because just hearing them live </connor>
<connor> and hearing, it was like
my life had built a up </connor>
<connor> to this one moment, </connor>
<connor> I don't know.
- Beautiful. </connor>
<connor> - Because I'd never seen a band </connor>
<connor> that I loved so much as a kid, </connor>
<connor> later in life until that one moment. </connor>
<connor> So it was just such an
incredible moment for me. </connor>
<joey> I will never forget hearing Mr. Brightside </joey>
<joey> for the first time in life.
- A live. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] And then we
have a Michael Jackson. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I also like Vanilla. </garnt>
<joey> (men laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so the reason that
Michael Jackson is on there </garnt>
<garnt> is because, so as a kid,
I went through a phase </garnt>
<connor> where I was.
- Yeah, you spoke about this. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah?
- I think you have. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- I feel like I've. </garnt>
<connor> This is weirdly familiar. </connor>
<connor> Garnt talking about it.
- On the podcast? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I dunno if I have
talked about it on the podcast, </connor>
<connor> but as a kid, I went
through this massive phase </connor>
<connor> where I was obsessed with Michael Jackson. </connor>
<connor> Like I was a aware.
- You've definitely said this. </connor>
<connor> - Really, I dunno.
- I dunno if I've said it </connor>
<connor> in private to you guys or on the podcast. </connor>
<connor> But like, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I went through a phase when I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> just an obsess Michael Jackson kid. </garnt>
<joey> - I think everyone's
gone through that phase </joey>
<connor> at least once.
- As a target, obvious once. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (burping, laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - This was the, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> This was before that phase. </garnt>
<connor> But regardless of what his image was, </connor>
<connor> or what happens later in life, </connor>
<connor> there was, I think you know,
his music fucking slaps. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, yes it's vanilla, </connor>
<garnt> but it's a classic for a reason. </garnt>
<connor> - I love the song, pretty
young thing, but it's so hard. </connor>
<connor> It's so hard to listen to that song. </connor>
<connor> (burping) </connor>
<joey> - Like the lyrical content. </joey>
<connor> - You know how I like, they're
like separate the art artist? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- I do. </connor>
<connor> But sometimes, it's
really fucking hard to. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that song definitely didn't, </joey>
<joey> - That's one of those songs, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Why, why? </joey>
<joey> "This song is so good, but
why do it have to be ruined?" </joey>
<joey> I literally cannot listen to
that song without being like, </joey>
<joey> "This is great, oh, no." </joey>
<joey> - And then you remember what it was about. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, oh, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - MJ, I feel.
- But so many was songs </joey>
<joey> are amazing.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - MJ is just one of
those artists that I feel </joey>
<garnt> you could be at any party
or any convention in </garnt>
<garnt> with any amount of people that could have </garnt>
<garnt> completely different
personalities on everything. </garnt>
<connor> The moment of Michael
Jackson song comes on, </connor>
<connor> everyone's unanimously like fuck it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's good, every song's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we talked about this before, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't think we'll ever
see someone that had the reach </garnt>
<connor> or was as famous as Michael Jackson was. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you're surprised.
- He was famous by standing. </connor>
<joey> I love that.
- Yeah, I love that. </joey>
<joey> - Because part of the reason
I go into Michael Jackson </joey>
<connor> was because my dad actually introduced me </connor>
<connor> to Michael Jackson. </connor>
<connor> I remember he bought like a VHS </connor>
<garnt> of the top 25 hits of,
- Holy shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was a 25th anniversary. </garnt>
<connor> - I wish I had like a deep
story of every single pick. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I was like,
- This is, this is the reason </connor>
<connor> I had the picks, cause I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I dunno how to talk about the music. </connor>
<garnt> "I'm just gonna talk about the stories. </garnt>
<garnt> - Somebody's watching
like Slumdog Millionaire. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like every single answer
has a goddamn 10 part back, </garnt>
<connor> like flashback it is insane. </connor>
<garnt> - So it's one of the weirdest experiences </garnt>
<garnt> where you go to the
countryside in fucking Burma </garnt>
<garnt> or Thailand or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they've never
experienced internet there. </garnt>
<connor> They barely have electricity there. </connor>
<connor> You go to the transit slide </connor>
<connor> and even going in the middle of nowhere, </connor>
<connor> somehow there will be this one farmer </connor>
<connor> who will have this old
beaten up cassette tape </connor>
<connor> of like Michael Jackson Thriller. </connor>
<connor> - Of course, everybody likes,
- And like they will, </connor>
<connor> they will not know a
single word of English. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Oh,
you grew up in England, </connor>
<connor> "you know Michael Jackson,
you know Michael Jackson's </connor>
<connor> "Should I beat it?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, we're in the, </connor>
<connor> "how has Michael Jackson, </connor>
<connor> "how does Michael
Jackson have this reach?" </connor>
<connor> - Well, he's the king of pop, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- For a reason. </joey>
<joey> - So, it's still like I'm thinking about </joey>
<joey> it still blows my mind. </joey>
<garnt> Just how famous one person is.
- Yeah, that's right. </garnt>
<joey> - I Think Thriller, even to this day, </joey>
<connor> is most sold album ever. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Mm, you think so? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Look, I said I
think so like I have any idea. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Which is like stupid. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It sounds right. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, by stupid, I mean like, </connor>
<connor> the difference between Thriller </connor>
<connor> and everything else is like stupid. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- True, true. </connor>
<connor> - It's insane. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because like you know, </connor>
<connor> you could go to the bomb fucked
middle of nowhere in Japan, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And there'll be someone like
decrepit 70 year old lady, </connor>
<garnt> you know, putting rice in the rice fields </garnt>
<garnt> and being like, "Oh Michael
Jackson, yeah, yeah" </garnt>
<connor> - I almost de crap it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> This a piece of shit, old lady. </connor>
<connor> They're all useless. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Decrepit wasn't the right word. </connor>
<connor> - This poor old lady, what's her problem? </connor>
<connor> - I wonder.
- I'm just tryna </connor>
<connor> give you some rice. </connor>
<connor> Which Joey will say, will
taste the same anyway. </connor>
<connor> - It all taste the same. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, who just like
knows Michael Jackson. </joey>
<connor> It's like it's just,
- Yeah everyone knows </connor>
<joey> Michael Jackson.
- It's ridiculous thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like weird
to think how someone, </garnt>
<joey> one person got this
famous to so many cultures </joey>
<joey> and so many countries that
obviously had nothing to do </joey>
<joey> with the US or just even
listen to that kind of music </joey>
<joey> in the first place. </joey>
<joey> And I mean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, Thriller is like. </joey>
<joey> I'm not putting like Thriller on there </joey>
<joey> is kind of putting like fucking Zelda </joey>
<joey> or something as your favorite
video game of all time. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, it's one of, </joey>
<joey> it's one of the most legendary out albums </joey>
<joey> and he's one of the most
legendary artists for a reason. </joey>
<joey> And,
- Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - And I was a weird Michael Jackson kid. </joey>
<joey> I actually.
- Did you learn </joey>
<joey> how to moonwalk? </joey>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<connor> - Did you learn how to moonwalk? </connor>
<garnt> - I attempted to learn how to moonwalk. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I could moonwalk at one point. </joey>
<joey> Actually it's like bullshit.
- I could moonwalk </joey>
<garnt> at one point too, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Could you actually. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, genuinely, genuinely.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you figure it out by yourself or. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I watched YouTube video. </joey>
<joey> - I Think I watched YouTube video. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> Because I remember trying to
figure it out as a kid, right? </joey>
<joey> Trying to figure out
how the moonwalk works. </joey>
<joey> Because.
- You know, </joey>
<joey> like frame by frame on the video. </joey>
<joey> Just like analyzing the moonwalk. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because as like a five, six
year old kid or whatever, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I got this. </joey>
<joey> "Okay, this looks exactly
like Michael Jackson." </joey>
<joey> And it was only until like years later </joey>
<joey> when you YouTube existed
and YouTube videos existed, </joey>
<joey> did I realize that's this is not, </joey>
<joey> this is not how you do the moonwalk, </joey>
<joey> I was doing it wrongly. </joey>
<joey> - I was just walking backwards. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Literally, I was just like
walking backwards the inside. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm thinking I look cool as fuck. </garnt>
<joey> No, no. </joey>
<joey> - I tried to do like the </joey>
<joey> the leg like pop thing that he does. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- I tried to do that as well. </joey>
<joey> - Tried to do that, and
almost dislocated my knees. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Ahhh." </joey>
<connor> - That's like, Joey became a
pensioner there, he was fine. </connor>
<joey> - I was like, "Oh, is
that why he shouts ahhh? </joey>
<joey> Because it just fucking hurts, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Are these Japanese artist? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<joey> - Fuck me. </joey>
<joey> - Hold on, just frothing
over Michael Jackson's, </joey>
<joey> just frothing up. </joey>
<garnt> - So then you can add
that to the compilation </garnt>
<garnt> of Garnt tries to drink
like a human being. </garnt>
<garnt> So I guess, this is with the Mayo. </garnt>
<connor> But this is more of where I put her in, </connor>
<connor> just because I feel like
she's a genre of music </connor>
<connor> that I have just recently gotten into. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And as with everything in my life, </connor>
<garnt> somehow, everything always comes back </garnt>
<garnt> to your Domestic Girlfriend. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh what the fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing, breathes loud) </garnt>
<connor> - It's almost like I was
born for this moment. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - As I always does, right.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm not sure what
this genre of music is, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's not really just J-pop it. </connor>
<joey> It's more of like. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so how I would describe it, </joey>
<joey> do you guys know what Utaite? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So Utaite is like, I
believe singers or musicians </joey>
<joey> who mostly originated
from Nico Nico starting, </joey>
<joey> who started off doing a lot
of Hudson named Nico songs </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that.
- Just like covers. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, covers and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> So a lot of these musicians who
came from the scene ended up </connor>
<connor> just like, I guess,
graduating and just made </connor>
<connor> started making their own songs </connor>
<connor> with their own original artists. </connor>
<connor> And there's this, I
dunno what the genre is, </connor>
<garnt> but there's a lot of artists in this genre </garnt>
<garnt> that I got introduced to by the
Domestic Girlfriend opening. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's the, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Domestic Girlfriend is
a very divisive show. </garnt>
<garnt> I know that.
- Really. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know that. </garnt>
<garnt> The opening fucking slaps. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the opening's amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - The opening is fucking amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know the opening. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna even be able to attempt </connor>
<joey> to say it.
- Yeah, it's harder. </joey>
<connor> - It's not like the catchy
song, it is just a banger. </connor>
<connor> - Right?
- It's like (burping) </connor>
<connor> - I'll take your word for it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And that's how I discovered
that artist, Minami. </connor>
<connor> And Spotify recommendations, </connor>
<connor> YouTube recommendations. </connor>
<connor> - Of course.
- So I got really, </connor>
<joey> really into Minami and her songs </joey>
<joey> from the Domestic Girlfriend opening. </joey>
<joey> And that kind of
introduced me to this world </joey>
<joey> of artists like Zutomayo, Eve. </joey>
<joey> Who else is fucking? </joey>
<joey> Yorushika, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Yorushika, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so how I describe them is like, </joey>
<garnt> they are anime music
that don't have an anime </garnt>
<garnt> that they play to. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Again, I've listened to this. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know their name.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But if you go to my YouTube, </garnt>
<connor> you can see I've listened
to this person a lot. </connor>
<connor> It's just like that genre of like, </connor>
<connor> I'm making the anime in my head. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing)
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm making this up. </connor>
<garnt> - So like a lot of these
artists that I listen to now, </garnt>
<connor> have now been picked up for
like animate openings, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yes.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I remember I got into, </connor>
<connor> I got into Zutomayo and
then I got into Eve. </connor>
<connor> And then I remember listening </connor>
<connor> to the Jujitsu Kaisen's
opening, when that came out. </connor>
<connor> For the first time in my life, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "oh my
God, I know this band." </connor>
<connor> I know it cause I've never
heard this song before. </connor>
<connor> But they have such a distinct style </connor>
<connor> that I had that moment
where I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> "I've been following them </garnt>
<garnt> "since they were
underground motherfucker." </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I said, I read The Manga, fuck it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you're right.
- He waved that </joey>
<garnt> in front of Jujitsu fans so fast, </garnt>
<joey> like I know this song. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it is the equivalent of the, </garnt>
<garnt> I've read this when The
Manga wasn't big, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you know, because
there are so many artists </garnt>
<garnt> in this field that have now been picked up </garnt>
<garnt> for anime opening or ending and like, </garnt>
<garnt> there is this, there's
this feeling of like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yes, you have music slaps. </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm fucking proud you." </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm validated for being a fan of. </garnt>
<joey> - I was like that with Tosite Sigure. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> Like before they became
the cyclo pass opening </joey>
<joey> of the Tokyo Ghoul opening, </joey>
<connor> I was like, "I knew them before those." </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey, Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Damn, you before the movie? </garnt>
<connor> - Before they're animate.
- But then, also a little sad </connor>
<garnt> because now everyone knows Eve as, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, it's the Jujitsu Kaisen band?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "No, they're
not just the Jujitsu." </connor>
<connor> - There's so much more. </connor>
<connor> - There's so much more than that. </connor>
<connor> Listen to the rest of their fucking songs. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, I mean this is, </connor>
<garnt> I guess that's the kind of
music I listen to the most now. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like really?
- Really? </garnt>
<joey> - That's like my Weib kind of.
- It's really big in Japan </joey>
<connor> right now, especially like
Zutomayo and Yorushika </connor>
<connor> and they're like, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Daft Punk, I'm supposed to be </connor>
<joey> a Daft Punk
- Daft Punk. </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't know, you're
a big Daft Punk fan. </garnt>
<garnt> - I am, I was a big Daft Punk fan </garnt>
<garnt> during like the Discovery album, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm thinking back and
a lot of my favorite songs </garnt>
<joey> or a lot of my favorite music </joey>
<joey> have visuals to accompany them. </joey>
<joey> Like do you guys, do you guys, okay. </joey>
<joey> When you guys listen to
a song, do you guys like, </joey>
<joey> do you guys imagine a music video </joey>
<joey> in your head or anything like that? </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes, yeah.
- Depends on the song for me. </joey>
<joey> - I usually like what I'm doing. </joey>
<joey> - Like for me, if I can't connect </joey>
<joey> to a song unless I can
imagine kind of story </joey>
<joey> or some kind of visuals
to accompany that song. </joey>
<connor> And I feel like, I have
such a random song, </connor>
<connor> I have such a random
music taste because to me, </connor>
<connor> I don't really listen to lyrics, </connor>
<connor> but if a song emotes an emotion </connor>
<connor> or a visual image in my head. </connor>
<connor> Then that's when I get really </connor>
<connor> emotionally connected to a song, right? </connor>
<connor> And to me, how I discovered Daft Punk, </connor>
<connor> was I discovered it
through Intastella 5555 </connor>
<connor> - You're so good. </connor>
<connor> - Which was a fucking amazing movie, </connor>
<connor> and it's also one of the few albums </connor>
<connor> I have listened to all the way through </connor>
<connor> based purely from that movie. </connor>
<connor> Right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And from then on,
from watching that movie </connor>
<connor> and seeing the story that
they crafted from that movie, </connor>
<connor> every Daft Punk song I listen to, </connor>
<connor> I have such cool visuals
that go along in my head </connor>
<garnt> that's why I became such
a massive Daft Punk fan. </garnt>
<connor> - How did that even happen? </connor>
<garnt> That I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> Was it literally just the guy listened to </garnt>
<connor> and was like holy shit, </connor>
<connor> I gotta make an animate to go with this. </connor>
<joey> - I think, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't know exactly, </joey>
<connor> but I think Musk Muto Deji
was like a fan of Daft punk. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then they just worked
something out and then. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause it's so good, </garnt>
<connor> it's so good.
- Would like to know, </connor>
<connor> I would like to know like,
what kind of like fucking. </connor>
<garnt> - What do I have to do to get </garnt>
<joey> Musk Muto Deji to make music? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, how did that connection happen </joey>
<joey> - I don't even know. </joey>
<connor> - Cause this was before
anime was even close to big. </connor>
<connor> This was, this was like
on the ground is fuck. </connor>
<garnt> So,
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you have a favorite
song from the album? </connor>
<garnt> Mine always changes quite often. </garnt>
<garnt> - From, it's hard. </garnt>
<connor> - From Daft Punk. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably Harder,
Better, Faster, Stronger. </connor>
<connor> - That's good song. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's good. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, for me, it's like,
I know it's the vanilla pick, </joey>
<connor> but like One More Time
will always be there. </connor>
<connor> - One More Time is amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - One More Time is great.
- One More Time </garnt>
<joey> with Digital Love. </joey>
<joey> - I just finished </joey>
<joey> the Digital Love.
- My two favorites. </joey>
<joey> - Digital love is fucking incredible. </joey>
<joey> - Digital love is amazing.
- Digital Love's very amazing. </joey>
<joey> - And I think the reason I picked </joey>
<joey> Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger </joey>
<connor> was because I remember when
I first started getting to </connor>
<connor> AMVs and everyone tried to
make LinkedIn Punk AMVS. </connor>
<connor> I did nothing, but just
make Daft Punk AMVS. </connor>
<connor> That was me, man. </connor>
<connor> That was like eve, the rest.
- I already made an AMV. </connor>
<connor> - The rest of YouTube went through that. </connor>
<connor> The rest of fucking YouTube went through </connor>
<connor> a LinkedIn Punk phase. </connor>
<connor> I was here just like. </connor>
<garnt> It was like the entire
Discovery Channel in anime form </garnt>
<garnt> aside from like, not even the movie, </garnt>
<garnt> but just like in Naruto
clips and or shit like that. </garnt>
<joey> - And when you heard the,
the Kanye West remix. </joey>
<joey> That song, you're just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God." </joey>
<connor> - I think that's how I heard that </connor>
<connor> before I heard the original Daft Punk. </connor>
<joey> - All right, I discovered
Kanye through that song. </joey>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "why? </joey>
<joey> "Who's this guy?"
- That song grew up </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "who's this guy
wrapping over a DF punk song." </joey>
<garnt> And then that's Kanye West.
- Ah, so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, at first I hated that song </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm just like, </garnt>
<connor> "Why would you ruin
Harder, Better, Fasteer." </connor>
<connor> And then like, the more I
listened to it, the more I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Alright, this fucking slaps."
- Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Kanye, alright. </connor>
<connor> You're a crazy motherfucker, but. </connor>
<joey> - He's gonna get big. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> I can feel it. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I think this guy's gonna do stuff. </joey>
<garnt> - I think he's gonna be quite noodle. </garnt>
<connor> - And Arctic Monkeys, is
obviously British staple. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, obviously, again, I mean, </garnt>
<connor> I've already talked about my Indie phase. </connor>
<garnt> I've kind of just, it
wasn't just Arctic Monkeys. </garnt>
<connor> It was just,
- Everyone born around </connor>
<connor> our generation ish, British
loves Arctic Monkeys. </connor>
<connor> - Because if I would </connor>
<connor> have to say,
- Very normal. </connor>
<connor> - If I would have to say what my, </connor>
<connor> what influences I took when, </connor>
<connor> I was in my band, right? </connor>
<connor> It was bands like Arctic
Monkeys, The Klaxons, Strokes, </connor>
<connor> who else was like big at that time? </connor>
<connor> Razorlight. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow, Razor I fucking love that. </connor>
<garnt> - Also like Red Hot Chili
Peppers and Foo Fighters as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like, just like any.
- Everyone. </garnt>
<joey> - Any Australia around that
time, White Stripes was massive. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, White Stripes as well, fuck it. </garnt>
<joey> Yes I fucking loved the White Stripes. </joey>
<garnt> I mean that slot is just there for, </garnt>
<connor> just for just mid 2000s. </connor>
<connor> - Bruce Check, Bruce Check?
- Yeah, Bruce Check. </connor>
<connor> - Bruce Check, right. </connor>
<connor> Bruce Check. </connor>
<connor> - And then you got Pillows. </connor>
<connor> - And then I got The Pillows. </connor>
<connor> Well, I put The Pillows there </connor>
<connor> because I did go through a phase </connor>
<connor> where there was a lot of
anime music on my playlist. </connor>
<connor> - Actually, we've all been there. </connor>
<connor> Come on.
- Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - We've all been there. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like. </connor>
<connor> - Joey was the animate man at one point. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah and </joey>
<joey> - Good old times. </joey>
<joey> - But back then, I didn't like, </joey>
<garnt> I didn't look up the bands
behind the anime music. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just anime music. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And.
- My apple thing </connor>
<connor> was TV size bracket. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of one minute 30 songs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember Fooly Cooley
was the first entire OST </garnt>
<connor> that I've like, I took this entire OST </connor>
<connor> cause every song in the Fooly Cooly OST, </connor>
<connor> because it was basically just
The Pillows album, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, basically. </connor>
<connor> - It was just an album of The Pillows. </connor>
<connor> It was the first time where
I took an entire anime OST </connor>
<joey> and put it on my MP3 player,
which wasn't even an iPod. </joey>
<joey> It was like this like.
- An actual league MP3 player. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It was like a knockoff cheap ass </joey>
<connor> Chinese MP3 player that I
can't even remember the brands. </connor>
<connor> Because.
- Probably, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't exist anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it probably doesn't exist anymore </connor>
<garnt> because I couldn't afford proper iPods </garnt>
<garnt> or proper branded MP3 player. </garnt>
<joey> - I had one that was kinda
like shaped like a long pill. </joey>
<connor> It was like a blue pill. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, and. </connor>
<connor> - And then you could
put like an ox-corner. </connor>
<connor> It was like tiny, tiny screen, </connor>
<connor> and the name of the song will like scroll </connor>
<garnt> across the screen.
- Same, same. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh good times.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Kids will never understand. </joey>
<joey> - And I mean like The Pillows, </joey>
<garnt> it is again kind of just like Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> but also has certain like,
- I was this close </garnt>
<joey> to putting The Pillows
on mine, but I didn't. </joey>
<garnt> - Again, like the reason I
really loved that soundtrack </garnt>
<garnt> is because FLC is kind
of just like an AMV, </garnt>
<garnt> but just in animate form.
- Six season goods AMV. </garnt>
<joey> - Is the second season good? </joey>
<garnt> - It's good, but nowhere near as. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not as good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never watched it.
- It's not as good. </garnt>
<connor> - It has its moments.
- You gotta watch </connor>
<joey> the first one. </joey>
<joey> - But its like to me, </joey>
<joey> like 90% of why I love Fooly Cooly so much </joey>
<joey> was cause of The Pillows. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the visuals were kinda like, </joey>
<garnt> it was kinda like watching
Intastella 5555 again, </garnt>
<connor> where I'm.
- So if you like the music, </connor>
<garnt> you'll like the anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- What if you're </joey>
<joey> into the music? </joey>
<connor> You're like, </connor>
<joey> - It's gonna be hard to
not be into the music. </joey>
<garnt> - Right, I get.
- I mean it kinda sets </garnt>
<garnt> the tone of the entire show.
- That makes sense. </garnt>
<joey> - There's a reason why
it's one of the most famous </joey>
<connor> anime OST.
- All right, yeah. </connor>
<joey> People never shut off about Fooly Cooly </joey>
<connor> and why it's so amazing and why should. </connor>
<garnt> - But it's moments like
this where I was afraid, </garnt>
<connor> whenever people were just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, well, let's pass your Score. </connor>
<connor> "Let's see what your music taste is." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Fuck man. </connor>
<garnt> "How am I going to explain, </garnt>
<garnt> "yeah like TV size, Naruto opening five?" </garnt>
<garnt> Like, "What is that? </garnt>
<joey> "What is that?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but at least it was like you know, </joey>
<joey> hard, Cut & Dried, like J-Rock, right? </joey>
<joey> I was listening to like Lucky
Star opening with people. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "That's
even harder to explain." </joey>
<joey> It's like past The Yonks. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I don't think
you want The Yonks, man. </joey>
<connor> - I definitely listened to too much, </connor>
<connor> Hannah Montana at one point.
- Really. </connor>
<connor> - More than I.
- What? </connor>
<connor> - More than I care to admit. </connor>
<garnt> - Hannah Montana?
- You always saying </garnt>
<connor> like Best of Both, was?
- Then I was so obsessed </connor>
<joey> with Hannah Montana.
- Best of Both </joey>
<joey> was an amazing song.
- Yeah, was good. </joey>
<joey> ♪ Best ♪
When I was like 13, </joey>
<joey> I was obsessed with Hannah
Montana and I dunno why. </joey>
<joey> So much to say, that one of
the first books I ever read </joey>
<joey> was Miley Cyrus's autobiography. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - I'm not kidding. </joey>
<joey> I'm not kidding, I wish that was a joke. </joey>
<joey> I wish that was those String of Rose. </joey>
<joey> - You're a hardcore Miley Cyrus, fan? </joey>
<joey> - For some reason I was
obsessed with the Disney Shower </joey>
<joey> when I was like 12 or 13. </joey>
<joey> - That makes sense, though. </joey>
<joey> - I think I was sold on the dream </joey>
<joey> that you can do whatever you wanted to do. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I realized that no,
it's not how it works. </joey>
<joey> Let me sat this
- And then you saw, </joey>
<joey> and then you saw how
Miley turned out, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was a little. </connor>
<joey> (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> I was like there was just Selena
Gomez Women's Much Better. </connor>
<joey> - Switch Gears. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, Much Better. </connor>
<connor> I'm done with it this,
so what do you meme? </connor>
<joey> I dunno. </joey>
<joey> I dunno why I just liked it. </joey>
<joey> And also I like the music for some reason. </joey>
<joey> - I thought that was,
- It's weird how, </joey>
<joey> when you're 12 and 13
you're just fucking idiot. </joey>
<joey> - I was more obsessed with Hillary Dolph. </joey>
<connor> (Connor laughing)
- Hillary Dolph? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like more of the, </joey>
<connor> I don't know why?
- Isn't it weird, </connor>
<connor> I used to have those phases? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Miley didn't really click for me. </joey>
<joey> Hillary, I was like, "Yeah,
I can get behind this." </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> I dunno why? </connor>
<connor> - I feel like everyone has that one thing </connor>
<connor> that they've shoved down </connor>
<connor> and their subconsciously has pressed it. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "I never like this. </connor>
<connor> "If you say I did, I did not." </connor>
<connor> - It's so in-explainable. </connor>
<joey> Now that I think about
it, I was like, "Why?" </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Dude, why? </joey>
<joey> I don't,
- Did I like Hillary Dolph? </joey>
<joey> - I cannot explain to you </joey>
<joey> why I like this?
- Was she like hot to me? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - I think I like the
escapism that it offered. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that could be it.
- When I was like 12 and 13. </joey>
<joey> Copium or something, </joey>
<joey> I dunno why?
- Copium. </joey>
<joey> 12 Year old copium.
- What's wrong with me. </joey>
<joey> And now I'm this jaded British
man who likes beans on toast. </joey>
<connor> But back then I had dreams and stuff. </connor>
<connor> Business Channel.
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] What the happened to you? </garnt>
<connor> (blabbers, chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - Anyway?
- Animate does that, </connor>
<garnt> animate does that too, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Destroys dreams. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, that is my three by three. </garnt>
<joey> I dunno if that's like random as fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - I mean like.
- It's gone, it's gone. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like I've talked
more behind the stories of, </garnt>
<joey> the stories of.
- I just wanna hear </joey>
<joey> more about you being in a band now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we need more of that
- How am I supposed </joey>
<connor> to live up to this?
- Stories about living </connor>
<joey> in the band to be continued. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God.
- How am I suppose </joey>
<connor> to live up to that?
- Who's gonna be next. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - It's the Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, one end of. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Yoey, Yoej.

<connor> - [Connor] This is okay. </connor>
<connor> I know this one. </connor>

<joey> He look, I feel like I've seen him on TV. </joey>
<joey> - Tommy Hawk, been on a TV show? </joey>
<joey> - Sure, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - To be honest, can we Google that? </joey>
<joey> Am I going crazy? </joey>
<joey> - Maybe, I don't know
- Can I even guess? </joey>
<joey> - Please. </joey>
<joey> I'll be surprised if
you can get anyone else. </joey>
<garnt> - Streaked Out.
- I know one of them. </garnt>
<connor> - Streaked Down
- Is it Streaked Down? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I know one of them's Tool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's Tool. </connor>
<connor> - Yes.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, why do they all look the same? </connor>
<connor> Is this a British Bands? </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - It could be like The
Who or The Sex Pistols </connor>
<connor> or it could be one of them. </connor>
<joey> - It's not Who or Sex
Pistols, but it's that era. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like
they all look the same. </connor>
<connor> Okay, I'm British they all
look exactly the fucking same. </connor>
<joey> - That is true.
- They do, they do. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so from left to right, </joey>
<joey> we got Tool, Led Zeppelin.
- Okay shit, that one was just </joey>
<joey> gonna kill me.
- Radiohead, Tangerine Dream, </joey>
<joey> Pink Floyd, Nick Drake, MF Doom, </joey>
<joey> American Football and Might June. </joey>
<connor> - My brother's gonna kill me. </connor>
<connor> He actually is obsessed
with like Led Zeppelin. </connor>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah, </joey>
<joey> he was obsessed with them. </joey>
<joey> - I'll be his friend
- He loves all of those. </joey>
<joey> That era bands, </joey>
<joey> he know them really well.
- I could have put like nine, </joey>
<joey> just '70s hard rock bands
as well, if I wanted to. </joey>
<joey> But,
- Cause, </joey>
<garnt> I love a lot of the music,
but a lot, at the same time, </garnt>
<joey> I have no idea what any
of the band's look like. </joey>
<garnt> - Like you know.
- That's what they look like. </garnt>
<joey> They all look like long hair. </joey>
<connor> - Like Led Zeppelin, </connor>
<joey> I know what Aussie Osborn looks like now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey, Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what he looked like, </connor>
<joey> - He kind of. </joey>
<garnt> - Boy, he looked so different back then. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, y'all Aussie Osborne
actually looked like a human. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Poor 80 year old Japanese, </connor>
<connor> so now that the Aussie's getting dragged, </connor>
<connor> to be fair, Aussie is aged strangely. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, when I saw him live, it was weird. </joey>
<connor> - Aussie is like, you know
those time lapses of like </connor>
<connor> this chicken nugget, has been
in the closet for 70 years </connor>
<connor> and hasn't aged, but it has. </connor>
<connor> And that's how I feel. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, is
that a fact comparison? </connor>
<connor> I don't even know. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's how I feel. </connor>
<joey> It's like, "It shouldn't be alive, </joey>
<joey> "but it looks worryingly well." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Aussie now kind of looks
if someone took Aussie Osborn </joey>
<garnt> and deflated him and then
reinflated him again. </garnt>
<joey> - He's the one who's done.
- He looks like </joey>
<joey> if someone took Aussie
Osborn and just like, </joey>
<connor> he left him in water for too long. </connor>
<connor> (laughing, clapping) </connor>
<connor> - Poor Aussie. </connor>
<connor> He had like, just hasn't he
done like an insane amount </connor>
<joey> of drugs or something. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, he should've
- I mean most. </joey>
<joey> - He should have died ages
ago, normally, but he some, </joey>
<joey> I mean, that's why he can barely talk now. </joey>
<joey> - That's crazy.
- Like when I went to go see </joey>
<joey> Black Sabbath live, </joey>
<joey> it was like you know, </joey>
<connor> the original lineup.
- I'm surprised </connor>
<connor> he's still performing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, this was like
maybe five, six years ago. </connor>
<joey> And it was labeled there Last Tour, right. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, "Of course I have to go." </joey>
<connor> - That's impressive, that
he's still able to perform. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> It's like, he came out from. </joey>
<joey> When they all came onto stage </joey>
<joey> and the music starts playing </joey>
<joey> and you just see this guy </joey>
<joey> just like hobbling
across the stage, right. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Oh, that's him. </joey>
<joey> "There he is." </joey>
<joey> And he just goes up to
the mic and he is like, </joey>
<joey> "How's y'all, how you doing?" </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was like, </joey>
<joey> - That is normal for Birmingham. </joey>
<joey> What you talking about? </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Ooh."
- Sorry, I break again. </connor>
<connor> - "I don't know what you saying man, but, </connor>
<joey> "God, you sounding good." </joey>
<joey> And he is like, "Oh, I'm
good but what's this job, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, I think you know it. </connor>
<connor> "General's gathered." </connor>
<connor> And he just starts singing normally. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Why can you not? </connor>
<joey> "Why can you sing completely fine. </joey>
<joey> "But you can't talk normal." </joey>
<connor> - This is the, you haven't
lived in the UK test. </connor>
<joey> I can understand him like perfectly. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm not even joking. </joey>
<joey> (cameraman laughing) </joey>
<joey> I could understand what he was saying. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is, man. </joey>
<joey> The UK is weird. </joey>
<connor> - It's such,
- It doesn't make sense. </connor>
<connor> - It gives you like, </connor>
<connor> it's like the hard mode of English, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean?
- I feel like, </connor>
<connor> - Once you're trained
in it, then you could, </connor>
<connor> you could like distinguish any accent. </connor>
<garnt> - No, difficulties
understanding English accents. </garnt>
<joey> Cause I just grew up
around really strange ones. </joey>
<joey> - But I guess like Black Sabbath, </joey>
<connor> Like sorry, Led Zeppelin for me, </connor>
<connor> is kind of just all of the
British, '70s hard rock, man. </connor>
<connor> So like Black Sabbath can fit in there, </connor>
<connor> Like Deep Purple can fit in there. </connor>
<connor> Cause like that's just
like the music my dad </connor>
<connor> just grew up with. </connor>
<connor> And he was like here, "Do
you know, Rolling Stones?". </connor>
<connor> And I was like, and I was
two years old and I was like, </connor>
<joey> "What is a music?" </joey>
<joey> And then he just played Rolling Stones. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Okay,
I can get behind this." </connor>
<connor> And then I think the first
band I like really connected to </connor>
<connor> was Led Zeppelin. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like I fucking love every song. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I'm gonna, I'm like an idiot. </joey>
<joey> Are they the ones who
did Stairway to Heaven? </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, they are the ones </garnt>
<joey> who did Stairway to Heaven.
There's no way I could get, </joey>
<garnt> that one wrong
- Stairway to heaven, </garnt>
<garnt> Rock and Roll, Black Dog, </garnt>
<garnt> - Immigrant Song.
- Immigrant Song. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know that song? </garnt>
<joey> The one that goes like,
(blabbering) </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yeah I get, I listen to that one. </connor>
<connor> - The Viking song. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they're the ones.
- Yeah, The Viking song, </garnt>
<connor> that's them. </connor>
<connor> - I often living in Japan, </connor>
<connor> you'll meet like, let's
say, you're just me, </connor>
<connor> talking to Japanese people, whatever. </connor>
<connor> And they'll be like, "Oh,
I love British music." </connor>
<connor> I'll be like, "Oh, okay." </connor>
<connor> I'm thinking like, "Fuck, watch Era, </connor>
<connor> "they gonna talk to me about it." </connor>
<connor> Cause I don't know any of them. </connor>
<connor> It's always like Black
Sabbath, Led Zeppelin </connor>
<connor> and they'll be like, they'll ask me, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, what's your favorite song?" </garnt>
<joey> I'll be like, (breathes deep) </joey>
<joey> - Stairway.
- Stairway to Heaven. </joey>
<connor> - This is where I feel like </connor>
<connor> this is where like my bullshit
levels come into like, </connor>
<joey> "how well can I do this?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this.
- This is really wrong. </joey>
<connor> - But basically like, Jimmy Page, </connor>
<joey> Who's the guitarist for Led Zeppelin, </joey>
<connor> he's the one who basically
influenced me to start guitar. </connor>
<connor> - Right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I watched one
concert from Led Zeppelin </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "That is the
coolest fucking human alive." </connor>
<joey> Just like him just shredding on guitar, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "I want what
he has, I want that. </joey>
<connor> "Can I do that?" </connor>
<connor> - Is it a coincidence that
we're all posing very similarly. </connor>
<joey> And they just happen to all
have the same looking post. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, that's
just like, we are a band. </joey>
<connor> - We are a band, we're doing pretty well </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we are a band. </joey>
<connor> - Is he holding a door? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> No, I think, </connor>
<connor> he's behind the door.
- He's behind a door. </connor>
<joey> (laughing)
- He's not holding a door. </joey>
<joey> He's not holding a door </joey>
<joey> in this thing. </joey>
<joey> - He's just holding door.
- I'm taking this home. </joey>
<connor> I'm taking. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I guess like, </connor>
<connor> so Led Zeppelin is just like. </connor>
<joey> Just my love for like '70s rocks. </joey>
<joey> So like Black Sabbath, Deep
Purple, Rolling Stones. </joey>
<joey> Cause like the,
- This must have been </joey>
<joey> really hard for you to decide.
- It's really hard. </joey>
<joey> - Cause your music knowledge is vast. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is.
- And I feel like </joey>
<garnt> you have an appreciation
for music way beyond </garnt>
<connor> anything me and Garnt have </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, for like me and
Connor like a music puddle. </joey>
<joey> Yours' like a music ocean.
- You're right, basically. </joey>
<joey> And then I guess like
kind of in the same vein, </joey>
<connor> but I had to like put it,
differently as Pink Floyd </connor>
<connor> in the middle. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- You love them. </connor>
<connor> - I think I went to a
concert of Pink Floyd's. </connor>
<connor> Well, technically just Roger
Waters and he performed there. </connor>
<connor> Pink Floyd has this album called The Wall. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, good take though.
- Which is considered like </connor>
<joey> one of the greatest concert albums. </joey>
<connor> - Joey has explained The
Wall to me in great detail. </connor>
<connor> - I like how you said, </connor>
<joey> "They made this album called The Wall." </joey>
<joey> - The Wall.
- Like it's not </joey>
<joey> one of the most favorite.
- I don't know, </joey>
<joey> - The favorite albums there.
- Because people always think </joey>
<joey> like, "Oh yeah, they made
dogs out of the moon." </joey>
<joey> It's like, okay.
- That's the one I knew. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, is that the one that
Nostalgia Critic's made, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, my favorite, Nostalgia Critic's. </joey>
<joey> I love them.
- I love that album. </joey>
<joey> - It's amazing.
- Amazing. </joey>
<garnt> I fucking I Nostalgia Critic's. </garnt>
<garnt> - But so Roger Waters was the guy who like </garnt>
<garnt> mostly wrote The Wall. </garnt>
<garnt> But the entire band did it as well. </garnt>
<garnt> But he went on like a tour all
around to perform The Wall. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so I got tickets to it, </garnt>
<garnt> like miraculously from a
friend of mine and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh my God, my dream's
gonna fucking come true." </garnt>
<connor> Like I get to see one
of my favorite bands. </connor>
<connor> But it wasn't a concert. </connor>
<connor> It was a Stage Show.
- Huh. </connor>
<connor> - So again, the whole
concept of The Wall is like, </connor>
<connor> guy creates a wall,
that's like not physical </connor>
<connor> and then he breaks it down
to get over his musical </connor>
<connor> and emotional bears. </connor>
<connor> Super oversimplifying the album. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, thank you.
- That's what I mean. </connor>
<connor> - Strait run.
- But what's amazing, </connor>
<connor> what was amazing about
that concert is that </connor>
<joey> as they are playing the
songs throughout the album, </joey>
<joey> they're literally physically
building a wall on stage. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's cool.
- That's cool. </joey>
<joey> - With like, it not obviously
not outta bricks, but like. </joey>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Like big, like Styrofoam Bricks. </connor>
<connor> - It's cool.
- So like after every song, </connor>
<joey> the band members actually
like go off the stage </joey>
<joey> and like place bricks on the wall. </joey>
<joey> - That's cool. </joey>
<garnt> - And then, in the second half, </garnt>
<garnt> and then in the first half of the album, </garnt>
<garnt> he finishes building the wall </garnt>
<garnt> and then it just goes into an interlude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it funded by Donald Trump. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "I want it taller." </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then, the second half
the wall is built, right. </joey>
<joey> But they build it in front of the band. </joey>
<garnt> So as the concert is going on, </garnt>
<garnt> you can see less and less of the band. </garnt>
<connor> - That's so cool. </connor>
<connor> - And then the second
half of the album starts, </connor>
<connor> the entire stage spins around. </connor>
<connor> - That's why we're looking for them. </connor>
<connor> - And so now you're looking
from inside The Wall. </connor>
<connor> - Huh.
- Huh. </connor>
<joey> - And then, because that's the theme </joey>
<joey> of the second half of the album. </joey>
<joey> And then at one point in, </joey>
<joey> at the end,
- How the fuck </joey>
<connor> do they spin the stage? </connor>
<joey> - It was all just on this like giant, </joey>
<joey> like Lazy Susan Esque,
like just rotating thing. </joey>
<joey> - Huh.
- Right. </joey>
<connor> - And then, like the second
to last song on the album, </connor>
<connor> the main protagonist of the
album, he breaks down The Wall. </connor>
<connor> And they literally like blow the shit up. </connor>
<connor> - That's so cool.
- Just the pieces, </connor>
<garnt> just go flying into the crowd. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's fucking cool.
- And then, </garnt>
<garnt> the album just stands. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've never cried during a concert, </garnt>
<connor> but that was the first
time I was like crying. </connor>
<connor> It was one of those
concerts where it's like, </connor>
<connor> you know normally, like
say if you go see Muse </connor>
<connor> or like Pendulum, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- You're like standing up, </connor>
<connor> you're like grooving,
you're singing along, </connor>
<connor> you're like fuck, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know like that kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> That was the first ever concert I went to </connor>
<connor> where I was just like
my ass firm only planted </connor>
<connor> on the seat and just staring. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Yeah, I appreciate it. </connor>
<joey> - And just listening and taking it in </joey>
<connor> because it's like,
- I wish I could have that. </connor>
<connor> - Because it was,
- I wish I could have that. </connor>
<connor> - It was crazy, it was like one of the, </connor>
<joey> I've been a lot of concerts in my life, </joey>
<joey> but that was like one of
the most like ethereal </joey>
<joey> is like the only way I could describe it. </joey>
<joey> It was just so like, oh
my God it's so magical. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, as someone who doesn't understand </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of like the deeper appeal of music, </garnt>
<joey> like what makes The Wall
such an amazing album? </joey>
<joey> Because to me, The Wall is
just like the album you say, </joey>
<joey> if you want to impress a dad, </joey>
<joey> you know like you meet,
- That's true. </joey>
<joey> - You meet your girlfriend's
dad or something. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh what music do you like?"
- Cause it's like Craft Juliet </joey>
<joey> - I like.
- I love The Wall. </joey>
<joey> - I love Pink Floyd, The Wall. </joey>
<garnt> And like easy fucking
bragging points, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course, of course. </garnt>
<joey> - I love IPAs, I love that. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - IPAs, I love The Football, </joey>
<joey> - I do love IPAs.
- And I love The Wall. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so I did like a whole
dissertation on The Wall. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Huh? </connor>
<connor> - I did like a fault, so I
took music is like a major </connor>
<joey> in high school.
- Right, right. </joey>
<connor> - Cause I wanted to like pursue it at Uni. </connor>
<connor> Obviously, I didn't end
up pursuing it at Uni. </connor>
<connor> - Your dad's were like, "No,
no you're Asian, Jerry." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, like, no,
way you're gonna do it, </connor>
<joey> you're gonna do it right now. </joey>
<joey> And one of like I did, I
studied like musicology, </joey>
<garnt> which is just like music
analysis basically. </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like, and like
the yearlong dissertation </garnt>
<connor> was take an album and just
write a dissertation about it. </connor>
<connor> Like write an album, write
an album review, basically. </connor>
<connor> I wrote this like 40 page,
dissertation on The Wall. </connor>
<connor> And like, what's the most
insane thing about The Wall </connor>
<connor> is like not just the fact
that the story is cohesive </connor>
<connor> and all the songs flow together? </connor>
<connor> - Hmm.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There is no pauses
between any of the songs </connor>
<connor> as it flows from one song to another, </connor>
<connor> the entire album is connected
to just one big song. </connor>
<connor> But the most amazing,
like mind blowing thing </connor>
<connor> is the fact that the album
literally repeats endlessly. </connor>
<connor> - That's cool.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So the end, the ending of the last song </connor>
<connor> fades into the beginning
of the first song. </connor>
<connor> - That's really cool.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And that just completely like, </connor>
<connor> and that's not just a stylistic thing. </connor>
<connor> - No.
- They did that on purpose </connor>
<connor> to show that like what this
main character is going through. </connor>
<connor> Is a never ending cycle. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right, right. </connor>
<joey> - And it's just never, </joey>
<joey> it's just constantly
repeating over and over. </joey>
<connor> - Tyler created that as well </connor>
<joey> with one push album.
- With Eagle, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, Eagle did that as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> So The Wall was, I'd
say was the first album </joey>
<connor> to incorporate that style and a lot of, </connor>
<connor> obviously like Tyler and like
a lot of artists took that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you know I've always said that, </connor>
<connor> you can make a concept heavy album, right. </connor>
<joey> And try and tell a story. </joey>
<joey> But if the music sucks,
then the music's gonna suck. </joey>
<joey> - No one likes the song because. </joey>
<joey> - It's you could have the most </joey>
<joey> like deep ass message about like, </joey>
<joey> whatever the you're trying to sing about. </joey>
<joey> But if the song doesn't stick with you, </joey>
<connor> then it's like there's no point. </connor>
<connor> The Wall though, it's like
every, song's a fucking banger. </connor>
<connor> So even if you listen to
it individually, it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's a fucking great song." </connor>
<connor> - [Connor, Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's it still slaps. </connor>
<connor> And then on top of that, it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's deep as well,
and profound it's lyrics." </connor>
<connor> It's like, "What more could you ask for?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, awful and true. </connor>
<connor> - And like what? </connor>
<connor> The one thing though that
annoys the fuck outta me </connor>
<connor> is the fact that another brick in The Wall </connor>
<connor> is from this album. </connor>
<connor> And it's like Pink Floyd's
most well known song. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> Just because, and I'm like, it's a Bob. </connor>
<connor> But so many people just
listen to it outta context. </connor>
<joey> - They don't know what it means. </joey>
<joey> - Because they don't know what it means. </joey>
<joey> Because if you actually in.
- It's pretty me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because in the context of the album, </joey>
<joey> it's a really depressing song. </joey>
<joey> But it's just like played in an upbeat </joey>
<connor> and it's like a great song, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like I'm not gonna
fault them for that, but. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> And like all their albums
are just like that. </connor>
<connor> They've never had a
bad album, it might be. </connor>
<joey> So there's that. </joey>
<connor> - I know you love Radiohead an awful lot. </connor>
<joey> - I love Radiohead as does Garnt. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I do as well, he was, </connor>
<connor> - I know he was burnt over radio. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey, Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember like, I had to
pick between Muse and Radiohead </connor>
<connor> and I was just like, Muse can slightly, </connor>
<garnt> just slightly edges them out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is there's any Radiohead
songs that I've heard </garnt>
<garnt> that have been like, "I love this song?" </garnt>
<joey> - Have you listened to Creep? </joey>
<connor> - I don't like creep that much. </connor>
<joey> - The best song. </joey>
<joey> - You guys always sing it. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean,
- This is like, </joey>
<connor> it's like the songs.
- Cause it's the least </connor>
<connor> depressing Radiohead song. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't really
like the depressing songs. </connor>
<connor> That's the Weeknd thing. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Cause at least it's gonna not be right. </connor>
<garnt> - He plays (indistinct)
- He always sounds bumpy. </garnt>
<connor> - It's cause I started
listening to the lyrics. </connor>
<joey> I'm not gonna do that
again, that was a mistake. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know like, I
think for me Radiohead, </joey>
<joey> what I appreciate the most
about Radiohead is that </joey>
<joey> they started off as
just like another '90s, </joey>
<joey> alternative rock band. </joey>
<joey> And then, one day they were just like, </joey>
<joey> "No, I don't think I will. </joey>
<joey> "I don't think I'll be another
'90s alternative rock band. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna try something else. </joey>
<connor> And then, okay. </connor>
<connor> Computer came out, and it was one of </connor>
<connor> the most like revolutionary
'90s, rock bands ever. </connor>
<connor> And then, bands like Muse
listened to them was like, </connor>
<garnt> "We can do that too." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> I think I,
- And like the Coldplay </connor>
<connor> as well was like heavily
influenced by Radiohead. </connor>
<joey> All these like big, old
alternative rock bands </joey>
<joey> that went a little experimental. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I feel like Radiohead
are the OG in that sense </joey>
<joey> and they are fucking incredible. </joey>
<connor> And the only reason I
put Muse above them was </connor>
<connor> because I think I discovered
them both around the same time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But there are so many nights where </connor>
<connor> I just like conquered
just listen to Radiohead </connor>
<connor> and I don't know it's, </connor>
<connor> to me if I'm like having
an existential crisis, </connor>
<connor> I put on Radiohead, man. </connor>
<connor> Cause there's nothing that
just encapsulates that mood </connor>
<joey> more than just like a Radiohead song. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Sometimes I'm
just like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> "I just wanna stay home
and just feel depressed." </joey>
<joey> - I wish I could feel this
strongly about music, I did. </joey>
<connor> I remember I was at a place </connor>
<connor> that was like classical music being played </connor>
<connor> and there's this guy, I was enjoying it. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was amazing. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Oh, this
guy's are so talented." </connor>
<connor> And there's a guy who's in the front </connor>
<connor> and I could see him
cause it was kinda like, </connor>
<connor> you know, a good circle, like semi circle. </connor>
<connor> I could see him. </connor>
<connor> And he was like tearing
up how good this was. </connor>
<connor> I remember thinking like,
"Fuck, how did he do that?" </connor>
<connor> - How did he. </connor>
<connor> - How does this mean so much to him? </connor>
<connor> Or how did that make him feel this way? </connor>
<connor> Cause I don't understand,
I like the sound a lot </connor>
<connor> and I really appreciated
the artistry and everything. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Fuck man. </connor>
<garnt> "I wish I was able to
get what that guy had." </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel.
- I felt like shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was he emotional? </garnt>
<garnt> - About from the music, like
really made him emotional. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can easily get that.
- I can't get that. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that's only, </joey>
<garnt> I think there's only two.
- Am I fucked up? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think there's only two
artists in my three by three </garnt>
<connor> that haven't made me cry. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I dunno. </joey>
<garnt> Is that weird that I can't? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think it's weird.
- I don't think it's weird. </connor>
<connor> - I wish I could get that to. </connor>
<connor> - To me I have a different problem. </connor>
<connor> Cause like I said, </connor>
<connor> I never know the deeper
meaning behind the music, </connor>
<joey> but like I've cried to so many songs, </joey>
<joey> I have no idea what they're about. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck.
- Cause they just make me </connor>
<connor> feel things.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna feel these things.
- Why do they </connor>
<connor> make me feel things? </connor>
<connor> Like I don't listen. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what the lyrics mean. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Damn man, this." </garnt>
<joey> - I think like, have you
ever just like sat down </joey>
<joey> and just listened to music? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, nothing. </connor>
<joey> - But I guess nothing, </joey>
<connor> but I guess you're listening
to like Daft Punk and shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I love the beat. </connor>
<connor> - It's nothing like Digital Love </connor>
<connor> isn't necessarily gonna make you cry. </connor>
<connor> - No, all right, you're right. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, all right. </joey>
<connor> I guess it's maybe the music I listen to, </connor>
<connor> the way I consume it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, maybe I dunno. </joey>
<connor> But I don't think it's weird. </connor>
<connor> I think there's a lot of people you. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I don't struggle to </connor>
<joey> when I watch TV or anything, </joey>
<joey> it's like super easy, I cry all the time. </joey>
<joey> - But there are people who like struggle </joey>
<joey> to cry watching movies.
- Yeah, it's true. </joey>
<connor> - So I guess it's the same thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's not like I'm
sitting there like (burps) </connor>
<joey> - Come on tears. </joey>
<joey> (moaning) </joey>
<connor> - I'm not there doing
that, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I don't get what this guy's getting. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand why I, you maybe it's, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know.
- No, no if. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe as I'm mature, I might. </connor>
<garnt> - To me, music is, this's gonna
sound so philosophical now. </garnt>
<joey> It's kinda like a language, </joey>
<joey> They're like,
- Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - I don't speak it. </joey>
<joey> - It is like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> I feel like there is
something being communicated </connor>
<connor> through the language of music and like, </connor>
<connor> I don't even understand
the words behind the music, </connor>
<connor> but I feel, you know? </connor>
<connor> There are times when I think
I feel the language behind it </connor>
<garnt> and like the emotion that
being portrayed with the music. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so fucking weird. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, if animals or anything to go by, </connor>
<connor> you know, dancing is a language, </connor>
<connor> singing is a language,
somehow they don't understand, </connor>
<joey> but I imagine what they're
saying, but it does something </joey>
<joey> and that's how they
decided they, some animals </joey>
<joey> - It's just pulls out, like
just some kind of primal. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, you're right. </joey>
<connor> - I think we have an
inclination to a feel towards it </connor>
<connor> under where my, I fucked it up. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what makes, I
don't what makes good music. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what makes
good music, like literally. </joey>
<joey> - I think what makes good music is just, </joey>
<joey> if it makes you feel a certain way. </joey>
<connor> - I watch like musical memes, </connor>
<connor> like memes that only people who like </connor>
<connor> or are really into music would get. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I feel like this is funny." </connor>
<connor> I just didn't, I just couldn't
understand why it was funny. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I'll be like when somebody plays C minor </connor>
<joey> or something like that
and I'll be like, "what?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> But yeah, that was kind of funny. </joey>
<joey> - That's a bit of a
deep cut, but you know. </joey>
<connor> - I don't if it is,
something along those lines. </connor>
<joey> - And then I guess Tool
is probably the one band </joey>
<joey> that made me love metal again. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - Because like I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Twain Long in the songs? </joey>
<connor> (burping) </connor>
<connor> The name sounds extremely familiar. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, they
- Yeah, cause Joey </garnt>
<connor> used to talked about them
- Cause I used to talk about. </connor>
<connor> - That's okay, that's probably, why, </connor>
<connor> that's probably, why. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I talk about them all the time? </connor>
<connor> But, I think, well, speaking
of like primal instinct, </connor>
<connor> I think like Tool does the
best job of like pulling out </connor>
<garnt> that primal instinct in
people when they listen </garnt>
<garnt> to the music.
- I also I thought </garnt>
<garnt> you were talking about that band. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no.
- I'm like Monkey. </joey>
<joey> (blabbering) </joey>
<joey> - I was like primal
instinct, I love that band. </joey>
<joey> - There's a band called
Primal Scream, which is good. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> But not primal instinct. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I don't know like Tool is like, </joey>
<joey> I don't think they necessarily </joey>
<joey> have like a hit song or anything. </joey>
<joey> They're kind of like one
of those just cult bands, </joey>
<joey> I guess maybe like the pot. </joey>
<garnt> - Sober, The Pot.
- Yeah, Sober, The Pot </garnt>
<garnt> Prison Sex, there's there's
a lot of like good songs. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think what makes it, like. </garnt>
<garnt> I think what makes Tool amazing, </garnt>
<garnt> what I feel love with Tool is that like, </garnt>
<garnt> especially this is a band that like, </garnt>
<garnt> you need to listen to the lyrics. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck.
- Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not like it but what I
love about Tool is that </garnt>
<connor> their music just in
general is so fucking good </connor>
<connor> that you'll still enjoy yourself without </connor>
<connor> listening to the lyrics at all. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So like Maynard James Keenan, </connor>
<connor> who's this guy in the
middle, he's the lead singer. </connor>
<connor> In his, in like Tool Stage
Shows and like concerts, </connor>
<connor> normally the lead singer
is in the front, Right? </connor>
<connor> But Maynard for some reason is
behind a curtain in the back. </connor>
<connor> Like you can't even see him
half the time in concerts. </connor>
<connor> And that's because he treats his voice </connor>
<connor> as just another instrument.
- I know that. </connor>
<connor> - And if you want to listen in, closely, </connor>
<connor> on what he's saying, then you can. </connor>
<connor> If you don't want to, you don't have to. </connor>
<connor> There's the rest of the band to listen to. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's like, so
fucking cool because it's like, </connor>
<connor> again it goes back to
that whole thing of like, </connor>
<connor> you might have like some deep
ass message behind your music, </connor>
<connor> but if your music sucks, then
no one's gonna listen to it, </connor>
<connor> right?
- True, true. </connor>
<connor> And Tool's like, we can make banger songs </connor>
<connor> and we can make profound lyrics. </connor>
<connor> - That makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, that's like I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's just like musicians. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I inspire to be that. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, like I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Tool is one of those metal bands, </connor>
<connor> that even non metal fans love. </connor>
<connor> - Mm. </connor>
<connor> - I think every person I've shown Tool, </connor>
<connor> who is like not necessarily
into metal music, </connor>
<connor> is like, "Yeah, this fucking slabs." </connor>
<connor> - Oh.
- So like, I'd recommend, </connor>
<connor> if you don't like metal listen Tool. </connor>
<connor> - And then, oh God. </connor>
<connor> I guess we'll go to Dr.
Doom as Connor alluded to. </connor>
<connor> - MF Doom.
- MF Doom. </connor>
<connor> - I knew that, I knew
that I shouldn't have. </connor>
<connor> - So MF Doom, yeah. </connor>
<joey> As Connor said, is your favorite
Rapper's favorite rapper? </joey>
<garnt> - Mm, I've seen that YouTube video. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you've seen
that in YouTube videos? </garnt>
<connor> - I've, he's like a legend. </connor>
<connor> I've heard so much about this person, </connor>
<connor> but I've never listened to their music. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So basically like Tyler The Creator </joey>
<joey> and like you know, fucking. </joey>
<joey> Literally every rapper, everyone
loves I and has gotten big, </joey>
<connor> has been somehow inspired by MF Doom. </connor>
<connor> Just because he's like, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> He's like the hiphop fans,
hip hop, if that makes sense? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly.
- Because I feel like </connor>
<connor> before MF Doom, the only hip hop </connor>
<connor> I ever really listened
to growing up was Eminem. </connor>
<connor> But that's because Eminem back then </connor>
<connor> was like fucking inescapable. </connor>
<connor> During Eminem show era,
Eminem was everywhere, right? </connor>
<connor> So I feel back then, I didn't
really take hiphop seriously </connor>
<connor> or like rapping seriously,
other than Eminem. </connor>
<connor> But then I listen to MF
Doom, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, hold on, this might actually, </connor>
<connor> "this might actually be good. </connor>
<connor> "This might be some good music." </connor>
<joey> Again, another artist you
need to listen to the lyrics. </joey>
<joey> So.
- Yeah, I remember that. </joey>
<connor> I don't know who broke that music? </connor>
<joey> Vox or something. </joey>
<joey> - Vox did a video on it,
- I think they did </joey>
<joey> break down the lyrics. </joey>
<joey> - They did like an Elon video. </joey>
<joey> - On and I was like, "This is amazing. </joey>
<connor> "I just don't, I don't know." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just,
- I dunno. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think I could
ever garner this by myself. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Or even become close to
garnering this by myself. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, when they tell
you why the piano is amaz </connor>
<connor> or this specific piano is amazing. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "I'm sure it is. </joey>
<joey> "It certainly looks the best." </joey>
<connor> But I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> No, it makes sense, it makes sense. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's just like
good music in general. </connor>
<joey> Again, I'm having a hard time explaining </joey>
<connor> why this is good to people </connor>
<connor> who aren't on the same wavelength. </connor>
<joey> - Well, well,
- Well, luckily, </joey>
<connor> any hardcore music fans here </connor>
<connor> can appreciate your taste. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure.
- You're right, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Well, well, okay. </joey>
<joey> If we were more hardcore into music, </joey>
<garnt> how would you explain it then? </garnt>
<connor> Cause I am curious. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so.
- Break, it down for me. </connor>
<connor> - Break it down.
- Break it, break it down. </connor>
<connor> - Focusing a 100%.
- Break it down. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so Tool, for example
is like just the sound </joey>
<joey> and their singing style and
the way they structure songs </joey>
<garnt> it just has like a flow to it. </garnt>
<garnt> One song could have like
seven or eight different parts </garnt>
<garnt> that sound like seven or
eight different songs. </garnt>
<garnt> But somehow they can stitch
that bitch up together </garnt>
<garnt> and make it sound so
cohesive and like together, </garnt>
<joey> to the point where you can listen through </joey>
<joey> a 15 minute Tool song and
it'll sound like two minutes. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was gonna ask how
long is a typical Tool song? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - They're not actually too. </joey>
<joey> I mean, they obviously have
like long songs as well, </joey>
<joey> but I think average Tool songs, </joey>
<joey> maybe like five, six minutes. </joey>
<joey> - It's quite long. </joey>
<connor> - Which I guess is long. </connor>
<connor> But I mean like, if you
compare it to like say, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, a Tangerine Dream song, </connor>
<connor> like a standard Tangerine Dream song </connor>
<connor> is like 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> - That's a good name.
- Yeah, so. </connor>
<connor> - I've never heard of them,
but that's a good name. </connor>
<connor> - So Tangerine Dream is this German group. </connor>
<connor> - Tangerine Dream?
- Yeah, Tangerine Dream. </connor>
<joey> - That's a good statement you
don't have to say anymore. </joey>
<connor> - It's a great fucking band name. </connor>
<connor> So they're a German group that like, </connor>
<joey> does electronica and ambient music. </joey>
<joey> And I put them there because
this is the one group, </joey>
<connor> I used to listen to all the time </connor>
<connor> in school while I was studying. </connor>
<connor> - How did you find out about this band? </connor>
<connor> - Right, its incredible.
- My dad showed them to me. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay, I was gonna say this. </connor>
<connor> Seems like very big.
- So basically every, </connor>
<joey> I reckon everyone except
maybe the bottom three here. </joey>
<garnt> I found out through my dad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay.
- Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like he, yeah, he just. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, he raised you well, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But he's proud of you.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So Tangerine Dream have been around, </garnt>
<connor> they're still around, actually. </connor>
<connor> They've been around
like 60 years is almost. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - I think they've been
around since the early '60s </connor>
<connor> and they're still going. </connor>
<connor> - What?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Cameraman] 1968. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking hell, what? </garnt>
<garnt> - And they're still, they're still going. </garnt>
<garnt> They have like. </garnt>
<garnt> I think they have like 400
studio albums or something. </garnt>
<connor> They have a big, big, big catalog. </connor>
<connor> Like it's stupid amount
of albums they've made. </connor>
<connor> But like basically they've revolutionized </connor>
<connor> like chill electronica,
meditation music, ambient music, </connor>
<connor> that kind of stuff. </connor>
<connor> And it's like perfect study material. </connor>
<connor> - Huh.
- Because it's like, </connor>
<connor> there's no lyrics.
- Better than Lo-fi better? </connor>
<connor> - Better than Lo-fi. </connor>
<connor> - It should be that Lo-fi hiphop girl. </connor>
<connor> Is it full shit?
- Lo-fi hip hop girl </connor>
<joey> wishes they were Tangerine. </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<connor> But yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's just like really good like. </connor>
<connor> Tangerine Dream I would say </connor>
<connor> is like perfect background music. </connor>
<connor> If you're at like, you know, </connor>
<connor> if you have like friends
over and you're just like, </connor>
<connor> you just wanna like hang out </connor>
<connor> or you're like you know,
you have your fucking like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, fiance's parents over. </connor>
<joey> And you don't wanna sound, </joey>
<joey> you don't wanna look
weird by putting on Tool </joey>
<joey> in the background, you know. </joey>
<connor> Tangerine Dream is like the music to go. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- Because it's just like, </connor>
<connor> it's just relaxing, it's
inoffensive, it's just. </connor>
<connor> - I'll check it out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and they got a lot of good songs. </connor>
<connor> They did a lot of movie soundtracks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really?
- Yeah, so, </connor>
<connor> - Any movie song I know? </connor>
<connor> - There was this. </connor>
<connor> What was the Tom Cruise movie </connor>
<connor> that they did the soundtrack to? </connor>
<connor> - [Cameraman] Jack Reacher. </connor>
<connor> - They did a lot of soundtracks though. </connor>
<connor> And like game soundtracks
as well that they're done. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, what?
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So.
- What kind of games? </garnt>
<garnt> - I wish I could tell. </garnt>
<garnt> They've done, they've done 400 albums. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fucking remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Camera Man] Risky Business?
- Risky business, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> They did the Risky Business soundtrack. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh wow. </joey>
<joey> - Which is like probably
one of their best albums. </joey>
<joey> They literally just three German dudes </joey>
<joey> who play a lot of relaxing music. </joey>
<connor> - Goddamn, they've got
a fucking work ethic. </connor>
<joey> - They've gotta work ethic.
- Fuck me! </joey>
<connor> - And then I guess Nick Drake is this guy. </connor>
<connor> - Who's that? </connor>
<joey> - So Nick Drake is like,
so he's like kind of, </joey>
<joey> he plays folk music.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> - As if you couldn't
tell from this picture. </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<joey> But he basically. </joey>
<joey> It's really hard to describe him. </joey>
<joey> So he basically, </joey>
<connor> he killed himself very early in his crew. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - I think he was like 23, 24 </connor>
<connor> when he killed himself.
- Oh, Jesus. </connor>
<connor> But he made this one
album called Pink Moon. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's literally
just him and a guitar. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- That's it. </connor>
<connor> And it's like super Lo-fi. </connor>
<connor> It's just him just like
singing just one guitar. </connor>
<connor> Occasionally, maybe like a piano. </connor>
<connor> But it's so like, it's one of like, look, </connor>
<connor> when it comes to depression,
as a theme in music. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of artists have done it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Like all sorts of different angles. </connor>
<connor> In my opinion, Pink Moon,
is probably the most fucking </connor>
<connor> hard hitting and like real album </connor>
<connor> when it comes to depression
and exploring depression. </connor>
<connor> - What makes you to say that? </connor>
<connor> - It's because it's not only
just the tone of his singing </connor>
<connor> and just the fact that
it's just him and a guitar, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But, again, it's like lyrics obviously. </connor>
<connor> He has this one song called, </connor>
<connor> I think it's called Black Dog. </connor>
<connor> And it inspired a book called Black Dog. </connor>
<connor> - Great.
- Where it's like, </connor>
<joey> depression is like a black dog. </joey>
<joey> It just like keeps coming back. </joey>
<joey> And that's from the song that he wrote. </joey>
<joey> But it's like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's like it's beautiful. </joey>
<joey> But it's like haunting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like really
really fucking haunting. </joey>
<joey> And every time I play this album, </joey>
<joey> this is like a couple
of songs that I just hit </joey>
<connor> where I'm just like breakdown, crying. </connor>
<connor> - I guess, cause you
know the, you know what, </connor>
<garnt> how real the stuff is.
- Well, when someone's </garnt>
<connor> in that state of mind, </connor>
<connor> Sometimes it's like sometimes </connor>
<joey> you can't always express yourself </joey>
<joey> or communicate that emotion </joey>
<joey> without having a medium like
music or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - What I can say, is
that Nick Drake is music, </joey>
<garnt> but what it's certainly
not is entertainment. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It is this.
- Or he has me pampered. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would dare say, it
really is the awesome. </garnt>
<connor> It is just like, it is music
in its purest artistic form. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, okay.
- Where it's like, </connor>
<connor> you don't put on a Nick Drake
album to fucking jam out. </connor>
<connor> You put on a Nick Drake
album to self reflect </connor>
<connor> and just kind of take it in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And kind of you learn from it. </connor>
<garnt> Because he was like,
he was super depressed. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm talking like mega, mega,
mega depressed from a child. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I believe that. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, </garnt>
<garnt> and like it led him to take his own life, </garnt>
<connor> even though he was like
extremely fucking talented. </connor>
<connor> He probably had a bright
future ahead of him </connor>
<connor> if he kept going, but. </connor>
<connor> - Depression was very hard to deal with. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So then he just kind of gained </connor>
<connor> a cult status because of that. </connor>
<connor> And my sister actually
like put me onto Nick Drake </connor>
<connor> because I guess she was
in a stage in her life </connor>
<connor> where she kind of was like in that mood. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it was like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like I found him
in like the perfect time. </connor>
<garnt> And again, this is not an
artist I would recommend </garnt>
<garnt> to people who want bangers.
- Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I feel like that type of music </garnt>
<garnt> or that type of media
definitely has a place </garnt>
<joey> because especially like when
you are in a dark place, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you're not
looking for happy music </joey>
<joey> or things to cheery up
or like listening to, </joey>
<joey> I guess someone who has been </joey>
<connor> in that same emotional state as you, </connor>
<connor> or maybe finding someone who you feel </connor>
<connor> is in that same emotional stage as you. </connor>
<connor> There's like a comfort knowing that </connor>
<garnt> at least you're not the only one </garnt>
<joey> who's feeling like this now. </joey>
<garnt> - And when I was in that
moment in my life as well </garnt>
<garnt> and listening to Nick Drake, </garnt>
<garnt> I think this album cheered me up </garnt>
<joey> more than any fucking album. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause when I'm really
depressed and really sad, </garnt>
<joey> listening to depressing
music cheers me up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like listening to happy music </joey>
<joey> just makes me more depressed. </joey>
<joey> Cause I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "How does, how dare."
- Why are they happy </joey>
<joey> and I'm not?
- You're probably depressed. </joey>
<connor> - How dare this beat, be
like upbeat and like happy. </connor>
<connor> How dare these people be happy, </connor>
<connor> but you listen to depressing songs </connor>
<joey> and I'm just like, fuck man. </joey>
<joey> I'm not, I'm not alone.
- I'm not the only one. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not the only one.
- Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the thing, is like I feel listening </garnt>
<connor> to happy music while depressed
just does the opposite effect </connor>
<connor> because it makes you go, </connor>
<connor> how come they're happy, but I'm not. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, I can't relate
to this happy mood right now </connor>
<joey> because that's not where I am. </joey>
<connor> Right now I'm in this dark
depressing like somber moment. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I need something that can like, </connor>
<garnt> you know, compliment that feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So that's why I love Nick Drake. </connor>
<connor> And then yeah, I talked about MF Doom. </connor>
<connor> American football? </connor>
<joey> So they're pretty much. </joey>
<joey> I think there are a recent like addition </joey>
<joey> to my favorite bands. </joey>
<joey> But they made me fall in love </joey>
<joey> with this genre of music
called Midwest emo. </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - [Connor, Garnt] What? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What the? </joey>
<joey> - There is a genre of
music called Midwest emo. </joey>
<joey> - You know what people
say, genres out loud. </joey>
<connor> And I'm just think, "You're just lying." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Like I just like.
- Like you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Like at this point, I feel
like music, most of all, </garnt>
<joey> like people just make up genres. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> Of course they do.
- It it's music most of all. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course, ff course they do. </joey>
<joey> They're just like, "It's not punk. </joey>
<joey> "It's just some derivative of punk. </joey>
<joey> "We don't wanna be the
same as those punk bands." </joey>
<joey> - So what's so good about 'em man. </joey>
<joey> Why do like, is emo country? </joey>
<garnt> - No.
- Emo Midwest. </garnt>
<joey> Midwest emo.
- Midwest emo. </joey>
<garnt> - How'd you define Midwest emo? </garnt>
<garnt> - What's Midwest? </garnt>
<joey> - It is emo made by bands </joey>
<joey> who have lived in the Midwest America. </joey>
<garnt> - So what is the difference
between Midwest emo and emo? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so emo. </joey>
<connor> - In terms of sound? </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Is there a Southern emo? </connor>
<connor> (Blabbers)
- I'm sure there is, </connor>
<connor> but I wouldn't be aware of it. </connor>
<connor> So Midwest emo is like. </connor>
<connor> So basically these guys founded the genre </connor>
<connor> and like the Indie scene
for the past 20 years </connor>
<connor> has been just filled
with Midwest emo bands. </connor>
<connor> - It has?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> They're like, they're like,
- I have no idea. </connor>
<connor> - There's a lot of bands
who have gotten big off </connor>
<connor> like Band Camp and like SoundCloud </connor>
<connor> and like Spotify and stuff,
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Just that are in this genre. </connor>
<connor> And it's like. </connor>
<connor> (burps) </connor>
<connor> How do I explain Midwest emo? </connor>
<joey> It's like Indie rock and
Math rock with folk music. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - What is Math rock? </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God.
- This's why, </connor>
<joey> I don't understand.
- How do you explain </joey>
<joey> math rock now? </joey>
<connor> - This is the problem cause every time, </connor>
<connor> I speak to people who really know music, </connor>
<connor> they start saying things to me, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "You're just
lying, you just lying." </connor>
<connor> Like why isn't that on iTunes, that thing? </connor>
<joey> Am I stupid, like? </joey>
<joey> - It is on iTunes, probably. </joey>
<joey> - It probably is now, but to me it's like, </joey>
<connor> "Are we categorizing
music too much, like?" </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I guess. </connor>
<garnt> But that's because I feel music
just in general has expanded </garnt>
<garnt> to so far that it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of a shame to
just throw it all away. </garnt>
<joey> It's just rock or pop. </joey>
<joey> - That's true, I guess. </joey>
<connor> Maybe this is just my own
inability to understand it. </connor>
<connor> And so I'm just like, "why?" </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean </joey>
<joey> It's the same thing with
like electronic music, right? </joey>
<connor> Like we have electronica, you
have house, you have trance, </connor>
<connor> you have techno.
- Yeah, I guess. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas someone who doesn't
like music will be like, </connor>
<garnt> "It's just all electronic." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just the beeps and the boobs. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just the beeps
and the boobs, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So same thing with Mid.
- That's trash. </garnt>
<garnt> - So Midwest emo is like,
as the name suggests, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the lyrical
themes are very depressing. </garnt>
<connor> But it's not like folk music, </connor>
<connor> like strictly.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's not like a Nick Drake. </connor>
<connor> It's like, there's a band behind it. </connor>
<connor> Usually a lot of the songs can be upbeat, </connor>
<joey> but usually the lyrical
contents are very depressing. </joey>
<joey> Hence the emo. </joey>
<connor> - So that makes the emo
when it's depressing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Okay. </joey>
<connor> - It's kinda like, it's kinda like emo. </connor>
<joey> This is gonna sound really bad. </joey>
<joey> Midwest emo is like Nick
Drake, if you were privileged. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like if you were like, if you were like </connor>
<garnt> - I dunno if that's a hard tackle. </garnt>
<joey> - If you like, if you like,
- I don't understand </joey>
<joey> a lot about music.
- If you were like, </joey>
<joey> you know,
- We're getting into </joey>
<garnt> so many layers right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Midwest emo is like
it's coming from bands </joey>
<joey> who're like have lived in the Midwest </joey>
<joey> in small towns where it's not like </joey>
<joey> they're born into poverty </joey>
<connor> - It's kinda shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just like they
kinda just lived in a town </connor>
<connor> that's in the middle of
nowhere in the Midwest, </connor>
<garnt> - Right.
- not a whole lot to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay.
- Except get sad about shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Because they don't </garnt>
<garnt> Because they have like,
- Because you're </garnt>
<garnt> from Minnesota,
- Suburban Emo? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is like Suburban Emo. </garnt>
<joey> That's the only way.
- I just made that up. </joey>
<connor> - It is, it is literal. </connor>
<connor> It is a.
- I just made a new genre </connor>
<joey> of music right now.
- It is emo rock. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - With mixes of folk music for people </joey>
<joey> who live in suburbs in Midwest areas. </joey>
<joey> - I think I understand. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Cameraman] Paramore. </joey>
<joey> - Paramore?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So Paramore
- Paramore, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Paramore kind of took Midwest emo sound </joey>
<connor> and put a little bit more
of like a punk twist on it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- You're right. </connor>
<connor> - So they're a little more like a upbeat. </connor>
<connor> But there's still like </connor>
<connor> the lyrical context of like Paramore songs </connor>
<connor> are still very much like, </connor>
<connor> I'm feeling depressed because
this girl doesn't like me </connor>
<connor> and she left me and you know,
- Yeah, true. </connor>
<joey> - It's like my town has nothing, </joey>
<joey> my friends have all moved
away, that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So American Football is that. </joey>
<joey> And through American football,
I found I've like, so, </joey>
<connor> you know how Spotify has that, </connor>
<connor> like Spotify wrapped.
- Yeah, yap. </connor>
<connor> - Midwest emo was number
two for me last year. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - And American Football
was a big reason for that. </connor>
<connor> - Wow.
- Because I just listened </connor>
<connor> to a lot of American Football,
- Used to that much. </connor>
<connor> - And not just American football, </connor>
<connor> - Got that outta influence?
- There's a lot of other, </connor>
<connor> like Midwest emo. </connor>
<connor> And I basically just found this large pool </connor>
<joey> of Midwest emo bands and
they're all fucking amazing. </joey>
<joey> - What appeals to you about Midwest emo? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> That's such a random like.
- It is right. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's such a random genre of music. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> For one, the music is just good. </connor>
<connor> Like, it sounds good,
it's like performed well, </connor>
<connor> because it's got blends of math rock, </connor>
<connor> which is very technical
rock and technical guitar. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - I just love that sound in general. </connor>
<connor> Japan does a lot of really good math rock. </connor>
<connor> Japan has it's own branch </connor>
<connor> of math rock, called Japanese Math Rock. </connor>
<connor> And Japan is like really
fucking good at just like, </connor>
<joey> (blabbering) </joey>
<connor> Like Ling Tosite Sigure,
for instance, right. </connor>
<connor> like the opening psychopath
their first song? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's math rock. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - Where it's like very technical guitar. </connor>
<connor> - Didn't know that.
- And it's just like </connor>
<connor> very Whaley.
- Fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - But Midwest emo kind of
takes a lot of that style </connor>
<joey> of just like technical guitar,
which just as a guitarist, </joey>
<joey> I can appreciate for once. </joey>
<garnt> - That makes sense.
- Like one thing </garnt>
<garnt> I always want to know is like, </garnt>
<joey> how much do you appreciate
music in a technical sense? </joey>
<joey> Or like a theory sense, where obviously, </joey>
<connor> you're way more musical trained, </connor>
<connor> musically trained than say I am. </connor>
<garnt> So how much does that play
into your taste in music </garnt>
<garnt> or your appreciation of music in general? </garnt>
<joey> - I Mean if I hear
something I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh that's cool." </connor>
<joey> What did you just do there? </joey>
<connor> Then obviously I'm gonna
like perk my ears up. </connor>
<connor> But I'm not gonna fall in love with a band </connor>
<connor> just because they're technical. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- That makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - Because again, </connor>
<connor> at the end of the day,
- It's feeling, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- If your music isn't good, </connor>
<connor> then it's not good, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know, </connor>
<connor> I've listened to a lot of Midwest emo </connor>
<connor> and even like metal, like
technical metal bands </connor>
<connor> or stuff like that where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, your technical, you are skilled." </connor>
<connor> But, the music isn't really
for me, kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then I guess finally, </connor>
<connor> is the only Japanese guy, is Maeda Jun. </connor>
<connor> He basically, </connor>
<connor> - That name sound familiar.
- Yeah, he wrote music </connor>
<connor> for like Kanade.
- He also wrote Kanade. </connor>
<connor> He also wrote </connor>
<joey> Kanade, Aaron Cannon.
- What? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and Angel B, </connor>
<joey> so basically every key.
- So basically, </joey>
<joey> what makes Maeda Jun,
- Is this cause </joey>
<connor> you got into The Gacha recently? </connor>
<joey> - That too. </joey>
<garnt> But what makes Maeda Jun my fucking idol, </garnt>
<garnt> is just, again, the fact that
this man can single handedly </garnt>
<joey> write a story, write characters </joey>
<joey> and just write all the music for it. </joey>
<joey> Just single handedly. </joey>
<joey> - It must be an advantage then. </joey>
<joey> You can like, you know the characters </joey>
<joey> in the story better than anyone. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - You can craft the whole music. </connor>
<connor> - But I don't know like. </connor>
<joey> Of course I like, I look up to this guy </joey>
<joey> just for his ability to tell a story </joey>
<joey> because like Kanade and Aaron and Cannon </joey>
<connor> and angel beats are like,
you know, great stories. </connor>
<connor> But like, I think the one
thing that makes Maeda </connor>
<connor> like I appreciate Maeda Jun </connor>
<connor> is just how fucking
musically talented he is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because not only can he
write like somba piano tracks </connor>
<connor> that have no lyrics at all, </connor>
<connor> the entirety of the Kanade a soundtrack, </connor>
<connor> and make me cry like a fucking baby. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I cried, I cried. </connor>
<joey> - But he can write
fucking bangers as well. </joey>
<joey> Like you know, any of
the Angel Beats songs. </joey>
<joey> - Yep, yep. </joey>
<joey> - Are absolute fucking
like Girl's Dead Monster </joey>
<joey> that fictional band he
created in Angel Beats, </joey>
<joey> every song is a banger. </joey>
<joey> I'm like you can write bangers
and you can make me cry. </joey>
<connor> - It's pretty impressive,
I didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> - Like how do you do that?
- I didn't know that really. </connor>
<joey> - And so you were talking </joey>
<connor> about The Gacha Game I got into. </connor>
<connor> So Key recently released a Gacha Game </connor>
<connor> called Heaven Burns Red, </connor>
<connor> which is the first fully Maeda Jun </connor>
<joey> produced game in 15 years. </joey>
<joey> - Huh. </joey>
<joey> - And so he wrote the story. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it a visual novel? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's yeah, it's kind of
it's very dialogue intensive. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's a fucking Maeda Jun game. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (sniffing) </connor>
<connor> - But it's also like a turn
base RPG kind of thing as well. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Of course it does Gacha. </connor>
<connor> - Of course.
- You know I've I love it. </connor>
<connor> - Kinda he's got his music? </connor>
<connor> - He wrote the story, he
wrote the character designs. </connor>
<joey> He came up with the character designs. </joey>
<joey> - Huh. </joey>
<joey> - He came up with a scenario </joey>
<joey> and he wrote all the music for it. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Fucking hell. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's why he hasn't
been doing anime recently. </garnt>
<joey> Hasn't he? </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - All this time in a Gacha Game. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's also because
he's been extremely sick. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true.
- As well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh man. </connor>
<connor> - Like the whole, you know
the whole theme in Angel Beats </connor>
<connor> about the heart thing, that's
just based off his own life. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Because he has </connor>
<connor> - Fuck hell.
- A chronic heart disease </connor>
<connor> or something.
- This is a beast or something </connor>
<connor> He's done so much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Jesus! </connor>
<connor> - I mean he wrote, I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<joey> I dunno if this is true, </joey>
<joey> but I think he wrote Angel
Beats in the hospital bed. </joey>
<joey> - Seriously. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, while he was admitted to hospital, </joey>
<garnt> he wrote Angel Beats.
- What the, what a bam </garnt>
<garnt> or something.
- And it's just, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's just like, he's a bam. </garnt>
<garnt> And the fact that like,
again, this man, doesn't miss. </garnt>
<garnt> Not just like he hate it.
- He don't miss. </garnt>
<garnt> - He don't miss, like every, </garnt>
<joey> even in the new game, the story is great. </joey>
<joey> The characters are great
and the music fucking slaps. </joey>
<connor> - So I guess, I guess everything else </connor>
<connor> just lifts your enjoyment
of the music more. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- And it's like okay, but. </connor>
<joey> - And I feel like, you
know we were saying earlier </joey>
<joey> that like Fooly Cooly as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Like pillows, </joey>
<connor> I was very close to putting
Pillows because that's just like </connor>
<connor> - Pitches it out for you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think Maeda Jun just
pitches it out for me </connor>
<joey> because as much as I love
the Fooly Cool soundtrack, </joey>
<joey> the first soundtrack
that made me fall in love </joey>
<joey> with soundtracks was Kanade. </joey>
<joey> Because like, again, as a pianist myself, </joey>
<connor> listening to like piano music </connor>
<connor> that makes me fucking break
down crying like bitch. </connor>
<connor> - Can perform it.
(sobbing) </connor>
<connor> - And it's like I can't even, </connor>
<connor> I can't even learn to play
these songs without crying. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like that's,
- That's wholesome. </connor>
<connor> - And that's like really
hard to do as someone </connor>
<connor> who like you know. </connor>
<connor> Cause as someone who writes music, </connor>
<connor> I strive to do that to people. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And the fact that this guy can do it </connor>
<connor> over and over, and over again, </connor>
<joey> with everything also writes is like, </joey>
<joey> "How do you do that?" </joey>
<connor> - I can murmur at all that talent. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's not fair. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just saying, man. </joey>
<joey> Key would not be where
they are without this guy. </joey>
<garnt> - Hey, sometimes you see someone </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, "You're
a bit too talented. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - This is unfair.
- You're, </joey>
<joey> - And he's good looking like, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- As if I couldn't like </joey>
<joey> give me something </joey>
<garnt> to hate about you.
- God, obviously didn't love </garnt>
<joey> all humans equally.
- No, true. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing)
- He made you. </joey>
<joey> - Hate Maeda Jun.
- He made on Maeda Jun. </joey>
<connor> - It's not fair, it's not fair. </connor>
<connor> - It's not fair. </connor>
<joey> - I wish I had a sliver of
the talent this guy has. </joey>
<connor> But I guess,
- That guy's so talented. </connor>
<joey> - That's my three by my three. </joey>
<garnt> - I was very, I feel like I learned a lot. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't even know anything.
- I learned way more than </connor>
<garnt> me talking myself or listening to Connor. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, no, no, man. </joey>
<joey> I feel a little bit
pushback because I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I need to somehow top Garnt
living in anime, Beck story. </joey>
<connor> - You can't, </connor>
<joey> you can't top that.
- I couldn't top it. </joey>
<joey> So I was like.
- We call that </joey>
<joey> the Slumdog Millionaire. </joey>
<joey> Boy, we're just living in Garnt's life. </joey>
<connor> We're not, we're not in this. </connor>
<connor> Garnt's story is his own.
- I swear. </connor>
<joey> - I will forever live in that shadow. </joey>
<garnt> - I swear, I have mentioned before, </garnt>
<joey> I've been in the band, just.
- You've not, you've not. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, same way everyone's
been in the band. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, no, you don't know.
- Why does that mean? </connor>
<connor> - I've been, I've been in like six bands, </connor>
<joey> but I never had a cool story like that. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought when I said I was in a band, </garnt>
<connor> everyone had similarly experience. </connor>
<connor> - No, no.
- It's not at all </connor>
<connor> - You're wrong. </connor>
<connor> - For example, what normally happens </connor>
<connor> when you're in the band then? </connor>
<joey> - You're just kinda like.
- You're not playing gigs. </joey>
<garnt> - Pretend to
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You go to the drummer's house, </garnt>
<joey> you play a couple of cover songs. </joey>
<joey> - That's it.
- And then you're like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, cool, see you never again." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that happens all the time. </connor>
<connor> You sing Smash Mouth once.
- What's the, </connor>
<connor> what's the point of forming a band, </connor>
<connor> if you're not gonna play gigs? </connor>
<connor> - I mean.
- How you, </connor>
<connor> how you gonna play gig? </connor>
<connor> How you gonna arrange that? </connor>
<connor> - How you gonna play gigs?
