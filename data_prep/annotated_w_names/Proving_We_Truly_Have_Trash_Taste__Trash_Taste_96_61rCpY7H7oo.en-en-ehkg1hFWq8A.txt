<joey> (upbeat music) </joey>
<joey> (Joey groans) </joey>
<joey> - Trash Taste. (Connor groans) </joey>
<joey> (relaxing music) </joey>
<joey> Hello, you fabulous fun bags. </joey>
<garnt> Welcome back to another episode </garnt>
<garnt> of Trash Taste podcast. - Oh, god. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god. - Oh my god. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm fun bag number one </joey>
<joey> with fun bag number two and three. </joey>
<garnt> - Are you filling fun today, Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm feeling super fun today. </joey>
<garnt> - I gotta say, you kinda look like fucking Rocky Balboa </garnt>
<garnt> about to run up those steps right now. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey screams) </garnt>
<connor> - That is a very sports-like jumper. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it? </garnt>
<connor> - It does look like the stereotypical I'm about to montage. </connor>
<joey> - I walked in the office and Meilyne called me a fuck boy. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I appreciated that or not. </joey>
<connor> - It's because you have short hair and a beanie. </connor>
<connor> - It's the short hair, beanie, and the rings, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You shaved your facial hair. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we all did. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we all did. </connor>
<joey> - For the charity stream that we just finished. </joey>
<joey> - People are gonna be like, oh my god, this episode's so, </joey>
<connor> they recorded this so long ago. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> Really dating ourselves. </joey>
<joey> We're like, yeah, we just recorded the charity stream, </joey>
<joey> which was probably- </joey>
<garnt> - For you guys was like a month ago. </garnt>
<joey> For us, it was two days ago. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it was a month and a half ago, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Oh, more than that, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we're trying to get ahead </joey>
<garnt> before we fly off once again. </garnt>
<joey> - But yeah, if you guys didn't know about it, </joey>
<joey> we just finished a 24-hour charity stream </joey>
<joey> for Doctors Without Borders, </joey>
<joey> and it was extremely successful. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was very surprised. </garnt>
<garnt> We raised 176, </garnt>
<connor> but we haven't added the amounts- </connor>
<garnt> - It's about 180, I think, total. </garnt>
<garnt> - About 180, adding everything that we collected in total. </garnt>
<joey> - That's crazy. - That's nuts. </joey>
<joey> - Crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Which is absolutely fucking nuts. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what we expected out of this charity stream. </garnt>
<joey> - There was a part of me when we were deciding, </joey>
<joey> okay, what are we gonna make our goal? </joey>
<garnt> And someone was like 100,000. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, in 24, that's a lot of money, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, maybe if we are like doing </joey>
<garnt> a week-long subathon maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, or something like that. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I don't know, I only did one charity stream once, </joey>
<garnt> years and years ago with Aki, </garnt>
<garnt> and we did not raise nearly that much money. </garnt>
<garnt> I think, in the back of my head, I had that as my benchmark. </garnt>
<garnt> So when I heard a 100,000, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> dude, we're not fucking PewDiePie or Jacksepticeye. </joey>
<joey> We're not gonna hit those numbers. </joey>
<joey> Turns out, we kinda did, because we were number one </joey>
<joey> on Twitch for that night. </joey>
<joey> Which was nuts. - Yeah, yeah, I mean, </joey>
<garnt> I think we peaked at 53,000 viewers, which is insane. </garnt>
<connor> - PB. - Quite a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, personal best, personal best. </garnt>
<garnt> - Quite a lot. </garnt>
<connor> That's definitely the most I've been involved in. </connor>
<joey> - It's definitely the most I've had, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely by far. </joey>
<garnt> Well, I'm not even the streamer. </garnt>
<joey> So that's definitely the most I've been a part of. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just ridiculous. </joey>
<garnt> - But how was the experience for you boys? </garnt>
<joey> - You know what? </joey>
<joey> Even though I went into it with zero sleep, </joey>
<garnt> it was probably the most fun stream I've ever been in. </garnt>
<garnt> I would absolutely do that again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Part of me is just like, I would absolutely do that again. </garnt>
<joey> And part of me is- - Not anytime soon. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a part of me is just like, </joey>
<garnt> man, I remember those last six hours, that was- </garnt>
<connor> - I'll do it again once I forget about how hard </connor>
<joey> the last six hours were. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, yeah, this is fine, we can do this again. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, at least I had you guys and Chris and Mouse there, </joey>
<joey> because, if I had done it by myself, </joey>
<joey> I would not have lasted 10 hours. </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the last two, three hours. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just running on complete autopilot. </garnt>
<joey> You know when you're just using the part of your brain </joey>
<joey> that isn't even thinking? </joey>
<joey> It's just like habits you've built up? </joey>
<garnt> That was just me, I was just like- </garnt>
<joey> - I saw bits and pieces of the board </joey>
<joey> where it's just you alone on the couch, </joey>
<garnt> and you're just like, "Thank you for the $20 donation." </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It kind of got to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where I was just questioning my own insanity. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it was just- - Is that sanity really? </connor>
<garnt> - Sanity? Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or insanity? </garnt>
<connor> I questioned my own sanity. </connor>
<garnt> - Questioned my own sanity. </garnt>
<joey> - My favorite clip though is where you two were </joey>
<joey> on the couch and you just started going, </joey>
<joey> "Well, let's have all the boys. </joey>
<joey> All right, let's have all the boys." </joey>
<joey> And they Garnt, in the most unenthusiastic way, goes, </joey>
<joey> "Get hype, guys." </joey>
<joey> It's like the most not-hype "Get hype, guys" </joey>
<joey> I've ever heard. </joey>
<garnt> - It just had such house party vibes. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like when you stay up too late, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's that one guy that just wouldn't leave. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that was exactly what it felt like, </connor>
<joey> where I'm just like, I need to go to bed. </joey>
<garnt> - Garnt is that one guy who doesn't leave. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you are, you are. </connor>
<joey> At every fucking all-night karaoke, Garnt is the last guy. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I was the last guy in the stream as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, you boys... </garnt>
<joey> I mean, this wasn't the competition obviously, obviously, </joey>
<joey> but I was the only one to stay awake the entire time. </joey>
<joey> - I know, I know, I know. - Right, right, right, right? </joey>
<garnt> - If it was Connor that was in your position, </garnt>
<garnt> he would've been like, "Weak, you're all weak. </garnt>
<garnt> I won that competition." </garnt>
<joey> - Absolutely. - It was me. </joey>
<garnt> I carried. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, 'cause I knew you guys were there, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was like, so I can sleep. </garnt>
<joey> Then I was like, I will. </joey>
<joey> But I think if it was just me alone, I would've had to, </joey>
<joey> I mean, I would have just ducked out. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course, of course. </joey>
<connor> - And just been more miserable. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, the reason I didn't sleep </garnt>
<garnt> was because I knew as soon as I closed my eyes, </garnt>
<garnt> they were not going... </garnt>
<garnt> I could not go to sleep and come back up to stream again. </garnt>
<connor> - I couldn't stop yawning. </connor>
<garnt> - I just looked horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the last 30 minutes when I came back, </garnt>
<joey> I looked half dead. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh god. </joey>
<connor> - I think I used all my energy holding in the laughs. </connor>
<connor> I used an exceptional </connor>
<connor> amount of energy. - I used so much energy </connor>
<connor> not saying anything during the try-not-to-laugh segment. </connor>
<garnt> That took a lot more energy than I thought it did. </garnt>
<garnt> It actually took more energy than doing the quiz, </garnt>
<garnt> talking, or just hanging out. </garnt>
<joey> - Also not to mention that I think we greatly overestimated </joey>
<garnt> how much energy we were going to have, </garnt>
<joey> because we had a schedule, </joey>
<joey> a preemptive schedule that staff made. </joey>
<joey> And we probably did maybe 40% </joey>
<joey> of what was originally scheduled. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean- - 50. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was a few things, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause obviously Chris was scheduled for two hours. </joey>
<joey> Stayed for six hours. </joey>
<joey> Which I'm not complaining, I'm not complaining. </joey>
<joey> He was obviously having fun. </joey>
<garnt> But then we also had a bunch of things </garnt>
<garnt> that we were meant to be doing with Ironmouse. </garnt>
<connor> But by the time Chris left and Mouse came on, </connor>
<connor> it was just, we were so out of energy </connor>
<connor> that we were just like, </connor>
<garnt> we can only manage talking right now. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<garnt> - How did you guys manage to recover afterwards? </garnt>
<garnt> Did you recover easily? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, recover is a strong word. </joey>
<joey> I went home, and weirdly enough, </joey>
<joey> I think because I was kinda reliving the moment </joey>
<joey> when I was on the train ride home. </joey>
<garnt> So by the time I got home, I was wide awake for some reason. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was doing a little bit of work </garnt>
<joey> and then my body was just like, I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> I literally passed out on my desk. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my god. - For like an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, (sniffling). </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I need to go to bed. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<garnt> And then I slept for like 14 hours, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I just completely fucked </garnt>
<joey> my sleep schedule for the next day. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> My body's so weird after an all-nighter. </garnt>
<garnt> I hate it, I absolutely fucking hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause, during the stream, I'm like, I'm going to pass out. </garnt>
<garnt> It's well documented how close we were to passing out. </garnt>
<joey> And so I remember, the stream finishes. </joey>
<joey> I do not even remember saying goodbye </joey>
<joey> to anyone in the office, even though I know </joey>
<joey> we were all just like, "Hey, congratulations!" </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "See you on Tuesday. </joey>
<joey> See you in like two days or whatever." </joey>
<garnt> I think I said, "See you on Tuesday," </garnt>
<garnt> but I think I just left as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it seemed like I was rude or something, </garnt>
<garnt> I need to go to my bed. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're so rude, Garnt. You're so rude. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember like- - Such a diva. </joey>
<joey> - I remember going to my bed, being like, finally, </joey>
<joey> I've stayed up all night for this. </joey>
<joey> Didn't nap, didn't sleep. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to finally go to sleep. </joey>
<joey> Get on my bed, and my body's just like, </joey>
<joey> nope, you don't sleep now. </joey>
<joey> You stay awake. </joey>
<joey> You don't need sleep. </joey>
<joey> It is sunshine now. </joey>
<joey> - So how long did you stay awake till? </joey>
<connor> - I stay up for an extra... </connor>
<connor> It took me three hours to get to a point where I could sleep </connor>
<connor> and then I slept for- - So what? </connor>
<connor> It was like 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that was around when I passed out. </connor>
<connor> - And I slept for two hours. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<garnt> - So I was just, my day was just fucked, I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - When did you go to bed bed then? </connor>
<joey> - Like 2:00 in the morning. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. - Oh my god. </joey>
<garnt> - But then I did sleep for like 16 hours, so that's- </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, so you woke up at like 4:00 PM the next day? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my god, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - That's why I woke up to Connor streaming "Jump King," </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, fuck's sake. </garnt>
<garnt> How are these boys awake and streaming right now? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fighting for my life. </garnt>
<connor> - On Sunday, I went home and then I had three hours sleep. </connor>
<joey> And then I went out for some drinks and a meal. </joey>
<joey> - How the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - I was fine. </joey>
<joey> - How? </joey>
<garnt> - How? - How? </garnt>
<joey> - I got tired at around 10:00 PM. </joey>
<joey> So I went home and then I slept, </joey>
<connor> woke up early, and played "Jump King." </connor>
<garnt> But I finished it. </garnt>
<garnt> - You finished it, yeah, congrats. </garnt>
<connor> You've both finished it now. - So did I. </connor>
<garnt> - I finally finished "Babe of the Ascension," </garnt>
<garnt> which is the worst thing ever. </garnt>
<connor> I don't ever wanna do it ever again. </connor>
<joey> - Finally finished the base game, that was fun for- </joey>
<connor> - When you gonna do the DLC, Joey? </connor>
<connor> - You know what sucks? </connor>
<connor> At the end of that stream, I was like, </connor>
<garnt> you can't pay me to play the DLC. </garnt>
<garnt> I want my happiness back in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> But then the moment I turned off the stream, </garnt>
<joey> I was like, fuck, I wanna keep playing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because you're like, but there's more. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because it was the fact </joey>
<garnt> that there was so much encouragement online </garnt>
<garnt> when I posted my time and people were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Dude, you're actually cracked." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I am. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I am. </garnt>
<garnt> - Give me a little more praise. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, come on. - Give me more praise. </garnt>
<garnt> - The game has a way of humbling you, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I thought the same thing when I did the third DLC, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I'm cracked, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be able to do this new one easily. </garnt>
<garnt> I was actually worried. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, what if I beat this DLC too fast? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Too fast. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like not a good stream arc. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then the first eight hours of playing it, </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh no, oh no, this is hard. </joey>
<joey> This is really hard. </joey>
<joey> And it too me 48 hours- </joey>
<joey> - Damn. - To beat the DLC. </joey>
<connor> - 48 hours. - The fan-made DLC. </connor>
<connor> - But now I know what it feels like to be an alpha gamer. </connor>
<connor> And now I can finally say, </connor>
<connor> hey, Garnt, when are you finishing "Jump King," bro? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, when are you gonna do "Jump King?" </garnt>
<joey> - I'll do it, guys. </joey>
<joey> I fucking feel like fucking that scene </joey>
<joey> in fucking "My Hero Academia", </joey>
<joey> where like All Might is just pointing at you saying, </joey>
<joey> "It's your turn now." </joey>
<joey> - It's your turn. - Fuck's sake, All Might. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta do it, you gotta do it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just here watching on TV. </joey>
<joey> I'm not even involved and here you are pointing at me, </joey>
<joey> being like, "It's your turn." </joey>
<joey> - You've done half of it, so you have to do the other half. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it half of it? Is it half of it? </garnt>
<joey> - No, Garnt got to maybe 40%. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I got 40%. - Where did you get to? </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't remember. </garnt>
<joey> - He got to the fucking- </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] The poles? </joey>
<joey> - No, not even there. </joey>
<joey> Before that, the town in the sky. </joey>
<joey> - Bargainburg. </joey>
<joey> - Bargainburg, that's it, he got to Bargainburg. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I will finish it, </garnt>
<garnt> just because I knew it's one thing, when I started it, </garnt>
<joey> and I was just like it's... </joey>
<joey> I have the same inkling feeling in me </joey>
<connor> where it doesn't feel comfortable until I finish it. </connor>
<connor> - Taking your time, aren't you, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's been a few weeks since your last one. </connor>
<connor> You're gonna get rusty. </connor>
<connor> You'll start from zero again. </connor>
<connor> - I'll be fine, I'll be fine. </connor>
<garnt> It'll be like pure muscle memory. </garnt>
<garnt> - It'd be like you never left. </garnt>
<joey> - It's gonna be like dementia the game with Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> Every time he goes back to it, </garnt>
<garnt> he's like, oh, I gotta learn this section again. </garnt>
<connor> - It'll be like 30... </connor>
<garnt> My playthrough will be like 50 hours or something </garnt>
<joey> spread between an entire year. - Look, if anything, </joey>
<garnt> you now have someone else to compare yourself to. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's Meilyne, because she also started it as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god. </garnt>
<garnt> - That stream last night was hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw Mudan started it as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Mudan started it. </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ, it's like a virus. </garnt>
<joey> - But don't worry, if you thought... </joey>
<joey> Look, Meilyne just got to the bottom of the sewers, </joey>
<joey> and it took her a couple of hours to get there. </joey>
<connor> - I just think it's one of the best games to stream. </connor>
<garnt> It's so intuitive. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no explanation needed. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, some games there's like power-ups, level ups. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's like, oh, you can unlock this thing, </garnt>
<joey> and then everyone's like, oh, what's going on? </joey>
<joey> But "Jump King" is literally just- </joey>
<joey> - One mechanic. - You can see. </joey>
<garnt> - You jump, one button. </garnt>
<garnt> - You understand immediately from watching </garnt>
<connor> that they're trying to go up, and when they fall, </connor>
<connor> you're like, oh, I get it, this is fun to watch. </connor>
<connor> - It's also just a pretty game. </connor>
<garnt> - It's good, right? - It's a really pretty game. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I love the aesthetic. </joey>
<joey> I will say, I thought you were bullshitting when you said, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's a fun game, it's a fun game." </joey>
<joey> But no, it is. </joey>
<garnt> I do actually genuinely think it's a fun game. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a high that you get when you reach </garnt>
<garnt> your new personal best. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, damn. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey panting) </joey>
<joey> This is a good feeling. </joey>
<joey> And then that lasts for like three seconds </joey>
<joey> before you fall for the first time. </joey>
<connor> You're like, aw. </connor>
<garnt> - I know we've spoke on "Jump King" so much </garnt>
<connor> on this podcast now, 'cause it's like taken over my life, </connor>
<joey> but on the first map, there's a very solid checkpoint. </joey>
<joey> When you get to that, you feel like, I can do this. </joey>
<joey> - The 70% one, right? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, when you get to the- </joey>
<joey> - The church? </joey>
<joey> - The church. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then you're like, oh my god, I can do this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's when it feels good. </joey>
<joey> - That's when I was like, all right, I got this. </joey>
<joey> You got this, king. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, you can do it then. </joey>
<joey> If you can get there, you can do it easily. </joey>
<joey> - So DLC for me is a hard maybe. </joey>
<garnt> - No, you should do it. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I want to maybe put in a couple of other games </joey>
<garnt> that I've been wanting to play. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hard maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> What does that even mean? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a hard maybe. </connor>
<garnt> - What were you, being like- </garnt>
<connor> - Joey won't ever commit to anything. </connor>
<joey> So maybe is about the best you'll get from Joey. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's better than "Arcania," </joey>
<joey> where he just will flat out say no. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] A hard maybe. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - A hard maybe is like a- </joey>
<garnt> - I am committed to my neutrality here. </garnt>
<joey> It could be yes, it could be no. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you want to marry the bride? </garnt>
<connor> Do you wanna marry the bride? - I am firmly planted. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe. </joey>
<joey> - That's a hard maybe, dog. </joey>
<joey> - That's a hard maybe. </joey>
<joey> - My ass is firmly planted on the fence. </joey>
<connor> - Was your viewership higher than normal </connor>
<joey> when you were doing "Jump King?" </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. </connor>
<garnt> But you know, it's like, what do I prioritize, </garnt>
<garnt> clout or happiness? </garnt>
<garnt> It's a hard choice for every YouTuber. </garnt>
<connor> - You can have both. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just waiting for when the Kirby game comes out, dude. </joey>
<connor> That's when real happiness comes out. </connor>
<connor> - I play games now, when I play "Pokemon: Arceus," </connor>
<joey> there's just not enough challenge. </joey>
<joey> Even though there was, there literally was. </joey>
<joey> - There definitely was. </joey>
<joey> - But the thing was is that I never once thought, </joey>
<connor> for a moment, I wasn't gonna be able to do it. </connor>
<joey> Whereas "Jump King" has that thing where it's like, </joey>
<connor> I don't know if you can do it, man. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, but you did that last fight, right? </joey>
<connor> - The Volo, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you struggled a lot with that. </connor>
<connor> - I did, but, at no point, did I ever feel like, </connor>
<connor> this is too hard. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because to me, that was easily </joey>
<joey> the hardest in-game Pokemon fight ever. </joey>
<connor> - It is, it is, it is, but even then, </connor>
<garnt> there's no point, when I'm doing it, </garnt>
<joey> where I'm like, I don't know if I can do this, man. </joey>
<connor> I just felt like I just gotta grind a little bit more. </connor>
<joey> - I've gotta admit, Arceus was hard as fuck. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, yeah, that one. </connor>
<joey> - I wanna see you do that. </joey>
<connor> - Whereas New Babe+, when I was playing that game </connor>
<garnt> of "Jump King," it's the second map, </garnt>
<garnt> I did it over three streams. </garnt>
<garnt> One stream, second stream, third stream. </garnt>
<garnt> The second stream after it and I went to bed, I had anxiety. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, what if I just can't do it? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Just can't do it. </garnt>
<joey> - What if I can't do it? </joey>
<joey> I'm never gonna be able to forget this if I can't do it. </joey>
<joey> And then I woke up the next day and just bossed it, </joey>
<connor> just destroyed it in one hour. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Damn. </garnt>
<connor> - I think you have an addiction. </connor>
<connor> - I do, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] There's definitely an addiction, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I kind of got out of multiplayer games. </joey>
<garnt> That was kinda where I got the kick from, </garnt>
<garnt> beating other people. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a hard ceiling in multiplayer games, </garnt>
<garnt> where you're like, </garnt>
<joey> if I wanna be able to to improve at this game, </joey>
<connor> I have to put an absurd amount of hours in consistently. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, but is 45 hours in one "Jump King" map </joey>
<connor> not an absurd amount of time? </connor>
<connor> - Here's the thing, right? </connor>
<joey> - What is a lot of time? </joey>
<joey> - You could finish 13 Sentinels in that time. </joey>
<joey> - Think about it. </joey>
<garnt> An FPS first-person shooter multiplayer game, whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> 45 hours is nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. - That's absolutely nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. </garnt>
<connor> - You're competing against people who do 45 hours a week. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - How many hours have you put into all </connor>
<garnt> of "Jump King" right now? </garnt>
<connor> - 100-something. </connor>
<garnt> - That's quite a lot. </garnt>
<connor> That's a "Persona" playthrough. </connor>
<garnt> - That's a "Persona" playthrough. </garnt>
<garnt> - In "Apex," I have over 1,000 probably. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's true. - That's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - And even then, I got to master once, </garnt>
<connor> and that was me going insane grinding it. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, why don't you get </garnt>
<garnt> in some more challenging games then? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you said you don't really play </garnt>
<connor> the "Souls" types games or that kinda genre. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna do "Elden Ring." </connor>
<connor> - I feel like it's a different type of challenge, </connor>
<joey> because, with "Jump King," it's just one mechanic </joey>
<joey> that you have to hone- - Master. </joey>
<garnt> - And master, whereas, </garnt>
<garnt> with something like "Elden Ring" or "Sifu," </garnt>
<garnt> it's a lot of things going on at once. </garnt>
<connor> There's a lot of different approaches, </connor>
<connor> a lot of ways to master the game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I just like "Jump King," 'cause there's no bullshit. </connor>
<joey> If you fucked up, absolutely nothing, </joey>
<joey> there's no other single factor. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because with games like "Dark Souls" or "Sifu"- </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] There's some bullshit that can happen. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you can blame it on the enemy. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? That one frame hit me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I know I'll make up excuses. </connor>
<connor> - But in "Jump King," there's no enemies to get in your way. </connor>
<garnt> It's just you. You're in the way of yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - You are your own enemy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Almost like fucking- </garnt>
<joey> - Don't trust anyone, not even yourself. </joey>
<connor> That is "Jump King." </connor>
<connor> - Each DLC gets more brutal though. </connor>
<connor> The first "Jump King," you can only fall two screens max. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I'm dreading, man. </joey>
<connor> - And I fell 20 in the latest one. </connor>
<connor> - What if I actually start raging? </connor>
<joey> - I do. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want that though. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna get angry. </joey>
<connor> - Not like an actual angry though, </connor>
<connor> like an angry video-game angry. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's a different kinda anger. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how to explain it. </connor>
<connor> It's an anger where you're like, </connor>
<connor> you shout, but it doesn't actually get you upset. </connor>
<connor> You're just kinda like, (screams). </connor>
<joey> All right, back to it. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It's just like a slight frustration, slight annoyance. </connor>
<connor> - Like stubbing your toe. </connor>
<joey> - Well, no, there's different kinds of video game... </joey>
<joey> I don't know what that analogy was. </joey>
<garnt> I'm not angry when I stub my toe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not like a 13-year-old on Xbox Live angry </garnt>
<garnt> where I just test out all the new bad words I've learned, </garnt>
<garnt> not that kinda anger. </garnt>
<garnt> Just from out of frustration, </garnt>
<garnt> like when the website, when you fill out the whole form, </garnt>
<connor> and then it reloads for some reason. </connor>
<connor> You're like, (screams). </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? That's the anger you feel? </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, when you enter a... </connor>
<connor> Have you not had that? </connor>
<connor> I get so angry when that happens. </connor>
<connor> You've filled out a whole signup form, </connor>
<joey> put the credit card info in, the address in, </joey>
<joey> all in the right space. </joey>
<joey> You're about to go to the checkout. </joey>
<joey> For some reason- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It times out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it times out, or it reloads. </joey>
<joey> Fucking Guts' theme goes through my head. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, is it even worth signing up again? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if this is worth it anymore. </garnt>
<connor> I don't even want the trampoline. </connor>
<garnt> - The worst part is when you fill out everything correctly </garnt>
<connor> except for that one field, </connor>
<connor> but the website's designed in a way </connor>
<connor> that when you press send, it goes, </connor>
<connor> this one field is incorrect. </connor>
<connor> - We've reset the whole thing. </connor>
<garnt> - But they've reset the entire fucking thing- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, dude. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the level of anger. - Except for that one field. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I hate that. - Imagine that happens, </garnt>
<connor> but it happens to every website you sign up for. </connor>
<garnt> - There's so many Japanese websites like that as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Every Japanese website, dude. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if Japanese people are aware of UX designers, </joey>
<joey> but they certainly need some more. </joey>
<garnt> - The amount of times I've been fucking cucked </garnt>
<garnt> by not using half-width Katakana. </garnt>
<garnt> My fucking god, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the biggest joke in Japan. </connor>
<connor> It's something you'll never experience </connor>
<joey> unless you either try to buy stuff in on a Japanese website, </joey>
<garnt> but, for some reason, they have full-width </garnt>
<connor> and half-width Katakana and Hiragana. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you explain that by the way? </garnt>
<garnt> What is the point of full width and half width? </garnt>
<joey> - I'll tell you exactly the difference. </joey>
<joey> There is none. </joey>
<joey> That's what's so frustrating about it. </joey>
<connor> - Someone explained it to me one time. </connor>
<connor> It had something to do with how they coded way back, </connor>
<joey> the initial internet. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Here in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And it was a layover of that essentially </joey>
<joey> that they just kept using. - Probably. </joey>
<connor> - And they never decided to sort out. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I've told the story </joey>
<connor> of how I interned for an IT company here, </connor>
<connor> and I got to fix a bunch of clients' websites. </connor>
<connor> And I had to go through the HTML, </connor>
<garnt> and I almost had a stroke looking at some of these codes, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's like, oh my god, </garnt>
<garnt> you said you built this website last year. </garnt>
<garnt> You're using code literally from the '90s. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> Of course this page takes 20 seconds to load </garnt>
<connor> even though it's just text based, </connor>
<connor> because there's so much bullshit code here. </connor>
<connor> - It's so weird- - It's the worst. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's almost like convenient stuff </connor>
<garnt> and crazy stuff you can do </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't do in other countries. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they're like, how about websites? </garnt>
<connor> We just keep them shit. </connor>
<connor> We just keep them shit. </connor>
<joey> - Weirdly enough, the best designed websites </joey>
<joey> are the fucking anime trailer websites. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, the ones that are like, </joey>
<joey> they use fucking pretty Java and CSS. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh, that looks fancy as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, when that website </garnt>
<joey> of when the last "Bakemonogatari" volume was coming out. </joey>
<joey> And it was just scrolling down </joey>
<joey> for the entire history of the series, </joey>
<garnt> I was like, damn, this is beautiful-looking website. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my god, an actual coder, </joey>
<joey> an actual programmer made this, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Why can you not add this to your UI design </joey>
<joey> when I'm trying to fucking buy something? </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. - Or sign up to a site? </garnt>
<joey> - Rakuten is just a hellhole of a website, </joey>
<connor> because you don't know, you go to... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause on Amazon, for example- </connor>
<connor> - You see why Amazon's so good. </connor>
<connor> They don't do this shit. </connor>
<connor> - Because on Amazon, it's like, okay, </connor>
<connor> there's the fucking picture of the thing you wanna buy. </connor>
<connor> There's how many is left, when it's gonna arrive. </connor>
<connor> Here's all the information. </connor>
<connor> Everything is perfectly laid out with every single item. </connor>
<connor> Meanwhile, with Rakuten, it's just a fucking free for all. </connor>
<garnt> It's like, would you like 17 banners that have nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> with the product you're actually buying? </garnt>
<garnt> By the way, where is the purchase button? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, it's buried deep beneath this fucking wall of text. </garnt>
<garnt> And every time I go onto Rakuten, it's so handy, </garnt>
<garnt> because you get so much stuff on Rakuten </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't get on Amazon, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just a struggle to try and buy anything, </garnt>
<joey> because it doesn't even tell you when it arrives. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, no, that's not the final boss. </garnt>
<garnt> The final boss is Yahoo! Auctions. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, Yahoo! Auctions. (Joey groans) </joey>
<joey> - Where you can't even sign up </joey>
<joey> with an account that you want. </joey>
<garnt> You need a special Yahoo! account. </garnt>
<garnt> So you need to just sign up to Yahoo! </garnt>
<garnt> It's not your normal Yahoo! </garnt>
<garnt> It's Japanese Yahoo! as well. </garnt>
<connor> - So I have a Yahoo! email account, </connor>
<garnt> some Duncan or something. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, they chose the name for me. </joey>
<connor> It's really weird. </connor>
<connor> - Of course it's a Yahoo! Japan account, </connor>
<joey> because no one outside of Japan uses fucking Yahoo! anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly, right, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> So you just need to just sign up </garnt>
<garnt> with a special Yahoo! account </garnt>
<garnt> to sign up to this Yahoo! Auctions account </garnt>
<garnt> to then just not even, </garnt>
<joey> I don't even know what the etiquette is </joey>
<garnt> in terms of bidding stuff and how to buy stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, I dead ass never even used Yahoo! Auctions </joey>
<joey> just because I refuse to make a Yahoo! Japan account. </joey>
<connor> - I have a bad rating on it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I forgot one time to say I got the thing. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I got that on Mercari as well. </joey>
<joey> - I got a really angry message from a dude who was like, </joey>
<joey> "Why haven't you told me that you got it? </joey>
<joey> This has been an awful experience for me." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I just figured if I didn't say anything, </joey>
<garnt> that means I got it. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, you'd think so. </joey>
<joey> - But how'd you pay? </joey>
<garnt> Can you pay with credit card or something? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so it's really confusing. </connor>
<connor> When you auto-translate it in Google, there's online pay </connor>
<joey> and something else that sounds like online pay. </joey>
<joey> And I remember that I was confused, </joey>
<joey> and I clicked one of them. </joey>
<joey> And then I had to do this whole weird kind of thing </joey>
<joey> with my bank where I had to then contact my bank </joey>
<joey> to do the online payment. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - Where there was just another field </joey>
<connor> that just let you put your credit card information in. </connor>
<connor> It isn't clear, 'cause it didn't say credit card. </connor>
<connor> It said something else. </connor>
<connor> Really annoying, really, really annoying. </connor>
<connor> I hate using it. </connor>
<connor> I just don't bother. </connor>
<connor> That's why I mean, as well, </connor>
<connor> a lot of the websites that offer English, they're like, </connor>
<garnt> okay, you click English, send you to a brand new website </garnt>
<garnt> that doesn't have half the shit of the Japanese one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whereas Amazon, it's like, you change to English, </garnt>
<connor> nothing changes except the language. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's great. </connor>
<garnt> - It's exactly like when you go to a Chinese restaurant </garnt>
<joey> with your one Chinese mate, </joey>
<joey> and they're like, bring on the special food. </joey>
<connor> - Bring on the real menu. - Real menu. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why it's Chinese restaurants in particular, </connor>
<connor> but it seems like every Chinese restaurant has </connor>
<garnt> the special menu that you can only get </garnt>
<garnt> by asking in Cantonese or Mandarin or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - And I bet they're not even saying bring out the real menu. </joey>
<joey> It's probably just like a codeword, you know? </joey>
<joey> It's like, mandarin is an orange. </joey>
<joey> And they're like, he said the word. </joey>
<joey> All right, bring it out. </joey>
<joey> - It just plays with my mind, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I go to a Thai restaurant, </joey>
<joey> and I can ask them in Thai whether they have a Thai dish </joey>
<joey> that they only do in Thailand </joey>
<joey> or only most Thai people would know. </joey>
<joey> Why is it that Chinese restaurants just have </joey>
<joey> an unspoken understanding </joey>
<garnt> that there's gonna be so many people asking </garnt>
<garnt> for a special menu that they're gonna make a special menu </garnt>
<joey> in every single Chinese restaurant? </joey>
<joey> - Why are they literally gatekeeping? </joey>
<joey> It's like they're literally gatekeeping, </joey>
<joey> being like, if you're not Chinese, </joey>
<joey> you can't get the real shit, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - It makes me feel sad though, 'cause I love Chinese food. </garnt>
<garnt> I never wanna go to a Chinese restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> without a Chinese friend. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know, right? - Yeah, I know, it sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it feels like you just unlocked the starter, </garnt>
<garnt> the starter kit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And you need to learn Mandarin to get the actual good gear. </garnt>
<connor> Do you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I love Chinese food, </garnt>
<garnt> but the best Chinese food I've had </garnt>
<garnt> has not come from the normal menu. </garnt>
<garnt> If I go to a Chinese restaurant, </garnt>
<garnt> and I see fucking orange chicken, </garnt>
<garnt> sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, all this stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, no, no, give me the real shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Please give me the real shit. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how to access it. </garnt>
<joey> - Where is your Chinese friend, huh? </joey>
<joey> - I do not know how to access it. </joey>
<joey> - I don't see him. </joey>
<joey> - Just speak Chinese for it. </joey>
<joey> Just speak Mandarin. - Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - It's easy, it's easy. - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Could you imagine if McDonald's did that? </garnt>
<joey> It's like, oh, where is your American friend? </joey>
<connor> - Wait, I know Shake Shack does though. </connor>
<connor> - Do they? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they have secret items. </connor>
<connor> - Really? - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't know that. </joey>
<joey> - You didn't know this? </joey>
<joey> No, it's not Shake Shack, sorry. </joey>
<joey> In-N-Out. </joey>
<joey> - In-N-Out. - Oh, In-N-Out. </joey>
<connor> Oh, I don't go to In-N-Out, so that's fine. </connor>
<garnt> - What possible special menu could they provide? </garnt>
<connor> - You can get the... </connor>
<connor> Well, I don't know, it's animal style fries. </connor>
<connor> That's a secret menu item. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah, I know that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then there's a- </connor>
<joey> - Is that a secret menu though? </joey>
<joey> I feel that's so well known now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but if you're a tourist from Asia </connor>
<joey> who doesn't speak English- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - And you're like, what's that guy got? </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck? How do I get that? </garnt>
<garnt> No one told- - I'll never tell. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I know you can get a flavor </garnt>
<joey> where they mix all the milkshake flavors into one, </joey>
<joey> which sounds interesting. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds interesting, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if you want that. </joey>
<joey> I think there's something else. </joey>
<garnt> There's another secret burger or something as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I know there are secret items at fast food chains. </garnt>
<garnt> - There are secret items. </garnt>
<garnt> - Items on the menu. - Where would there be secret- </garnt>
<garnt> - Not like an entire- </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know that- </garnt>
<garnt> - Because they're a pain in the ass to make, </garnt>
<garnt> but if someone asks for it- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it a marketing thing, you reckon? </garnt>
<garnt> - Also that as well, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It makes you seem like you're- </garnt>
<garnt> - In the club. - In a club. </garnt>
<connor> - Part of the secret society. </connor>
<garnt> I got the real stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> Give me the real stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - Have you ever been to those places </connor>
<connor> that are secret bars or clubs or anything? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, like the invite-only ones? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You ever been to those? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, one of my friends took me to one where it literally, </connor>
<connor> it's in Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> I'm obviously not gonna say where, but it literally- </connor>
<garnt> - I'll never tell. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll never tell. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll never tell. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've been there. </garnt>
<garnt> - It literally looks like a concrete wall. </garnt>
<connor> I was with my friend, and he's like, "Okay, we're here." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "What do you mean?" </connor>
<connor> - Where is this? </connor>
<connor> - It's in Roppongi somewhere, I think? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause we went to one in Shibuya, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that speakeasy. </garnt>
<garnt> - It said closed, and it was closed due to corona. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Someone knocked on the door, and they came out. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, no. </connor>
<connor> - It wasn't even it looked closed. </connor>
<joey> It was just scaffolding, </joey>
<joey> and a wooden door. - Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - Like the place was being built and boarded off. </joey>
<joey> And you just knock on the door. </joey>
<garnt> And like an actual speakeasy, </garnt>
<garnt> the fucking thing opens up. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, my one had that as well, so he knocked. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Oh, I have to knock a specific way as well." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Bullshit you do." </joey>
<joey> And he did a secret pattern. </joey>
<garnt> And then the thing came up. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "Password." (speaking in foreign language) </garnt>
<garnt> And then he said the password. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "Friend?" </garnt>
<garnt> He pointed at me, and he's like, "Yeah, yeah, friend." </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> And then he opens it up. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just this tiny maybe three-person bar. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was all right, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was all right. </garnt>
<joey> - It was cool that I was in there. </joey>
<joey> - The coolest part was just going </joey>
<garnt> to what looked like a secret bar. </garnt>
<joey> - The coolest part was just the dude opening </joey>
<joey> it up like this. </joey>
<connor> I've only ever seen that in movies. </connor>
<connor> - I went to one where, it was in London. </connor>
<garnt> I went to it, and it was a breakfast restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> or something on the top. </garnt>
<garnt> We went in there. </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't know the password, </garnt>
<garnt> and neither did my friend. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We don't know what the password is." </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "It's a Daft Punk song lyric." </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<connor> And he was feeding it- - He was giving clues! </connor>
<connor> - He was feeding it to me, and I was like... </connor>
<connor> It was something like, </connor>
<connor> I'm up all night to get lucky or something. </connor>
<joey> - Right. - Oh, okay. </joey>
<connor> - So he said it, then he was like- </connor>
<connor> - It's not even an obscure Daft Punk song. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, no, no. </connor>
<joey> - You just go through their entire discography. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, which album? </joey>
<joey> - Which album are we talking about? </joey>
<joey> Okay, okay, can't be too many lyrics. </joey>
<joey> If it's Daft Punk lyrics, that narrows it down. </joey>
<connor> - Is it "Around the World?" </connor>
<garnt> - So then we're here, </garnt>
<garnt> and then some guy comes and greets us, </garnt>
<joey> and we start walking through this restaurant that's closed. </joey>
<joey> And then, like in a movie, we go in the kitchen. </joey>
<joey> And there's people working into the kitchen. </joey>
<joey> We're just walking through </joey>
<joey> their working in the kitchen. - Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - And we go down into a basement in the kitchen. </joey>
<joey> And there's boxes of fries and shit all around us, </joey>
<joey> and we're going in. </joey>
<joey> Like in a fucking spy movie, it's got the fucking beads. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, shit! - For the door. </joey>
<garnt> And it opens it up. </garnt>
<joey> There's this room, I mean, it's fine. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Like a dimly lit room? </joey>
<garnt> - It's okay, but there's no real chairs or anything. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kinda like a very small room that's very dimly lit. </garnt>
<connor> It wasn't that good, and the drinks were okay. </connor>
<joey> The coolest part was walking to this thing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And then I was like, </joey>
<connor> now I wanna leave. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've always wanted to know. </connor>
<joey> Why would you opt to make a business like that? </joey>
<joey> - Novelty. </joey>
<joey> - I feel clearly if you're going to opt to be like, </joey>
<joey> okay, I'm gonna make this so exclusive </joey>
<joey> that it's near impossible for a regular person to find. </joey>
<joey> Then it's like you're clearly not doing it </joey>
<garnt> as a sustainable business. </garnt>
<garnt> You're clearly just doing it </garnt>
<joey> as a fucking hobby or something. </joey>
<connor> - The assumption is you'll be able to survive </connor>
<connor> on word of mouth, I guess. </connor>
<connor> That's the hope. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of people are like, "It's so cool, you gotta go." </connor>
<garnt> And then the drinks are very mediocre. </garnt>
<joey> But the experience feels worth it, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause you feel exclusive. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but it's just bragging rights, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you pay for the experience </connor>
<garnt> and not so much the bar or the business </garnt>
<garnt> or the drinks itself. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like bars that are membership only. </garnt>
<garnt> And you can only get membership </garnt>
<garnt> by having someone recommend you. </garnt>
<garnt> That always seemed really silly to me. </garnt>
<connor> But there's so many of them in Tokyo. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like half of the Golden Guy membership. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, half of Nichome, as well, is like that as well, </joey>
<joey> where it's like, if you don't someone </joey>
<joey> who either works there or goes there frequently enough, </joey>
<joey> they just won't let you in. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> I get it with the bars in Golden Guy, </garnt>
<garnt> because the bars are so small </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm sure that their regular customers </garnt>
<garnt> can keep their business up and running anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<joey> - You just need one or two patrons. </joey>
<joey> So you get yourself going, and then you're basically set. </joey>
<joey> - That's true. - That's true. </joey>
<joey> - You're basically set. </joey>
<joey> - It'd be really cool to own </joey>
<joey> a tiny little bar in Golden Guy. </joey>
<joey> I've always thought about that. </joey>
<joey> - How hard is it to get a bar there? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I've always wondered. </joey>
<joey> All those bars, even though they're so tiny, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure they're paying out the ass to have that space. </joey>
<connor> - We should put a Trash Taste bar there. </connor>
<joey> - A Trash Taste bar in Golden Guy? </joey>
<garnt> - A Trash Taste special, build a bar. </garnt>
<garnt> - Build a bar in Golden Guy. </garnt>
<garnt> All three of us build our own bars in Golden Guy, </garnt>
<joey> see who makes the most money at the end of the night. </joey>
<connor> - I don't even wanna do it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even wanna think- </joey>
<connor> - A logistical nightmare. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even wanna think about how much it must cost </joey>
<joey> to rent out a space there. </joey>
<garnt> - I'd get really claustrophobic working one of those bars. </garnt>
<connor> - No, it's cozy. </connor>
<garnt> - You think it's cozy? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think it's cozy. </garnt>
<joey> - It depends. </joey>
<joey> I've been in some where it's like, </joey>
<joey> I literally can't stand up straight inside of them. </joey>
<joey> - It's literally a shoebox. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is. </joey>
<garnt> - And I don't even know how they get into the bar </garnt>
<garnt> let alone work behind the bar. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, most of them are four feet tall </joey>
<garnt> like (speaking in foreign language), right? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true, that's true. </garnt>
<joey> - They probably don't have any problems. </joey>
<joey> - It's not built for someone of my stature. </joey>
<garnt> If I stand up, my head literally hits the ceilings. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like Gandalf in Frodo's house </joey>
<joey> in a lot of these places, all right? </joey>
<joey> I'm just constantly, can I get a drink please? </joey>
<joey> - It's normally if you're wide that's the problem though, </joey>
<joey> not if you're tall. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<joey> - But that's why going in the wintertime is the worst, </joey>
<joey> because you're all puffed up with jackets and shit. </joey>
<connor> You're just like, all right, out of the way please. </connor>
<joey> Sorry, excuse me. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's best to go at winter though. </joey>
<joey> In the summer, it feels weird. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - I feel, in the summer, it's way too hot. </joey>
<joey> - It's hot, it's really hot. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Even when the AC's going, it's still there. </connor>
<joey> - Either way, it's very much a gamble. </joey>
<joey> I've heard so many horror stories in Golden Guy </joey>
<joey> and Nichome and all that stuff. </joey>
<connor> - Just don't go into a bar </connor>
<joey> if someone tells you to go into a bar. </joey>
<joey> That's the rule of thumb. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If somebody is trying to tell you to go into their bar, </garnt>
<garnt> that's a good sign to not go into that bar. </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably a bad idea. </garnt>
<connor> - Gentlemen, this episode of Trash Taste </connor>

<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've only been to Golden Guy two times. </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't been that many times. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's been a interesting experience every time. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, the last time I went was with you guys at that bar. </joey>
<connor> - I think that was fun. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, which was really, really fun. </connor>
<joey> - That was a good time. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - When was that? </garnt>
<connor> - That's the one that Jan came to. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, that one, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And he immediately went behind the bar </garnt>
<garnt> and starts serving drinks. </garnt>
<joey> - He just took over the bar. </joey>
<connor> - He just took over, yeah! </connor>
<joey> - Was it 'cause the woman who was at the bar </joey>
<connor> got tired or something? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was owned by this, </joey>
<joey> what looked like a, at least, 70, 80-year-old old lady. </joey>
<joey> She was really, really nice, </joey>
<joey> but she was clearly standing at the bar all night. </joey>
<garnt> And the moment Jan came in, she was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, that looks a charismatic enough guy </garnt>
<garnt> to take over my bar for the night. </garnt>
<garnt> She literally ushers Jan over, </garnt>
<garnt> because there were no seats left. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause there was us three and two other Japanese people, </garnt>
<garnt> and that was it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was so small. </garnt>
<garnt> So Jan comes in, he's like, "I got nowhere to sit." </garnt>
<garnt> Old lady just ushers Jan over and is like, "Take over." </garnt>
<garnt> And then she just goes behind the back. </garnt>
<garnt> And we never see her for the rest of the night. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, we can just leave if we wanted to. </garnt>
<joey> Obviously, we paid at the end of it. </joey>
<connor> - It was like 1,000 yen a drink, </connor>
<joey> but it was like you were pouring the drinks. </joey>
<joey> It was like you could just make it as strong as you wanted. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. - It was really strange. </garnt>
<connor> It was a really fun time though. </connor>
<connor> - It became a self-service bar, </connor>
<garnt> and I don't know how Jan has this effect </garnt>
<connor> basically everywhere he goes </connor>
<joey> where he just sweet talks the fucking restaurant, </joey>
<joey> the waiter, or the bar lady to give us the special service </joey>
<joey> or the special menu, </joey>
<joey> the menu that doesn't exist, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's always someone like Jan who is able to to get- </garnt>
<joey> - Jan is the only man that can somehow pull out </joey>
<joey> a secret menu from a restaurant </joey>
<joey> that doesn't even have a secret menu. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, oh, I guess we have a secret menu now, fuck. </joey>
<joey> All right, bring it out for this guy. </joey>
<garnt> - Can you imagine going to a British restaurant or something </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, you gotta get out the secret menu, </garnt>
<joey> and it's just toast sandwich. </joey>
<joey> - Unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> - Toast sandwich, crisp sandwich. </joey>
<connor> - Unfortunately, I think the UK is the one place </connor>
<joey> where sweet talking doesn't do anything. </joey>
<joey> They just tell us no. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - No. </joey>
<connor> I've never seen anyone sweet talk anything in the UK. </connor>
<connor> Maybe in a bar with one guy, </connor>
<joey> but in a restaurant, it'll never work. </joey>
<joey> - Or maybe it's because they just don't have </joey>
<joey> secret menu culture maybe? </joey>
<joey> - No, we don't. </joey>
<garnt> - What would be on the Japanese secret menu? </garnt>
<joey> If you went an abroad- </joey>
<garnt> - Something slimy. </garnt>
<joey> - Natto, natto? </joey>
<connor> - Cognac or something. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, I feel like we don't have </joey>
<joey> secret menus here either, </joey>
<joey> just because we don't even have tipping culture here. </joey>
<joey> Because we're just so like, these are the rules. </joey>
<garnt> We can't make any kind of exceptions. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why would you wanna hide something if you're proud of it? </garnt>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> - What I'm talking about is, </garnt>
<joey> if you go to a Japanese restaurant not in Japan- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I see. </joey>
<joey> - What would be the foods on there </joey>
<joey> that would be something that you, </joey>
<joey> a Japanese person very accustomed </joey>
<garnt> to Japanese cuisine would know, </garnt>
<garnt> but is, I guess, not mainstream enough to be- </garnt>
<joey> - So you're asking what the most </joey>
<joey> underrated Japanese food is? </joey>
<joey> Or unknown Japanese foods. </joey>
<joey> - I would say it'd probably be something slimy </joey>
<joey> like most of the shit that we've ended up feeling </joey>
<joey> in the What's In The Box on the charity stream. </joey>
<joey> - Like mozoku or natto. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, shit like that. </joey>
<joey> - Like okra, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Probably, something like that. </joey>
<joey> Maybe like, I don't know, natto in curry maybe. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like a lot of izakaya foods </garnt>
<garnt> would be on there. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, definitely. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, like the blended squid </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that, or takowasa. </garnt>
<joey> That shit's bomb. </joey>
<joey> That shit's bomb. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, no way, no way. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey, man, you're part of my team now, </joey>
<garnt> because you like natto. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, natto was actually all right. </garnt>
<connor> It was all right. </connor>
<connor> - The taste is fine, but the slime is just dreadful. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah? - Really vile. </connor>
<garnt> - The slime, it's not even the worst texture </garnt>
<garnt> I've had in Japan, I feel like. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks a lot of worse than it tastes </garnt>
<garnt> and feels in your mouth, I think. </garnt>
<joey> I think the beans taste pretty good. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, it just tastes like soy sauce, I think. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, it smells- </joey>
<joey> - That's basically what it is. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, that's what it is. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just soy sauce on soy beans. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, right? - It's just like soy overload. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - I feel though, because you guys ate it </joey>
<joey> straight out of the packet, </joey>
<garnt> you got the full brunt of the sliminess and the texture, </garnt>
<garnt> but when you put that on a bed of rice, </garnt>
<garnt> because you're eating it with rice, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't feel as slimy as it should've. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like, with a bit of rice, it would be perfect. </garnt>
<joey> It would be absolutely perfect. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It's fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I guess, you gotta open- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Just give it a go. </joey>
<joey> - Give it a go, give it a go sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - And if you don't like it, it's totally fine, I understand. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe you like it, maybe you're not. </joey>
<joey> To me, I learned that I just can't handle ketchup. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why, I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> That was a first- </joey>
<joey> - To be fair, that was a lot of ketchup. </joey>
<connor> - That was the first time... </connor>
<connor> - Garnt's referring to the 24-hour livestream. </connor>
<connor> - To explain, we all had forfeits to do. </connor>
<connor> I had to eat pizza crusts drenched </connor>
<connor> in ketchup and mayonnaise, </connor>
<connor> because I hate ketchup and mayonnaise. </connor>
<connor> - And you don't eat the crust. </connor>
<connor> - And I don't eat the crust. </connor>
<connor> And I remember, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna give this the best go that I can possibly can, </connor>
<connor> because it's for charity. </connor>
<connor> And it's the first time where I've put something in my mouth </connor>
<connor> and I had immediate gag reflex. </connor>
<connor> - That's 'cause it's your mind. </connor>
<connor> Your mind is telling you that you don't want it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Mind over matter. </connor>
<connor> - To me, like the natto, I was just like, </connor>
<garnt> maybe I'm gonna gag during the natto. </garnt>
<garnt> And I had it, and I'm just like- </garnt>
<connor> - It's 'cause you expected to gag. </connor>
<connor> I think you expected to throw up, </connor>
<joey> so you were psyching yourself out. </joey>
<connor> So the moment it touched your tongue, you're like- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, to be fair though, that smell was pretty dreadful. </joey>
<garnt> I had to do the ghost pepper. That was dreadful. </garnt>
<garnt> - How was that experience? </garnt>
<garnt> - That hurt. </garnt>
<connor> See, because you guys were saying, oh, </connor>
<connor> and everyone in the chat was saying, </connor>
<connor> oh, look forward to the next morning. </connor>
<connor> You're gonna be shitting through a straw. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh, god- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, the ramen was way worse. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the ramen was way worse that we had. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I was fine. </connor>
<joey> I had maybe one painful shit, </joey>
<joey> and then, I thought that was gonna the beginning of the end. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, just one. - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<connor> - The one that's spicy is the only one you get. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I was fine after that. </joey>
<joey> I look back on the clip of me shivering </joey>
<joey> for 15 minutes afterwards. </joey>
<joey> I literally look like I'm about to fucking die. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was getting slightly worried </garnt>
<joey> when you started shivering, </joey>
<joey> but I know it's because your body is just going into shock. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<garnt> - Your body is rushing you of fucking adrenaline </garnt>
<garnt> and endorphins and all that kinda shit. </garnt>
<joey> I just remember seeing you go like this, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "Joey, are you all right, man?" </joey>
<garnt> - I think the worst part about it is, </garnt>
<joey> when you watch that out of context, </joey>
<joey> you see a dude who looks clearly sleep deprived </joey>
<joey> with huge bags under his eyes shivering. </joey>
<joey> I just looked like a crack addict. </joey>
<joey> I just looked like I was having withdrawals. </joey>
<joey> I was sleepy just going like, (panting). </joey>
<joey> It was not the best look. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think the sleep deprivation helped as well, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I can't imagine trying a food that you really- </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like seven in the morning. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was seven in the morning. </garnt>
<joey> We were up for like 20 hours at that point, and you're like- </joey>
<joey> - It taste good? - Perfect time, </joey>
<joey> perfect time to eat a ghost pepper. </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> To be honest, I couldn't taste anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. - Yeah, there was no flavor. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was it as painful as you thought it would be? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I find that sauces, </connor>
<garnt> like really heavy sauce-based dishes that are spicy, </garnt>
<garnt> are the hardest to eat. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the Hot Ones stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> I can eat all of those Hot Ones sauce, </garnt>
<garnt> like the hottest ones, on wings, no issue. </garnt>
<joey> I don't need milk or anything like that. </joey>
<garnt> It tastes good, like the Last Dab. </garnt>
<garnt> I slather everything in that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's all good, 'cause it's just a few bites, </garnt>
<joey> but it's very solid. </joey>
<joey> But we did the ramen video for yours. </joey>
<joey> And that wasn't that spicy. </joey>
<garnt> I'd say it's not as spicy as a ghost pepper </garnt>
<garnt> or a Carolina Reaper, because it's just sauce. </garnt>
<connor> It coats your mouth, coats your esophagus, </connor>
<connor> and it goes into your stomach. </connor>
<connor> It hurts so much. </connor>
<joey> And then it takes a while, </joey>
<joey> so you just keep eating and eating. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I definitely struggled more, </joey>
<joey> I think, with that than the ghost pepper. </joey>
<connor> - One burst of spice is not that bad. </connor>
<garnt> It's when you keep eating bursts of spice </garnt>
<connor> that the pain just multiplies. - It builds up. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't give yourself a break. </garnt>
<connor> That's why eating one Carolina Reaper, for me, </connor>
<garnt> is totally chill. </garnt>
<garnt> I could do it now, and we could still film the episode, </garnt>
<garnt> and it'd be chill. </garnt>
<garnt> Those competitions where they eat 40, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, that's fucked, that's fucked up. </connor>
<joey> - How has anyone not died from that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, 'cause- </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I don't think- </connor>
<garnt> - Can you die from spice? </garnt>
<connor> - No, you can go into shock though. </connor>
<garnt> - You can go into shock, but I don't... </garnt>
<garnt> Has there been a recorded case of someone dying from spice? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not sure if there is. </garnt>
<garnt> There has been? </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] You can burn a hole through your stomach. </joey>
<connor> - I don't necessarily think that's true though, I think. </connor>
<joey> - You'd have to have a pretty weak stomach though, </joey>
<connor> I feel, for that. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's a factor of things. </connor>
<garnt> - For me, as someone who loves spicy food, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to explain why I eat spicy food or why... </garnt>
<garnt> Jerry's said to me all the time, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I don't know how you can get through that" </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I think, one thing that's really underrated </garnt>
<garnt> about why people eat spicy food </garnt>
<garnt> is that the spicy food needs to taste good, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> When we think of spicy challenges, we just think </garnt>
<garnt> about getting through how spicy this spicy meal is, </garnt>
<garnt> or getting through this fucking pepper or something. </garnt>
<garnt> A big draw of spicy food is that, </garnt>
<garnt> even if you're in fucking pain and your mouth is hurting, </garnt>
<garnt> if it tastes good with the spice, </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna finish it, and you wanna eat it, </garnt>
<garnt> because it tastes good. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, that was it with the ramen video. </joey>
<joey> I would not have finished that </joey>
<joey> if it didn't taste as good as it did, </joey>
<joey> and it tasted really fucking good. </joey>
<joey> If that did not taste good, </joey>
<joey> I would've just been like, no, fuck this. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've had, for example, </garnt>
<garnt> the Coco Ichiban level 10 spice. </garnt>
<garnt> And it is spicy, but it doesn't taste good at all. </garnt>
<joey> It just feels like you're making it spicy to make it spicy. </joey>
<joey> - Just artificial? </joey>
<joey> - It's just artificial. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes it just feels like, </joey>
<joey> this is just a flex at the end of the day, </joey>
<garnt> where we can make it this spicy, but it doesn't even, </garnt>
<garnt> the taste doesn't marry well with the spice at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Proper good spicy dishes need to taste good. </garnt>
<joey> - It needs to complement the actual base food. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> For example, I have Thai food without the spice, </garnt>
<garnt> and it literally does feel like there's a component </garnt>
<garnt> that's missing from the food. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, fuck, so good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, what are you gonna say, Ashley? </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] Capsaicin does cause tissue inflammation, </joey>
<joey> so a large enough dose could cause serious damage </joey>
<joey> to your stomach and intestines. </joey>
<joey> - I feel you'd have to have an egregious amount though </joey>
<joey> to hit that point. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Or something really spicy, </joey>
<joey> you'd have it all in one sitting, </joey>
<joey> you could do enough damage to potentially kill you. </joey>
<garnt> - My ex-girlfriend was Sri Lankan. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when I went to meet her parents and stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> everything had chilies in it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was amazing. I loved it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was breakfast, omelet. </garnt>
<joey> We had five of those peppers that you put in Thai food. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - And I ate 'em all. </joey>
<joey> And then, I don't know if I told this story, </joey>
<joey> but her mom came in and was like, </joey>
<joey> "Why did he eat the peppers?" </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Am I not supposed to eat the peppers?" </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "No, you'll get stomach cancer </connor>
<connor> if you eat the peppers." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Why would you put them in the food then?" </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> They were delicious. </connor>
<connor> It was good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There was also another restaurant, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause she took around to a bunch of the local restaurants. </garnt>
<garnt> And there was one thing were it was deviled mutton, </garnt>
<joey> it was called, or something. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds badass. </joey>
<joey> - It was like the most delicious marinated mutton </joey>
<garnt> I'd ever had in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn. </garnt>
<connor> - But it was like doom level of spice. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, if it's got the word devil in it- </garnt>
<connor> - Devil, yeah. - Devil's blood. </connor>
<connor> - I'm tearing up, but I'm like, </connor>
<connor> fuck, it's so good. (whimpering) </connor>
<connor> Even though I was in so much pain, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, just another bite. </garnt>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing about spicy food. </connor>
<connor> If it's really good spicy food- </connor>
<connor> - You power through, you power through. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck me, just one more bite. </connor>
<connor> When you take the bite, you're in a pain, </connor>
<joey> but you're just like, oh, it just tastes so good! </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how to explain it, </connor>
<connor> but when it's super spicy and super delicious, </connor>
<connor> it's almost like it's searing in the flavor </connor>
<connor> into your tongue. - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm like, this is so much flavor! (screams) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's almost like, if you take the spice out, </connor>
<joey> for example, I've had unspiced Thai curry. </joey>
<joey> I've had unspiced Indian curry as well, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause we live in England. - No, don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on now. </garnt>
<garnt> - The best way I can describe it </garnt>
<joey> is that it just tastes flat. </joey>
<connor> It tastes flat. </connor>
<garnt> There's something that's missing from the taste. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like uncarbonated soda. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kinda. </connor>
<garnt> That's a good analogy actually. </garnt>
<garnt> The flavor's there, but there's a texture </garnt>
<garnt> or something is missing. - The flavor is there, </garnt>
<garnt> but the personality is gone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Indian curry, if you have rice with it too, </connor>
<connor> or you have naan, </connor>
<joey> I feel like that's so nice to have spice with it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause then it kinda helps mellow it out a bit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. - That's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, see, 'cause I never, for the longest time, </connor>
<connor> I didn't understand that concept of spice enhancing food, </connor>
<connor> because up until, I'd say, maybe three or four years ago, </connor>
<connor> I could not handle spice at all. </connor>
<connor> If I went to Coco Ichi, I would do level one, </connor>
<garnt> which is like the most basic shit. </garnt>
<joey> And I'd just be like, "No, too spicy, I can't do it." </joey>
<joey> And then, I don't know what it was that, </joey>
<joey> where just one day, I kinda just flipped a dime. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> It hurts, but I'm enjoying it for some reason. </joey>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<garnt> - I had the opposite journey of Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> someone who's grown up with Thai food and stuff like that. </garnt>
<joey> I remember, when I was a kid, </joey>
<joey> I really did not like Japanese food at all, </joey>
<joey> because a lot of Japanese cuisine revolves </joey>
<joey> around the natural flavor of stuff. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Savory. </garnt>
<garnt> - Savoring it and just bringing out the natural flavors </garnt>
<garnt> of the ingredient. </garnt>
<garnt> And me, a Thai person, being like, </garnt>
<garnt> there is not enough ingredients in this dish. </garnt>
<garnt> What, sushi? </garnt>
<garnt> Sushi, what, that's just- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Two ingredients. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's rice and fish. </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the spice? Where's the flavor? </garnt>
<garnt> - Wasabi. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, three ingredients like rice. </garnt>
<garnt> You have rice with a bit of vinegar in it, fish, and wasabi. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, where's the five million spices </joey>
<joey> to go with it? </joey>
<joey> What? You dip it in soy sauce? </joey>
<joey> Where's the chilies in the soy sauce? </joey>
<joey> - Where's the kick? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, where's the kick? </joey>
<joey> Japanese cuisine was my least favorite cuisine, </joey>
<garnt> because to me, there just weren't enough extra spices </garnt>
<connor> or extra ingredients to enhance the flavors. </connor>
<garnt> - Is this unseasoned sushi? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - And then, as I grew older, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> as I grew older, I learned to really appreciate </garnt>
<garnt> the subtleties in the flavor of Japanese cuisine. </garnt>
<connor> It really enhances the good ingredients. </connor>
<connor> - It's just rice, isn't it? </connor>
<garnt> - It's just rice. - It's all just the same. </garnt>
<garnt> Sushi chef straight up for 20 years </garnt>
<connor> to get the perfect rice. </connor>
<connor> It's all rice, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - It's all the same. </connor>
<connor> - What is this, Uncle Ben's? </connor>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Did you put it through a colander? </connor>
<garnt> - Is this microwaved? </garnt>
<connor> - Did you wash this rice? </connor>
<connor> - Did you wash this rice through a colander? </connor>
<joey> - It's microwave rice, right? </joey>
<joey> Five-minute rice? </joey>
<joey> - Minute Maid rice. </joey>
<joey> - I fucking love the golden rice </joey>
<connor> in those microwave packets though. </connor>
<connor> I fucking love that rice. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, the ready-to-make ones, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, dude. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It tastes so good. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, they do taste good. </joey>
<garnt> - Probably 'cause it has all the artificial shit in it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Fast food rice. </joey>
<connor> How do we make rice unhealthy, super unhealthy? </connor>
<connor> We found a way. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, honestly, the fast food, the packeted fried rice </garnt>
<connor> that you can buy is actually pretty damn- </connor>
<connor> - In Japan, it's pretty good. </connor>
<garnt> - The one that you buy in the freezer? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - I used to live off it. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, oh, well, I made curry, and I don't wanna make, </joey>
<joey> I didn't have a rice cooker at the time. </joey>
<joey> And I hated making rice the way that my mom taught me, </joey>
<joey> which is just boil a pan full of water and guess. </joey>
<connor> Which sometimes works, sometimes didn't. </connor>
<joey> - But doing it in Japan is blasphemous. </joey>
<connor> - I know, I know, I know. </connor>
<garnt> It's weird, 'cause you'd think that the first people </garnt>
<joey> to adapt an easier way to do it would be white people, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they love being lazy. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's true. </joey>
<joey> - You'd think rice cookers would go down, </joey>
<connor> especially for the UK where we love rice. </connor>
<connor> We love eating it with curry, so you'd think that- </connor>
<connor> - Do people in the UK love rice? </connor>
<connor> - With curry. </connor>
<garnt> - That's pretty much it though. </garnt>
<connor> - But that's the only thing we eat half the time. </connor>
<joey> We eat chicken tikka masala, it's like every week. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's true, that's true. </joey>
<connor> - You'd think that we would figure out, </connor>
<connor> hey, these rice cookers aren't so bad. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember growing up in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I'd have my packed lunch of whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> it would be like something- </garnt>
<connor> - No, you'd never make rice for a packed lunch. </connor>
<garnt> It's a dinner thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, it's- - No, sorry, tea, tea. </garnt>
<garnt> No, fuck, it is dinner. - Supper? </garnt>
<garnt> - It is dinner. - Supper. </garnt>
<connor> - Whatever you wanna call it. - Tea is a Northern thing. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Tea to me is the drink, you know? </connor>
<joey> - I could see that, tea. </joey>
<joey> I know, I know. </joey>
<garnt> - As with most of the- </garnt>
<joey> - I know, I know, I know. </joey>
<joey> - As with most of the developed world. </joey>
<garnt> - Tea for me is a twit longer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Awful joke. </garnt>
<joey> - Awful joke, I'm sorry. </joey>
<garnt> - No, but I remember having this conversation </garnt>
<garnt> with my mates, and they were like, </garnt>
<joey> "Wait, you eat rice every day with every meal?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, you have it with every meal." </joey>
<garnt> They couldn't wrap their heads around it, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - You bougie motherfucker. </joey>
<joey> - You eat rice with everything? </joey>
<joey> You don't take a break from rice? It's everything? </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, yeah, it's Asian cuisine. </garnt>
<garnt> You literally eat rice with everything. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure the Asians are asking the same thing, </joey>
<joey> being like, wait, you use bread with everything? </joey>
<garnt> Every meal is with bread? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's bread or potatoes? </garnt>
<joey> Is that it? </joey>
<joey> - Is that it? - Bread and potatoes? </joey>
<connor> - Why not both? </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - Carbs on carbs. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I think it's grown a lot in popularity though </joey>
<garnt> in the last 10 years especially. </garnt>
<garnt> - Rice? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, definitely not when I was growing up at all. </garnt>
<connor> - It's become way more popular, </connor>
<connor> rice-based dishes in general. </connor>
<joey> - I say finally. </joey>
<connor> What took them so long? - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I think there's enough dishes </connor>
<connor> where people are making them where a rice cooker... </connor>
<connor> People buy bread makers. </connor>
<connor> People aren't making bread every fucking week. </connor>
<connor> And those things are fucking massive. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - My little rice cooker is this big. </connor>
<connor> But the point was, before I did this, </connor>
<garnt> I used to just buy the microwave packets. </garnt>
<garnt> They're amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> 300-gram packets, perfect portion, tastes great. </garnt>
<connor> Slap it on the plate, you're good to go. </connor>
<garnt> Amazing, amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - I actually think those, </connor>
<connor> I also survived without a rice cooker </connor>
<joey> in university for a long time, </joey>
<joey> 'cause the microwave packets were good enough. </joey>
<joey> The problem with a rice cooker, </joey>
<joey> I find, is that the rice goes off so fucking quick. </joey>
<joey> So either you cook a tiny bit of rice </joey>
<joey> in this massive rice cooker, </joey>
<joey> because I'm Asian, and of course, </joey>
<joey> if a mom buys you a rice cooker, </joey>
<joey> it's like the biggest fucking rice cooker </joey>
<joey> you can ever imagine. </joey>
<joey> - How many families do you wanna feed? </joey>
<joey> - It's like those restaurants ones where it's this big. </joey>
<joey> - Luckily, there was a humanitarian crisis, </joey>
<connor> but it wasn't for long, </connor>
<connor> 'cause Garnt had his rice cooker that his mom gave him. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause my mom bought me </garnt>
<garnt> a rice cooker for university, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause that's one of the essential pieces of equipment </garnt>
<garnt> that you need for university </garnt>
<garnt> for every Asian kid that their mom provides. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - They provide you a rice cooker </garnt>
<garnt> that could survive a nuclear winter. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure you could hop inside of it </joey>
<joey> and survive a blast, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> But the problem is, I would always cook too much rice </garnt>
<joey> or too little rice, right? </joey>
<joey> It would be either too much for the meal I was cooking, </joey>
<joey> and I would have some leftover rice. </joey>
<joey> Or I would cook too much rice, </joey>
<joey> and the rice just goes off so quickly, </joey>
<joey> even if you put in the fridge or something. </joey>
<garnt> Because unless you're really, </garnt>
<garnt> and this is the Asian trap, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because with the rice cooker, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to eat rice every day </garnt>
<garnt> in order to eat all the rice </garnt>
<garnt> that you cooked with the rice cooker. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise, it's just gonna go off. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that's why actually the microwave packets </garnt>
<garnt> were just the perfect portion for one meal, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just a lot less effort. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because then you have to start experimenting. </joey>
<joey> You look in your fridge and be like, all right, </joey>
<joey> what can the rice go with that I haven't tried yet? </joey>
<connor> - However can you dehydrate the rice that you've cooked, </connor>
<joey> turn it back into a rice grain? </joey>
<joey> Is that possible? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean- </joey>
<joey> - Could you do that if you had the technology? </joey>
<connor> I'm asking is it possible. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I've put a- </joey>
<joey> - Have you tried? </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] No, it's like popcorn. </joey>
<joey> You don't turn back the popcorn to its- </joey>
<connor> - Oh, that form is completely different though. </connor>
<connor> The rice stays the same. </connor>
<connor> I think if you took the water out somehow, </connor>
<joey> maybe we could do it. </joey>
<connor> Scientists, can we un-hydrate rice? </connor>
<joey> - My family, or actually a lot of Japanese families, </joey>
<garnt> what they do is, if they make too much rice, </garnt>
<garnt> then you put it into small maybe microwave-sized packets, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you put it in the freezer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, that was also what happened as well. </garnt>
<joey> - But it's not the same. </joey>
<joey> The next morning, you wake up being like, </joey>
<joey> okay, there's some leftover rice. </joey>
<joey> If I don't eat it, my mom's gonna fucking throw a hissy fit, </joey>
<joey> so let's just get it out. </joey>
<garnt> Defrost that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - But there was no space in my freezer </garnt>
<garnt> to put extra packets of frozen rice. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know why? </garnt>
<joey> As a university student, </joey>
<joey> what happens when your mom comes over? </joey>
<joey> She brings you eight Tupperware boxes full of takeaway food. </joey>
<joey> And then you gotta put it in the freezer. </joey>
<connor> It lasts you the entire day. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you're that asshole. - No, the entire fucking term. </connor>
<garnt> I was that asshole, I was that asshole. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're that asshole. </garnt>
<garnt> You know when you go to share a freezer, </garnt>
<connor> and some fuck takes up the entire fucking thing? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he decided that he was gonna meal prep </connor>
<connor> an entire month? - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're a cunt, you know that? </connor>
<garnt> We gotta share the freezer? </garnt>
<joey> Where is my Ben and Jerry's gonna go? </joey>
<joey> - Where am I gonna put my vodka? </joey>
<joey> - I just wanted one Ben and Jerry's in here. </joey>
<joey> Is that too much to ask? </joey>
<connor> - You start playing "Tetris" with all the rice packets. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - No, 'cause my mom would come to visit me </garnt>
<garnt> once a month in university. </garnt>
<garnt> And every month, she'd bring two full Sainsbury's- </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my god. - Bags worth of takeaway </joey>
<connor> boxes of food. - Holy shit. </connor>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, that is... </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - How many people were you sharing one fridge with? </connor>
<garnt> - Six or seven or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - So at best, you have half a shelf to yourself. </garnt>
<joey> And then you have one, a freezer is even smaller. </joey>
<garnt> - The freezer was smaller, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you had, what? </garnt>
<joey> Two items to put in the freezer? </joey>
<joey> Garnt, you must've been hated. </joey>
<connor> They must've hated you. </connor>
<connor> - I probably was hated. - They probably hated you. </connor>
<connor> I would throw a fit. - I would've hated you. </connor>
<connor> - I'd be like, Garnt, mate, </connor>
<connor> either you're sharing this with me, </connor>
<connor> that's my real estate, </connor>
<connor> or I'm putting stuff in there, dude. </connor>
<joey> Now you gotta say bye bye. </joey>
<joey> - You're invading my property a little bit. </joey>
<joey> Gonna have to pull the short gun on that. </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna have to haggle with me here a bit. </joey>
<garnt> We gotta figure something out. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh, god. </garnt>
<garnt> - What it's like living with a Southeast Asian guy or girl. </garnt>
<joey> - That's realizing it. - Whenever their parents come </joey>
<joey> to visit, they just bring a shit ton of food. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why it's part of our culture. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like that's just like an Asian in general. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it true with Japanese? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I know it's true with Southeast Asian and Chinese- </garnt>
<joey> - I know when I was living with, </joey>
<joey> I know when I was living on my own still, </joey>
<joey> my aunt used to come over </joey>
<garnt> and just buy me a shit ton of food. </garnt>
<garnt> That was when I was house sharing with two other people. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, I was also the asshole </connor>
<connor> that took up 80% of the freezer. </connor>
<joey> I knew very well- </joey>
<joey> - I can't believe I'm cohosting with these assholes, </joey>
<connor> these barbarians, filling up the fridge selfishly. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Hey, man. </joey>
<joey> - This is our turn to colonize. </joey>
<garnt> We're colonizing one freezer at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> - How does it feel? </garnt>
<connor> - Hey, I'm Welsh, dude. </connor>
<garnt> I'm Welsh, bro, what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] How does it feel now? </garnt>
<connor> - Welsh can't get a break, man. Fuck, dude. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, god. </connor>
<garnt> - One freezer at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> We're coming for your freezers, okay? </garnt>

<garnt> So get yourself a Levoit air purifier </garnt>
<connor> from the description link below. </connor>
<garnt> - It smells clean. - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did your parents send you care packages </garnt>
<garnt> when you went to university? </garnt>
<connor> - If I say no, they might say otherwise. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, how dare you don't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - They might see this episode and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We sent you things, Connor." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think they did. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna say that, no, I don't think so. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the last house I moved into in university, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like, we moved in, it was a bit beat up. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't great. </garnt>
<garnt> And my mom was mortified. </garnt>
<garnt> She was like, "Oh my god, this place is a shithole. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my god, you can't be caught living here." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "It's not that bad. </garnt>
<connor> I'll get over it. I'll be fine." </connor>
<connor> I just remember her reaction. </connor>
<connor> She was just like, </connor>
<connor> I thought she was actually gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> "You can't, you can't, you have to find somewhere else. </connor>
<connor> This is too old." </connor>
<connor> I was like, "No, it's fine." </connor>
<joey> It wasn't even that bad. It was just kinda messy. </joey>
<joey> - Is this the one in Swansea? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that one was the one that later had rats. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - But I don't think the rats were a part </joey>
<garnt> of the initial moving-in thing. </garnt>
<joey> They joined later. </joey>
<joey> They moved in with me. </joey>
<joey> - They were the other roommates. </joey>
<joey> - They weren't part of the package? </joey>
<joey> - No, I didn't preorder those unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, no, I mean, fuck. </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to think now. </joey>
<joey> I only ever had white roommates actually. </joey>
<joey> It sounds bad. </joey>
<joey> I guess, in Swansea, there isn't much diversity. </joey>
<joey> There wasn't. </joey>
<joey> I did have some friends who were from Chinese schools, </joey>
<joey> but most of them didn't speak- </joey>
<joey> - Like exchange students or? </joey>
<joey> - A lot of foreign students come to the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The UK has a lot of foreign students in all. </joey>
<joey> - That makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there's a ton of universities. </joey>
<connor> I think, every city has two. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you guys have some of the highest </joey>
<joey> universities as well, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of people come for that. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of prestigious ones as well. </joey>
<garnt> Not Swansea, but maybe another prestigious one. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe Oxford was full. </garnt>
<garnt> I had some friends that were Chinese, </garnt>
<garnt> but they didn't speak much English. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was such a, I can't remember his name. </garnt>
<joey> I had did some projects with him in first year, </joey>
<joey> and he didn't know what the fuck was going on. </joey>
<joey> We kinda just helped. </joey>
<connor> We were like, "We'll just help you. We'll just do it." </connor>
<connor> He was like, "Thank you, thank you. </connor>
<joey> I'll return the favor." </joey>
<joey> And then, he never returned- </joey>
<joey> - We never saw him again. </joey>
<joey> - He never returned the favor. </joey>
<garnt> - Never saw him again, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And then, two years later, same engineering. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, oh my god, I saw him again. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "How you doing, man?" </garnt>
<garnt> And his English was quite a bit better this time. </garnt>
<garnt> He spoke a bit more English. </garnt>
<garnt> Still wasn't great, but it was pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was really struggling with this thing. </garnt>
<connor> And we had a spare slot in our group, and we were like, </connor>
<connor> "Just join us, 'cause we're basically nearly done. </connor>
<joey> And you'll get a passing grade." </joey>
<connor> And he was like, "Oh, shit, no way." </connor>
<connor> We were like, "What do you do for fun?" </connor>
<joey> He's like, "I'll show you." </joey>
<joey> Dead ass, we're in the computer libraries </joey>
<joey> just working on this thing, </joey>
<joey> and this is when we invited him to join us. </joey>
<joey> We're just talking, 'cause he was sitting with us. </joey>
<joey> And we're like, "Oh, yeah, what do you do?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "I'll show you, show you." </joey>
<connor> So he takes us outside. </connor>
<connor> He just starts breakdancing. </connor>
<connor> - Hell yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Insane. - Fuck yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - Insane, 'cause he didn't wanna explain it or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember what it was. </garnt>
<joey> He just starts doing insane flips and shit. </joey>
<garnt> We're computer nerds and engineers. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're just like, what? </garnt>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> - That's fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - It was so bizarre. </connor>
<joey> - The glow-up, dude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then he was like, "Yeah, I love breakdancing. </joey>
<joey> It's my passion and stuff." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Nice, dude, nice." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "What are you gonna do after this?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "I don't fucking know." </joey>
<connor> He's like, "I'm just here until my parents drag me back." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "I don't know, fair enough." </connor>
<joey> - Breakdance my way to a degree. </joey>
<connor> - And so, he was like, "By the way, I didn't forget. </connor>
<joey> I wanna return the favor for you guys helping me so much." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah? </joey>
<joey> - I didn't see him for a long time. </joey>
<joey> And then one day I was on the bus back to my house, </joey>
<joey> and he was there, he was like, </joey>
<joey> "Dude, let me return the favor for you." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh, okay, sure, sure." </joey>
<joey> And so we go into town. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Look, my friend owns this boba store." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, of course. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, yeah, I don't wanna be racist, but it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - It made sense, yeah. - It makes sense, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Your Chinese friends own the boba store. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> It makes sense, it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - My first time ever having boba. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Yeah, you gotta try this. This is amazing." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? - He said, "You love tea?" </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, "Yeah, I love tea, I love tea." </garnt>
<joey> I'd never heard of boba before. </joey>
<joey> This is like 20- </joey>
<joey> - Is this before it exploded, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this is 2015. - Before the boba explosion. </joey>
<joey> - And I've never even seen this stuff. </joey>
<joey> And they were putting these, </joey>
<garnt> what I thought were, balls into my drink, </garnt>
<garnt> tapioca at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> He puts 'em in, I'm like, "I don't know, man. </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't like tea I've had before. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's cold?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I don't know about that. </garnt>
<joey> So I have this, and he makes it for me. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "It's free of charge, free of charge." </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, all right, I'll give you, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know how much this work would've cost </joey>
<joey> if I charged you, but all right. </joey>
<garnt> - Free boba. - I was very grateful. </garnt>
<connor> And I drink it. </connor>
<connor> And immediately, I'm like (coughing). </connor>
<connor> I'm choking on this fucking tapioca ball. </connor>
<connor> I'm like (coughing). </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you gotta Heimlich maneuver me. </connor>
<connor> It was awful. </connor>
<connor> I spat out the boba in the store. It was so bad. </connor>
<connor> I suck on it, and like the whitest thing ever, </connor>
<connor> I went (coughing). </connor>
<connor> - That is the whitest story ever. </connor>
<garnt> White man tries tapioca for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally spat it out. </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "I'm so sorry." </connor>
<connor> He's like, "No, it was funny." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Oh, okay." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "But the milk part tasted good. </connor>
<connor> Can we get rid of the balls?" </connor>
<joey> And he's like, "Yeah, we'll just make you another one </joey>
<joey> without the balls." </joey>
<joey> "No, no, no, you don't have to." </joey>
<joey> He's like, "It's free, don't worry." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - I got you, bro. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Aw, okay, okay, okay." </joey>
<joey> - That's nice of him. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he's very, very nice. </joey>
<joey> - God, I remember when the fucking initial boba </joey>
<joey> explosion happened in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - How did that happen? Why did that happen? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so weird, 'cause the month we moved here, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like every boba store, </garnt>
<garnt> you would tell which boba store, </garnt>
<connor> what was a boba store, sorry, </connor>
<joey> if it had a line outside. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. </connor>
<joey> - There were some boba stores near my house at the time </joey>
<joey> where it was like, legit, on weekends, </joey>
<joey> it was legit like a four-hour wait. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't get it. - And I'm like, what? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't get it. </joey>
<garnt> It's just bit a tea with some jelly. </garnt>
<connor> - Man, did that die though. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It fucking sped-run death. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, I like- </joey>
<connor> - Did it speed-run death? </connor>
<joey> I think it's still- - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No, you never see lines anymore. </joey>
<joey> - No, you go to a boba store now. </joey>
<joey> There's maybe one or two people there max. </joey>
<garnt> - That's true, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, they're still a thing in the UK from what I can see. </garnt>
<connor> They still exist, the stores still exist- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, it's still around, but it's not the hype. </connor>
<connor> The hype is nowhere near. - It's just the hype, </connor>
<connor> but I mean, rightly so. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I thought it was overrated the fuck. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I think so too. </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't get what the craze around it was. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I drank a shitload of it during uni, </joey>
<connor> because we had a boba store near where we studied. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I get it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but that was before the explosion. </garnt>
<connor> - It lasts a while, 'cause it's cold. </connor>
<joey> You can kinda just sip on it throughout the day </joey>
<connor> if you ever get a big one. </connor>
<joey> - Also, if you're a uni student, it's a great sugar rush. </joey>
<joey> And also, it keeps you concentrated. </joey>
<joey> - I guess, everyone after a while was, in Japan at least, </joey>
<joey> were like, all right, back to Starbucks now. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, back to Starbucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Back to the way life should've been. </garnt>
<connor> - I just saw nothing but just iced tea, </connor>
<joey> or iced coffee, I don't know, maybe. </joey>
<joey> To me, it was like- </joey>
<joey> - But it's not fun. </joey>
<garnt> There's no personality. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a hot boy. </garnt>
<garnt> I like my drinks hot. </garnt>
<connor> I don't really like cold drinks that much. </connor>
<joey> - They had hot boba too though, right, I think? </joey>
<garnt> - Hot boba is just not the same. </garnt>
<garnt> - They have hot boba? - It's not the same. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I think they do. - What? </joey>
<joey> - But it's not as good. </joey>
<joey> - I believe you can order it with no ice sometimes. </joey>
<joey> You know when you can customize your order? </joey>
<joey> - That's lukewarm though. </joey>
<joey> - That is true, that's lukewarm. </joey>
<joey> - That's like piss water. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Warm boba? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's like pee water. - Warm boba? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Gross. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what maniac would order a warm boba, </joey>
<garnt> but it was an option in some </garnt>
<garnt> of the boba stores I've been to. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it was a specialty, I'd be like, okay, if you say so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was that a secret menu? </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] The secret menu! </joey>
<garnt> - Did you have to speak Chinese to get that one? </garnt>
<joey> It's like, got my Chinese friend. </joey>
<joey> Can I get the lukewarm boba? </joey>
<garnt> It's like, aw, you know your shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how or why it exploded, </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember, not just in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> but just pretty much everywhere in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> everywhere in Thailand, you just couldn't get away from it. </garnt>
<joey> - Even in the States, I remember it was huge. </joey>
<garnt> - It was fashionable. </garnt>
<joey> I think it's just a fashionable drink. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess so. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Instagram-able. </garnt>
<garnt> That's it. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Instagram-able. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's be honest, 2014 was all the Frappuccino. </garnt>
<joey> That's what it was. </joey>
<garnt> - That's true, that's true. - It came out. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the thing. </garnt>
<joey> Everyone just wants a photogenic drink, </joey>
<connor> and boba looked photogenic. </connor>
<joey> - But I feel Japan took the photogenic-ness of boba </joey>
<joey> and just was trying to stretch it out </joey>
<joey> to such a high degree where it was just so unnecessary- </joey>
<joey> - That's like everything in Japan now. </joey>
<joey> Everything is about taking photos. </joey>
<garnt> Afternoon tea, I love my afternoon tea. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the most British thing I've ever said. </garnt>
<garnt> I really, really enjoy going for tea </garnt>
<connor> and having crumpets or scones. </connor>
<joey> - That is a weirdly popular subculture in Japan, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - It is, but everywhere I've been just does it really badly. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I mean, not badly. It's hard to say. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Not as good. </joey>
<joey> - To me, afternoon tea is just as much </joey>
<garnt> about the food you get as it is the tea. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the food isn't great here. </garnt>
<garnt> - The food here looks so aesthetic. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it doesn't taste good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, that's literally all they do. </garnt>
<garnt> They arrange it, </garnt>
<connor> and they get these beautiful colored things. </connor>
<connor> Then you take one bite of the quiche. </connor>
<connor> You're like, why does it taste bad? </connor>
<garnt> - I actually agree. </garnt>
<garnt> Afternoon is one thing that England does the best </garnt>
<garnt> that I've had so far, </garnt>
<garnt> because the afternoon tea food is actually good, </garnt>
<garnt> whereas in Japan, every time I've had afternoon tea, </garnt>
<connor> it just looks pretty. </connor>
<garnt> - Also, yeah, it's gotta be layered, right? </garnt>
<connor> The layers are to distinguish the types of flavors. </connor>
<connor> Bottom is for sandwiches. </connor>
<garnt> Then maybe you get the quiches </garnt>
<garnt> or the more savory kind of the dishes. </garnt>
<garnt> It's always sandwich at the bottom. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like pastries and stuff like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's savory. - You got the sweets </garnt>
<garnt> at the top. - Savory, and then sweets. </garnt>
<garnt> But in Japan, it's sweets, sweets, </garnt>
<connor> savory, and also sweets. </connor>
<connor> It's ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause normally, afternoon tea, you kinda have it at, </connor>
<connor> we'd have it in the afternoon. </connor>
<connor> If it's a good place, </connor>
<garnt> you can normally skip lunch or dinner with it, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause it's quite a lot. </joey>
<garnt> Some places even refill. </garnt>
<garnt> In the UK, they refill the sandwiches </garnt>
<garnt> or stuff in some places. </garnt>
<garnt> You can chow down. </garnt>
<garnt> If you liked the sandwiches, </garnt>
<garnt> or you liked whatever they're offering, </garnt>
<garnt> dude, it's good, it's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> You get your money's worth. </garnt>
<connor> Expensive though. </connor>
<connor> In London, it's very expensive. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, I bet. </joey>
<joey> - It's good, it's really good. </joey>
<connor> - But it's an experience you're paying for, right? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - One thing I've only seen really in Asia as well, </garnt>
<connor> going off the boba thing, </connor>
<connor> before, I guess, the boba craze took off- </connor>
<connor> - It's the most privileged thing </connor>
<connor> I've ever mentioned by the way. </connor>
<garnt> I just realized that. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? Afternoon tea? - I sound so privileged, </garnt>
<garnt> me being like, "The tea isn't good enough, disgusting." </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] No sandwiches. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's one thing I feel like Britain does well, </connor>
<connor> so I think it's a good- </connor>
<connor> - It's no Greggs though, is it? </connor>
<connor> - It's no Greggs. - It's not Greggs. </connor>
<connor> - It's not Greggs. </connor>
<joey> But yeah, dessert cafes, that's one thing </joey>
<joey> I only saw in Asia. - Oh, god. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know if there is more dessert cafes in the UK now- </joey>
<garnt> - Dessert buffets especially. </garnt>
<joey> - Sorry? - Dessert buffets. </joey>
<garnt> - What's that? </garnt>
<joey> - It's literally exactly that. </joey>
<joey> Think of a buffet, but it's all desserts. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause whenever I'd hang out </garnt>
<garnt> with some of my friends in Thailand, they'd be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, let's go to this dessert cafe." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, wait. </garnt>
<garnt> To me, growing up in England, dessert was something you have </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the meal at a restaurant. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't go to a specific place to eat dessert, right? </garnt>
<joey> That concept was just alien to me. </joey>
<joey> To me, it still feels weird, right? </joey>
<garnt> If I wanted dessert after a meal, </garnt>
<garnt> I would order it at the restaurant. </garnt>
<garnt> But you go to a dessert cafe, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like half a meal, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause you never go to a dessert cafe </garnt>
<joey> after you finish eating at a restaurant, </joey>
<joey> but you go to a dessert cafe </joey>
<joey> at really weird times at a day. </joey>
<joey> - Three. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, three or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I go to a dessert cafe, I have the dessert, </garnt>
<joey> and then it just fucks with my eating schedule. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause then I just don't want dinner, </joey>
<garnt> but then it also doesn't fill me up as well. </garnt>
<joey> It's really weird. </joey>
<garnt> - So you get hungry at 9 PM. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a really weird time where it's like, </garnt>
<joey> oh, it's kinda too late to eat food. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </joey>
<connor> - But I know I won't be able to sleep, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm gonna get hungry. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No, I get that. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I just don't feel satisfied </joey>
<joey> if I've eaten a lot of something sweet. </joey>
<connor> But when I eat a savory meal, I just feel happy. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel sick if I eat too much sweet stuff now. </connor>
<connor> I was always like that though. </connor>
<connor> I could never eat too... </connor>
<connor> I like sweets, but I could never eat too much of it, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause then I'd just get... </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be filled up, but then that feeling </garnt>
<garnt> of being filled up by sweet shit, </garnt>
<garnt> it just made me feel really ill, </garnt>
<joey> which just made me wanna eat regular food anyway. </joey>
<connor> - Man, I said this a year or two ago, </connor>
<joey> but man, I still don't like themed cafes in Japan, </joey>
<joey> the collaboration cafes. </joey>
<joey> The food- - Because of the food? </joey>
<joey> - The food and drink is a joke. </joey>
<joey> - It looks good. </joey>
<joey> - That's the thing. </joey>
<garnt> I hate the fact that we're turning food impractical. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, wow, we put a little... </garnt>
<garnt> I went to the Square Enix one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they made me a latte. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, this latte tastes really bad. </garnt>
<joey> But they put a Slime on it, so I guess now it's worth $9. </joey>
<joey> It's like, what? </joey>
<joey> - I've been to so many themed cafes, </joey>
<joey> 'cause Aki loves going to them. </joey>
<joey> - I know. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause she makes content out of it, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's understandable. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the only good one where I would actually go back </garnt>
<garnt> for the food is the Kirby Cafe. </garnt>
<garnt> I know it's good- - Lies. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sus, sus. - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I know it's good because- </garnt>
<garnt> - The biggest Kirby fan of all- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, no, hear me out. </garnt>
<joey> - Says the Kirby Cafe- - Hear me out. </joey>
<joey> - Has the best food. </joey>
<joey> - It does. </joey>
<joey> - What a coincidence, Joey. </joey>
<garnt> - It legitimately does, and I know </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not the only one who thinks that, </garnt>
<joey> because it was a temporary thing at fucking Tokyo Skytree, </joey>
<garnt> but now they made it a permanent thing. </garnt>
<garnt> So you know if a themed cafe turns permanent, </garnt>
<garnt> that's how you know that the food is good. </garnt>
<garnt> Because if the food sucks, then people don't come back. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a novelty to it that's really short lived. </garnt>
<garnt> And once you've experienced all the food </garnt>
<garnt> and you've experienced </garnt>
<garnt> that themed cafe's style and everything, </garnt>
<garnt> and you've grabbed all the fucking merch you can, </garnt>
<joey> because there's always a merch shop attached to it as well, </joey>
<joey> then you're not gonna go back. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, 'cause to me, </connor>
<connor> it's like the food itself is the art. </connor>
<connor> Don't draw all over my steak. </connor>
<connor> Don't reassemble the carrots to look like a smiley face. </connor>
<connor> I'm not a toddler. - But I think that's why </connor>
<joey> I like the Kirby Cafe, because the Kirby Cafe, </joey>
<joey> they don't fuck around the food. </joey>
<connor> They fuck around with the cutlery. </connor>
<connor> So the plates are shaped in certain ways, </connor>
<connor> or the cups are shaped in certain ways. </connor>
<garnt> But the actual food itself is normal </garnt>
<connor> once you put it on a regular plate. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if I'm like a Scrooge or something, </connor>
<connor> just don't enjoy fun or whatever, </connor>
<garnt> but I just don't want people making faces </garnt>
<garnt> or shit out with my food. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want my food to be a toy. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] No, I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm exactly the same way where, </garnt>
<garnt> if I go to a themed something of something I'm a fan of, </garnt>
<joey> then I don't want them to fuck around with the food. </joey>
<joey> - Right? - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Look, look, I'm here for a good time </joey>
<joey> to enjoy the thing I like. - I'll buy the merch. </joey>
<joey> - I'll buy the merch. </joey>
<joey> Give me cool merch. </joey>
<garnt> Give me cool exclusive merch that I can buy. </garnt>
<connor> - What better way to get one with the show </connor>
<connor> than to digest the show. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, dude, fucking typical example </joey>
<joey> is when we went to the "Baki" exhibit, right? </joey>
<joey> And I saw this poster that was like, </joey>
<garnt> oh, just down the block, there is the Baki Cafe, </garnt>
<garnt> a "Baki" themed cafe. - Oh, god. </garnt>
<garnt> - And my friend and I were like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was hitting around lunch time, early afternoon. </garnt>
<garnt> We were like, all right, let's go check it out, all right? </garnt>
<garnt> Let's go see the menu. </garnt>
<joey> And I saw the menu, and I was like, </joey>
<joey> this is the laziest attempt at a themed cafe. </joey>
<joey> One of them was Retsu Kaiou's Neapolitan pasta. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, when does Retsu ever eat Napoleon pasta </joey>
<garnt> in fucking "Baki?" </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like they are really fucking stretching it. </garnt>
<garnt> They're really stretching it to make it on brand. </garnt>
<connor> - It's Mickey Mouse's world-famous lasagna. </connor>
<connor> He loves lasagna. </connor>
<joey> - One of them was Yuujirou's cappuccino. </joey>
<garnt> It didn't even have Yuujirou's face on it. </garnt>
<connor> It was literally just a cappuccino. </connor>
<garnt> - $9. </garnt>
<joey> - What makes this Yuujirou? </joey>
<connor> - That's the thing about- - $10. </connor>
<garnt> - So many themed cafes are mental in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> where they have a dish on the menu </garnt>
<garnt> that's just like fucking Rin's special curry </garnt>
<joey> from "Fate/stay night." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, when did this happen? </joey>
<garnt> How is this on brand? </garnt>
<joey> Why did you just add a... </joey>
<joey> You literally just added a character to a random dish. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - You call it a brand? </joey>
<garnt> They call it branded. </garnt>
<connor> - I find it insulting. </connor>
<garnt> You're insulting my intelligence. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're insulting my fandom. </garnt>
<garnt> - You think I'm just gonna buy this </garnt>
<connor> because you put this kaiju on it? </connor>
<connor> I'll take two. </connor>
<joey> - If you had put the fucking Neapolitan pasta </joey>
<joey> in front of me, I would've been like, </joey>
<connor> oh, it's just a regular Neapolitan pasta. </connor>
<connor> Do you think if they were like, </connor>
<connor> "But it's Retsu Kaiou's Neapolitan pasta," </connor>
<connor> then I'd be like, "Well, fucking sign me up then! </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna eat the shit out of this!" </joey>
<connor> - This is why, when you go to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, </connor>
<connor> he doesn't serve fucking smiley faces on his steak. </connor>
<joey> Do you know what I mean? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just don't want that, I don't want it. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the steak just has the initials. </joey>
<joey> - If you went to a rely nice restaurant... </joey>
<connor> Yeah, just initials burnt into the steak, </connor>
<connor> you'd be like, what the fuck this this? </connor>
<connor> What is this? Is this a horse? </connor>
<connor> Are you branding it? Was it running away? </connor>
<connor> What's going on? </connor>
<connor> - This is our steak. </connor>
<connor> - I just don't like that. </connor>
<connor> To me, if a food is done well, </connor>
<connor> it itself is so beautiful, and I'll pay for it. </connor>
<connor> Just have the decor of your cafe, </connor>
<connor> have everything else be themed. </connor>
<connor> Everything else but the food. </connor>
<connor> Don't fuck with that. - Just have cool cutlery. </connor>
<connor> Have a cool vibe. </connor>
<connor> Have a cool aesthetic. </connor>
<garnt> Make it feel like you're at the place. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it's Kirby, make it so that the toilet is Kirby, </garnt>
<garnt> and I can lift up his mouth. </garnt>
<connor> And I can sit and shit in Kirby's mouth. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right, but I think that's what I appreciated </joey>
<joey> about the Kirby Cafe </joey>
<joey> was that they didn't fuck around with the food. </joey>
<connor> They fucked around with the cutlery, </connor>
<connor> which you can then buy at the fucking merch store. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, oh, cool. </connor>
<connor> This is a thing I can use in my kitchen. </connor>
<connor> And it's kinda neat and dope, </connor>
<joey> and I don't have to make a fucking Kirby-themed- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you'll have to go </joey>
<joey> if you come to Japan at some point. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there will be tons. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, please, Kirby Cafe's great. </joey>
<connor> - There's always a bunch. </connor>
<connor> They're rotating. </connor>
<connor> - For me, especially when it's cafes </connor>
<connor> especially that are paired with exhibits or whatever, right? </connor>
<joey> Just give me some good merch. </joey>
<connor> - Didn't they have the "Pen Pineapple Pen" cafe? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I went to that. - Did they actually? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - No fucking way. </garnt>
<garnt> - I made a video on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, god. - Yeah, you did, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I made a video on it. - How long ago was this? </garnt>
<joey> - When was "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen" made? </joey>
<joey> Six years ago? </joey>
<garnt> - Six years ago or something. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it was 2016. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, they made a- </connor>
<connor> - That's how popular it was. They made a cafe. </connor>
<connor> - They made a popup of "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen." </connor>
<connor> I think it was at Tokyo Skytree, </connor>
<garnt> or Tokyo Tower, whichever one it was. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, you go in, and all of the menu items </garnt>
<garnt> spelled out P-P-A-P. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the only- - That was it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yep, they didn't even have any pineapple </garnt>
<garnt> or apple-based products, and I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> I feel like you really missed the ball here. </joey>
<joey> - Paprika, it's paprika, right? </joey>
<joey> - It was a "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen" burger, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> what does this have to do with "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen?" </joey>
<garnt> - With zero pineapple in the burger. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, no pineapple in the burger, no apple- </joey>
<connor> - That's good though. I don't like pineapple burgers. </connor>
<connor> - I don't mind it if it's done well. </connor>
<connor> But even then, they couldn't even put the effort to do that. </connor>
<connor> The thing I felt the most sorry about was the fact that, </connor>
<connor> there was two clerks who were standing behind the counter, </connor>
<connor> and they looked so dead inside, </connor>
<connor> because "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen" was playing on repeat </connor>
<joey> in the store all day. - Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - I was there for a couple of hours. </joey>
<joey> By minute 20, I was like, </joey>
<joey> I wanna get the fuck out of here. </joey>
<joey> Shove a pen in my ear. </joey>
<joey> Just blur out the sound. </joey>
<joey> They looked so dead. </joey>
<garnt> - That's kind of how I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> All of the truck drivers that drive </garnt>
<joey> around fucking Harajuku or whatever, </joey>
<joey> and they have to drive around promoting </joey>
<joey> these idols or whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. - Or this latest album. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, have we spoke about... </garnt>
<garnt> I swear we've mentioned it. </garnt>
<garnt> There's these trucks that drive around Japan </garnt>
<connor> where they'll play music really loudly. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] They're called (speaking in foreign language), </joey>
<joey> or decorative trucks. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, and they just blind you. </connor>
<connor> And they're awful, they're awful. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] It's basically just a moving billboard basically. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, basically. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird in Japan how you can't make noise </connor>
<garnt> in your own apartment, but anyone can make as much noise </garnt>
<garnt> as they want on the street. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really weird, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Someone can come around selling hot potatoes </connor>
<garnt> and intrude our streams. </garnt>
<joey> - People running for government just scream in public. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like, what year are we in? </joey>
<joey> Don't you have social media you could promote on? </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> - No, I'm sure you're really connected </joey>
<connor> with the youth of today </connor>
<connor> by driving around a truck and screaming. </connor>
<joey> - What do they expect for everyone to come out </joey>
<joey> of their houses is like, "Guys, honey, wake up. </joey>
<connor> The new politician's in town." </connor>
<connor> - I mean, even if it's older people, right? </connor>
<connor> Well, they're not gonna get up just to go outside </connor>
<connor> to listen to you drive by. </connor>
<garnt> - And maybe that's why they're loud. </garnt>
<connor> Otherwise, they're not gonna hear it, </connor>
<connor> so they just broadcast to all the houses. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, probably. </garnt>
<joey> - We gotta make it through the hearing aids somehow. </joey>
<connor> - It trends in an interesting spot where they have to, </connor>
<garnt> political people have to try and go </garnt>
<garnt> towards the older generation. </garnt>
<garnt> So all the techniques they use seem archaic as fuck, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's the only way they can get elected. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if you're not in someone's letterbox, </garnt>
<garnt> they're not gonna get on Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> Weird, isn't it? Weird, isn't it? </garnt>
<connor> The whole political system is just catered </connor>
<joey> towards old people. </joey>
<joey> - What I just don't understand though is, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I'm sure they're being loud as fuck on the street, </joey>
<joey> so that, again, as you were saying, </joey>
<joey> it can reach the old peoples' ears, right? </joey>
<joey> Because a lot of people, as old age comes naturally, </joey>
<garnt> you become hard of hearing. </garnt>
<garnt> And yet these same old people can hear </garnt>
<garnt> the tiniest creak from upstairs and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh my god, that's too fucking loud. </garnt>
<joey> How dare they walk so loud in my apartment!" </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, I'm having a really hard time hearing </joey>
<joey> this fucking politician on 17 megaphones </joey>
<joey> just drive past my house. </joey>
<joey> I need them to turn up a little bit louder. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I don't know what... </garnt>
<garnt> Are there any laws around how much noise </garnt>
<garnt> you can make in Japan? </garnt>
<connor> - Isn't it past 10? </connor>
<garnt> - Past 10? - Or nine? </garnt>
<joey> - It's something like that, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel, half the time, </garnt>
<garnt> people just don't follow those laws. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's always exceptions to the rule. </garnt>
<joey> You could have like a bunch of... </joey>
<joey> How come all these loud ass bikes </joey>
<joey> that drive through neighborhoods </joey>
<joey> and not be fucking called on by the cops? </joey>
<garnt> - Does your neighborhood have a gang </garnt>
<garnt> of old Japanese grandmas who are just like the real- </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean? </garnt>
<joey> - The leaders of that fucking street or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - It's 'cause you have a house. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, I have a house. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, you're in a neighborhood area. </joey>
<joey> - I'm in an apartment. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm in an apartment as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause Meilyne warns me about this </joey>
<joey> before I was moving in the house. </joey>
<joey> She was like, "Be careful about the posse </joey>
<joey> of old Japanese grandmas." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, "What are you talking about, Meilyne? </joey>
<joey> What are you talking about?" </joey>
<joey> Lo and behold, now I've noticed </joey>
<joey> there is this group of Japanese grandmas </joey>
<joey> who seem to run the neighborhood. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how this happened. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why this happened. </joey>
<joey> But you do one thing wrong, </joey>
<joey> maybe you take a garbage out just a bit too early. </joey>
<joey> You see them, you see them eyeing you. </joey>
<joey> You see them eyeing you, right? </joey>
<joey> I can tell. </joey>
<joey> Anytime me and Sydney come out, </joey>
<garnt> sometimes they're just gossiping together. </garnt>
<garnt> You know when you can feel someone gossiping about you, </garnt>
<garnt> that's every time me and Sydney go out of the house. </garnt>
<connor> They're always in the same corner. </connor>
<garnt> It's the same group of Japanese grandmas, and I remember- </garnt>
<joey> - We should wait for them to say hi. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, you should- - No, I do, I do. </connor>
<connor> - For those people, what I've learned </connor>
<garnt> is that you just need to be ignorantly happy </garnt>
<garnt> and friendly towards them. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they'll start to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, maybe they're actually all right. </garnt>
<joey> Maybe we'll take them off the hit list, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, I feel like I've been put... </garnt>
<joey> I was friendly enough, right? </joey>
<joey> - There's so much moist- </joey>
<joey> - Sorry. - Amount of speaking here. </joey>
<joey> (Connor moaning) </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I've been put on a hit list now, </joey>
<garnt> because I did unfortunately take the garbage out </garnt>
<connor> on the wrong day. </connor>
<garnt> One day, one day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Being on a Japanese hit list is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll give you, at worst, a passive aggressive note one day. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I got that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Did you really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, remember? </connor>
<connor> In my old apartment, I got that English-written note. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the worst you'll get. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, that's the worst you'll get. </connor>
<connor> - They say they'll kick you out, </connor>
<joey> and they'll tell the housing company. </joey>
<joey> - And then I need (speaking in foreign language) </joey>
<joey> reverse Uno card, and then they shut up. </joey>
<joey> - The housing company's not gonna kick you out. </joey>
<joey> - No, of course not. </joey>
<garnt> - Unless you are actually taking the piss. </garnt>
<garnt> But if you're just walking, </garnt>
<connor> the housing company's not gonna give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - They'd be like, okay, granny. </connor>
<garnt> - They'd be like, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Simmer down, come on now. </garnt>
<joey> - So yeah, one day, normally, we take our garbage out </joey>
<joey> either the night before or the morning of. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what's custom in Japanese neighborhoods. </garnt>
<joey> - It depends on your area. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, normally, it's like, I think, the morning of, </joey>
<joey> but I remember, I think, I woke up slightly late that day. </joey>
<joey> So how it worked in my place is that, </joey>
<joey> the garbage is one day. </joey>
<joey> And then the recyclables is the next day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I hated that. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's most places. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, so I thought I was just on the cusp </joey>
<garnt> of getting the recyclables out on the right day, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's garbage, recyclables, then garbage again. </garnt>
<garnt> So I thought I was just on the cusp. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe the garbage truck hadn't come yet. </garnt>
<garnt> So I go out to the garbage spot, </garnt>
<garnt> and I see some bags there. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, oh, great, I still made it in time. </joey>
<joey> And so I put the recyclables out, went back in my house, </joey>
<joey> and just continue about my day. </joey>
<joey> I get a ring on my doorbell. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<connor> - I get a ring on my doorbell. - No way. </connor>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, oh, it must be a delivery or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I open the door, and it's three old Japanese grandmas- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god. - Just staring at me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you serious? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I am serious. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my god! </joey>
<joey> - And I see my bag of recyclables right in front of my door. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, they nicely enough explained to me </joey>
<garnt> that I had missed the time and it was just the wrong day </garnt>
<garnt> to bring out the recyclables, </garnt>
<garnt> but it kinda felt like some fucking loan sharks </garnt>
<garnt> outside my door being like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It'd be a shame if this were to happen again. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like repo men. </joey>
<garnt> You do it again, we're taking everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - They are basically the gangsters </garnt>
<garnt> that run the neighborhood, you know? </garnt>
<joey> I felt like I just missed out on paying </joey>
<joey> the protection money of the day. </joey>
<joey> It's like, shame what would happen- </joey>
<garnt> - America has the Crips and the Bloods. </garnt>
<joey> We have the Grannies. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> Fear them, they control everything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they're the real... </joey>
<joey> It's like the fucking Sopranos, right? </joey>
<connor> It's the Japanese Sopranos, right? </connor>
<connor> The old Japanese grandmas- </connor>
<garnt> - Did you take the recycling out today? </garnt>
<garnt> - I heard some really strict crazy grandmas </garnt>
<garnt> can get pissed off when, you know on cardboard boxes? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like the Amazon labels and stuff, </joey>
<joey> they get pissed off you don't take those off. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've heard of some grandmas that get like, </joey>
<joey> they're like, how dare you. </joey>
<garnt> Even though it doesn't make a difference. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, of course not. </garnt>
<joey> - This is why I love living in an apartment building. </joey>
<joey> I can just take it down whenever I want. </joey>
<joey> No recycling day. </joey>
<joey> No garbage day. </joey>
<joey> It's like, whenever you have garbage, take it down. </joey>
<joey> Cardboard's the worst, 'cause when you're moving in, </joey>
<joey> it literally is like cardboard city. </joey>
<joey> And it's just stacks upon stacks upon stack. </joey>
<joey> I'm waiting for the day when you're like, </joey>
<garnt> well, what's that in the corner, Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> Well, it's the wall of cardboard actually. </garnt>
<garnt> It's one of the main attractions of the apartment. </garnt>
<garnt> I have so much cardboard, in fact, </garnt>
<connor> that I could probably house everyone in the half of Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, that's the thing where, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when I was moving in, I felt like, </garnt>
<garnt> if you missed the day of the cardboard collection, </garnt>
<garnt> then you were just fucked, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but also you feel like, </connor>
<connor> am I taking the piss with this much cardboard? </connor>
<garnt> I have a two-meter-high stack of cardboard. </garnt>
<joey> Am I taking up too much cardboard? Is that allowed? </joey>
<connor> What's the limit on how much recycling I can recycle? </connor>
<joey> - I remember the only time I had a granny experience </joey>
<joey> when I was moving into my current place was when, </joey>
<joey> it was like the first week I was moving in, </joey>
<joey> and it was like the shitload of cardboard thing. </joey>
<joey> And cardboard day comes around. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, finally, here we go. </joey>
<joey> This is where the cleansing starts. </joey>
<garnt> So I take out way too much cardboard, </garnt>
<garnt> probably fucking half the Amazon rainforest </garnt>
<garnt> worth of cardboard, right? </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Naturally. </joey>
<joey> - And then, the next morning, </joey>
<garnt> I come out to leave for the office, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And a grandma stops me. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like, oh no. </joey>
<garnt> - Uh oh, uh oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - And she points at the mountain of cardboard, </garnt>
<connor> and she's like, "That's all your cardboard, right?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "I mean, not all of it." </connor>
<connor> - Oh, come on, love, it's like 90%. Fuck off. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, most of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And she's like, "I think that you're really causing </garnt>
<garnt> the rubbish people a lot of trouble </garnt>
<joey> with that much cardboard." </joey>
<joey> And then I just reverse Uno card, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I moved in yesterday." </joey>
<joey> Puts on sunglasses, walks off. </joey>
<joey> But legit, she was just like, "Oh, I'm sorry then. </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry about that." </joey>
<garnt> But that felt good. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the one time where I trumped the granny. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, you don't control it! </garnt>
<joey> - Silence! </joey>
<joey> - Silence, woman! </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] You can actually, </joey>
<joey> some moving companies say call them up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and take the cardboard. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I did that, but even they, </joey>
<joey> I had so much cardboard that the moving company </joey>
<joey> could only take so much cardboard. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I moved into a much bigger place, </joey>
<garnt> and I needed to buy all this new furniture </garnt>
<garnt> to fill up the space. </garnt>
<garnt> But it felt good. </garnt>
<joey> It felt good to reverse Uno card a granny. </joey>
<garnt> - Basically, they think organized crime in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> is the Yakuza, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It's the grandmas. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the Japanese grannies in your neighborhood. </joey>
<joey> Watch out, make sure you don't piss them off. </joey>
<joey> Otherwise, you're gonna be having a bad time. </joey>
<joey> - I've been living here for 60 years. </joey>
<joey> I know every nook and cranny of these streets. </joey>
<joey> - Literally the day after they came, I came back home, </joey>
<garnt> and they had slid this in my letterbox, </garnt>
<garnt> just the schedule of the garbage for the week, </garnt>
<connor> and the garbage collection. - No. </connor>
<connor> - That's so passive aggressive. </connor>
<garnt> - I was just like, oh, they're sending me a message. </garnt>
<connor> They're literally sending me a message. </connor>
<garnt> - You turn over the note, and they're like, </garnt>
<joey> get this wrong again, you're dead. </joey>
<joey> Don't fuck it up again, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - Gonna wake up in bed with a decapitated horse head. </joey>
<garnt> Get the garbage day right next time. Don't fuck up. </garnt>
<connor> - You'll have a dead salmon at your front door. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, you better take this out on the right day. </joey>
<garnt> - What day does oily containers go, Garnt? Hmm? </garnt>
<connor> - The ultimate test. - A shampoo bottle? </connor>
<connor> A shampoo bottle is not recycling, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - I love it, you have this spreadsheet of items </connor>
<joey> that very specifically cannot be recycled and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - I have an app for it, dude. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh my god. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, our ward created an app being like, </joey>
<joey> if you put in a certain item, </joey>
<joey> it tells you exactly what day to bring it out. </joey>
<connor> - What sucks is that there's like, </connor>
<garnt> some items, you're like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, like styrofoam, right? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Have you had that packaging that's thin? </joey>
<joey> It's like a paper styrofoam? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck is this? </joey>
<joey> Is this burnable? </joey>
<connor> Is this paper, or is this- </connor>
<connor> - Plastic? - I don't know what this is. </connor>
<connor> This is a mystery. </connor>
<connor> And every time I ask anyone, they're like, "I have no idea." </connor>
<connor> I think it's burnable, but no one's 100%. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's like, "Dude, it's not gonna matter. </connor>
<connor> Just put it in the burnable." </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing. </joey>
<joey> There's all these rules that are laid out </joey>
<connor> that the grannies will enforce you on. </connor>
<connor> But when you put it all into a fucking bag and put it out. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Of course. </connor>
<joey> - I heard that apparently the recycling, </joey>
<connor> even though they make you sort it very strict, </connor>
<joey> that actually when it goes to the plant apparently, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how true this is, that it's not actually, </joey>
<joey> they don't recycle it as well as you'd think they are. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I would believe that. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, fair enough. </joey>
<joey> But fuck, dude, one time I went down </joey>
<joey> to my recycling thing in my current place. </joey>
<joey> I thought, hmm. </joey>
<joey> I was putting out my bottles in my bottle thing, </joey>
<joey> and I noticed that there was 10-plus </joey>
<garnt> Bombay Sapphire gin bottles. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, who has drank this much Bombay Sapphire? </garnt>
<garnt> This is a lot of gin. - It wasn't you, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it wasn't me. </garnt>
<garnt> I was gonna say- </garnt>
<connor> - I thought that was you. </connor>
<connor> - As another person who enjoys Bombay Sapphire gin, </connor>
<connor> I was like, huh, I wonder who's bought this much Bombay... </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna keep saying it, it's very satisfying. </connor>
<connor> Bombay Sapphire gin. </connor>
<joey> - Clearly, there's another British person in your building. </joey>
<connor> - I was like, either somebody's running a bar secretly </connor>
<joey> in their apartment that specializes </joey>
<joey> in Bombay Sapphire cocktails. </joey>
<garnt> - Or someone had a good night. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or there's a really depressed British person </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere in this apartment building </garnt>
<garnt> who is really, really spending a lot of money on gin. </garnt>
<garnt> I just thought, why would you have this many? </garnt>
<garnt> They're all neatly stacked, </garnt>
<joey> almost like a Jenga-esque stacking style. </joey>
<joey> This is definitely one person who brought... </joey>
<joey> I wonder, did they collect them for a long time, </joey>
<joey> and they thought, no, this is ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> I can't collect this many bottles. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause some people will keep their alcohol containers </joey>
<joey> afterwards as a memory, but I guess, </joey>
<connor> when you drink too much, you're like, okay, this is just- </connor>
<joey> - How many Bombay Sapphires is too many? </joey>
<joey> - I just thought, I was like, this is a lot. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, what's going on here? </joey>
<joey> I wonder, I was like, what a weird trash. </joey>
<connor> You ever see peoples' trash, and you think, what's going on? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. - What's going on with that? </joey>
<joey> - Many times. </joey>
<joey> I remember the weirdest one I saw was, </joey>
<joey> it was a vacuum cleaner that had been perfectly cut </joey>
<joey> in half down the middle. </joey>
<joey> I was like, how does that happen? </joey>
<connor> - Someone's like, damn, man, I just wanna see what's inside. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was a Dyson. </joey>
<connor> It was the body of a Dyson, </connor>
<joey> but it'd been perfectly split down the middle. </joey>
<joey> But there was only one half. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, where did the other half go? </joey>
<garnt> - Sounds like some serial killer shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was just one half? </garnt>
<joey> - It was only one half. </joey>
<joey> For five minutes, I was kinda looking around seeing. </joey>
<joey> I wonder where the other half is. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't find it. </joey>
<garnt> So he's either kept the other half, </garnt>
<garnt> or I've witnessed some crucial evidence </garnt>
<joey> of a crime scene or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what. - That's so specific. </joey>
<joey> - It was the weirdest thing. </joey>
<joey> At least, I was like, </joey>
<joey> oh, well, now I know what's inside of a Dyson. </joey>
<garnt> - That's something you'd see for a YouTube channel. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> What's inside of a Dyson? </joey>
<joey> - What's inside of a Dyson? </joey>
<garnt> What if I cut this Dyson in perfect half? </garnt>
<joey> - I just wanna know how they did it. </joey>
<joey> It's either someone has a laser cutter </joey>
<joey> inside of their house, </joey>
<joey> or they just went ham with a saw. </joey>
<connor> I don't know what it was. </connor>
<joey> - Either they have a saw in their house, </joey>
<joey> or it's somewhere else, </joey>
<joey> and then they brought half a Dyson </joey>
<joey> to your apartment building. </joey>
<connor> And then they decided that they are done with half a Dyson, </connor>
<connor> and they're gonna throw it away. </connor>
<joey> - It was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen. </joey>
<connor> - It's so annoying having to get rid of big stuff in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - You buy those stupid stickers from the company. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, you can't throw out, if it's bigger than, </garnt>
<joey> I think, 30 centimeters in my apartment. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, something like that. - Which is nothing. </joey>
<joey> There's so many things that are 30 centimeters or bigger. </joey>
<joey> And if you wanna throw it away, you have to book. </joey>
<joey> And it's normally like three weeks away if you're lucky. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, usually, it's like a month. </joey>
<joey> - Now I've figured out a genius strat, </joey>
<connor> which is just break the thing down to below 30 centimeters. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then you're good. </connor>
<connor> You know how, in prison movies, </connor>
<connor> when they escape from prison, </connor>
<joey> that they start dumping the soil one by one </joey>
<joey> in the courtyard or something? </joey>
<joey> It's like, all right, you gotta break this cabinet </joey>
<connor> into small pieces and slowly recycle it every week. </connor>
<garnt> - I saw that the other day actually. </garnt>
<connor> - People do it, because they don't wanna deal with... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause this shit is so annoying. </connor>
<connor> - Someone had disposed of an office chair </connor>
<connor> one part at a time. </connor>
<connor> - I get it, I get it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's so genius. </connor>
<connor> - I remember seeing, I would go take the garbage out, </connor>
<connor> and one day, I saw the bottom off, the wheels part. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, why is someone just getting rid </connor>
<connor> of the fucking wheels part? </connor>
<garnt> And then, the next week, I go to put the garbage again, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's the seat. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it's the seat. </garnt>
<garnt> Someone's just playing Jenga with office chairs. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, next week, lo and behold, it's the backrest. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's slow, but it's effective. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the exact reason why I bought a saw. </connor>
<connor> I am not kidding. </connor>
<connor> I bought a saw just to saw shit in half, </connor>
<connor> so I don't have to deal with this. </connor>
<connor> - I had a lot of wooden shit, and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> I'm not paying to get rid of this fucking wooden plank. </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna saw this bitch in half. </joey>
<joey> - It's also annoying, 'cause you have to measure it exactly. </joey>
<garnt> If it's even a little bit off, they won't take it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you gotta wait another three weeks </garnt>
<connor> and buy those stupid sticker things again. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna do this. </connor>
<connor> - I had a metallic coat hanger, </connor>
<garnt> or a coat rack kind of thing. </garnt>
<garnt> And of course, it was way too big, </garnt>
<garnt> even if I took the parts off. </garnt>
<garnt> So what did I do? </garnt>
<joey> I put it back up, I put it on my balcony, </joey>
<joey> and just let the weather wear it down as much as possible, </joey>
<joey> to the point where I could just snap it in half. </joey>
<connor> - You let it rust? </connor>
<connor> - I just let it rust to shit. </connor>
<joey> And then I grab the saw or just snap it half to the sides. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, perfect. </joey>
<garnt> - Just let nature take its course. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Erosion. </garnt>
<joey> - Three months later, I was like, </joey>
<connor> all right, I can finally take this out. </connor>
<connor> - It's the worst way to recycle something, </connor>
<connor> but I respect the effort you'd go </connor>
<connor> to not deal with the bureaucracy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, dude, it probably would've taken just as long </joey>
<joey> to fucking book a time </joey>
<joey> to throw this fucking coat hanger out. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I just don't wanna deal with it, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Or I just wait for someone to come over and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Do you want this shitty thing I don't need? </connor>
<joey> Just take it please." </joey>
<connor> - Dude, they make me feel like such a bastard </connor>
<connor> for using batteries. </connor>
<garnt> I just wanna use some AA batteries, </garnt>
<garnt> and they make it seem like I was using some kind </garnt>
<connor> of radioactive material the way they made me get rid of it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what's wrong with me? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think I've ever properly gotten rid </garnt>
<joey> of my batteries, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> okay, I'll get rid of them next time, another time. </joey>
<connor> So I have a fucking drawer just full of used- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Dead batteries? </connor>
<connor> - Used dead batteries that I've not been able </connor>
<connor> to get rid of, because I've always- </connor>
<connor> - That is the most troll drawer in existence. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Huh? </garnt>
<connor> - Sure, we've got a whole drawer full </connor>
<connor> of batteries sitting here. </connor>
<connor> Go and grab a pair. </connor>
<connor> None of them are working, Garnt! </connor>
<joey> - That's what you should do as a joke. </joey>
<joey> Just get one actually working battery </joey>
<joey> and put it in the drawer, and be like, </joey>
<joey> "There is one working battery." </joey>
<garnt> - Find the working battery. - Good luck. </garnt>
<connor> - Trash day special. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna get rid of it someday, </connor>
<connor> but I just keep forgetting the day </connor>
<garnt> to get rid of the batteries properly. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the most fucked up "Saw" trap. </joey>
<joey> There is one working battery. You have 15 minutes. </joey>
<garnt> - Find the working battery. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - I don't really use a lot of batteries, </connor>
<connor> but for a lot of the filming stuff that we have- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's basically all for the filming stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - It's all for mics, camera accessories. </connor>
<garnt> It's all batteries. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really annoying 'cause you have </garnt>
<garnt> to get batteries for that, and it kinda sucks. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, get rechargeable ones. </connor>
<connor> It's like, yeah, but I always forget to recharge. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but then if you get rechargeable ones, </garnt>
<garnt> you forget to recharge them before the shoots, </garnt>
<connor> which is unfortunate. </connor>
<connor> - And luckily, you can buy AAA batteries </connor>
<garnt> everywhere in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty good for that. </garnt>
<connor> It's pretty good. </connor>
<connor> Always done well. </connor>
<garnt> - Anything else you guys been up to this week? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just trying to think. </connor>
<connor> - I've watched anime. </connor>
<connor> I finished "Odd Taxi." </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you finished "Odd Taxi?" </connor>
<connor> That's surprising. </connor>
<garnt> Did you watch it in subbed or dubbed? </garnt>
<garnt> - Subbed, it was good, I liked it. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, nice. - Yeah? </connor>
<connor> - A very fun show. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how they're gonna make a movie. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, they are making a movie, aren't they? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was surprised when they announced </garnt>
<joey> that they were making a movie, </joey>
<connor> just because it felt like it just wrapped everything up. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, we're done, aren't we? </garnt>
<joey> - Also it weirdly seemed like, </joey>
<connor> I didn't think it was as popular on the surface- </connor>
<connor> - Did you watch it? - As it made it out to be. </connor>
<garnt> I watched it, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Did you finish it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - How have we never talked about this? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> I thought I told you I finished it. </joey>
<joey> - No, you didn't. </joey>
<joey> I would remember. </joey>
<joey> - It's because it's so rare. </joey>
<joey> - I would remember if you told me </joey>
<joey> you finished an anime, Joey. </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - I liked it. I thought it was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I liked it. It was good. </garnt>
<joey> But yeah, again, I was surprised, </joey>
<joey> not only because, yeah, as you said, </joey>
<joey> the show wrapped up nicely where it was like, </joey>
<joey> how are they gonna make a movie out of it? </joey>
<joey> But also, it's like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> I feel "Odd Taxi" was one of those shows </joey>
<joey> where it got really popular from word of mouth. </joey>
<joey> I was like, did it really get that popular </joey>
<joey> to warrant a movie? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know how popular it got, </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember when I made my video on it, </garnt>
<garnt> I made it 'cause no one was talking about it at all. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought it was kinda the underdog. </joey>
<connor> - Everyone who watches it I know likes it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's a great show. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing. </connor>
<joey> It's one of those shows where I feel you start watching it, </joey>
<joey> because someone who gave it a go was like, </joey>
<joey> "It was really fucking good." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like it had a similar arc to "Made in Abyss," </garnt>
<garnt> because when "Made in Abyss" came out, </garnt>
<joey> no one was watching "Made in Abyss" at all, </joey>
<joey> 'cause everyone saw the art style, </joey>
<joey> and everyone was just like, oh, this is a children's show. </joey>
<joey> - Children's show. </joey>
<joey> - Children's show, which couldn't be more further </joey>
<garnt> from the truth honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - There's a lot of children in the show. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah, it is a children's show </garnt>
<garnt> in some sense of the word. </garnt>
<connor> - That's one for the kids. </connor>
<connor> - One for the whole family. </connor>
<connor> - They can relate. The children can relate. </connor>
<joey> - The children can relate. </joey>
<joey> - The children can relate. </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, that was another show </garnt>
<garnt> that really spread through word of mouth, </garnt>
<garnt> and then eventually it won Anime of the Year </garnt>
<garnt> the year it came out as well. </garnt>
<garnt> "Odd Taxi," I feel, had a similar thing </garnt>
<garnt> where it didn't really have much promotion </garnt>
<garnt> or anything like that, </garnt>
<garnt> at least not that I could see outside of Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> In Japan, it actually had some kind of decent promotion. </garnt>
<joey> I remember, when it was airing, </joey>
<joey> every time you'd go in a taxi, </joey>
<joey> they would have an "Odd Taxi" advertisement. </joey>
<joey> - Did they really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, did you not see? </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't remember that. - No, I didn't see. </joey>
<joey> - They'd always have it playing </joey>
<joey> in the little TVs that they have on the back of the taxis. </joey>
<joey> - Did they? </joey>
<garnt> - At least I did. </garnt>
<joey> I saw a bunch of 'em. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't go in enough taxis to know. </connor>
<connor> - Did I talk about "Tokyo Revengers?" </connor>
<connor> I watched that. </connor>
<connor> - I think you- </connor>
<garnt> - You have not talked about "Tokyo Revengers." </garnt>
<joey> - Have we not? </joey>
<garnt> - Have we not? </garnt>
<joey> - Maybe not on episode. </joey>
<connor> - I was trying to watch all the animes of the year </connor>
<connor> that were nominated. </connor>
<garnt> - When did you get time to watch anime? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, an episode here and there. </connor>
<garnt> It's very sporadic. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh, "Sonny Boy" looks kind of shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you're not going to enjoy "Sonny Boy." </garnt>
<garnt> - I looked at it, and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, yeah, it's for those anime fans </garnt>
<joey> that think that they're really intelligent </joey>
<joey> and want something deep. </joey>
<joey> - Your IQ wasn't high enough. </joey>
<joey> - At the end of the day, they're just anime fans. </joey>
<joey> - I'll tell you who would enjoy "Sonny Boy." </joey>
<connor> I think you would really enjoy "Sonny Boy" actually. </connor>
<joey> - What, you're not the first person </joey>
<joey> to say that to me for some reason. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I should be offended. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, you shouldn't be. - There's a category of shows. </connor>
<connor> And to me, I took one look at "Sonny Boy," and I was like, </connor>
<connor> oh, this is what fucking Reddit anime fans </connor>
<connor> are gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> "This is the best anime of the year actually." </connor>
<joey> - I listened to two soundtrack songs from it, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, okay, </joey>
<joey> if the soundtrack is as good as the actual show, </joey>
<joey> I think I'm gonna enjoy this. </joey>
<connor> - I just cannot stand shows where I feel like people like it </connor>
<joey> just to be pretentious. </joey>
<garnt> And that's one of those shows </garnt>
<garnt> that I felt like the fans make me wanna not watch it </garnt>
<connor> and despise it more than the show. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I get that, I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't even know if I enjoyed "Sonny Boy." </garnt>
<joey> It's a really fucking weird show, </joey>
<joey> and it left an impression on me. </joey>
<joey> Whether I enjoyed it or not- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that sounds like something I would enjoy. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I watched it, and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> this is such a Joey show. </joey>
<connor> - What would you give it out of 10? </connor>
<joey> - I don't even fucking know. </joey>
<joey> - A five? </joey>
<garnt> - To me, it's still- - Five, four, three, two, one? </garnt>
<connor> - To me, it's still sinking in. </connor>
<connor> - What does that mean? </connor>
<connor> What does that fucking mean it's still... </connor>
<connor> What is it? </connor>
<connor> - I got the perfect analogy. </connor>
<garnt> Have you watched "Donnie Darko?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What did you think of it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I liked "Donnie Darko." </garnt>
<connor> - What did you like about it? </connor>
<joey> - Gosh, it's been so long. - Exactly! </joey>
<joey> - I remember I liked it. </joey>
<joey> It's been a very long time since I watched "Donnie Darko." </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, fuck, that's one of my favorite movies. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so it's kinda like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Can you watch it so that I don't feel bad </connor>
<garnt> about shitting on it? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause right now, I just feel </garnt>
<connor> like I'm shitting into the void. </connor>
<connor> - What, "Sonny Boy?" - It's like "86." </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, it's like "86." </connor>
<connor> When I shit on "86," I thought, </connor>
<connor> oh, no one's gonna contest me on this. </connor>
<connor> Turned out everyone got really- </connor>
<connor> - Meanwhile, the entire internet. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone got really fucking angry </connor>
<connor> that I didn't like "86." </connor>
<garnt> But to be fair, I watched eight episodes of that, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was boring as shit. </garnt>
<garnt> That's "86's" fault. </garnt>
<connor> - "Sonny Boy" is just 12? </connor>
<garnt> - "Sonny Boy" is just 12 episodes. </garnt>
<connor> Actually, 'cause I remember watching </connor>
<connor> the first three episodes of "Sonny Boy," </connor>
<connor> thought it was boring as fuck. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was boring as fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, if you think that, </garnt>
<connor> then, holy shit, I'm gonna be giga-bored. </connor>
<connor> - This is like fucking arthouse fucking pretentious shit. </connor>
<garnt> And then the soundtrack got recommended to me, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, holy fucking shit. </garnt>
<garnt> This soundtrack just is everything I want. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a lot of soft rock, alternative rock in the soundtrack. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, you've listened to some tracks. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, I kinda wanna watch this show </garnt>
<garnt> just 'cause of the soundtrack. </garnt>
<garnt> - I found it because I was buying a bunch of vinyls. </garnt>
<garnt> On the front page of the store, </garnt>
<garnt> the online store that I go to to buy my vinyls, </garnt>
<garnt> it just would not leave the front page. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, what is this "Sonny Boy" thing? </garnt>
<joey> So I went onto YouTube real quick, looked up one song, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, yep, sold. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right, right. </garnt>
<joey> - This is lit. </joey>
<joey> - The best thing I could say is the soundtrack </joey>
<joey> just sets the vibe of the anime. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Where it's less about the plot points, </joey>
<joey> and it's more about the feeling that it gives you. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you end up finishing it? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I did end up finishing it. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I finished it, </joey>
<joey> and I didn't know what to think about it. </joey>
<joey> I knew some of the ideas presented in "Sonny Boy," </joey>
<joey> it's one of those shows that you don't know </joey>
<joey> exactly what you think immediately, </joey>
<joey> but I just remember some scenes. </joey>
<joey> - So is it kinda like "FLCL" in that sense? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, kinda like "FLCL" </joey>
<joey> where is just like "FLCL," "Donnie Darko," that kinda thing, </joey>
<joey> where you watch it and you're like, </joey>
<joey> I don't really know what I watched, </joey>
<garnt> but some parts of it just really stick with you </garnt>
<connor> and just refuse to leave. </connor>
<connor> That's how I feel with "Sonny Boy." </connor>
<connor> - Do you think it deserves to be nominated </connor>
<connor> for an Anime of the Year? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think it deserved to be nominated </garnt>
<garnt> for Anime of the Year? </garnt>
<garnt> - Didn't it win the Reddit one though, the Reddit anime- </garnt>
<connor> - Of course, it did! </connor>
<joey> Arthouse pretentious type of anime? </joey>
<joey> - It won the Reddit's, not the user awards. </joey>
<joey> - No, the critics. </joey>
<joey> - The critic award. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god! </joey>
<joey> - Which does not help its image at all. </joey>
<joey> The Reddit armchair critics gave it the award </joey>
<garnt> for anime of the year. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate bashing on low-hanging fruit, but yeah, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> that is sometimes normally an indication where I'm like... </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean- </joey>
<garnt> - Whenever I say "Donnie Darko" is one </garnt>
<joey> of my favorite movies, I'm waiting for it. </joey>
<joey> I'm dangling the low-hanging fruit. </joey>
<connor> - We know it's normally Joey. </connor>
<joey> Joey's normally that guy in our podcast </joey>
<connor> who's the pretentious arthouse media guy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I am, I am. </connor>
<garnt> - With "Donnie Darko," did you like it immediately? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> I only liked it maybe after my second </joey>
<garnt> or third viewing of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was so young when I watched it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that was the problem. </garnt>
<garnt> When I first watched it, </garnt>
<garnt> I was maybe 13, 14 years old, right? </garnt>
<garnt> When you watch those kinds of movies at 13, 14, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't know what the fuck's going on. </garnt>
<garnt> All you think is, oh, creepy bunny, wow. </garnt>
<garnt> But then I watched it again when I was 17, 18, </garnt>
<garnt> which is the peak of pretentiousness </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to consuming media. </garnt>
<joey> - I definitely had that phase as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you understand "Donnie Darko?" </garnt>
<joey> - Only after I watched a fuck-load of analysis videos on it. </joey>
<garnt> I had a friend who recommended me "Donnie Darko" </garnt>
<garnt> during high school or middle school, </garnt>
<garnt> who was a massive fan of it. </garnt>
<garnt> He would tell me his theories on it, </garnt>
<garnt> and we would kinda bounce off ideas. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's the reason why I like </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of those kinds of media, because it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> especially when you have another person, </garnt>
<garnt> or a group of people to discuss it </garnt>
<garnt> and kinda theorize and hypothesize like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, this might be this, or this might be that, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> That's kind of fun. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, once you actually sit down </garnt>
<garnt> and read into what it's actually about, </garnt>
<garnt> according to the creator or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> then you just realize, oh, it's not as deep </garnt>
<joey> as all these fucking pretentious critics made it out to be. </joey>
<connor> - My favorite thing is when people speculate </connor>
<connor> about media and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And then the creator was like, "No, that's not it." </connor>
<connor> And then they're like, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> No, I don't think you understood what you did. </connor>
<garnt> I think it's actually this, sir. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally the "Evangelion" fan base. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the EVA. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally like, no, no! </garnt>
<connor> My theory is right please! </connor>
<connor> I think those anime don't appeal to me </connor>
<connor> as much unfortunately. </connor>
<garnt> - No, and I totally don't blame you. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it doesn't even appeal to me. </garnt>
<garnt> I have to be in a really specific mood </garnt>
<garnt> that comes along once a year or once every two years </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm just like, I just wanna watch something </garnt>
<garnt> and just not understand it </garnt>
<garnt> and make me feel things that are- </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, the thing I like about this podcast </connor>
<connor> is that the viewers can align who they trust's opinion </connor>
<garnt> on a show based on what type of media they like. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're more to me, and I'm like, I don't like "86," </garnt>
<garnt> you shouldn't then trust my opinion for other anime. </garnt>
<garnt> That show weirdly, people are obsessed with it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just didn't enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't know anything about the series. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know anyone was talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I just didn't like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think part of being a good critic, </garnt>
<joey> online at least, or part of being a good critic is, </joey>
<joey> acknowledging that you have tastes, </joey>
<joey> 'cause people look at people who talk about media online, </joey>
<joey> and they should be like, you should be able to judge </joey>
<joey> every single piece of media objectively, equally. </joey>
<joey> You should be able to judge them with no bias. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, that's completely bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you're not a fucking robot. </joey>
<joey> - When I look at, for example, Dunkey for example, </joey>
<joey> when I look at one of his video game reviews, </joey>
<garnt> I know exactly what his taste is. </garnt>
<garnt> And that gives me a better perspective </garnt>
<garnt> than a lot of fucking IGN reviewers, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because at least when Dunkey... </garnt>
<garnt> I think, recently, I saw his review </garnt>
<connor> of "Horizon: Forbidden West." </connor>
<connor> He didn't like completely- </connor>
<connor> - He shat on it. </connor>
<connor> He did shit on it. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, he shat on it. </connor>
<joey> Not completely compared to some JRPGs for example. </joey>
<joey> I saw his criticisms, and I was just like, wow. </joey>
<joey> I can completely understand why he feels this way. </joey>
<joey> Me, knowing what kind of gamer he is- </joey>
<joey> - I understand. </joey>
<joey> - I understand, and that gives me a better perspective </joey>
<joey> of what this game is like </joey>
<garnt> compared to a lot of other critics. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I would say the best critics online </joey>
<garnt> are the ones where you continue to keep watching </garnt>
<garnt> even though you disagree with most of their opinions, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause their opinion holds, </garnt>
<garnt> even though you don't agree with it, </garnt>
<garnt> they explain it, and they're articulate enough, </garnt>
<garnt> and they're honest enough with what they like, </garnt>
<garnt> and the fact that there's no way </garnt>
<joey> to completely get rid of bias with anything. </joey>
<joey> And they own that. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, well, I knew before coming into this review </joey>
<joey> that you were probably going to think </joey>
<joey> a certain way about it, </joey>
<joey> and I might not agree with it, </joey>
<joey> but I respect the fact that you can still stick to this. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> probably everything I like in a game </garnt>
<joey> Connor's gonna complain about. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> And vice versa probably, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, and vice versa, you know? </joey>
<joey> But that just comes with our taste in games. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and that's fine. </joey>
<garnt> - The same can be said about anime and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I cut you off there. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, I don't know what I was gonna even say. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, "Tokyo Revengers" was okay. </joey>
<joey> I really liked the first half, and then it got really shit. </joey>
<connor> - And now, he's gonna have "Tokyo Revengers" fans </connor>
<garnt> on his throat. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Tokyo Revengers" was... </garnt>
<garnt> I saw the first four episodes, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<connor> this is a read-the-manga show. </connor>
<connor> - I definitely felt that. </connor>
<garnt> - You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause there's a fight at the end. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you watched all of... </garnt>
<garnt> Anyone watched all of it here? </garnt>
<joey> - I watched the first two episodes. </joey>
<garnt> - There's this fight that goes on for fucking nine </garnt>
<garnt> or eight episodes at the end. </garnt>
<connor> And it is the dumbest fight I've ever seen in my life. </connor>
<joey> - That sounds like some Aizen shit, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - It is literally the fight of wait, there's more. </garnt>
<connor> Something happens, wait, there's more. </connor>
<garnt> Wait, there's more. </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, this is stupid. </connor>
<connor> Just fucking resolve it. </connor>
<connor> This is ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> This isn't "Dragon Ball." </connor>
<joey> - It's like every "Dragon Ball" fight. </joey>
<joey> - This story has been somewhat concise. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, they drag on a little bit here and there. </joey>
<joey> They have had some long fights, </joey>
<joey> but never more than four or five episodes, I think. </joey>
<connor> It just felt like this last fight in particular </connor>
<connor> just took the absolute piss </connor>
<connor> to the point where I was like, this is just stupid. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, it had a good cliffhanger. </connor>
<connor> I was so bored for four episodes. </connor>
<connor> - But it doesn't matter, man. </connor>
<joey> All the characters are hot as fuck. </joey>
<connor> According to the fan base, according to the fan base. </connor>
<joey> - They've got these characters. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, I like some of the characters in the show. </connor>
<connor> My god, are so many of them insufferable. </connor>
<connor> God, I mean, I liked the show. </connor>
<connor> I thought it was good. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, man, I felt like it blew its load, </connor>
<garnt> and it was making excuses. - Is it even over? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it even over? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, it's not. - It's not over, is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not, it's not. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like where they left it was pretty good, </garnt>
<garnt> and it might pick up. </garnt>
<connor> It just felt like every single time something happened, </connor>
<connor> it was like, oh my god, there's more. </connor>
<connor> Oh my god, there's more. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, I know this is gonna sound really unfair, </joey>
<joey> and this is totally my bias, </joey>
<joey> but I think I only managed to make it </joey>
<joey> through the first two or three episodes, </joey>
<garnt> because I immediately saw what kind of theming </garnt>
<garnt> they were going for with the story. </garnt>
<garnt> Just a bunch of dudes just fighting... </garnt>
<joey> - And it's weird as well. </joey>
<connor> - Good stuff, but I hate the fact </connor>
<joey> that the moment I knew where the story was heading, </joey>
<joey> in my head, I was immediately just like, </joey>
<joey> I'd just rather read "Baki" to be honest. </joey>
<joey> - I was kind of pissed off as well </joey>
<joey> that all of these kids are 13, 14. </joey>
<connor> I was like, why? </connor>
<connor> Just make them 17. </connor>
<joey> It would make the story so much more- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] But isn't it weird that you felt that- </joey>
<connor> - It would make so much more sense. </connor>
<joey> - But here's the thing. </joey>
<joey> Isn't it weird that you felt that about that show? </joey>
<joey> And yet, you see Hanayama Kaoru who's 14 years old, </joey>
<joey> and you're like, perfectly understandable, </joey>
<joey> have a nice day. </joey>
<connor> - For some reason, it checks out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right, it's so weird how it checks out though. </connor>
<joey> - I don't doubt it, right? </joey>
<connor> Because "Baki" never asks me once </connor>
<joey> to actually believe this world is a real world. </joey>
<joey> It just completely is like, listen, bro, </joey>
<garnt> this is literally like the equivalent </garnt>
<connor> of an internet forum debate where, can Goku beat Saitama? </connor>
<connor> That is "Baki." </connor>
<connor> It never once asks you to be invested in this world, </connor>
<joey> whereas "Tokyo Revengers," for me, </joey>
<joey> felt like it was trying to get me to get invested </joey>
<joey> in the gangs and the culture and stuff. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time, how are you gonna make me believe </joey>
<garnt> that this is how 13-year-olds and 14-year-olds react, </garnt>
<garnt> that they drive motorcycles, that they do all this shit, </garnt>
<connor> that they're willing to rob and kill each other. </connor>
<connor> If you made these kids 18, they can still be in school. </connor>
<garnt> All of this would still make sense. </garnt>
<connor> Just do that. </connor>
<garnt> Why? Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's basically 90% of anime, </garnt>
<connor> where they don't need to be that age, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause nobody their age actually acts like them. </garnt>
<connor> - This is one where I actually felt </connor>
<connor> like it was to a massive detriment </connor>
<joey> that they were super young. </joey>
<joey> Every single plot point in the story- </joey>
<joey> - Because it just made it unbelievable, right? </joey>
<joey> - Not so unbelievable, but it made it so to the fact </joey>
<garnt> that it's constantly asking you </garnt>
<garnt> to just have this level of disbelief, to give it, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, I guess this is how 14-year-olds would react </garnt>
<garnt> and respond to this situation. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, just add on four years. </garnt>
<garnt> They're still in school. </garnt>
<connor> This can work in college. </connor>
<connor> It all still works. </connor>
<connor> The universe totally works. </connor>
<joey> - It can work when you're an adult as well. </joey>
<garnt> - And now they can ride motorcycles no question about it. </garnt>
<garnt> This is in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> No one is breaking the law in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> People don't even like... </garnt>
<garnt> The only law they break is stealing umbrellas. </garnt>
<garnt> That's literally it, that's all they do. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't do nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all they do. - Pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, pretty much. </garnt>
<connor> - How the fuck are they gonna get a motorcycle at 13 here? </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like, the last time I felt that, </garnt>
<garnt> when I felt like the characters </garnt>
<connor> just weren't acting their age at all, </connor>
<connor> was when I watched "Erased." </connor>
<connor> - I was gonna say, I knew- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - "Erased" was just like... </joey>
<joey> Man, these five-year-olds. </joey>
<joey> How old were they, five, six? </joey>
<joey> - They were eight. - They were nine, I think. </joey>
<garnt> - They're nine-year-olds acting like- </garnt>
<connor> - They're like, yes, using the forms of relativity </connor>
<garnt> and quantum mechanics, we can actually predict </garnt>
<connor> when we will reenter into space-time continuum. </connor>
<joey> - They were more capable than veteran detectives </joey>
<joey> in the force and all this shit. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, bruh, these are nine-year-olds, </joey>
<garnt> and they're acting like fucking adults. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I just couldn't get into "Erased." </joey>
<joey> It's the exact same thing where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> this nine-year-old girl is solving mysteries </joey>
<connor> that fucking 30-year veterans couldn't fucking crack. </connor>
<connor> - I know we've ranted about this before and stuff. </connor>
<joey> We've talked all about the age and stuff. </joey>
<joey> I do understand that, a lot of shows, I don't give a fuck. </joey>
<joey> It's totally fine. </joey>
<joey> - It's fiction, it's whatever. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't matter. </joey>
<joey> But again, there are some shows like "Erased" </joey>
<joey> where I feel like doing this is just completely </joey>
<garnt> to the detriment of the show. </garnt>
<connor> And it makes you suspend belief beyond reasonable doubt. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, and this was one of the shows </garnt>
<connor> where I'm like, this is just stupid. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, there's also "Your Lie in April" as well, </connor>
<garnt> where a big thing that took me out of the show </garnt>
<garnt> is I feel like they were in middle school or something. </garnt>
<garnt> I think they're 14, 15. </garnt>
<joey> Everyone talks like a fucking poet. </joey>
<garnt> - The writing needs to match the age. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't give a shit if you put 'em in the school. </joey>
<connor> You've gotta write 13-year-olds like 13-year-olds. </connor>
<garnt> - Kosei was talking like fucking Mozart was back then. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, dude, you're 15. </garnt>
<connor> When I was 15, all I was thinking about poo-poo, pee-pee. </connor>
<connor> - That's all I think about now. I'm 25. </connor>
<joey> - That's all I think about now. </joey>
<joey> You are way more sophisticated </joey>
<garnt> than you should be for a 15-year-old. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, this guy came out the womb </garnt>
<garnt> speaking in sonnets and all this shit. </garnt>
<joey> He was studying Shakespeare by the age of three. </joey>
<joey> My god, that took me out so much. </joey>
<joey> It was a small thing, but it was just like, </joey>
<joey> you could've easily made them at a higher age </joey>
<garnt> to make them feel like they had the ability </garnt>
<garnt> to speak like this. </garnt>
<garnt> They were 14 years old. </garnt>
<connor> That was the biggest thing that worried. </connor>
<connor> - It's annoying. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes, it's shows where they write </connor>
<connor> the characters like 17-year-olds. </connor>
<connor> They act and talk like 17-year-olds. </connor>
<connor> They behave like 17-year-olds. </connor>
<connor> Why not just make them fucking 17-year-olds? </connor>
<joey> - That's why I think, to this day, </joey>
<joey> the most perfect example of a perfectly aged, </joey>
<joey> a character's acting age appropriate </joey>
<joey> in a super realistic way, was "Golden Time." </joey>
<joey> Because it was like, they were in college, </joey>
<joey> and yet they were super immature </joey>
<joey> like most college students are. </joey>
<joey> That's a realistic character. - I like that show. </joey>
<joey> - I love "Golden Time." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and that's why that show was so good, </joey>
<joey> and it was so immersive, because it's like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I know people who are like this in college. </joey>
<connor> - You're such a breath of fresh air </connor>
<joey> to have it set in college. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but they were acting more like high school students </joey>
<joey> than most high school students were in other shows. </joey>
<garnt> It's so fucking ironic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like that's why, to me even now, </garnt>
<garnt> "Golden Time" is one of my favorite romances- </garnt>
<joey> - I love "Golden Time." - In all of anime. </joey>
<joey> Just because it actually felt </joey>
<garnt> like these were believable characters set in a world </garnt>
<garnt> that felt like it was based in reality, </garnt>
<joey> not in this anime world where 15-year-olds- </joey>
<joey> - 15-year-olds are doing quantum physics. </joey>
<joey> - 15-year-olds are doing quantum physics. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, you look at fucking Naruto and Sasuke, they- </garnt>
<connor> - "Hunter x Hunter" was another one </connor>
<connor> where I felt like they got the characters' ages, </connor>
<garnt> it actually reflected their personality. </garnt>
<garnt> Gon was an idiot. </garnt>
<connor> He would be convinced to do stuff by strangers. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Like a 12-year-old- - Like a child. </connor>
<connor> - Like a 13-year-old, unfortunately. </connor>
<connor> No one over the age of 18 is hanging out with Hisoka, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Let's be honest. </connor>
<connor> - For good reason. </connor>
<connor> - [All] For a good reason. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause everyone could tell you he's a creep. </joey>
<garnt> But Gon is like- - For their own protection. </garnt>
<connor> - Gon's like, oh, he's talking to me. </connor>
<connor> Okay, I'll talk back. </connor>
<connor> I appreciate it when shows actually treat </connor>
<connor> the characters like their age. </connor>
<joey> It pissed me off. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause a lot of people, for example, Naruto, </joey>
<joey> a lot of people forget that, in the OG "Naruto,"- </joey>
<joey> - He's 10. </joey>
<joey> - They're 11 and 12 years old. </joey>
<joey> You look at some of the shit they go through. </joey>
<garnt> Sasuke is trying to revenge his entire fucking clan </garnt>
<garnt> at the age of 11. </garnt>
<garnt> 11! </garnt>
<joey> He's doing that, right? </joey>
<joey> - This man's listened to too much My Chemical Romance, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - Right, right, right. </garnt>
<joey> - Get off that shit, and go to fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - I'll avenge my fucking Big Mac </joey>
<connor> if someone slaps it out of my hand when I'm 11. </connor>
<connor> So I believe that actually. </connor>
<connor> I was a very petty 11-year-old. </connor>
<joey> - Most realistic character. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> I just kinda wish that it would change a little bit. </joey>
<joey> And that was one of the main reasons </joey>
<garnt> why I was a bit harsh on "Tokyo Revengers." </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I got more annoyed with it, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it felt like it was just getting stupid right there. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know if I've just seen so much anime </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm just immune to this shit. </garnt>
<joey> It's very rare that a character's age really comes </joey>
<joey> into any kind of specific plot point </joey>
<joey> or any bearing on the plot itself. </joey>
<joey> It's so hard to tell a character's age in anime </joey>
<garnt> based on just their looks and their actions, </garnt>
<garnt> because the range of anime characters from 13 to fucking 28, </garnt>
<joey> they all look the same, </joey>
<joey> and they all act the same. - They act the same, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's kinda like Japanese people in real life, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe that's why! </garnt>
<joey> Maybe that's why! - That's probably why. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - They turn to adults- </joey>
<joey> - You look at a Japanese girl, </joey>
<joey> and you're like, you can be 12 or 30. </joey>
<joey> And I'm kind of afraid to ask. </joey>
<joey> - Did you see, as well, for the "Tokyo Revengers," </joey>
<joey> they made an uncensored version? </joey>
<joey> Because they used the temple symbol a lot, </joey>
<joey> which is unfortunately is- </joey>
<joey> - A manji? - A swastika turned. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Really unfortunate, and then they just- </joey>
<joey> - They had to censor that? </joey>
<joey> - They made a censored version- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, damn. - Where they just don't use </joey>
<connor> the symbol much. - 'Cause it's in the title. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's weird. </garnt>
<connor> In some ways, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I mean, I feel like they didn't need to do that, </connor>
<connor> but I also kinda get it, why they wanted to be careful. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I can see why they did that. </garnt>
<joey> It's unfortunate, but I mean, </joey>
<joey> with how international anime is now, </joey>
<joey> a lot of people could've taken it the wrong way, </joey>
<garnt> because they don't have- </garnt>
<connor> - Also, it may be a good moment </connor>
<joey> to learn about another culture. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right, be like, why are they using that? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you'd be like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna Google, is this okay? </connor>
<connor> And then you see it. </connor>
<connor> To me, when I first saw it, I was like, whoa. </connor>
<connor> And then you Google it, and you're like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's only been a symbol that's been around for, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, 3,000 years. </garnt>
<joey> - It's been a lot longer, yeah, it's very unfortunate. </joey>
<garnt> - Didn't they censor it in "Naruto" as well? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember Neji's clan symbol </garnt>
<garnt> that he had on his forehead or something </garnt>
<garnt> was originally based on that, I believe. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. - There's a lot of shows </joey>
<joey> that I think use those symbols. </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah, 'cause it means- </connor>
<joey> - It means peace. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, peace, oddly enough. - Yeah, it means peace. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's Buddhist, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's very unfortunate, the dichotomy of the meanings. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Oh, no, Neji has a cross. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it's a cross? Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Unless that's the censored version. </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, is that the anime version or the manga version? </garnt>
<joey> - [Ashley] It was the anime version. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so- </garnt>
<joey> - So the manga version might've had it. </joey>
<garnt> - What was the manga version of that? </garnt>
<connor> - [Ashley] Let me check. </connor>
<connor> - So they made a whole version where they added it, </connor>
<connor> and then a whole 'nother version </connor>
<connor> where they just went through and got rid of it. </connor>
<connor> Really odd. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Nevermind all the violence. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like, if you're just gonna get rid of it, </connor>
<joey> just get rid of it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, right. </joey>
<connor> - It's not gonna be that big of a deal. </connor>
<joey> - Here's the uncensored one </joey>
<joey> for you cultured individuals out there. </joey>
<joey> - Cultured? </joey>
<joey> - Actually cultured in a different religion. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Yeah, so in the manga, </joey>
<joey> it was literally the manji sign. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I thought, that's what I thought. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Ashley] That's in the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I get it, if you wanna avoid the misunderstanding. </garnt>
<joey> - I get it, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Have the awkward, guys, we promise, look it up. </joey>
<joey> - We promise, not a Nazi. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] It's the same thing </joey>
<joey> with the Google Maps issue though. </joey>
<joey> They changed the manji sign. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, because on Google Maps, </joey>
<joey> they use that symbol to mean temple. </joey>
<connor> - I have that on mine. </connor>
<garnt> I have an English Google Maps. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, really? - Yeah, it's there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, it's on there for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe on the other languages? </garnt>
<joey> I swear to God, on my Google Maps in English, </joey>
<connor> I still see the symbol. </connor>
<joey> - [Ashley] Because it was an issue a couple of years back, </joey>
<joey> because it was like, what is this on the Google Maps? </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe if you're not in Japan, and you search </garnt>
<connor> up Japanese places. - I feel like it's on </connor>
<connor> the person who comes to Japan to educate themselves. </connor>
<joey> - Kind of. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because they're the ones </connor>
<joey> that're gonna throw a hissy fit and look like an idiot. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I understand it's a very unfortunate thing, </connor>
<joey> obviously, with whom Japan allied themselves with. </joey>
<connor> I can understand why the mistake might be made. </connor>
<joey> - It's scary how 45 degrees changes everything. </joey>
<joey> It's just a slight shift, </joey>
<joey> just completely changes everything. </joey>
<joey> - The power of 45 degrees. </joey>
<joey> - The power of angles. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> The powers of angles, dude, scary. </garnt>
<joey> - You either want peace, </joey>
<joey> or you want something that's definitely not that. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely the opposite of peace. </joey>
<joey> - [Ashley] Buddhism, I took a class on this, </joey>
<joey> Buddhism doesn't actually distinguish </joey>
<joey> between the orientation </joey>
<joey> and which direction the swastika is facing. </joey>
<joey> So technically, all of them mean the same. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, I mean, most people wouldn't know that though. </joey>
<joey> - Obviously, when I saw it, I didn't feel like, </joey>
<garnt> oh my god, what is this? </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, oh, what don't I know? </garnt>
<garnt> Clearly, I'm missing context. </garnt>
<connor> I would like to be educated. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> I felt exactly the same way. </connor>
<joey> I was just like, it's weird seeing that symbol, </joey>
<joey> but I'm sure they would not be- </joey>
<connor> - There's a good reason for that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure they wouldn't be putting that symbol </connor>
<garnt> if there wasn't a reason for that. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sure these 13-year-olds, this gang, is not into that. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I mean. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I know that's a gang. </connor>
<garnt> - See, if only everyone on the internet thought, </garnt>
<connor> had rational thinking like that, you know? </connor>
<connor> And instead, it was immediately like, oh no, how dare you! </connor>
<joey> - We've said it a number of times. </joey>
<joey> People aren't willing to give </joey>
<joey> the benefit of the doubt to people anymore. </joey>
<connor> That's gone out the window in the year 2022. </connor>
<garnt> - Also, they forget that different cultures </garnt>
<garnt> have different backgrounds and histories a lot of the times. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what's strange is that people don't really </connor>
<connor> wanna give benefit of the doubt to the country </connor>
<garnt> or even hide behind their country's flaws </garnt>
<garnt> when it's convenient for them. </garnt>
<garnt> But when they don't understand something, </garnt>
<joey> they're like, oh, well, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - They should've explained it better. </joey>
<garnt> - Anyway, keeping on anime, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, since I finally get to talk about anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Go on. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't actually watch much anime this previous season, </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't think there was actually much good things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, god, don't say that. </garnt>
<connor> Everyone would get angry. </connor>
<joey> There's no good anime last season. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, have you not learned my lesson? </joey>
<joey> - 2021, well, I think 2022 he's been a pretty weak year </joey>
<garnt> for anime so far. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess the only real recommendation I would have, </garnt>
<garnt> since you were going through last year, </garnt>
<garnt> is "Ranking of Kings." </garnt>
<connor> - That's literally the last one </connor>
<garnt> I've been meaning to watch of last year, </garnt>
<connor> and then I'm done with last year. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's continuing onto this year. </joey>
<joey> Last year was, I mean, it's a 23-episode show. </joey>
<connor> So last year, we only had 12 episodes. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I mean, I guess I'll just wait then. </connor>
<connor> - Just wait till it's finished? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's almost finished. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's only gonna be a part one of the story. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, "Ranking of Kings" is fucking incredible. </connor>
<connor> - I've heard it's amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like, unironically, </connor>
<connor> a lot of people, like "Made in Abyss," didn't watch it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it looked like a children's cartoon. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it looked badass. </garnt>
<garnt> - I also didn't watch it, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it looked like a children's cartoon initially, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's kind of like, </garnt>
<joey> it's kinda like the closest thing to a Ghibli movie, </joey>
<joey> I guess, in terms of aesthetic. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it looked beautiful. - And feeling. </joey>
<joey> I really don't like Ghibli movies, </joey>
<joey> but it kinda gave me that kind of... </joey>
<joey> You know when you're watching an anime fairy tale </joey>
<joey> that kinda feels like- - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I can only point to Ghibli </joey>
<garnt> that gives you that same kinda feeling, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's the kind of feeling it's giving me. </garnt>
<garnt> But it also is written really, really fucking well. </garnt>
<garnt> It's been a while since I've seen just an anime </garnt>
<garnt> just this well written </garnt>
<garnt> and with characters this interesting as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Damn. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me, the spring season, </garnt>
<garnt> no, sorry, the winter season, </garnt>
<garnt> was basically "Attack on Titan" and "Demon Slayer." </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone was talking about that. </garnt>
<garnt> To me, "Ranking of Kings" is close to that level </garnt>
<garnt> of quality, in my opinion, </garnt>
<garnt> of just how good the show is. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean, there's also "My Dress-Up Darling" as well. </joey>
<garnt> - There was also "My Dress-Up Darling." </garnt>
<joey> That occupies a different space in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> - That's a different faction, I feel. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a different faction. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, true, true, true. </joey>
<joey> There's the "Attack of Titan" "Demon Slayer" core, </joey>
<garnt> and then the fucking "My Dress-Up Darling" </garnt>
<garnt> all the way over here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It was surprising to see, in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> "Ranking of Kings" has really shot up in popularity. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's the most watched anime right now. </garnt>
<joey> - It's because there's a lot of voice actors </joey>
<garnt> who are saying how good it is. </garnt>
<garnt> They're all like, "Yeah, this is really fucking good." </garnt>
<garnt> - Voice actors have a lot of power here. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they do, I mean. </joey>
<joey> - They're top-tier celebrities here. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, they're not even just voice actors here. </garnt>
<joey> They're just actors with- </joey>
<joey> - Celebrities. </joey>
<garnt> - They're just gone to celebrity status as well. </garnt>
<joey> - And that's why they can make questionable decisions </joey>
<garnt> like Hanazawa Kana selling NFTs, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh, god. </garnt>
<joey> - I saw that, and I was like, this has to be a joke. </joey>
<garnt> And then I watched the video- - Please say psych. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, please say psych, Hana Kana, please. </connor>
<joey> - And I saw a lot of people that were like, </joey>
<connor> no, no, no, I'm sure it's just her management. </connor>
<joey> I'm sure it's just her management. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, yeah, but- </joey>
<joey> - But she agreed to it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, someone has to give the go ahead. </joey>
<connor> Even if it is her management's idea or whatever- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, she might have a management, </joey>
<connor> but she's allowed to say no. </connor>
<connor> - I love that. </connor>
<connor> No one ever uses that excuse </connor>
<connor> for Western celebrities or anything. </connor>
<connor> It's always with the Japanese celebrities. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that only implies to kind of low ranking talent </connor>
<connor> who maybe where the management has a little more power, </connor>
<joey> because we're giving you this one. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, the big ones don't have that. </joey>
<connor> - Hana Kana is literally top 1% of voice actors. </connor>
<connor> She can say no to whatever the fuck she wants. </connor>
<garnt> - She don't need no NFTs. - And yet, she said yes </garnt>
<joey> to the NFTs. </joey>
<garnt> - She takes any role she wants. </garnt>
<joey> - She can do any role she wants. </joey>
<joey> If she says, "I wanna be in this anime," </joey>
<joey> the directors will be scrambling over themselves </joey>
<connor> to be like, yes, let's get Hana Kana in this. </connor>
<joey> The whole management thing is just bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - NFTs, no. </joey>
<connor> - That is just Hana Kana fans in denial </connor>
<garnt> of the fact that she's promoting NFTs. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is just her fans snorting pure Copium. </garnt>
<connor> I've never seen so much Copium. </connor>
