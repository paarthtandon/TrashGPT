<joey> - Have you ever cry wanked? </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I don't dare try, to mix the... </connor>
<connor> - We know how easy it is for you. </connor>
<joey> - He hasn't read metamorphosis. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Read metamorphosis you'll know the definition </joey>
<joey> of a cry wank. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - Welcome back to this episode of "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> that you just joined, </connor>
<connor> so now welcome back, </connor>
<connor> with my boys, (Joey laughing) Joey and Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - Welcome to this episode of "Trash Taste". </garnt>
<connor> - Welcome back, I'm sure you... </connor>
<joey> - Welcome back to "Trash Taste". </joey>
<connor> - As you should with every "Trash Taste" episode, </connor>
<connor> you should go and watch the previous episodes in order, </connor>
<connor> without breaking them then come to this one. </connor>
<garnt> - We have a watch order, it goes one, </garnt>
<garnt> then two, (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> then three. </garnt>
<connor> - Whoo controversial. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - Are you gate keeping (Gigguk laughing) this? </connor>
<connor> - What if I wanna watch episode four </connor>
<joey> and then go back to episode one? </joey>
<joey> - Bro you're not a real fan (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> You got to start from part one, </connor>
<garnt> and then part two all the way to part 20. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I watch halfway through part three. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sorry, I'm sorry Joey. </connor>
<garnt> - You're a real fan, if you see me over here, </garnt>
<garnt> a special episodes, then we know if you're a real fan. </garnt>
<joey> - If you don't know what we're talking about, </joey>
<joey> don't worry about it. </joey>
<connor> - Sorry Joey. - [Host] This is bullshit. </connor>
<joey> - What are we talking about today? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, what we're gonna talk about today Joey? </joey>
<joey> - We hardly ever know what we're gonna talk about </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like we have a few ideas we want to do </garnt>
<garnt> but we'll save the special ones coming up. </garnt>
<connor> But, I mean yesterday, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna tell you a little story boys. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, yeah, for it's Connor's Story Time, </joey>
<connor> it's getting graphic </connor>
<connor> - Connor's Story Time. </connor>
<garnt> - I went to the DMV. </garnt>
<connor> - Gathered around the camp, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) This is already sounding horrible. </connor>
<connor> - This is not a campfire stories. </connor>
<garnt> - This is already sound horrible </garnt>
<garnt> - So as you guys know, </garnt>
<connor> none of us have the ability to drive in Japan, </connor>
<connor> but we all have the licenses in our own respective country. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - And I thought well, one of us needs to do it, I'll do it. </connor>
<connor> I like driving, Garnt hates driving </connor>
<connor> and Joey is just Joey. </connor>
<connor> So Joey just stands there being like, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to do that. </connor>
<connor> Joey doesn't want to spend a whole day at a DMV. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - (laughs) And more probably - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - My relationship with driving is that </connor>
<connor> it's literally serves a purpose. </connor>
<garnt> Like I don't care if I can get from point A to point B </garnt>
<garnt> in a way that's like other than driving </garnt>
<garnt> or someone else can drive me. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't care if I have to drive, I'll fucking do it but-- </garnt>
<connor> - I can afford an Uber now. </connor>
<connor> - I'm convinced that you wanted to become a rich person </connor>
<garnt> just to get a chauffer (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> that's like, eventually. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the dream right? - That's the dream. </connor>
<connor> Okay, like okay I don't hate driving, </connor>
<connor> what I hate is parking. </connor>
<connor> My gods, like I can. </connor>
<connor> - Just like at all? </connor>
<connor> - The thought of parking, </connor>
<connor> yes 'cause I suck at parking, Okay? </connor>
<garnt> I barely passed my test </garnt>
<garnt> when it came to like parallel parking. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) The thoughts of parallel parking </joey>
<garnt> gives me nightmares. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I wake up in a cold sweat and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> what if the car doesn't fit? </garnt>
<garnt> I'd make a fool of myself, </garnt>
<garnt> like spending 10 minutes trying to get into the slot, </garnt>
<garnt> but (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because everyone's been on the other end, right? </garnt>
<joey> Where you're trying to watch someone parallel park </joey>
<connor> and it's like, come on, it's not that hard. </connor>
<connor> And then when you actually go to do it's like, </connor>
<joey> oh, it's that hard (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I somehow nail like the hard parking </connor>
<connor> and then take 15 attempts for the shittiest easiest parking, </connor>
<connor> when there's like a 100 people around me </connor>
<connor> just watching me like really embarrassing. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I wanted to get my license </connor>
<joey> 'cause you know, I wanted to have the options open. </joey>
<joey> So I feel like you can still explore </joey>
<joey> a lot of Japan without a car. </joey>
<joey> - [Host] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just some places, you know the further I... </joey>
<joey> - Once you're outside of Tokyo, you pretty much need a car. </joey>
<joey> - Becomes a little more difficult </joey>
<joey> especially if you wanna really explore a lot. </joey>
<connor> Like if you want to stick to the main tourist stuff, </connor>
<garnt> there's this buses and stuff and you'll be fine, </garnt>
<garnt> but I wanted to drive and I mean, nothing goes better </garnt>
<connor> with my Beep Boop Daft Punk music than driving. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) I love driving with music man, </connor>
<connor> it's so like smacking that wheel, you know. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Smacking that wheel is like, you're like a fucking, </connor>
<joey> you are like a dad. - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> And I love it, I love all of it. </joey>
<connor> So I thought, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I'm going to get my license, </connor>
<connor> 'cause if you have a British license in Japan </connor>
<connor> and a select few of the countries, a lot of European ones, </connor>
<connor> they said like America, but only Hawaii and Alaska. </connor>
<connor> It was like, so only Hawaii and Alaska can do it. </connor>
<connor> If you're from any of the countries </connor>
<joey> where you don't, from those countries, </joey>
<joey> you have to do a test. </joey>
<joey> - Why Hawaii and Alaska? </joey>
<joey> - I have no idea, I don't think it was Hawaii or Alaska, </joey>
<joey> it was Alaska and some other country, some other state. </joey>
<joey> Which is really confusing, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm pretty sure don't they all drive </joey>
<joey> on the same side of the road? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I thought so, right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause the reason why American. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe there something we don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause the reason why Americans </connor>
<connor> have to do a driving test is because </connor>
<connor> we drive on the other side of the road, right? </connor>
<joey> But Alaska drive on the same side of the road as Japan? </joey>
<connor> Alaskans let us know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I had to go to the DMV </connor>
<connor> and I knew it was going to be a stressful process, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it always is with any driving. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's just universal </connor>
<garnt> but I can only imagine how stressful it is in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) because the extra layers you have to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, because you're like, </garnt>
<connor> it was already hell in my own country, </connor>
<connor> it's probably gonna be hell again in Japan, times two. </connor>
<joey> And I have to take a translator with me. </joey>
<joey> Which is so awful. - I'm so glad </joey>
<joey> the translator was not me (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I was gonna ask Joey, but then another friend offered </connor>
<joey> and I'm like. </joey>
<joey> - But then I was like oh, you ended up at DMV? </joey>
<joey> Sorry I'm busy, I'm busy that day, I got caught, my bad man. </joey>
<connor> - So first I gonna ask, how long were you there for? </connor>
<joey> - I got there at 8:20 in the morning. </joey>
<joey> - Why so early? </joey>
<joey> Is it your line off? - So </joey>
<joey> Yes, so right now, </joey>
<joey> because I'm not sure if it's because of COVID, </joey>
<garnt> but right now only 10 people are allowed </garnt>
<garnt> to get a foreign license a day, </garnt>
<garnt> in the whole prefecture. - Wow, what? </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's like first come first serve. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so whoever serve first, gets it. </garnt>
<garnt> If you don't, you have to come back at 2:30 and wait </garnt>
<joey> but they give out the 2:30 slots </joey>
<joey> at the 9:00 a.m - [Host] In the morning. </joey>
<joey> so I was in the 2:30 slot. </joey>
<joey> - Oh shit! - Jesus! </joey>
<garnt> - So I got, I queued up at 8:20. </garnt>
<connor> I was told, on the website it says 9:30, </connor>
<connor> get there at 9:30. </connor>
<connor> And then I called them up and I asked, </connor>
<connor> hey what time should I get that? </connor>
<connor> They said, get that for like eight, </connor>
<connor> so I got there at 8:20 because I thought, </connor>
<connor> oh it's no one's gonna be there. </connor>
<connor> There was already like 14 people lined up when I got there, </connor>
<connor> so I was in the second bunch. </connor>
<connor> So they only give out 10 licenses a day, </connor>
<connor> in the whole prefecture, which is like millions of people, </connor>
<connor> for foreigners and it's like, what? </connor>
<connor> How is this a thing? </connor>
<connor> Why only 10? </connor>
<connor> Like they issue the first 10 like I go home. </connor>
<joey> - At least it wasn't like the bullshit like you know, </joey>
<connor> you know when they did like </connor>
<connor> a Gotcha Game and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Here's a ticket and if you win the ticket, </connor>
<connor> you have a chance to get it. </connor>
<connor> - Wow, wow, you'll see well, </connor>
<connor> I'll tell you more about the story. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, go on. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like an hour away from me. </connor>
<connor> So I have to get up at like 6:00 AM </connor>
<connor> which is way over my like comfort zone. </connor>
<connor> I can wake up at eight and be fine. </connor>
<garnt> - Like anything before 7:30. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like shit the whole day. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I get that and we line up </garnt>
<connor> and then I have to wait an hour to get my ticket. </connor>
<connor> So I have to wait an hour to wait more. </connor>
<connor> So then I went to Coco's Diner, </connor>
<connor> which is like Coco's Richmond, </connor>
<joey> I think. - [Host] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Went there, stayed there for three and a half hours. </joey>
<joey> - [Host] Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - Came back to the place, waited another hour. </joey>
<joey> Finally got to go in. </joey>
<joey> As I'm going in, this couple is like screaming </joey>
<joey> at the employees. </joey>
<joey> - [Hosts] Right. </joey>
<connor> - Like what the fuck or something in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> I remembered some of it from anime. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) They were saying in the bad anime words. </connor>
<connor> I was like, that's a nappy I was like, </connor>
<connor> what happened it's like, </connor>
<connor> apparently didn't have the right documents. </connor>
<connor> But before we went in, </connor>
<connor> they gathered us all around and were like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey some of you are gonna be rejected today for no reason." </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> They literally said that. </connor>
<connor> They said. - What? </connor>
<connor> - They said, "We might reject you and not explain why." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> - What is the issued demonetization? </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<connor> - What do you mean, I've come here all day. </connor>
<connor> And you've to bring like so many fucking documents. </connor>
<connor> So you have to get like your license translated </connor>
<connor> at a different building, wait a few days for that. </connor>
<connor> Go to the ward office, which is another building, </connor>
<connor> get proof that you live where you say you live. </connor>
<connor> - [Hosts] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Bring your other license, your passport, </connor>
<connor> literally every single documentation </connor>
<connor> that you were ever a person to begin with. </connor>
<connor> And yeah and then they grilled me for like an hour, </connor>
<garnt> like asking me if I-- - Asking what? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well they so a part to get the foreign license </garnt>
<joey> you have to prove that you are in the country </joey>
<joey> where you got your license for six months after the fact. </joey>
<joey> So I brought tons of paperwork, </joey>
<joey> proving that I was in the U.K at the time when I got it </joey>
<joey> in for six months. </joey>
<joey> And they just kept grilling me </joey>
<connor> and asking me pointless questions, what I thought. </connor>
<connor> But they asked like, </connor>
<connor> "Did you have like a provisional license? </connor>
<connor> Which in the U.K and I think in America as well. </connor>
<connor> Australia too. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You got a license before the actual license. </connor>
<connor> They're like, did you have one? </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, obviously I had one, I had to drive. </joey>
<garnt> - Who doesn't? - What a dumb question. </garnt>
<connor> - Part of the official process, </connor>
<connor> you need a provisional before you get a full license. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think a lot of countries would let you </garnt>
<connor> get the full thing without doing it and I said. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll speak about Thailand. </garnt>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So I'm like, yeah of course I had that. </connor>
<garnt> And then they're like, </garnt>
<connor> "How long did it take you to get your license" </connor>
<connor> What do you mean how long? </connor>
<connor> Did it take like a week </connor>
<connor> or did you do lessons over a long time? </connor>
<connor> I was like, I did lessons over a long time. </connor>
<connor> Then they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, how long did you have that provisional form?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why are you ask? </connor>
<connor> Who cares? </connor>
<joey> Who cares how long? </joey>
<joey> - You got the full license? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I'm like, I had it for five years. </connor>
<connor> And she was like (snorts) </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then she asked, "why did you have it for so long?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, why does it matter how long like? </connor>
<connor> Because in the U.K, we don't have ID. </connor>
<connor> We don't carry around ID. </connor>
<connor> So most people will get the provisional license </connor>
<connor> even if they don't intend to drive. </connor>
<garnt> So I'm here explaining like a cultural difference to her. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, so what did you say? </garnt>
<garnt> - I explained that I'm like in the U.K, </garnt>
<connor> we don't really have ID, so people will get the ID. </connor>
<joey> - But that's what Japanese people do as well. </joey>
<connor> - Is it real? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a lot of like what we call. </connor>
<connor> - Why I'm I being grilled for this thing? </connor>
<connor> - In Japan, a lot of people are like known as paper drivers, </connor>
<connor> which means they have the license, </connor>
<garnt> but they don't have it to drive. </garnt>
<joey> They just have it as a form of ID. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, in the U.K people get provisional licenses </garnt>
<connor> because we. - That's where I got. </connor>
<connor> - We use licenses to prove that </connor>
<joey> we can get into bars and pubs. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - That's pretty much the only reason </connor>
<garnt> for provisional licenses. - And even Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so I had to wait an hour </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, cool, I'm it's all going well, </garnt>
<garnt> she seems to be, you know happy with it. </garnt>
<garnt> She's like, "Yeah okay, yeah, no problem. </garnt>
<garnt> "Just come back in two days." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like what? </garnt>
<garnt> What do you mean come back in two days? </garnt>
<garnt> - So you didn't even get it? </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't get it to today, I didn't get it. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<garnt> So you haven't got it yet? </garnt>
<garnt> - No - After waiting, </garnt>
<garnt> how long did you wait? </garnt>
<connor> - I left at 4:00 p.m and I got there at 8:00 a.m </connor>
<joey> so that is eight hours away. </joey>
<joey> - So eight hours? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like eight hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - You wasted a whole day. </garnt>
<connor> - I lost a whole day. </connor>
<connor> - To not getting a license. </connor>
<connor> - To get the paperwork, to get the license. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I remember you telling me just before </garnt>
<garnt> that you were getting this. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a whole of bunch of fetch quests, </garnt>
<garnt> this is why they love. </garnt>
<connor> In fact, this is why all the RPGs in Japan </connor>
<connor> have a bazillion fetch quests. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause living here is a fucking fetch quest. </connor>
<connor> Every time you wanna do anything, </connor>
<connor> it's like, okay get the prerequisite items. </connor>
<connor> Which you they're all in different locations </connor>
<connor> because of course they are, </connor>
<connor> like they're not all in the government building </connor>
<connor> because that would be so easy, </connor>
<garnt> that will make life too simple. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why Gotcha Game work here. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you even have the waiting time, </garnt>
<garnt> like the loading time where you're like think </garnt>
<connor> you got all the items and then you have to like put it in </connor>
<connor> to like, fucking yeah, you gotta a craft the item </connor>
<joey> and you've gotta wait until the item </joey>
<joey> is finished being crafted. </joey>
<joey> - And then you pull the DOD Gotcha (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> 'cause you have to wait to 2:30. </connor>
<connor> - So they said I have to come back on Wednesday, </connor>
<connor> which is tomorrow. </connor>
<connor> So I'm going there tomorrow to do the eye test. </connor>
<connor> That's it, I do the eye test </connor>
<garnt> and once I prove I'm not fucking blind, I get my license </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine if they just rejects you after that. </garnt>
<joey> - I would fucking lose temper </joey>
<connor> - So you basically spend eight hours </connor>
<joey> for someone to tell you come back in two days? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, basically, I know the DMV is bad in all countries, </connor>
<connor> but in U.K I would never have it that. </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't that bad especially with how many documents </garnt>
<garnt> you needed to grab before just to get your license slide, </garnt>
<joey> just be given a license as well. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's crazy because like Nabi, </joey>
<garnt> who went with you is a friend of ours, </garnt>
<joey> like when he went, he had such an easy time </joey>
<joey> but I guess it's because he got up before COVID. </joey>
<connor> - I think they've made it a lot slower, from COVID, </connor>
<joey> like apparently and they also told me that </joey>
<connor> for some reason, because of COVID, </connor>
<connor> the amount of people applying has gone up a lot. </connor>
<joey> - Well yeah, because no one can travel </joey>
<connor> outside of the country. </connor>
<connor> So therefore they wanna travel inside the country. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah true, but I guess </connor>
<connor> I would have thought the other way around, </connor>
<connor> but yeah it's just. </connor>
<garnt> - Speaking to you has made me less, </garnt>
<garnt> entirely put me off from wanting to get a job. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm glad at least someone in Trash Taste </garnt>
<garnt> now has a license 'cause we're just gonna ask you </garnt>
<connor> to show for us anyway. </connor>
<connor> - I want it, I even when I don't need something, </connor>
<connor> I want to just do it because if I have the free time, </connor>
<connor> I know there's gonna be up, </connor>
<connor> I never wanna be in the point in my life </connor>
<connor> where like, I need something and it's gonna take. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm like that as well. </connor>
<connor> But I'm not going to go to a DMV for eight hours </connor>
<garnt> to be like, come back for an eye test two days later. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't know they were gonna do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That doesn't sound worthy to me. </garnt>
<joey> So I'm glad you went through the pain </joey>
<joey> because like I said, like, I don't. </joey>
<joey> - Now we know not to do it </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, now I know not to do it </joey>
<joey> and I like driving for me is a stressful experience anyway </joey>
<connor> but that's probably because I've spent most of my time </connor>
<connor> driving in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, man. </connor>
<connor> - Because I never actually drove so much in the U.K </connor>
<connor> 'cause like I grew up in Brighton </connor>
<joey> and then went to London for my job search. </joey>
<connor> So I've never needed to be in a place </connor>
<connor> where I drive frequently until I moved to Bangkok. </connor>
<connor> And my God, driving in just Southeast Asia, in general, </connor>
<connor> is just nothing like driving in Japan </connor>
<connor> or driving in the U.K or anything. </connor>
<connor> So let me describe what it is like driving in one of these </connor>
<connor> kinds of countries. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so in Thailand, we don't have road rules, </connor>
<connor> we have road suggestions. </connor>
<garnt> (Connor and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's kind of so we technically have rules, </garnt>
<garnt> but whether people follow them or not, </garnt>
<garnt> is up to the individual driver. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like a Mario Kart with like a lot more death. </connor>
<garnt> - It is basically, so like you know how you change lanes, </garnt>
<connor> there's like a system for example, changing lanes. </connor>
<connor> You signal and then the person like whether it. </connor>
<connor> - Backs off. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the person backs off whatever, </connor>
<connor> like whoever has the right of way. </connor>
<connor> The rights of way in Thailand goes, </connor>
<connor> okay we're gonna play this game of chicken, okay? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] (laughs) Oh, no. </connor>
<connor> So imagine I wanna change lanes </connor>
<connor> or someone else wants to change lane </connor>
<connor> and there's a car just like behind them </connor>
<connor> or like in the same lane. </connor>
<connor> So the person's gonna start changing lanes </connor>
<joey> and either one person backs off </joey>
<joey> or the person changing lane backs off or we're gonna crash. </joey>
<joey> And so there's no rule to say who has to back off. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - So one of them is gonna back off or you're gonna crash. </joey>
<joey> So it's basically who has the bigger balls </joey>
<joey> to like not give way or give away </joey>
<joey> - Who's going to be the bigger man. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah exactly, exactly (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It is wild, I think like Thailand looks scary. </garnt>
<garnt> There's other countries that even worse I think. </garnt>
<connor> There's like, I think in Saudi Arabia </connor>
<connor> the number one cause of death is car accidents. </connor>
<joey> - I wouldn't be surprised, I mean. </joey>
<connor> - It's crazy because I don't think </connor>
<connor> any other country it's even not there. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I went to the Philippines a couple years ago </joey>
<connor> to go see Yankees family and we had to drive through Manila. </connor>
<connor> And that was one of the most terrifying things ever </connor>
<connor> because not only is there no lanes and it's the same thing, </connor>
<garnt> like it's just whoever gets in there first, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's also people just on the road </garnt>
<joey> just in the middle of the road trying to cross. </joey>
<garnt> - The worst thing is like the people in the middle </garnt>
<connor> of the road who have just no fear of death </connor>
<connor> and then motorcycles as well. </connor>
<connor> Motorcycles are like the fucking, like annoying housefly </connor>
<connor> that you just can't like fucking swat away, </connor>
<connor> but they're always and you always need to be aware of them. </connor>
<joey> Like driving in Bangkok, you just have to like, </joey>
<joey> you just have to mask the ultra instinct. </joey>
<joey> They just every driver, just needs to master ultra instinct. </joey>
<connor> - You just have to like the rain men. </connor>
<connor> - (Joey laughing) The fucking men turned on. </connor>
<connor> That's why they can all drive. </connor>
<garnt> - Like the fucking observation hockey, </garnt>
<garnt> like permanently turned on when you're driving. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's not just the motorcycle either, </joey>
<joey> it's like one it's like a motorcycle </joey>
<joey> that's normally for like max two people </joey>
<joey> but somehow have like eight people on it. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like what? </joey>
<garnt> - Like sometimes there's just the motorcycle </garnt>
<garnt> and there's just like the entire family (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> on the motorcycle plus the chauffeur. </connor>
<connor> - Dude that would be wild. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a clown car but a motorcycle. </connor>
<connor> - That would stressed me out so fucking much. </connor>
<connor> - Like it's funny 'cause Bangkok, living in Bangkok, </connor>
<connor> you often take motorcycle taxis </connor>
<connor> even though in any other country, you would not take it. </connor>
<connor> And I described Bangkok is like the only place </connor>
<connor> I've been to in the world, </connor>
<connor> where I will willingly risk my life everyday </connor>
<connor> going into a motorcycle taxi, </connor>
<connor> so I can save myself from </connor>
<connor> sitting in an hour of traffic. - Oh, my God. </connor>
<connor> - That's the kind of city it is during rush hour. </connor>
<connor> And that's just given me a huge, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't say fear of driving, </connor>
<connor> but just every time like I think about driving </connor>
<connor> just gives me a cold sweat. </connor>
<garnt> Like, oh, I got to get back on that road man. </garnt>
<joey> - Or you've just like perfected </joey>
<connor> your like dodging techniques. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Here in the U.K by some asshole. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah I go. </garnt>
<garnt> - So we were on, I was driving two, </garnt>
<garnt> we have like a yearly house party </garnt>
<garnt> where a lot of my friends in the U.K catch up </garnt>
<garnt> and I was sitting in the car with Alan, my Editor </garnt>
<connor> Alex, Alan's girlfriend, Sydney and D Revel House. </connor>
<connor> And so we were on like a country roads </connor>
<connor> and we had just like there was a car in front of us, </connor>
<connor> so we just stopped. </connor>
<connor> And I like did like a kind of like a sudden stop </connor>
<connor> 'cause the car in front of us, like did a very quick stop. </connor>
<connor> And then D was about say nice driving Garnt. </connor>
<connor> And as he was, as like the sound was leaving his mouth </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (mimicking a car crash) a fucking car just like </garnt>
<garnt> tears in my car and it fucking </garnt>
<garnt> destroys my car. - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - And (laughs) I like my car is fucking totaled </garnt>
<garnt> and the car in front of us has the audacity to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, this was your fault by the way, </garnt>
<garnt> "when are you paying up?" </garnt>
<garnt> And the car behind us was like, </garnt>
<garnt> so during the interview when the police came, </garnt>
<garnt> we called the police, we've got you know, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone got like checked up an ambulance </garnt>
<garnt> and apparently he just, he was going like 60 </garnt>
<garnt> or 70 down a country road </garnt>
<garnt> and he just had his eyes off the road. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "Yeah, I just took my eyes off </garnt>
<garnt> "the road for a second </garnt>
<garnt> "and who knew a car could creep up on me in one second?" </garnt>
<connor> - Oh dear, it's terrifying in the country roads. </connor>
<garnt> It's like I learned to drive in London </garnt>
<garnt> but I also drive a lot in Wales. </garnt>
<connor> But like, those roads in Wales are scary </connor>
<connor> 'cause they're all like thick trees and really tight roads, </connor>
<connor> especially like Wales and then probably in Devin as well. </connor>
<connor> We were in there like that's like fucking trucks </connor>
<connor> coming all the time on these roads. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a one way road or? </connor>
<connor> - It's two but when you get the big trucks, </connor>
<connor> it's like you kind of just stop. </connor>
<connor> - It might as well be a one-way road, </connor>
<connor> yeah. - So that you avoid </connor>
<connor> the road ditch, so sometimes you'll go in like </connor>
<joey> and then normally 60 'cause like their national speed limit. </joey>
<joey> - 60 miles right? - Miles per hour </joey>
<connor> And then they'll just be like trucks coming </connor>
<connor> and you really have to like. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like truck drivers in every country are like. </garnt>
<connor> - They don't give a fuck 'cause why would they? </connor>
<connor> They win every time (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> If I had a rock to destroy paper </joey>
<joey> of course I'm gonna pick rock to fucking kill everyone. </joey>
<joey> - They're like the jokes in the school hallway, right? </joey>
<joey> So you have to move out of the way </joey>
<joey> 'cause they don't gonna move (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean that was the only car crash </garnt>
<garnt> I've been in but there's been many, many close calls </garnt>
<garnt> as you can probably imagine in Bangkok. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the health and safety in Bangkok, </garnt>
<garnt> especially on the road, is very worrying. </garnt>
<connor> - How does an ambulance get to you? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) If you? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've wondered that exact same question, during shower. </garnt>
<joey> - Motorcycle as an ambulance, like get in the back </joey>
<joey> - I guess you just gotta a fucking bleed out </joey>
<joey> on the road, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause what's even scarier all right? </joey>
<joey> is the taxi drivers in Bangkok. </joey>
<joey> It causes such a roulette wheel. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so for one, you'd expect one of some, </joey>
<connor> one of the most dangerous cities to drive in </connor>
<connor> to have a lot of like safety measures </connor>
<connor> on the public transports right? </connor>
<connor> So most taxis you go in the back </connor>
<connor> and there's no seat belts. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Some of the closest near death experiences I've had </connor>
<connor> have been on a fucking taxi. </connor>
<connor> Because taxi drivers they don't get paid the most as well, </connor>
<connor> so they work ridiculously long hours. </connor>
<connor> So I remember this one time I was, </connor>
<connor> I had a night out and we stayed out till about </connor>
<connor> like 3:00 a.m, 4:00 a.m drinking at some IZakiya </connor>
<connor> in like Bangkok whatever and we had to go home. </connor>
<connor> And so we get a taxi home. </connor>
<connor> And the good thing about driving back home </connor>
<joey> in like the middle of like 4:00 a.m, </joey>
<joey> is it's normally driving there it takes two hours, </joey>
<joey> but when there's no traffic, it takes 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of like the time we had on </joey>
<joey> when you don't factor in traffic. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - But we get in, it's me and Sydney </joey>
<joey> and we get in this taxi </joey>
<joey> and this guy just seems really quiet. </joey>
<joey> And then we get to the highway </joey>
<joey> and he's doing like fucking 80 to a 100 miles an hour </joey>
<connor> on the freeway, right? </connor>
<connor> And then Sydney is like asleep in the taxi, </connor>
<connor> so it's just me and it's complete silence </connor>
<connor> and then he's just starts like swerving a bit. </connor>
<connor> You know that thing where. </connor>
<connor> - When you wake up. </connor>
<connor> - You're like whoa, whoa. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like okay, we could have crashed right there. </connor>
<connor> So I asked him, are you okay? </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Yeah, it's I'm completely good. </connor>
<connor> "I've just been up for like 36 hours." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) I'm like </connor>
<connor> - Pull over pull over. </connor>
<connor> - Whoa, whoa, hold on a second </connor>
<connor> and to explain something about, </connor>
<connor> to explain like something about Thai culture. </connor>
<joey> We have this thing called a Mapping Lie Attitude </joey>
<joey> which the closest translation is like </joey>
<joey> (speaking in foreign language) </joey>
<connor> It's okay kind of attitude, which you know it's great </connor>
<joey> when you're on holiday you know, </joey>
<connor> because the reason Thailand's so great </connor>
<connor> when you're on holiday is cause everyone's so relaxed, </connor>
<connor> you know, it's stress free. </connor>
<connor> But there are some situations </connor>
<connor> where it's very not in my situation </connor>
<connor> and this was one of those situations. </connor>
<connor> So I'm asking him, are you okay? </connor>
<connor> Are you sure you don't wanna pull over? </connor>
<connor> We can get another taxi. </connor>
<garnt> And he's like "map and lie, map and lie, map and lie" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like bruh, this is a very not map and lie situation </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) right now that we're in. </garnt>
<connor> - I could go next to him the whole time </connor>
<connor> like slapping his cheeks. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I was actually in the back seat. </garnt>
<garnt> No seat belt by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> This taxi did not have a seat belt </garnt>
<garnt> and this guy just I told him to slow down </garnt>
<garnt> and he goes, "Okay, I'll slow down." </garnt>
<garnt> So he goes from a 100 miles an hour to 80 miles an hour. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like bro, like brilliant, brilliant. </connor>
<garnt> But. </garnt>
<connor> - Everything is not map and lie. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, he's like map and lie, map and lie </joey>
<joey> I'm like every five minutes he would just like, </joey>
<garnt> I could see him nodding off, nodding off to be like, </garnt>
<connor> (mimicking a sleepy head) </connor>
<garnt> - This is where you get in the front seat </garnt>
<garnt> and stare at him like this, like the owl just like fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like Bangkok has like a highway. </garnt>
<connor> So it's like a elevated highway. </connor>
<connor> So I couldn't just tell him to stop </connor>
<garnt> and like and we get another taxi, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we're in the middle of the highway. </garnt>
<connor> - If you're a fucking Japanese taxi, </connor>
<garnt> he'll stop on the highway. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't give fuck that crazy here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so basically it was the most stressful </garnt>
<garnt> half hour of rides I've ever been on. </garnt>
<connor> Sydney was like stress-free, she was asleep. </connor>
<connor> She could have died in her sleep. </connor>
<joey> - Sydney was the only one who was map and lying. </joey>
<connor> - It's a good way to go (all laughing) I mean. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I know what's up like fucking pissed out </joey>
<joey> my mind at 4:00 a.m being like </joey>
<joey> trying to have this conversation with this taxi driver. </joey>
<joey> I was like I was just trying to keep him awake </joey>
<joey> and he was telling me like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, you know I've got like </joey>
<connor> "two kids waiting for me at home." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, dude after this taxi drive, </connor>
<connor> go home to your fucking kids. </connor>
<connor> Just think about your kid's. - Sleep, for fuck's sake. </connor>
<connor> - Please just think about your kids right now. </connor>
<connor> - My God. </connor>
<connor> - And yeah, that was one of the near life you know. </connor>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - That experiences I had. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, can I come to Thailand will be great. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, bro, what do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> You make us sound like it's fucking Jason Statham Movie </connor>
<connor> every time you talk about it, holy shit. </connor>
<connor> - Fast and furious. </connor>
<connor> - Keeping this man awake to save your life. </connor>
<connor> What is this? (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I'll said earlier like Japanese taxis, </connor>
<connor> they just stop anywhere, if you noticed that. </connor>
<joey> - They have the jocks in the skill, </joey>
<joey> they don't move. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I tell them to stop around somewhere, </connor>
<joey> they like take that literally </joey>
<connor> and they'll stop in the middle of the fucking busy highway. </connor>
<connor> And they'll be like, here you are. </connor>
<connor> I'm like what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> Get to a side road or something. </connor>
<joey> - If you don't specify like, </joey>
<joey> can you stop like down the road? </joey>
<joey> If you just say stop, they'll be like, okay stopping. </joey>
<connor> - They stop, if I say like (laughs) tomorrow, they'll stop. </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, we're in the middle of an intersection </joey>
<joey> maybe you should like, move forward a bit. </joey>
<joey> - He did that when we went to the Roman last week </joey>
<joey> and then he stopped at the intersection, </joey>
<connor> just stopped. </connor>
<joey> - And I'm like, I'm not getting out of the car, </joey>
<connor> we're in a fucking intersection. </connor>
<connor> - (all laughing) Like bro (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's so weird. </connor>
<connor> I don't know 'cause they follow road rules so strictly here. </connor>
<connor> But then for some reason taxi drivers just don't. </connor>
<connor> And it's funny cause I noticed </connor>
<connor> on the British government website, when you go to Japan, </connor>
<connor> it says be careful of taxi drivers </connor>
<connor> because they just stop anyway, especially when driving. </connor>
<connor> Because if you're behind a taxi driver in Japan, </connor>
<connor> and you're driving be careful. </connor>
<connor> He'll probably just stop like full force, </connor>
<connor> just full of it's crazy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it's like the like road rules </garnt>
<connor> or like who has the right of way? </connor>
<connor> Kind of confusing me sometimes and okay zebra crossing. </connor>
<connor> Zebra crossings in every country have a different meaning </connor>
<connor> and I don't know what it means in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> Like so to explain in the U.K, if there's a zebra crossing, </garnt>
<garnt> the pedestrian always has the right of way. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you never need to fear for your life </garnt>
<connor> if you're near the zebra crossing. </connor>
<connor> - You're taught to stop, as the driver you stop </connor>
<connor> even if you see someone walking near it, like slow down. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly, but you know in like Southeast Asia, </garnt>
<connor> zebra crossings mean nothing. </connor>
<connor> - It's a suggestion. </connor>
<connor> - It's a suggestion </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> In Japan, I don't know what it means either. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes they stop. </connor>
<connor> - They're supposed to stop, but they don't. </connor>
<joey> - Others this is where I've stood like </joey>
<connor> at the front of the several crossing, right? </connor>
<connor> When you want people to stop </connor>
<joey> and like five causes possible, I'm like can I go? </joey>
<connor> - You have to like start walking in the road </connor>
<joey> and then they'll stop. </joey>
<connor> So I realize I'm playing fucking chicken. </connor>
<connor> I thought I was walking the road and be like, halt. </connor>
<connor> I have the right of way. </connor>
<garnt> - Cease. </garnt>
<connor> - Cease, (all laughing) My Lord. </connor>
<connor> And then go, it's weird, I don't know why you think that, </connor>
<connor> you know, considering how strict that road was on there </connor>
<connor> and everyone leaves so much room between the cars, </connor>
<joey> I noticed that. </joey>
<joey> In the U-- - It's like a car's worth. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, in the U.K it's like this much, </joey>
<joey> but in Japan it's like I leave a car, at least to car. </joey>
<joey> - That's why I'm kind of glad </joey>
<joey> that Japan doesn't have like roundabouts, can you imagine? </joey>
<connor> - Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - Like just how much of-- </connor>
<connor> - No one would give way, everyone would just be waiting </connor>
<connor> for someone to come in. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, don't stop, don't stop. </connor>
<connor> - Please, please go ahead </connor>
<connor> you know because there were this is like, </connor>
<joey> I don't know if it's an actual road rule </joey>
<joey> and I want to preface, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it's an actual road rule, </joey>
<joey> but in Australia we were taught </joey>
<joey> and some people were taught, </joey>
<joey> that when you're in a roundabout right? </joey>
<joey> Usually it's like whoever's in the roundabout first right? </joey>
<joey> It's basically like once you're in the roundabout, </joey>
<joey> you have to give away to whoever's </joey>
<joey> in the roundabout, right? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But in Australia, some people were taught that like </joey>
<joey> you always have to give way to the person on your right. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, but then what if this four people </joey>
<joey> at the roundabout? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Who is gonna give way? </joey>
<connor> - It's kind of like, if you see them </connor>
<connor> and they're far enough way on the right-hand side, </connor>
<connor> I guess go this is why I hate roundabouts, </connor>
<joey> 'cause you know like super like rock solid logic </joey>
<joey> that you can. </joey>
<joey> - Australia is the land of fucking roundabouts. </joey>
<connor> We have a roundabout everywhere. </connor>
<joey> - We have so many in the U.K it's kinda like </joey>
<connor> you just gotta be like, are you Americans like </connor>
<connor> what the fucking you guys talking about? </connor>
<connor> Basically you just like kind of have to you see a car coming </connor>
<connor> you're like, do I think I can get this car in gear and go? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That just brings an extra layer of stress </connor>
<connor> to my drive. - The worst </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause t's like playing a quick time event. </connor>
<garnt> And if you failed a quick time event, you just struck </garnt>
<garnt> you just crash. - Crash. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey drives automatic, </garnt>
<garnt> so he's lucky - Oh God, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause the worst part is cause you obviously </garnt>
<garnt> have to stop versus the time of the roundabout. </garnt>
<connor> So you're like in, you're not in gear. </connor>
<connor> So you're like, you see a car and you're like, </connor>
<connor> I've seen this car, I have to quickly decide </connor>
<joey> whether I can get in gear and go, </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) And if I'm fast enough to not make that guy </joey>
<joey> slow down too much, 'cause it's just a mess. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah dude, </joey>
<joey> it's easy for me 'cause I just like, can I make it? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> - I'll just press the go pedal. </connor>
<connor> - Press the go pedal just get in (Connor laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, I did my driving test for a manual car, right? </garnt>
<connor> And this driving test, put me off driving manual </connor>
<connor> for my entire fucking life. </connor>
<connor> Okay to explain, I think you're allowed </connor>
<connor> 16 minor offenses, right? </connor>
<connor> - 16? Oh, oh when you're taking the test. </connor>
<garnt> - Minor, minor when you're driving test. </garnt>
<joey> - What registers as a minor offense? </joey>
<joey> - Like not indicating? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no not that's a major one. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe going a little too early and too much time. </connor>
<connor> Stuff that doesn't matter, but if you do a lot of them, </connor>
<joey> it would be like your shit driver. </joey>
<joey> - Stop, that one cause an accident. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - So if your tires like hit a curb, </joey>
<garnt> I think that's a major - Now that's a major offense. </garnt>
<connor> - So that's the level of. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - But like a minor offense is something that </connor>
<connor> can't cause a crash or anything like that I think </connor>
<connor> but I got 13 on my. </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit. </connor>
<connor> - I got 13 on my driving test. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I thought I've failed, right? </connor>
<connor> - So I'm gonna test the limit. </connor>
<connor> - And I swear like, 'cause I was so fucking stressed. </connor>
<connor> It was my first time driving. </connor>
<connor> It was my first attempt at the driving test as well. </connor>
<connor> And I remember this, there was always one road, </connor>
<connor> I was super fucking terrified would be on my driving test. </connor>
<connor> And of course it was all my driving test. </connor>
<connor> And so driving a manual car, it's a hill start. </connor>
<connor> - That's well. </connor>
<connor> - It's a hill start into a roundabout. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, same same. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, </connor>
<connor> I'm like that, I remember when I pulled up </connor>
<connor> and normally I hope that's the roundabout fucking clear. </connor>
<connor> Of course it's not clear, you know? </connor>
<connor> So you're playing about five different mini games at once. </connor>
<connor> And if you stop the car, if you go too early, go too late </connor>
<connor> or do any of that shit, you fail the test. </connor>
<connor> And that like the experience of having to drive manual </connor>
<connor> and you 'cause we've driving manual you are </connor>
<connor> constantly playing a mini game </connor>
<connor> where I just wanna shut my brain off, </connor>
<connor> I wanna stress free driving experience. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, that's why I've driven automatic my entire life </connor>
<connor> since then basically. </connor>
<connor> - I've never driven automatic so long it's like </connor>
<connor> - Really? - I'm too there. </connor>
<joey> - It'll be like fucking putting the antenna on in Marriott. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So how do we crash? </connor>
<connor> How do I crash this? </connor>
<connor> - I'm on my way to the driving test, </connor>
<connor> I did like everything wrong. </connor>
<connor> Like I didn't indicate, I ran a red light. </connor>
<connor> I fucked up on a roundabout, nearly close to crash. </connor>
<connor> My driving instructor was like, </connor>
<connor> it's okay if you have to do it twice. </connor>
<connor> You know it's and then I got like two minors, that's it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my-- </connor>
<connor> - I like went in like men mode, like focus. </connor>
<connor> I just like killed it. </connor>
<connor> I was like, wow okay damn, good at this </connor>
<connor> for this very small point during the day </connor>
<connor> where I must attempt. </connor>
<joey> - As long as it's not as bad as my uncle, </joey>
<joey> he like my uncle like he failed his first driving test </joey>
<connor> and (laughs) you want to guess </connor>
<connor> how he failed his first driving test? </connor>
<connor> - What did he do? Did he crash? </connor>
<connor> - So like, you know when you do you start at the DMV, </connor>
<garnt> like in your driving test </garnt>
<garnt> or do you just started like a random road? </garnt>
<garnt> - We start at a random road for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wherever you parked your car? </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess so. </garnt>
<connor> So in Australia you start at the actual DMV. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - And you have to like go out of the DMV driver, </connor>
<connor> come back to the DMV and then once you're back at the DMV, </connor>
<connor> then that's the end of the test. </connor>
<connor> My uncle went out of the exit (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - No (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Of the DMV. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So he got in the car, he started it up, </connor>
<connor> drove out two seconds later, it was like, "you failed." </connor>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he drove out of the exit. </garnt>
<joey> Sorry he dropped out of the entrance. </joey>
<garnt> - That sounds better than what happens in the U.K. </garnt>
<connor> In the UK, if you do a major, like major mistake </connor>
<connor> but you know, you've done it. </connor>
<connor> You have to complete the test. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, really? </connor>
<connor> - They don't tell you, you failed immediately. </connor>
<garnt> You just, you could like do something </garnt>
<garnt> and you'd know you failed. </garnt>
<garnt> And you still just have to go through the entire test </garnt>
<garnt> knowing that you've done it. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no, because in Australia, the moment you fail, </joey>
<connor> they just immediately tell you. </connor>
<connor> And they tell you to drive back </connor>
<connor> because to the instructor, they're like, </connor>
<joey> oh sweet we finished 15 minutes. </joey>
<joey> I can take a break. </joey>
<connor> - So they changed the U.K tests from when you did it now. </connor>
<connor> So when I had to do it, there was like a portion of it </connor>
<connor> that was with like a sat nav </connor>
<connor> and then there was another part </connor>
<connor> where they were like telling me the directions, </connor>
<connor> I hated it when they were telling me directions. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why do I need to be tested on this? </connor>
<connor> This is like testing my ability to use like a quilt. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I'm never gonna use this (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like just give me the little robot that talks to me </connor>
<connor> and I can see where the map is. </connor>
<connor> I know what the like, when you say right to me, </connor>
<connor> it's 10 seconds before my brain goes dumb. </connor>
<connor> It's like, right, right, right, right. </connor>
<joey> - Right now? Right now? </joey>
<joey> - Like this right. </joey>
<joey> Like my right arm this way right? </joey>
<connor> Like this my brain is like bro when I here directions. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause when I'm driving, I'm like bro </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to change gears the fuck up. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No one the testing is for fucking backseat drivers right? </joey>
<joey> Because they like it's all right, it's all right. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like yo, can you charge my mix tape at least kind of. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> - They tell you the thoughts. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> So that was pretty sick. </joey>
<connor> - I failed the test. </connor>
<connor> At least I'd wanna put the mixed tape. </connor>
<joey> - Just slip that in. </joey>
<joey> - I'll give you the mix tape for free if you let me pass. </joey>
<connor> - It's not like hook up my looks or something come on, man. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - All right, I got you (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Stop playing all the fucking </garnt>
<garnt> anime openings and everything. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh fuck love this opening, I'll turn right. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - So yes, so yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So now I know not to go to the fucking DMV in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you for taking the bullet for us. </garnt>
<connor> Now we don't have to hire a chauffeur for Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> We just have you. </connor>
<connor> - Can't wait to go tomorrow. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, moving on from driving </garnt>
<garnt> that was a pretty big tangent, </garnt>
<garnt> I have an announcement, gentlemen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Go on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I think after 10, 12, 13 years, </garnt>
<garnt> I may have a new best girl of all time. </garnt>
<connor> - Wow! </connor>
<connor> - Wait who was it before? </connor>
<garnt> - Senjogahara, so, ever since. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like white bread too. </garnt>
<joey> - So ever since the very first time </joey>
<connor> I've watched back Monogatari, like Senjogahara </connor>
<joey> has been my wife for you, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> She's always been the top tier girl </joey>
<connor> and like people would come close. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) Where are you going with this? </connor>
<connor> - But no one has come close to dethroning her. </connor>
<connor> But recently I caught up to the rental girlfriend, Manga </connor>
<connor> and I think that she's like, </connor>
<connor> she's is in contention for being like my best girl </connor>
<joey> of all time. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, which like leads me to the question like, </joey>
<joey> when did you first know that you have like a best girl? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I know who's yours is Joey. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And I know Connor is losing his mind. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) At this question. </connor>
<connor> - This is like where people were like on the forums </connor>
<connor> like how did you know you were in love? </connor>
<connor> Like what made you feel like you were in love? </connor>
<connor> Because it's like the stomach. </connor>
<garnt> - What is love? (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - What is love and when did you first fall in love? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, I mean, first of all, I'm surprised Senjogahara </joey>
<joey> was like your wife because I always thought </joey>
<joey> it was fucking Oscar. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean like Oscar was someone who I could just respect </garnt>
<garnt> for Connor is dying in his corner here. </garnt>
<joey> - Oscar is my wife and she's just someone I respect. </joey>
<connor> - Oscar is like 15. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it depends. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - This is the biggest, no officer she's a. </connor>
<garnt> - She's a drawing (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean I don't know if I wanna open up that debate, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause that debate is a fucking landmine of takes. </joey>
<connor> But yeah I mean like. </connor>
<garnt> - We can open that up for that. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know if I want to man. </joey>
<connor> (Connor and Garnt laughing) I'm in the worst position </connor>
<connor> for that, </connor>
<joey> (laughs) I'm in the worst position for that argument. </joey>
<connor> - Did you know there good defense for yourself. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, yeah but I also don't really care. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's like you don't need a </connor>
<connor> it's like you don't need a defense </connor>
<connor> to be like, yes, this is my girlfriend. </connor>
<joey> I don't care what you think, I love her. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I don't think it's like, I'm not trying </connor>
<joey> the people who are like, yeah, it's pedophilia. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I don't know about that. </joey>
<joey> - That's good. </joey>
<joey> - But like I think there's gotta be something </joey>
<connor> little sauce about dude like, yeah they're my wife who. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not gonna willingly, </joey>
<joey> you know walk into a courtroom and being like, </joey>
<joey> here is my defense. </joey>
<joey> - Your honor, she was a drawing. </joey>
<garnt> Which you know like, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - Your honor I have a birth certificate. </joey>
<joey> She's technically (laughs) 900 years old. </joey>
<garnt> - I do think there's a huge difference </garnt>
<garnt> in like having a wife and you know like sexualizing </garnt>
<connor> or whatever. - That's true. </connor>
<connor> Okay, a wife who is like a character </connor>
<garnt> who is a female I guess most of the time, </garnt>
<garnt> who is just really dig. </garnt>
<connor> - I get that, I get that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and for me it's always been Senjogahara </connor>
<connor> just because I like from watching back </connor>
<garnt> when I got three like I love the personality </garnt>
<garnt> and, huh? - Why, why? </garnt>
<connor> That was the biggest huh? </connor>
<joey> - Huh, just like how dare you even question? </joey>
<connor> - How dare you even question? </connor>
<connor> - So I can, you know think of some excuses when I need. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just because like, I interactions with Arararagi </garnt>
<garnt> were some of the most entertaining reacts, </garnt>
<garnt> like interactions I had seen in anime up to that point. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was like the way she was written </garnt>
<garnt> and the way like it really, what really sold me on the show </garnt>
<connor> was basically Senjogahara interaction with Arararagi </connor>
<connor> and how their romance developed </connor>
<connor> and how her character was explored as well. </connor>
<connor> It was just something that's </connor>
<connor> like her character really resonated with me </connor>
<connor> and I think that's what really a waifu wears. </connor>
<connor> It's a character who really like resonates with you </connor>
<connor> on a personal level. </connor>
<connor> Like you don't necessarily view them as a life partner </connor>
<joey> or anything like that. </joey>
<garnt> You're just like damn man. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just a character </garnt>
<garnt> that whatever they do, you just fucking love. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they can say or do anything </garnt>
<joey> and just how they react and how they are like. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just like the highest tier of Sydney. </garnt>
<connor> - And I saw all of that and was like nah, </connor>
<connor> give me the one who sucks my neck. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Nice character development bro. </joey>
<connor> How about you suck my neck? </connor>
<joey> - Senjogahara is not my waifu, </joey>
<connor> but I fuck love her as a character. </connor>
<connor> Like I love how everything she does </connor>
<joey> and says is deadpan as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what I love about </joey>
<connor> - It's her deadpan delivery and deadpan humor </connor>
<connor> which really drew her to Mike drew her to me. </connor>
<connor> And then it was exploring another side of the car </connor>
<connor> to a more vulnerable side, which was made me like, okay </connor>
<joey> I'm simping i want you to be happy. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - I totally get. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll take that. </garnt>
<connor> - Monogatari is really good at that though, </connor>
<connor> that's why there's so many waifus. </connor>
<connor> But now, I agree, it's like every time like Shinobu Oshino </connor>
<connor> came on screen, like everything she said and did </connor>
<joey> I was just like, I fucking love it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I can't explain it to you in words, </joey>
<joey> I just love it. </joey>
<connor> - That powerful that when you're done watching it, </connor>
<joey> you're like thinking about it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, she's such a good character. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you had I've never had character, </garnt>
<joey> like waifu or not like female or not </joey>
<joey> you've just like kind of resonate ways. </joey>
<joey> - You gonna have a husbando as well? </joey>
<connor> I have a husbando. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I think so, I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I think that I can't name them (laughs) </connor>
<connor> Off the top of my head. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I know like can't really think of any immediately. </connor>
<joey> - Do you have a husbando? </joey>
<garnt> - I'd have to think about it. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause my husbando is Usui from Kaichou Maids. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - So Malin is like, all right, that's a good choice. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, what's it called in English? </connor>
<connor> - Kaichou Maids Sama is a president, </connor>
<joey> is the, is a maid, is a really </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I've seen that. </joey>
<garnt> - Do want to explain this character? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so Usui is like the, I guess Kaichou Maids </joey>
<connor> some it's based off the shows Manga </connor>
<connor> from like the early 2000s, I believe </connor>
<connor> and the anime is from like the early 2000s. </connor>
<connor> But basically it's the story about </connor>
<connor> like how the the school like class president basically </connor>
<connor> is like, you know normally the anime troop </connor>
<connor> of class president is like you know, </connor>
<connor> that they're very like pure hearted, </connor>
<connor> they're very like together, you know they're very adult </connor>
<connor> for their age kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> But this particular culture is also a maid, at a maid cafe. </connor>
<connor> And she gets like. </connor>
<connor> - I could relate to them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so basically it's like a complete opposite, right? </connor>
<connor> And so basically she gets found out </connor>
<connor> by this like fucking honk of a dude called Usui, </connor>
<connor> who like all the girls fucking love. </connor>
<connor> And so it's this like special relationship </connor>
<connor> where he's trying to hide the fact that </connor>
<connor> she's not actually just like altogether </connor>
<connor> like me time personality and she fucking hates Usui for it. </connor>
<connor> But of course, with how every show Jo Manga goes, </connor>
<joey> she's like, actually this guy (Connor laughing) </joey>
<connor> I might like this guy and then Usui is also like, </connor>
<connor> you know I kind started off you know just like, </connor>
<joey> just teasing her, but she's kind of hot. </joey>
<garnt> - There was a guy character I liked what that show </garnt>
<connor> where the characters whole thing is that he's perfect </connor>
<connor> and he's a student? </connor>
<connor> - Sakamoto. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking loved that. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love Sakamoto. </connor>
<connor> - That anime was soo good (Joey laughing) and soo funny. </connor>
<connor> - I did not go like, that was an anime </connor>
<joey> that I heard was decent, and I was like </joey>
<joey> I didn't expect to love that, </joey>
<joey> Sakamoto - It's so funny. </joey>
<joey> - If you haven't seen Sakamoto it's basically like </joey>
<connor> the whole premise is that, </connor>
<connor> this guy is just the perfect human being. </connor>
<garnt> - This is just the perfect guy. </garnt>
<connor> - And everyone in the school </connor>
<connor> is trying to like fuck with him. </connor>
<connor> And he somehow always manages to flip it (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like there was one time where they needed </connor>
<connor> to like make a fire in a room. </connor>
<connor> So he literally started doing like back and forward. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He goes back and forward like jumping back and forward. </joey>
<connor> - And the friction between his shoes starts a fire. </connor>
<connor> - And the friction starts a fire. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, what? (Joey laughing and clapping) </connor>
<garnt> I love this, I love this man, I want fuck him. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I loved him so much. </garnt>
<connor> I wish I was that cool </connor>
<garnt> - Sakamoto like I'll be honest. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't like it that much. </connor>
<connor> - What? It was so fun. - Why? </connor>
<joey> - And you don't like it? </joey>
<connor> - It's because, Sakamoto it's so pretty much like </connor>
<connor> every problem I have with most comedy anime, </connor>
<connor> is in Sakamoto, which is, I like the first two episodes. </connor>
<connor> And then I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - Or is it the joke too repetitive? </connor>
<joey> - They kind of doing the same joke over and over. </joey>
<joey> - Became funnier every time for me, I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I knew it was coming, </joey>
<connor> it was always funny when it got, I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, you knew like whatever situation it was, </joey>
<connor> it's like you knew. </connor>
<connor> - He was going to come out on top. </connor>
<connor> - He's going to solve it, but it's the excitement of like </connor>
<connor> how we see. - How, yeah, </connor>
<connor> the absurdity of how he was gonna overcome it. </connor>
<connor> - I love show that because it completely defies expectations </connor>
<joey> of like, he's probably gonna do this. </joey>
<joey> But then they just completely flipped and be like </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like I didn't and there was no point in my mind </connor>
<connor> where I thought he was gonna friction </connor>
<connor> both the floor into a fire to save all the students. </connor>
<joey> Like I didn't see that coming. </joey>
<joey> - I just wanna to work out. </joey>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, what? </connor>
<connor> It's so fun, that's like, I love the comedy anime like that. </connor>
<connor> That'll just like, not trying too hard, I guess. </connor>
<garnt> - It's really weird, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I've had the hardest time getting into comedy anime. </garnt>
<connor> - Comedy anime are normally the worst type of anime. </connor>
<connor> - There are few comedy anime that I enjoy </connor>
<connor> and I put most of them in the same category </connor>
<connor> as like Sakamoto where it's funny to me like </connor>
<connor> for like one or two episodes. </connor>
<garnt> And then I get bored very quickly </garnt>
<garnt> if they're just kind of doing the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I always need to, like I always need to be, </garnt>
<garnt> they always need to be doing something different for me. </garnt>
<joey> - What about something like Nichijou. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, wait what's a Nichijou </connor>
<joey> and also what do you think is like the best comedy anime? </joey>
<connor> - Oh that's... </connor>
<connor> - In my opinion it's Nichijou. </connor>
<joey> - Super hard. </joey>
<joey> - Nichijou? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like off the top of my head, </joey>
<joey> probably the hottest I've ever laughed </joey>
<joey> at a comedy anime was probably Golden Boy, </joey>
<joey> if you remember that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But that was most of the. </joey>
<joey> - That's an old one. </joey>
<joey> - That's a really old one. </joey>
<connor> And that's the only like a six episode over you. </connor>
<connor> So I'd never got the chance to get bored over there. </connor>
<connor> And it is one of the best dubs I've ever heard </connor>
<connor> especially when it comes to a comedy anime </connor>
<connor> because you must've seen the meme </connor>
<connor> like of the one clip where it's the guy doing the swimming. </connor>
<connor> (mumbles) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the one clip that gets shared out Golden Boy. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you're gonna, if you laughed at that clip, </garnt>
<garnt> please watch Golden Boy </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like every point of Golden Boy, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like is just as good as that clip. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was just, a one clip that </garnt>
<garnt> if that would sell you on that show. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can easily re-watch that </garnt>
<connor> - Konosuba was also way funnier </connor>
<garnt> than I thought it was going to be. </garnt>
<garnt> - Konosuba is good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Konosuba I've I really enjoy </garnt>
<connor> in the same way I enjoy like Always Sunny in Philadelphia </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<garnt> It's just a bunch of awful people doing all the things. </garnt>
<connor> - This anime has awful as Always Sunny. </connor>
<joey> Always Sunny it's like my favorite fucking comedy, </joey>
<joey> I love it so much, my God. </joey>
<connor> - The corniness of a movie as well the surprise. </connor>
<connor> What's really funny. - I haven't watched that yet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but it was also really weird </connor>
<connor> because it was really funny, </connor>
<joey> he had no one in the cinema sloppy (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Japanese cinemas. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so I felt really bad laughing out loud. </joey>
<joey> I was just like (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Do you ever wish that was more like, I guess Western Humor </joey>
<connor> in comedy and cause a lot of it does kind of feel. </connor>
<connor> - I love this very anime as comedy. </connor>
<joey> It's very like some very slapstick. </joey>
<joey> - What would classify those as like Western comedy, right? </joey>
<connor> That's the question - I think where... </connor>
<joey> - Biggest slapstick as well it's any western. </joey>
<connor> - I don't necessarily think the Japanese humor </connor>
<connor> is as slapstick as we like to point out. </connor>
<connor> I think there's a YouTube video on this </connor>
<joey> and it's like, well there's like, </joey>
<joey> I mean there's a lot of TV shows in Japan, right? </joey>
<joey> Where like the whole comedy is like game shows </joey>
<joey> with that like language, right? </joey>
<joey> With the - Oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> like (mumbles) show. </joey>
<connor> - There's a bunch of other stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like, at least in Western, </connor>
<connor> we're like really fucking brutal with our comedy. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like you watch something like Always Sunny </connor>
<joey> and it's like (laughs) I couldn't imagine </joey>
<joey> anything like that coming out. </joey>
<joey> - Like Family Guy in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - It's weird though 'cause you have the game shows here, </joey>
<connor> which go above and beyond what we would think is acceptable. </connor>
<connor> But then when for some reason comedy </connor>
<connor> it's like they don't really joke about that kind of stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Right. - Right </joey>
<connor> - It's a lot of wordplay in Japan. </connor>
<connor> I feel like Japanese companies a lot of wordplay. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of wordplay right? But they have like </connor>
<connor> the show like fucking Orgasm Wars in Japan </connor>
<connor> where it's basically show about </connor>
<joey> if a dude can make another dude cum. </joey>
<joey> That's the whole premise. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<connor> - Whole premise, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He recently did a video on it, </connor>
<connor> but basically the most famous one was there was this, </connor>
<connor> it was versus this flipped super professional Japanese </connor>
<connor> like male porn star, who can like he says </connor>
<connor> like I can control when I cum basically. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> So he's always right, it's a 40 minutes shoot, </connor>
<garnt> all right I'll cum in the middle of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can cum in command. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically, he was like, I'm a cum in command. </garnt>
<garnt> Which means that if you tell me not to cum, </garnt>
<connor> I'll never cum. </connor>
<connor> And then he had to verse this guy, </connor>
<connor> - Verse? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> It wasn't verses like he basically had to verse this guy. </connor>
<connor> He was a bartender in Shinjuku Ni-chome, </connor>
<connor> which is like the gay district of Shinjuku, </connor>
<connor> and he's like considered to be, </connor>
<connor> he says he can make any man cum (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> with his skills, right? </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So basically they put him, </connor>
<connor> they put both of them in a room, right. </connor>
<connor> This is on TV by the way on National TV. </connor>
<connor> So they put him in a room he's inside the male porn star </connor>
<connor> is like inside of a box that's completely covered. </connor>
<connor> And the gay guy gets in basically. </connor>
<connor> And you don't see anything, but they're both miked up. </connor>
<joey> So you can hear everything, </joey>
<joey> - How does this pass television? </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) how? </garnt>
<joey> - And of course, you know </joey>
<joey> with traditional Japanese television </joey>
<joey> like in the corner there's like always </joey>
<joey> the reaction face (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And this is the bunch of people </joey>
<joey> just fucking losing themselves, </joey>
<joey> just watching dude suck off a gay. </joey>
<connor> - Do you mean like make him nuts like immediately. </connor>
<joey> - He makes him not in like five minutes. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And the funniest part is like, obviously like </connor>
<connor> you know watching them male porn star, </connor>
<connor> like cum on national TV. </connor>
<joey> But then we see guys coming out </joey>
<joey> and being like (speaking in foreign language) </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That's soo fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you hear like the dick sucking sound? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, it's on YouTube as well, mind you. </garnt>
<joey> If you look it up, I guarantee it's on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - It's got crazy that's like totally acceptable. </connor>
<connor> But then like that human doesn't </connor>
<joey> or maybe not even like it's not allowed, </joey>
<joey> but they don't really find that funny. </joey>
<connor> - No, no they find it funny. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah okay. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Like that was one of the most like legendary pieces on TV. </joey>
<joey> - You find that funny, </joey>
<connor> but then why would you reckon that something </connor>
<connor> like Sunny would be directing </connor>
<joey> that would be funny to Japanese people. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know really? </joey>
<garnt> - Have you watched Sunny? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I've seen a bit of it. </joey>
<connor> - They probably think, man, these people are really rude. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's what's so funny about it. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know cause like the reason </connor>
<connor> I've really enjoyed konosuba over something </connor>
<connor> like say Sakamoto is that Konosuba was like </connor>
<connor> way more character-based comedy. </connor>
<connor> I very much like enjoy character-based comedy, </connor>
<connor> where-- </connor>
<connor> - Sakamoto it's just like Mr Bean. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - Sorry to cut you off but. </connor>
<connor> - No, that's like the perfect analogy </connor>
<joey> where a lot of comedy anime. </joey>
<joey> - It's the perfect Bean. </joey>
<joey> - I love the comedy anime I see it's just like, </joey>
<connor> hey, there's this one joke and it's funny </connor>
<connor> like the first few times </connor>
<connor> let's see how far we can stretch it. </connor>
<connor> But eventually, I'm gonna get bored. </connor>
<connor> Whereas with a lot of like, you know, sitcoms and everything </connor>
<connor> like that, you know, it's a lot of character-based comedy </connor>
<connor> where you know, some of the best moments are seeing, </connor>
<connor> how knowing the characters </connor>
<joey> and seeing how they interact with each other. </joey>
<joey> And you know, that's what the comedy builds off of. </joey>
<joey> You talked about Nichijou, </joey>
<joey> I haven't actually seen Nichijou yet. </joey>
<joey> - You haven't seen Nichijou? </joey>
<joey> - I haven't, it's been like the one anime </joey>
<garnt> the one common anime. </garnt>
<joey> - I know you've, do you love Sakamoto? </joey>
<joey> you've fuck love Nichijou. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause Nichijou is that one comedy anime </joey>
<joey> where every joke is expectation defining. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause one thing I will say about Nichijou </garnt>
<garnt> is that it doesn't seem like </garnt>
<connor> it's not a character-based comedy as it? </connor>
<connor> - Every clip I've seen looks like funny as far. </connor>
<connor> - But the thing that sells him on like, </connor>
<connor> what makes me really want to watch Nichijou is that </connor>
<connor> every clip I've seen is vastly different </connor>
<joey> and vastly like they have an original approach </joey>
<joey> to a joke every time whether it be like animation </joey>
<joey> of the punchline or something. </joey>
<garnt> So I would probably really enjoy Nichijou as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Nichijou is interesting </joey>
<joey> because I feel it's kind of half, </joey>
<joey> it's like halfway between Sakamoto and Konosuba, </joey>
<connor> in the sense that it's a lot like Sakamoto </connor>
<connor> where like all the jokes are very, </connor>
<connor> you know, expectation defining and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But as you're watching these like short clips of like, </connor>
<connor> because it's basically just a bunch of short jokes </connor>
<connor> put into one episode essentially. </connor>
<connor> But the way that they do it, the way that it's written, </connor>
<connor> is that like each characters </connor>
<connor> like development is you know, very physically defined. </connor>
<connor> So by the end of like the 20 something episodes in Nichijou, </connor>
<connor> you know exactly what these characters like. </connor>
<connor> So there is character development </connor>
<connor> and character comedy within it as well. </connor>
<connor> Which I think is what makes it especially funny </connor>
<connor> where like the more episodes you watch, </connor>
<connor> the more you start to understand, </connor>
<connor> okay, this character is like this </connor>
<connor> and this character is like this. </connor>
<connor> So I can expect some kind of joke like this </connor>
<connor> but then the writing's like, no fuck all of that, </connor>
<connor> that you thought you were gonna expect, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna give you something completely different. </connor>
<connor> And that's what makes it so funny. </connor>
<connor> And of course it's Kyoto Animation. </connor>
<connor> So, you know-- </connor>
<connor> - I've been meaning to watch it like forever. </connor>
<garnt> - I've seen the dead scene, the dead scene </garnt>
<joey> in so many times every time I fucking lose money. </joey>
<joey> Like there are so many layers to that one scene. </joey>
<garnt> It just makes me want to watch Nichijou. </garnt>
<connor> - And especially after, when I helped your film the video </connor>
<joey> with the interview, </joey>
<joey> with the one of the main group's actress. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Honda Mariko, </joey>
<joey> yeah. - Yeah, </joey>
<connor> and she was super chill and nice. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, she was the voice of Yugo. </joey>
<connor> - And I felt bad cause I'm like, </connor>
<joey> I wish I could appreciate. </joey>
<joey> Being in front of you more but. </joey>
<connor> - It was crazy because all regular voice </connor>
<connor> is literally Yugo. </connor>
<connor> It's like I'm talking to Yugo </connor>
<joey> But yeah, it's fucking hilarious. </joey>
<joey> I mean I'm sure people can agree </joey>
<joey> but that's the good thing about Nichijou, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that like unlike Konosuba where you kind of have </joey>
<joey> to like understand the story and the characters. </joey>
<joey> It's very, I feel it's really hard </joey>
<joey> to like watch a Konosuba scene out of context </joey>
<joey> and still be fine. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah I would agree with you </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's the characters that have been built up. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, you need to understand the characters, </joey>
<garnt> but Nichijou somehow there is characters in it </garnt>
<garnt> but they've somehow established the joke </garnt>
<joey> where you can just watch a clip completely out of context </joey>
<joey> and still fucking hilarious. </joey>
<garnt> - Because okay, like to counter off that point </garnt>
<garnt> that's the other show that I can think of </garnt>
<connor> where I got kind of bored quite fast was a Pop Team Epic </connor>
<connor> which you know, </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<garnt> unfortunately, sorry Joey, nothing to do with you </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no it's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I heard you on the Ratio Joey (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I turned that shit off immediately. </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't funny, try again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Pop Team Epic was great </garnt>
<connor> until I realized that not every. </connor>
<connor> - Not funny. </connor>
<connor> - No, no there not every clip was funny. </connor>
<connor> And like, and then I realized that the optimal way </connor>
<connor> to watch Pop Team Epic was just </connor>
<connor> to watch like the YouTube compilations. </connor>
<connor> And so I realized that, hey, I could spend 10 minutes </connor>
<connor> or you know, 20 minutes if you wanna watch both versions </connor>
<garnt> or I could spend like five, three to five minutes </garnt>
<connor> just watching the best. </connor>
<garnt> - I hated how I played twice. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that shit was weird. </joey>
<joey> - It was okay for one episode. </joey>
<joey> But I was like, oh, we're doing that </joey>
<joey> oh we're doing it every episode. </joey>
<joey> - Every time, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I can, you know, having been in the anime, </joey>
<joey> I can confidently say a lot of it wasn't funny. </joey>
<joey> (Both laughing) </joey>
<joey> A lot of was just really stupid in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> - It was very like. </joey>
<connor> - Except the episode I was in that was fun (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That's was a banger. </joey>
<garnt> - That's was in the top 10 anime episodes of all time, </garnt>
<connor> like come on. </connor>
<connor> - It was like way too much Ha Ha XD internet humor, </connor>
<connor> like insulate Meme Humor. </connor>
<connor> A lot of the times I would say the one comedy anime </connor>
<connor> that I'd say pulled that off well </connor>
<joey> but this is going back way back. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if you guys have heard of this anime </joey>
<joey> called Cromartie High School. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I have. </joey>
<joey> - That's like a really, really old anime </joey>
<joey> that kind of predicted a lot of internet and Meme Humor </joey>
<joey> way before way before this was like prevalent </joey>
<joey> in like our culture. </joey>
<joey> And I remember the one clip </joey>
<connor> that's made me watch the entire thing was it was, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember when it came out </connor>
<connor> but it was like early 2000, it was like </connor>
<connor> 2002 or something. - Something like that. </connor>
<connor> - And it was like parodying internet trolls </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> And like the early 2000s something like this, </connor>
<connor> this is fucking brilliant. </connor>
<connor> It was so ahead of his time. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it has aged badly or not badly, </connor>
<garnt> I haven't really watched it in a while, </garnt>
<garnt> but that was also something where the dub </garnt>
<garnt> was fucking brilliant as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember reading the Manga at a friend's place </joey>
<joey> and I've never laughed so hard reading a Manga. </joey>
<connor> - What's an anime that was funny </connor>
<connor> purely because it was just so fucking awful and like. </connor>
<joey> - I mean there's a lot, </joey>
<joey> that's my entire career </joey>
<joey> Just watching bad anime and laughing. </joey>
<connor> - I watched King's Gamefor the first time, </connor>
<connor> I fucking lost it, I couldn't stop laughing as shit. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no King's Game was bad and then there was the dub. </garnt>
<joey> Was just made it, </joey>
<joey> - I didn't watch the dub, is it bad? </joey>
<joey> - I felt so bad cause it was obvious that like, </joey>
<joey> you know it wasn't on their priority. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> It was rough dude, it was rough. </connor>
<joey> - That's a really shame as well because like when I've heard </joey>
<connor> that the King's Game anime, I was like fucking horrible. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh man, I kind like the Manga though. </connor>
<joey> So it's like really a shame </joey>
<joey> that the anime just like completely fucked it. </joey>
<connor> - I can't remember trying watch two episodes </connor>
<connor> where I was like, I've seen enough, I'm just satisfied. </connor>
<connor> Like I was just like fucked dude, this is fucking awful. </connor>
<garnt> - A thing to see that burst out </garnt>
<garnt> or burst a laughing out was I think there was a challenge </garnt>
<connor> where the guy had to sleep with the girl </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<connor> And it's the girl is like the main guy's girlfriend </connor>
<connor> or crush I can't remember what it was, </connor>
<connor> but so it's his best friend who has to sleep with this girl </connor>
<connor> who is the main characters girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna say girlfriend now. </connor>
<connor> And so he doesn't wanna do it, </connor>
<connor> he doesn't want to betrays bro like that. </connor>
<connor> So the main character is trying to fucking argue </connor>
<connor> with this guy to sleep with his girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> And so he refuses, so what he does, this his solution </connor>
<garnt> is to fucking deck the guy in the until he turn conscious </garnt>
<garnt> and then the guy he tells who is girlfriend in the dub </garnt>
<garnt> and just do it while he's unconscious, please. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It is soo bad, my God. </garnt>
<joey> Are you sharing any anime? </joey>
<connor> You think of the top rack? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, my God, I mean I've been meaning to like </connor>
<connor> make a series on my channel where I'd do exactly that </connor>
<connor> where it's take the worst anime and I just love that. </connor>
<connor> Like I don't know a lot of the, </connor>
<connor> like the most horrible ones are like obviously </connor>
<connor> the ones that no ones of fucking horrible. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] True, true, true. </connor>
<connor> So like, I don't know, what's the famous one? </connor>
<connor> Like Skelter Heaven is a famous one. </connor>
<joey> Mass Destruction is a famous one, </joey>
<joey> you have seen any of those? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<garnt> - You have seen any of those? </garnt>
<garnt> - I still haven't seen Mass Destruction. </garnt>
<joey> - Mass Destruction. </joey>
<connor> - Skelter Heaven sounds familiar, I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Skelter, it's like one of the worst </joey>
<garnt> written anime basically. </garnt>
<garnt> Eiken's another worse written anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no Eiken. </joey>
<joey> - I Fucking Eiken is so bad. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. - I love it. </garnt>
<joey> But yeah I mean fucking some videos on them all, </joey>
<connor> but like those ones make sense, all right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's like, of course no one knows them, </connor>
<connor> they're fucking horrible, right? </connor>
<connor> But I'm trying to think like what's like a well known anime? </connor>
<connor> - That's bad. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like horrible. </garnt>
<joey> Like it's cause it's well known because it's bad. </joey>
<garnt> - Because like the only one I can think of </garnt>
<garnt> is this anime called Garzey's Wing, </garnt>
<joey> Which is I would say it's less that's less famous </joey>
<connor> and more infamous. </connor>
<garnt> I'd say like the most other infamous one </garnt>
<garnt> is probably the Ghost Stories dub maybe. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean if we're gonna bring up Ghost Stories. </connor>
<connor> We might as well talk about it. </connor>
<joey> - Okay Ghost Stories dog. </joey>
<connor> - It's fucking legendary. </connor>
<joey> - My favorite fucking dog. </joey>
<connor> - I'll never gonna get anything like that ever again. </connor>
<garnt> - So we never will because do you know </garnt>
<connor> the story behind how that stuff? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I know, a lot about it. </connor>
<joey> - Why don't you explain it for people who don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Basically Ghost Stories is, </garnt>
<garnt> okay what is the actual plot of the show? (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Kids go into an abandoned school building, </joey>
<joey> find ghosts trying resolve. </joey>
<connor> - Isn't just their school building, it's like </connor>
<connor> there just ghosts and they have to use. </connor>
<joey> - No, no there is talking abandoned </joey>
<connor> side of the building, right? </connor>
<joey> It's like the main building and then there's the abandoned. </joey>
<connor> - Who the fuck freaking pays attention? </connor>
<connor> - I paid attention (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That they basically have to get rid of ghosts. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically it's the story doesn't matter. </garnt>
<garnt> What matters is the dub, as it's considered one of the best </garnt>
<garnt> or the best worst dub of all time </garnt>
<connor> or the worst best dub of all time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's weird 'cause online </connor>
<connor> it's seems to be like people can't agree </connor>
<joey> if it's like good or bad </joey>
<joey> and I can't understand how. </joey>
<connor> - It's funny. </connor>
<joey> - It's the room of anime basically. </joey>
<garnt> - So basically what happened is this was a show </garnt>
<garnt> that sold so poorly when aired in Japan, </garnt>
<joey> that when they sold the licenses, </joey>
<joey> they just basically told the licenses, </joey>
<garnt> do whatever you want with this show to make it sell. </garnt>
<connor> Like we don't care, you have all creative, </connor>
<connor> you have all creative control. </connor>
<connor> And so basically they just chip posted in the dub. </connor>
<connor> It's often like seen as the very first Abridged Series </connor>
<connor> because it's basically what happens </connor>
<connor> if a bunch of official doubles just basically fanned up </connor>
<connor> and originally show and fuck about. </connor>
<garnt> And it's one of the most infamous like dubs </garnt>
<garnt> that has ever been released. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't like, the one the puppet kills me every time, </joey>
<connor> he's like the little, the younger Brother, </connor>
<connor> and his entire lifetime, he's just going, yay, yay. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like his mouth moving. </joey>
<joey> But the dog was just like, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna make you cry in every line. </joey>
<connor> - This is a really good video about it by a cartoon type. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember if it did sell badly or not? </connor>
<connor> I know that's the common thing, </connor>
<connor> but I swear there was some point </connor>
<connor> where that actually wasn't the case and it did do well. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember exactly the story, but again, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Cartoon Ciphers are really great </connor>
<connor> like 30 minute video about this whole dub. </connor>
<connor> They spoke to top sources, it's really good video. </connor>
<connor> It's just a really unique dub and also, </connor>
<connor> because of how they recorded it, </connor>
<connor> normally when you record anime, </connor>
<connor> whoever goes in first is like the first to record. </connor>
<connor> So basically they all wanted they go in first </connor>
<connor> so they could like start the improv scene. </connor>
<joey> - [Hosts] Right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> - So everyone to play off of went first. </connor>
<connor> So they were all trying to get in first, </connor>
<connor> it was just interesting because when you're watching it, </connor>
<garnt> you know that you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder who started. - This scene. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because even if they spoke first </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't mean they were the one who recorded first. </garnt>
<connor> So it's fun to try and figure out, </connor>
<connor> I wonder who fuck started the shit joke basically. </connor>
<connor> But it's just such a fun dub </connor>
<connor> and if you, I just watched it all. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah I've seen it all. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've seen it all. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's so fun. </joey>
<garnt> I really wish that we could get something again </garnt>
<connor> but we're never gonna get anything. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, it's. - Different times. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's different times now. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure some of the jokes that was ended up probably </garnt>
<connor> would not be able to have like we couldn't get away </connor>
<connor> with in this day and age. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God, no. God, no. </connor>
<connor> - But it's just such like a timestamp for that time period. </connor>
<connor> And it's just basically all improv as well </connor>
<connor> which is kind of funny how some, </connor>
<connor> it's like some of the jokes I thought were very good </connor>
<connor> and the fact that it wasn't scripted at all </connor>
<garnt> and it was just all improv, I'm just like man this, </garnt>
<joey> I still think it's funny to this day. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Even though it might be slightly, </garnt>
<garnt> you know not politically correct. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's definitely not politically correct. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the Robot scene. </garnt>
<joey> - I was so sad that I would never hear that voice again. </joey>
<connor> His laugh, </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> his funny little requests. </connor>
<connor> - Touch me. </connor>
<connor> - His reprimands. </connor>
<connor> - Touch me harder. </connor>
<connor> (Both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's wait, what was the joke </connor>
<connor> about that rabbit were like it's deadly is so something? </connor>
<garnt> - No, it was like the, </garnt>
<joey> - I can't get with you. </joey>
<garnt> It's not because you're a rabbit it's because you're black. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - Do you remember that one? </connor>
<connor> - (both laughing) Is that a joke? Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it's a joke. </joey>
<joey> And then the rabbit, like in the flashback, </joey>
<connor> the rabbit is like talking in the flashback. </connor>
<connor> He's like touch me harder. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, you'd never get away with that now. </connor>
<connor> I think there's also back then, like there was money in it </connor>
<connor> but the money levels scale is like very different. </connor>
<connor> And I think a lot of the dubbing is focused more </connor>
<connor> on the big shows. </connor>
<joey> - But aside from dubs like what is like </joey>
<joey> universally considered like, </joey>
<joey> this show is just kind of sucks and it's just not very good. </joey>
<joey> It could be objective really bad, </joey>
<joey> like we can be talking like </joey>
<joey> - This is gonna be like hot takes though now like, </joey>
<joey> Is now watch Trash Taste, </joey>
<joey> is all about. - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I can't decide if the reason I thought Higurashi was shit, </joey>
<joey> is because I watched it didn't dub. </joey>
<joey> - That's definitely the reason why we share. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I thought the show kind of sucked </connor>
<connor> after like episode two. </connor>
<connor> I was like, wow, this is really fucking boring. </connor>
<connor> Is it like that normally? </connor>
<connor> Is it boring after episode two </connor>
<connor> or is that because of the dub? </connor>
<joey> - No it's really picks up like near the end, in my opinion. </joey>
<connor> - And again, this is when I watched Higurashi </connor>
<connor> when I first started watching animation, </connor>
<joey> this is nearly like. </joey>
<connor> - Also you've been tainted by the dub. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. - I mean, </connor>
<garnt> we talked about the dub the other day very briefly. </garnt>
<joey> - It will say I've just recently watched Higurashi </joey>
<joey> for the first time and I watched it dubbed. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<connor> And it was a hilarious watch at times because. </connor>
<connor> - It's bad, bad. </connor>
<connor> - Higurashi dub is really bad and it's not like, </connor>
<connor> it's not the kind of bad where it's awful, </connor>
<connor> that he can laugh at. </connor>
<connor> It's just, there's one good voice, </connor>
<connor> I guess, I think. - Yes, yes, yes. </connor>
<connor> - And everyone else has just pretty bad. </connor>
<joey> - Which character is this? </joey>
<connor> - I think it's Shion. </connor>
<garnt> - What color is her hair? That's how I remember (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - [Hosts] Green. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - She is one that did the screaming, </connor>
<connor> a lot of the screaming, right? </connor>
<connor> I remember that was pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen the dub scene where she like </joey>
<joey> does the maniacal screaming. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, and I looked at that clip and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> the dub must be all right. </joey>
<connor> - There is lot of people who when the new show was announced </connor>
<joey> were like I hope you'll bringing back the old cast </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, I hope they don't it remember that, </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) Why would you want? </joey>
<joey> - I think that meant the Japanese cast. </joey>
<connor> - They dubbed it well. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - People are saying, </joey>
<joey> when they saw the Japanese one, </joey>
<joey> they wanted to bring it back. - Why? </joey>
<joey> - It was announced they wanted to bring it back </joey>
<connor> they were like, because there's an argument to be made </connor>
<connor> where it's like, the actors are probably better now </connor>
<connor> and the stuff it's also like (hissing) </connor>
<connor> yeah sometimes they just recasting, </connor>
<connor> get a new slate. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, if they are going to bring back </garnt>
<garnt> the original cast please, like have a real auditioning </garnt>
<joey> you know, (Joey laughing) like </joey>
<joey> please like make them audition </joey>
<joey> because, you know the quality of dubbing </joey>
<connor> is I'd say a lot better now. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It's much better. </connor>
<connor> - Compared to back then there were definitely </connor>
<connor> some very, very good dubs, </connor>
<connor> but it was definitely a much larger spectrum </connor>
<garnt> than you get now, I mean (both laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Some of the dubs that came out after Cowboy Bebop </connor>
<connor> is like, this came at the same time, oh okay, oh no. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when, back in the day </connor>
<connor> when it was like every doubles like mediocre to shit </connor>
<connor> and then there was Cowboy Bebop. </connor>
<connor> And everyone just pointed a Cowboy Bebop </connor>
<connor> as the golden child to be like, </connor>
<joey> not all dubs are bad. </joey>
<joey> We got Cowboy Bebop. (Connor laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It was like the DiCaprio and then (both laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's well even people who like I think, </garnt>
<connor> Brice Patin, I don't know if this is true. </connor>
<connor> I was told this it's a lot of the actors </connor>
<joey> even though they were the voice </joey>
<joey> and there was no problem with the voice and it's great, </joey>
<joey> they still have to audition again for season two, </joey>
<garnt> just to make sure they still there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just to make sure they still got it. </garnt>
<joey> - Just to make sure-- </joey>
<garnt> - I think, I heard that's true. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I'm happy to be corrected on it </connor>
<garnt> but that's what I was told. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah I mean, I thought, I mean </garnt>
<garnt> it might've been because I watched the dub as well </garnt>
<joey> but I just didn't care. </joey>
<garnt> - It was kind of shit right? </garnt>
<connor> - Why would you do that to yourself though? </connor>
<connor> - Okay this is back. </connor>
<connor> Okay, I don't know your 100% did not have this face. </connor>
<connor> - Of course not (all laughing) but, </connor>
<connor> when I first got into anime, </connor>
<connor> I only watched up because I came from like. </connor>
<joey> - No that's understandable. </joey>
<connor> - Right, I was like, I'm not used to it. </connor>
<connor> I rarely, I only do it once every while for a foreign film </connor>
<connor> that everyone says is like amazing. </connor>
<connor> I have to watch them, I have to watch them talk French, </connor>
<connor> fine you know, I don't like doing that, </connor>
<connor> (laughs) get excited. </connor>
<connor> But you know for a very long time I watched only dub </connor>
<connor> and the show happened to be one of the top rated shows </connor>
<connor> and I watched the dub, but it was shit </connor>
<connor> and then I just moved on with my life. </connor>
<garnt> And then obviously later on down the line, </garnt>
<garnt> a show comes out that you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> I really wanna watch the show it's available in sub, </garnt>
<garnt> you make an exception </garnt>
<garnt> and then suddenly everything becomes the exception </garnt>
<joey> and you start watching only sub. </joey>
<connor> It's kinda I think a lot of anime fans go through that </connor>
<connor> where they wanna watch dub if possible. </connor>
<connor> And I kind of know 'cause I'm like you'll come around. </connor>
<connor> You will 'cause there'll be that one show that's coming out. </connor>
<connor> They'll be like, all right, Demon Slayer episode 19. </connor>
<connor> Everyone said it was hype, yes I'm watching. </connor>
<garnt> - Now I whenever I get the chance, </garnt>
<garnt> I watched Dubbed all the time because this, </garnt>
<connor> because there's -- - Come full circle. </connor>
<connor> - This is a chance where I can watch dub, </connor>
<connor> I like a lot less than just me watching sub. </connor>
<connor> So if it's probably, you know, </connor>
<connor> like if it's on Netflix or something, </connor>
<connor> I'm probably gonna wait for the dub </connor>
<connor> like I did for the Great Pretender. </connor>
<connor> Cause I was like I knew I could watch it on Netflix </connor>
<connor> in Japanese with subtitles, </connor>
<connor> but I wanted to wait for it to be dubbed </connor>
<connor> so I could enjoy it in a different time. </connor>
<connor> - I could not express my disappointment in the dub. </connor>
<joey> When they dubbed it like multilingual to begin with. </joey>
<joey> So when they speak in Japanese, they speak in Japanese </joey>
<joey> and when they speaking English, they were speaking English. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Only for the first 10 minutes. </joey>
<connor> And then they just cut, they put a note on screen saying, </connor>
<connor> all right back to normal. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they did that in the Subla </connor>
<connor> as well. - Yeah, as well. </connor>
<joey> But like, why? </joey>
<joey> - Just because I guess, because in the sub </joey>
<joey> for the first 10 minutes, it was the most God awful English, </joey>
<joey> that I've ever heard. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, thank God it's a Japanese. </joey>
<garnt> - The French guy was okay. </garnt>
<joey> - The French guy was fine but. </joey>
<connor> - The Japanese guy sounded like I mean, </connor>
<connor> here's the thing right? </connor>
<joey> - The Japanese guy was like, I've done Duolingo, </joey>
<connor> that's what it sounded like. - He sounded pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> But also (laughing) like what have you said, </connor>
<connor> people speak English here. </connor>
<connor> I don't mind it because when I heard the Japanese people </connor>
<connor> speak broken English, I was like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, that sounds right, yeah cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you enjoy the entire series as much hearing that? </garnt>
<joey> - I would not be able to enjoy the series. </joey>
<joey> - I would not be able to like immerse myself. </joey>
<connor> There's a difference between like. </connor>
<connor> - I don't give it's almost more immersive </connor>
<connor> that he's speaking to me in broken (laughing) English. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's possibly too immersive (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Just like I can't imagine like. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want that kind of immersion. </joey>
<connor> - I can't imagine him being like. </connor>
<connor> - The Anime.. </connor>
<connor> - I can't imagine like a top play like. </connor>
<connor> - The French guy was so good though he had a French accent. </connor>
<connor> - The first guy was good, </connor>
<connor> but I can't imagine like a class A actor, </connor>
<connor> like scamming all these people </connor>
<garnt> with that like broken English you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> I just. - Give me all your money. </garnt>
<connor> - But it's like sometimes in you know, </connor>
<connor> when you watch a Hollywood movie, </connor>
<connor> though they might have like not a main, </connor>
<connor> but like a side character is pretty prominent </connor>
<joey> who could speaks broken English and that's fine. </joey>
<connor> - I don't like it though. </connor>
<connor> - Why aren't you like it? </connor>
<garnt> - Cause it's broken. </garnt>
<connor> - But they're trying their best to learn English. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But, they're not like, they never like the main character </garnt>
<garnt> or the main focus. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess, I don't know there was something </connor>
<connor> that was really like refreshing about hearing a guy </connor>
<garnt> with a Japanese accent, who clearly was Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> speak fluent like Japanese then go to English. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though, I guess they were speaking mainly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because if you have, if you gonna have the show that </garnt>
<garnt> where they speak mainly English, </garnt>
<garnt> then why not just re-dub it so it's, </garnt>
<connor> you know it's. </connor>
<garnt> - So it's fully English. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm sure there was actors out there </connor>
<connor> who sounded Japanese, but were like native quality English. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> that could have been Ken Watanabe, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Someone are like Ken Watanabe's level </garnt>
<garnt> definitely would've worked. </garnt>
<connor> - I love the French guy though, </connor>
<connor> I love the fucking fake French. </connor>
<garnt> - If we could get that level of, what's the word, </garnt>
<connor> I'm looking for? </connor>
<connor> Multi - Multilingual. </connor>
<garnt> - Multilingual </garnt>
<connor> - Fluency, I don't know. - Multilingual fluency. </connor>
<joey> I'm sure (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - That's term (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's the term that we definitely didn't just coin. </joey>
<joey> - I know there's a term for it. </joey>
<connor> I'm just joined out. - I don't fucking know. </connor>
<connor> I have no fucking, don't look at me. </connor>
<joey> - Multilingual fluency. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I get what you mean but don't worry. </joey>
<connor> I get what you're saying. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you know, like if you know like Hollywood films, </connor>
<connor> you always expect when someone's from that country </connor>
<joey> that they come from that country and like, yeah okay, </joey>
<joey> the budget is not even in the same ballpark. </joey>
<connor> But I think it's doable. </connor>
<connor> I would actually wouldn't have minded </connor>
<connor> The Grip Tender with the broken English the whole time. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean it there is a level of broken English </garnt>
<garnt> I would find except for one that was not like, </garnt>
<joey> I would just be like laughing half the time </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's so you know, I love Ken Watanabe, </joey>
<joey> but I don't think I'd be able to watch an entire movie </joey>
<garnt> where 90% Ken Watanabe talking. </garnt>
<garnt> - I could his English is amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ken's English I feel it's good enough. </garnt>
<joey> - It's good, but like even then </joey>
<connor> it's like cutting close with me </connor>
<connor> and like the English in Great Pretender </connor>
<joey> was like no way near that level. </joey>
<connor> - I guess yeah, I'm sure there's actors out there, </connor>
<connor> Japanese who living LA, </connor>
<connor> who could have like probably have done it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> - But did they have the budget for it? </joey>
<joey> I mean, what's wrong with anime. </joey>
<joey> - It just felt like, </joey>
<connor> this was the perfect show to really try and pull that off. </connor>
<joey> Just kind of disappointed. </joey>
<joey> - Also I think it's because like, </joey>
<joey> to most Japanese audiences or watching Great Pretender </joey>
<connor> that level of broken English is like, </connor>
<connor> damn this boy can speak English. </connor>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> Wow, it's basically fluent. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sure Japanese side would have also </connor>
<connor> like to have maybe heard the same thing, right? </connor>
<connor> Why would the English people trying to speak the Japanese </connor>
<connor> sounding somewhat competent, I don't know, amazing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, maybe I don't know, </joey>
<garnt> there might've been like a slight like racism problem </garnt>
<garnt> though involved in that right. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though it's really not racism, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know people always throw that out right. </garnt>
<garnt> Think, like or they speaking in a funny accent </garnt>
<joey> must be racist. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like the rules do work a bit differently </garnt>
<connor> from like live action film to you know, </connor>
<connor> dubbed you know and voice acting and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Because the expectation isn't that you can get </connor>
<connor> like a multilingual cast it's that, </connor>
<connor> there's like one spoken language </connor>
<connor> and we should speak that one spoken language </connor>
<garnt> and everything else is like it can be possible. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess like yeah when you watch, </connor>
<connor> what's a movie with like multiple languages. </connor>
<joey> I guess because if it has multiple languages, </joey>
<joey> you wouldn't follow right? - Inglourious Basterds </joey>
<connor> I guess yeah you wouldn't need a dub right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess that makes sense. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean in Inglorious bastards, </garnt>
<connor> they you know they put subtitles, I think </connor>
<garnt> when they speak different languages? </garnt>
<garnt> - Hard coded on the movie. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, in movie, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I know, ,cause I watched a movie recently </connor>
<connor> that was about like World War II. </connor>
<connor> Also really fucking awkward being the only white guy </connor>
<connor> in like a World War II movie about like the Japanese </connor>
<connor> being like destroyed. </connor>
<connor> I was just sitting there and like my seat like this, </connor>
<joey> like I'm American. </joey>
<joey> - Just waving the flags. </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause like you know, like when the, if I can like, </connor>
<connor> there was like the planes were being bombed and shit. </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, do I like feel happy </connor>
<joey> that the Japanese go like whooped here? </joey>
<joey> Are they happy, are they like, damn those Americans. </joey>
<joey> They got us, it was weird. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> I didn't know like what the vibe is in the cinema. </connor>
<garnt> (All laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Considering have we talked about that time we watched, </garnt>
<connor> what's that film? </connor>
<connor> Fukushima </connor>
<connor> - 50 - Fukushima 50. </connor>
<connor> So that we. </connor>
<connor> - Holy Joey wasn't there. </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't there. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, is it called Fukushima 50? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Fukushima 50. </connor>
<connor> - So there was this film that was made in Japan </connor>
<connor> about the whole Fukushima tragedy. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like how to couch. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like how to couch. </connor>
<connor> So we got invited to like a private screening of it. </connor>
<garnt> So we got an early copy of it. </garnt>
<connor> - To give our thoughts to them. </connor>
<garnt> - And you know, the whole film, you know it's. </garnt>
<connor> - Ken Watanabe is in it, </connor>
<connor> it's fucking amazing. - Ken Watanabe is in it. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I've got you. </connor>
<connor> - There's you know, I'd rate it a good like six out of 10, </connor>
<connor> there was some really good moments </connor>
<connor> and then there were some really boring moments. </connor>
<connor> And then there were these moments in it </connor>
<connor> where they focused on these American characters </connor>
<garnt> and the like the American military, </garnt>
<garnt> who wanted to you know he wanted to help Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And for one, some of them weren't even American. </garnt>
<connor> There was this like. </connor>
<garnt> - They're like South Africans </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there is one African dude in it. </garnt>
<garnt> - They were like South African </garnt>
<garnt> in this American military boardroom </garnt>
<garnt> and he sounded didn't even try to fucking hide it. </garnt>
<connor> He sounded like such a fix (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it's not a like a light accent South Africa, </connor>
<connor> it's really fucking for long. </connor>
<connor> And I was just so confusing and yeah, go on. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't remember the exact line, </garnt>
<connor> but there was this one, do you remember the exact line? </connor>
<connor> - I do, I do. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay do you wanna explain the exact line? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm actually paraphrasing, </garnt>
<connor> but it was roughly something like. </connor>
<garnt> - So there okay to explain the scene </garnt>
<garnt> before he says the line. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was so obviously the Fukushima emergency was happening </garnt>
<connor> and the Americans were like discussing how to help, </connor>
<connor> help the Japanese and how to provide aid </connor>
<garnt> and stuff like that. </garnt>
<connor> - All these scenes were shot like, </connor>
<connor> so the Japanese scenes were shot like perfect, </connor>
<connor> the cinematography was on point. </connor>
<connor> And then it cut to like a fucking sit-com quality </connor>
<connor> looking camera cuts. </connor>
<connor> He looked really shit and then the act is opened their mouth </connor>
<connor> and you're like oh fuck. </connor>
<connor> And imagine a script right? </connor>
<connor> Of how Japanese people think </connor>
<connor> that American people talk about the war. </connor>
<connor> That's the only way I can describe how the Americans spoke, </connor>
<connor> because it was like, the one line was like, when it, </connor>
<connor> like it blew up, actually to the Americans they were like </connor>
<connor> men, you think they would have learned </connor>
<connor> how to handle nuclear technology after we nuked them? </connor>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<connor> And I was like the line and we all looked at each other, </connor>
<connor> like you just say that, what the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like we were in like this like private screening. </garnt>
<garnt> We looked around, it was me, Connor, Sydney and Malin </garnt>
<connor> and then every like just Japanese businessmen. </connor>
<connor> And the Japanese businessmen were like fully immersed, </connor>
<connor> they were quiet and we're like, </connor>
<connor> yeah this is not American speak. </connor>
<connor> And I was looking around a Connor, Sydney and Malin </connor>
<connor> and we were just all like. </connor>
<connor> - Like Joey's like. </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck did we just here? </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) Is this okay? </connor>
<connor> - I'm like what? They can't say that, can they? </connor>
<connor> it was just so bad </connor>
<joey> and I was just so bad, so bad. </joey>
<joey> - And then just like to imagine the </joey>
<joey> fucking South African guy </joey>
<joey> and be like, I agree with everyone in this room right now. </joey>
<joey> - South African guys said it. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And there's just every time it was like, </connor>
<connor> please don't cut to the Americans, </connor>
<connor> please don't cut to the America </connor>
<connor> don't cuts the fucking American </connor>
<garnt> - He was just like an 80 SIMCOM, </garnt>
<garnt> it's already fucking right </garnt>
<garnt> and they had like this flashback scene as well, </garnt>
<connor> with this one character, there's one American general </connor>
<connor> who had no play in the plot or whatever </connor>
<connor> had zero screen time and then they just randomly </connor>
<connor> cuts to a flashback of him in Japan. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, why is this in the film? </connor>
<connor> - And then like towards the end, </connor>
<connor> there's just the shot of like the Americans coming </connor>
<connor> and giving water bottles to them </connor>
<connor> and it's like, all right sick. </connor>
<connor> I'll take a bottle of heavy in hell I do. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Just been nuked, but thanks for the water bro. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This will really save us, thanks America. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Like if that line was in an American film. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. - The fucking shit storm. </connor>
<connor> It would start. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the thing bro, it's okay 'cause it's </garnt>
<garnt> written like, I assume, </garnt>
<connor> it was written by a Japanese and outsource </connor>
<connor> to like an American company on a budget, </connor>
<connor> I'm fucking guessing. </connor>
<joey> - American like outsourcing </joey>
<joey> was like we have to translate this? </joey>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<joey> Are we lancing, is this is right? </joey>
<connor> - It was fine, I just try not to go to films </connor>
<connor> where Japanese the bad guys, I've kind of learned my lesson. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's brutal. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I thought I was gonna watch Tenant, </connor>
<connor> but it turned out it was just a war movie. </connor>
<connor> I genuinely got the wrong tickets (laughs) the wrong thing. </connor>
<connor> I paid for the wrong tickets. </connor>
<connor> I wanna watch Tenant, I did watch Tenant, </connor>
<connor> really good by the way. </connor>
<garnt> Watch it, yeah it's basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna watch that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like Inception, but more mind fuck I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - Anyway, what we talking about? </connor>
<garnt> - We talking bad anime and we go on another turn. </garnt>
<connor> - Why do they talk about the cinema? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't fucking know about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Everyone can scroll back. </garnt>
<connor> - We can't do that though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, everyone's gonna be like, it's so obvious. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what you're talking about please everyone. </connor>
<garnt> Higurashi right? Or some shit. - That's right. </garnt>
<garnt> - We were talking about Higurashi. </garnt>
<joey> - How you guys willingly... </joey>
<joey> - The actors pretending-- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I would like, I'm going to watch </joey>
<connor> the remake of Higurashi in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> 'cause the reason I watched in Japan </connor>
<connor> was 'cause like you know. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna re-watch in Japanese anyway, it's on Netflix, </connor>
<connor> I might as well watch it. </connor>
<connor> I thought he was an okay time, </connor>
<connor> honestly I was paying half attention half the time. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] You know. </connor>
<connor> - Because I was fucking doing arc nights roles, </connor>
<connor> I don't fucking remember. </connor>
<garnt> - (Joey laughing) Keeping his priorities straight. </garnt>
<connor> - I watched an episode of Anohana again, </connor>
<connor> kind of thought of shit. </connor>
<connor> I've watched all of Anohana, and I agree. </connor>
<garnt> - I was looking at you to be like </garnt>
<connor> don't you dare I finish the sentence sir, </connor>
<joey> don't drop the eSports </joey>
<garnt> - It was kind of shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I watched Anohana like three years ago </garnt>
<connor> and I fucking bawled my eyes out, great time. </connor>
<connor> I watched to the episode one again I'm like, wow, </connor>
<connor> I stuck at this episode. </connor>
<connor> - Nothing happens in episode one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's why shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Episode one was by far the worst episode of Anohana. </garnt>
<garnt> The episode one of Anohana of almost put me off of Anohana. </garnt>
<connor> - That makes it kind of shit bro. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I thought when it first started, </garnt>
<joey> I thought he was like some Lolly fan service Baits. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember seeing where men must sit on his lap </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, (Joey laughing) here we fucking go again. </joey>
<connor> - The guy is like fuck, here we go again. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I was just like, another Lolly bait Fan Service show. </connor>
<garnt> And then I think it was like halfway through episode </garnt>
<garnt> like there all like the end of episode two or three </garnt>
<garnt> where I actually got emotionally invested. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember episode one was like pretty bad. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you think if Anohana came out today, </connor>
<joey> it would be given the same level of respect that it's given? </joey>
<joey> I don't think you could hold to it. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think so because at the time </joey>
<joey> that Anohana came out, there were very few shows </joey>
<connor> that went in that direction. - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> I feel like and especially with like how short the show was, </connor>
<connor> like it managed to do something in 12 episodes </connor>
<joey> that a lot of anime struggled to do in late 20 plots. </joey>
<joey> - That's right they were like kind anime. </joey>
<joey> Now if you go watch it back, I don't think. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair that you only watched episode one, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't watch it all again, </connor>
<connor> I watched just episode one again. </connor>
<joey> - Well then that's probably why you thought it shit </joey>
<joey> because you watched the worst episode. </joey>
<joey> - But after I watched it, </joey>
<connor> I was like how the did I make it </connor>
<connor> to episode two after I watched this? 'Cause it was shit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's the same as like every person </joey>
<joey> who watches like the first episode of Steins Gate </joey>
<connor> and it's like, why would I continue to watch it? </connor>
<connor> - Episode one of Steins Gate is good, right? I think. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it was a little boring. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember thinking. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was looking outside half the time, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fucking remember anything. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - For some reason with anime like I do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why did you start to re-watch it? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it was Emirichu, </connor>
<connor> Emirichu she told me, she thought it was shit </connor>
<connor> and I thought no, it's good right, it's good. </connor>
<connor> So I went back and rewatched it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but I guarantee Emily also </joey>
<joey> only watched episode one and was like, it's shit. </joey>
<connor> - No, she watched all of that, she said, </connor>
<joey> but she watched it recently. - Oh, well then. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Common and defend yourself, Emily </connor>
<garnt> - I've watched Anohana and felt like, four times I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - Four times? - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I've only rewatched it once and I thought it was so. </connor>
<connor> - We'd have flying cars by now, </connor>
<joey> people stop rewatching anime this many times, </joey>
<garnt> are you fucking kidding? </garnt>
<connor> Four times why? </connor>
<garnt> - Because I remember I think Anahona </garnt>
<connor> was the very first anime that got me to cry. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember back and forth before I watched Anahona, </connor>
<connor> I was like stone-faced, I can never cry during anime. </connor>
<connor> - And she like this watching. </connor>
<joey> - I ain't no bitch. </joey>
<joey> - I'm a real man </joey>
<connor> and then like a bitch the first time I watched Anahona. </connor>
<connor> And like after I watch Anahona, </connor>
<connor> it was so fucking long before I could find like other shows </connor>
<garnt> that I could, you know bring a tear to my eye. </garnt>
<garnt> I tried watching Clannad, that just didn't fucking happen. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean it's so easy to make me cry, </garnt>
<garnt> like I feel like just the right beeps </garnt>
<connor> and boops will make me cry right. </connor>
<garnt> - You find one good dub person and you're like. </garnt>
<connor> I love this beeps and boops. - You're soo beautiful. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, so like the reason I re-watched it so many times </garnt>
<joey> was whenever I felt like I just need a good cry right now. </joey>
<joey> But so I would just put on Anahona just to like, </joey>
<garnt> get just get those emotions out. </garnt>
<connor> - It takes you that much to get a cry out? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Before I can. </connor>
<connor> - Can you not just like do it just like on command? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, if I'm fit. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I didn't know I put that there, Malin is like what? So. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> I've got to prepare myself, that's how I was spilling tears. </joey>
<joey> That's how I do it on Quebec. </joey>
<connor> No, so if I feel like I need to cry, </connor>
<connor> like as you say you feel like you need to cry, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I need that push, I need to like listen to that song </garnt>
<garnt> or I watch the anime. </garnt>
<connor> - I pretty much replicate what that guy did </connor>
<connor> in the best cry ever video of like that. </connor>
<connor> (mimicking crying) </connor>
<connor> I basically like just sit there and I'm like. </connor>
<connor> (mimicking crying) </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then once you get it started, </connor>
<connor> it like goes you know for like 30 seconds. </connor>
<garnt> - But, does that feel the same as like normal? </garnt>
<joey> - You can watch a fucking KFC commercial and start crying. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> If I'm in the right mood, honestly yeah. </joey>
<joey> If it's like an emotional soundtrack to it </joey>
<connor> like I could get it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the thing is right it's like Wank. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> It's just a different type of Wank, right? </connor>
<connor> And my mind I'm like they both feel </connor>
<joey> the exact same when you've done it. </joey>
<connor> Like when you cry, it feels like a relief, when you wank. </connor>
<joey> - Have you ever cry wanked? </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I don't dare try to mix the two. </connor>
<connor> - You know how easy this is for you. </connor>
<joey> - He hasn't read metamorphosis. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Read more metamorphosis you'll know the definition </joey>
<joey> of a cry wank. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - When you do that cry without urge, </connor>
<connor> do you not feel like when you stop crying you're like, ah. </connor>
<garnt> - No that's why we put it on because before that </garnt>
<connor> I just couldn't cry. </connor>
<connor> - How's the whole process take to make you cry? </connor>
<garnt> How many episodes do you wanna watch for you start crying? </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean so. </garnt>
<connor> - Lemme skip to the right path. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, so if we go beyond just </joey>
<joey> re-watching the entire thing, </joey>
<joey> sometimes I would just like, if I needed a quick cry </joey>
<joey> like if I needed like a five minute wank </joey>
<garnt> or whatever I'm like a cry WanK, </garnt>
<garnt> I would just put on the final episode, I'd be like </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, wait you just said cry wanked </joey>
<garnt> to the ending of Anahona. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no (Joey and Connor hamming) </joey>
<connor> - Using the same analogy. </connor>
<connor> If I needed that, like quick set, like. </connor>
<connor> - Skip the blow job right. </connor>
<joey> (Connor laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Go right to penetration. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, just straight into tears, </garnt>
<connor> you go to like the fucking end of Anahona. </connor>
<connor> If I needed like the full buildup or anything, </connor>
<connor> if I had like a whole day to waste </connor>
<joey> and I was just fell If I just felt emotional the entire day </joey>
<joey> if I just had a shit day and I just needed to cry it out, </joey>
<garnt> I just re-watch Anahona. </garnt>
<joey> - I was about to say like, </joey>
<joey> I had kind of imagine someone being like fuck </joey>
<joey> I need to cry or I tell time to invest six hours </joey>
<joey> into this year. </joey>
<connor> - I just feel like you say no or something like. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> How did you start crying man? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I completely like relate to the, </connor>
<connor> if I need to cry, then like a good song will do </connor>
<connor> that to me instantly. </connor>
<connor> Like I know, I have like a list, </connor>
<connor> immediately I'm just saying, I know </connor>
<connor> if I put this song on. - Men need to cry more. </connor>
<connor> I know the exact timestamp </connor>
<connor> as to where the tears will start coming. </connor>
<connor> - Men should start, men should cry more. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like men should cry more </connor>
<connor> like once I discovered Anahona, </connor>
<connor> I was on a fucking mission to find my next anime </connor>
<connor> that could make cry. </connor>
<connor> - That next time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was because I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I've always had like trouble crying </connor>
<connor> or show my emotion like publicly or whatever. </connor>
<connor> For some reason like watching, </connor>
<connor> like the saddest thing could happen to me IRL right? </connor>
<connor> I just don't cry, I don't know why like for example, </connor>
<connor> like I fucking love my grandmother, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I thought this entire time when I, </connor>
<connor> you know when she passed away and I went to her funeral, </connor>
<connor> but I couldn't shed some tears. </connor>
<connor> I for some reason I just couldn't shed tears, </connor>
<connor> even though I knew I cared about her. </connor>
<joey> Like I loved her as like family </joey>
<joey> and like one of the person I like. </joey>
<joey> - But that's a thing like, you don't have to like, </joey>
<garnt> show that emotion, express it like you know </garnt>
<garnt> outside to feel it right? </garnt>
<garnt> - But for some reason, watching a good scene in an anime </garnt>
<connor> or watching that one anime that just brings it out. </connor>
<garnt> That just gets it out full me. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's feels like it feel safe at home, right? </connor>
<connor> Like you feel like, all right, I can be vulnerable, right? </connor>
<connor> I can do this here. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you cry in front of other people though? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I can't. </connor>
<garnt> - When I'm in a movie with someone, </garnt>
<connor> doesn't matter who it is, if it's fucking sad, I'll be like. </connor>
<joey> - Are you one of those people who like watches </joey>
<connor> like something really emotional on a plane </connor>
<connor> that you can cry on a plane? </connor>
<connor> - I can cry on a plane. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> I think I have cried on the plane (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm like fucking you checking out. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I'm definitely one of those people who are like, </joey>
<connor> if I watch, 'cause I watch Maki on a plane </connor>
<connor> and I fucking cry like basically on, </connor>
<joey> but I had to like really just strain my eyes and be like. </joey>
<joey> I cannot show weakness to the person sit next to me. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's a subconscious thing for me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if there's other people around, </connor>
<connor> like there are sometimes that I want to cry, </connor>
<connor> I want to cry </connor>
<connor> and it just sometimes when there's someone else there </connor>
<connor> I just lose like froze for a split second, </connor>
<connor> I lose the immersion and then I'm like, </connor>
<connor> ah, I got to build up myself like the tears, </connor>
<connor> have to build up again. </connor>
<connor> And it's crying hard for me, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I value it whenever something does make me cry, </connor>
<joey> which is why I've really value for example your name. </joey>
<joey> Because that was the only time I've ever cried in a cinema </joey>
<joey> with other people around me. </joey>
<joey> But that was less because it was sad and more </joey>
<connor> because there's like, there's just so many emotions </connor>
<connor> right now, this is beautiful, </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) I just have to let it out somehow. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll go on, I was on a train </garnt>
<garnt> and I was on the Yamanote Line or something. </garnt>
<joey> I was watching a video and it's actually about </joey>
<joey> like they in Japan, they have like cinemas to make men cry. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that. </joey>
<joey> And so I was watching this video about like, </joey>
<joey> where they make basically, </joey>
<joey> they just Cry Porn to a bunch of Japanese businessman. </joey>
<connor> And it was kinda like a game show almost in this video, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was like, this one guy was just refusing to cry. </connor>
<connor> And then right at the final clip like the sixth one </connor>
<connor> is like a fucking tear as he's like. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) soo funny. </connor>
<connor> - That's so funny. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah as they were describing like, </connor>
<connor> this woman was describing what was in the clips, </connor>
<connor> did I show you? </connor>
<connor> It just hurt describing it, </connor>
<connor> I was fucking like tearing up on the Yamanote Line, </connor>
<connor> so fucking sad 'cause it was something like </connor>
<connor> there was so like a kid's mom passes away </connor>
<connor> and he's helping with his dad only </connor>
<connor> and he is like is so fucking sad. </connor>
<connor> Holy fuck, I don't want to go through that. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, man it's like, </joey>
<joey> - I know there's nothing wrong with like crying in public. </joey>
<connor> I don't know this is. </connor>
<garnt> - Is not like full on, I'm just like shedding you tears. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, but even like shedding tears, </garnt>
<connor> like I have like I don't know, </connor>
<joey> I have some kind of restriction with it. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's just a subconscious mental block. </joey>
<joey> I don't know 'cause I have exactly the same thing </joey>
<joey> and I wish I could like bring out my emotions more easily, </joey>
<joey> but because it takes me so many fucking steps </joey>
<connor> to get to that point. </connor>
<connor> You know that's why. </connor>
<connor> - I don't give a fuck though, </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) A lot of things in public. </connor>
<connor> - It's not about giving a fuck like I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> I don't know something. </connor>
<connor> - Do you give a fuck? </connor>
<connor> - No I'm not like, I'm like in my head, </connor>
<connor> I'm like cry, cry, cry, cry, cry. </connor>
<garnt> - No! (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - And then something my brain is just like no, </connor>
<garnt> don't do it, don't do it. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess there is like some it's, </connor>
<connor> you know just mental block that even </connor>
<connor> when you know you should it's like your brain </connor>
<connor> is like but don't. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think it was just the way I was raised, I guess. </connor>
<connor> So somethings, sometimes you've realize, </connor>
<connor> man the way you were, how you're raised as a kid </connor>
<joey> is pretty fucking important too. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it like affects how your like, </joey>
<connor> how you subconsciously think for like the rest of your life. </connor>
<connor> And it takes so much more effort to unlearn something, </connor>
<connor> than to like relearn. </connor>
<garnt> Which is like learned something for the first time. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you ever like catch yourself doing something </connor>
<connor> that your parents used to do to you when you were a kid, </connor>
<joey> like the way they would talk of it like? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember like, I think what was it like? </connor>
<connor> My dad used to have this really specific way </connor>
<connor> of making excuses up. </connor>
<connor> I caught myself doing it one time and I was like, </connor>
<connor> fuck I picked it up. </connor>
<joey> - Is that moment where you're like shit, I am my dad's kid. </joey>
<joey> - (all laughing) Fuck! </joey>
<joey> - I'm becoming. </joey>
<connor> - I thought I was superior this whole time, </connor>
<joey> but I was just equal. </joey>
<joey> - That's the thing right? </joey>
<garnt> It's like you listened to your dad </garnt>
<garnt> all your life. - You know all the bullshit </garnt>
<garnt> that your parents do. </garnt>
<connor> You listen to it all your life </connor>
<connor> and then when you get to like your teens and you hear it, </connor>
<garnt> you make fun of them for being like, </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm never gonna be like. </garnt>
<joey> - And then years later you catch yourself doing it </joey>
<joey> and be like, oh no! (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I was the same this entire time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's been a lot of like. </connor>
<connor> - Always has been </connor>
<joey> - I've had to like physically like </joey>
<joey> and mentally just be like, don't do this, don't do this, </joey>
<connor> don't do this thing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I thought they were like weird things, </connor>
<connor> nothing bad but like just little quirks </connor>
<joey> that my parents would do that. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like certain ways you say things </joey>
<connor> where you're just like, this is the first time me saying it </connor>
<connor> but for some reason I've heard it before. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, you are like fuck my parents, </connor>
<joey> they planted the seeds. </joey>
<connor> (All laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, I mean, Anahona, I still love it to this day. </garnt>
<connor> - Made, made, I surely love the word made. </connor>
<connor> - If that's the case, </connor>
<garnt> what anime would you recommend to someone to make them cry? </garnt>
<connor> What's it? </connor>
<garnt> - Golden Time. </garnt>
<connor> - What is that Golden Time? </connor>
<connor> - Is that the right name? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, Golden Time </garnt>
<connor> - I always fucking call it something different by accident </connor>
<connor> like golden week or some shit. </connor>
<garnt> - To me Golden Time is in the same categories </garnt>
<connor> as Anahona for like. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a cult though, I like the cult, I'm kidding. </garnt>
<joey> (both laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I just found that whole call awkwardly dumb </garnt>
<garnt> and I really enjoy how stupid that </garnt>
<joey> - I can't even remember that. </joey>
<joey> - I can't even remember. </joey>
<joey> - There was a part where she was like brainwashed </joey>
<connor> in a cult or some shit that happened, I think so. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I'm basically a patient in waiting. </connor>
<joey> So I mean I'm probably the wrong person. </joey>
<joey> - I definitely didn't get a cry bone a lot </joey>
<connor> from watching Golden Time. </connor>
<connor> - What is another show that it's like really good cry upon? </connor>
<connor> An anime. </connor>
<connor> What's the best Cry Porn Anime? </connor>
<joey> - I mean anything by </joey>
<joey> - Shinkai - Jun Maeda right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, anything Maeda Jun, anything Shinkai. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not one of those people who knows. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay Maeda Jun is like, Clannad, AngelBeats, </connor>
<connor> Little busters anything by Keys studios basically, </connor>
<joey> it's like pretty good cry porn.. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't find any Angelbeats as sad as everyone else, </joey>
<joey> cause I felt like. </joey>
<connor> - I cried because of the angels. </connor>
<connor> - It was obvious it was gonna happen though. </connor>
<garnt> - I felt exactly the same way. </garnt>
<joey> It was my same problem with Clannad, </joey>
<connor> just less stretched out where he was so obviously </connor>
<connor> trying to make you cry. </connor>
<connor> It was yeah, it's literally just Cry Porn </connor>
<connor> where you just. </connor>
<connor> - He was going to cry, he was crying, aren't you? </connor>
<garnt> - Sometimes just to like make you cry </garnt>
<garnt> and make you shed tears. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but I have like an initial, </joey>
<garnt> like my Cry Porn was raw card the moment I see Maeda Jun, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, I know it's like, I don't even have to watch it </garnt>
<joey> and I'm already prepared, you know? </joey>
<connor> - So I just googled Saddest anime, just Saddest anime </connor>
<connor> and Google says, number one, Anohana. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - See Emily? Even Google agrees. </joey>
<connor> - Plastic Memories, which is was. </connor>
<joey> - Plastic Memories it's okay. </joey>
<connor> - I wish you knew again. </connor>
<connor> - It was just basically Kansa with waifu's waiting. </connor>
<joey> It's like it was. </joey>
<garnt> (both laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like I Want To Eat Your Pancreas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually I Want To Eat Your Pancreas fucking brilliant. </garnt>
<garnt> - I Want To Eat Your Pancreas is a fucking cry. </garnt>
<connor> - Angel Beats. - Angel Beats, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Madoka Magica </connor>
<joey> - Madoka, I didn't cry at the end of Madoka Magica. </joey>
<garnt> - There's a difference between sad and bleak. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like Madoka Magica here is more on the bleak side. </joey>
<joey> - Madoka Magica is like grief crying. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - There's Guilty Crown. </connor>
<connor> - (Garnt laughing) Guilty Crown? Why? </connor>
<joey> - I cried because of how bad the ending was, </joey>
<joey> if that's what they mean by that. </joey>
<connor> - Was a Stein's actually, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I really liked Guilty Crown, I would just say it. </connor>
<joey> I like it. - The ending though? </joey>
<joey> - I like all of Guilty Crown. </joey>
<garnt> Really? - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what Connor, I'm absolutely there with you. </connor>
<connor> - (both laughing) Yes, yes. </connor>
<connor> It's the one fucking time me and Connor agree. </connor>
<connor> - People need to stop comparing it to as a Code Geass. </connor>
<connor> Code Geass is in it's its own world. </connor>
<connor> - How do you compared to that </connor>
<connor> I don't compare to Code Geass </connor>
<joey> but I still thought the ending was amazing. </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't the best ending of the world, </joey>
<joey> but man it was a fucking good run. </joey>
<joey> - It was entertaining as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - It was beautiful - Did you cry though? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I probably did. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was actually this close to crying </garnt>
<connor> and that's it wasn't because of the story, </connor>
<connor> it was just because of how. - The music. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - The beeps and the boops were soo hype. </connor>
<connor> - Okay here's the thing, </connor>
<connor> the thing about me in crying is that </connor>
<connor> music has so much more power over me (mumbles) does. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's if there's a good soundtrack, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like almost always close to crying. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, why do you think I cried, </joey>
<garnt> to everything Maeda Jun does? </garnt>
<garnt> Because he makes the music as well, </garnt>
<garnt> which makes me cry like a bitch. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, I don't know like I liked it, </garnt>
<connor> the Guilty Crown had it's like emotional moments </connor>
<connor> and obviously, you know the soundtrack was good, </connor>
<connor> but like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> my cry bone was like a half child the entire time. </connor>
<connor> I was like, - I really liked it. </connor>
<connor> - It's like it was so close. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe it's because I haven't watched it </connor>
<garnt> in four or five years, but maybe it's Garnt tinted glasses </garnt>
<connor> I'm looking through an app and I really enjoying it. </connor>
<garnt> - I really enjoyed it not in the sense where, </garnt>
<garnt> hey I'm gonna recommend this as a good show. </garnt>
<garnt> I really enjoyed it in the sense </garnt>
<garnt> where it was just here's a lot of dub anime tropes </garnt>
<connor> that I enjoy. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna, I don't care if they make any sense </connor>
<connor> whether they put these anime tropes in, </connor>
<connor> but (laughs) it's just like a lot of good popcorn fun. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's was great show. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's kind of reminds me, </joey>
<joey> I remember when Darling In The Franxx first aired, </joey>
<connor> I called Darling In The Franxxto guilty crown </connor>
<connor> of this generation (Joey and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I kind of still agree with myself on that point </connor>
<joey> where Darling In The Franxx got stupid as fuck </joey>
<joey> but he was entertainingly stupid. </joey>
<joey> - Of course. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I mean, the thing about Darling In The Franxx is that </connor>
<connor> I went through a whole fucking emotional arc with it </connor>
<connor> because it was the first half I would say </connor>
<connor> was actually legitimately good. </connor>
<connor> - Did you watch your weekly by the way? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I did watch weekly. </connor>
<connor> So I already thought that Darling In The Franxx </connor>
<connor> was a great character drama with MXNet </connor>
<connor> and I was super, super emotionally invested, </connor>
<joey> in this as a series. </joey>
<joey> And then the fucking space thing happens and then it went. </joey>
<joey> - More trigger was like, let me introduce myself. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly, and my enjoyment for Darling In The Franxx </joey>
<joey> kind of just shifted off that. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't, I wasn't emotionally attached to anymore, </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't that same kind of enjoyment, </garnt>
<garnt> it was just the look at all this happening out of enjoyment. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think when you watch a show weekly, </garnt>
<connor> I think like you're almost more likely </connor>
<connor> to think it's better than it is, if it's </connor>
<garnt> like holding your attention. </garnt>
<connor> - I disagree. - Really? </connor>
<garnt> - I think watching something like not having to wait </garnt>
<garnt> and just marathoning something I've enjoyed shows </garnt>
<garnt> that I haven't enjoyed weekly </garnt>
<garnt> that I've watched a of marathons. </garnt>
<connor> - Really like what? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I almost find that when you wait a week </connor>
<connor> for something that you're kind of excited for, right, </connor>
<connor> you almost like hype yourself up for it, </connor>
<connor> unlike, think that it's like, how written it is. </connor>
<connor> - It's hard for me to say though, </connor>
<joey> because haven't watched an anime weekly </joey>
<joey> since like High School. </joey>
<connor> - Been were watching Re:Zero weekly. </connor>
<connor> And I think maybe there's an aspect </connor>
<connor> of me that thinks it's better because the mystery being </connor>
<connor> like drip fed because of having to wait a week at a time. </connor>
<connor> - Right but I think that only works </connor>
<joey> because it's a mystery, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I actually Re:Zero is that exact show. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember enjoying it watching it weekly </garnt>
<connor> and I kind of only kept up with it cause it was my job. </connor>
<connor> And I remember re-watching it all at once </connor>
<connor> after there was no pressure to like keep up </connor>
<connor> little bit of review. </connor>
<connor> And I enjoyed it way more watching it all at once </connor>
<connor> and not having to wait weekly </connor>
<connor> even though I knew what was gonna happen. </connor>
<garnt> And that's why I haven't like I've kept up kind of </garnt>
<garnt> with Re:Zero Season Two, but I watch it in chunks. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not completely up to date with it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I wonder, </garnt>
<connor> cause I watched Attack on Titan season three, four, two. </connor>
<joey> Is that the title? </joey>
<connor> - Like the latest one. </connor>
<connor> - I watched that weekly. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, the latest one. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know if it's because like, </connor>
<connor> it's I watched it weekly and every single week was like, </connor>
<connor> oh my God, I have to wait a week, this is so hype. </connor>
<joey> This is the best thing ever. </joey>
<joey> But like in my memory, season three part two </joey>
<joey> which is fucking like God, God tear </joey>
<joey> - I marathon did and it was still do. </joey>
<joey> - It's still like that amazing even if like. </joey>
<joey> - Or I mean I don't know how you're feeling about it. </joey>
<connor> - Obviously like it's pretty one of the best anime </connor>
<connor> I've ever watched if not like it's like top two. </connor>
<joey> - I mean I binged the entire thing in a day. </joey>
<connor> It's so, it's fucking amazing. - it's fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> We've already sung the praises of talking title a ton </connor>
<connor> on this podcast. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's one of the few ratios </joey>
<joey> where it's like weekly or not. </joey>
<joey> It's just objectively a fucking great show. </joey>
<joey> You know like the experience I think is just as powerful. </joey>
<connor> - Spoiler Alert just for like one minute here. </connor>
<connor> Whenever the video comes up my recommended </connor>
<connor> of Levi versus the Beast Titan, I'm like, I've got time. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I've got time for three more minutes </connor>
<joey> of that Spoiler Warning. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah lets agree. </joey>
<joey> - Well, we somehow got onto good anime now, </joey>
<connor> let's go back to that anime, the worst anime ever. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know what I mean. </garnt>
<joey> - What's like a famous, like what's like a show </joey>
<joey> that is like, not universally praised </joey>
<joey> but it's like, not like, it's not like Garzey's Wing </joey>
<joey> like Mass Destruction where like the only reason </joey>
<joey> why it's known is because it's bad. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know because, here's the thing </garnt>
<joey> if there's a bad anime, I'm likely not to watch it </joey>
<joey> or finish it right. </joey>
<joey> Because, okay here's the thing, if something's </joey>
<joey> as bad as Garzey's Wing or something </joey>
<connor> then I'm gonna finish it. </connor>
<connor> But I still think it's good </connor>
<connor> because it gives me some kind of entertainment value. </connor>
<connor> What I don't like the worst thing an anime can do </connor>
<garnt> for me is just be boring. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's B made. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not going to lie. </connor>
<connor> I got to High School kind of shit, kind of shit. </connor>
<garnt> I'm going to say, it's kind of boring. </garnt>
<connor> - You mean God of Mid-school? </connor>
<connor> - (Joey laughing) God of Mid-school. </connor>
<garnt> - When I made a tweet about Rental girlfriend. </garnt>
<garnt> There was like three people </garnt>
<connor> who were like God of High School </connor>
<connor> is the best anime of the season. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what season did you watch it? </connor>
<garnt> - Watching God of High School just makes me so disappointed. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like the disappointed, because I look </garnt>
<connor> at some of these fight scenes and I still think choreography </connor>
<connor> and animation wise, </connor>
<connor> it's probably some of the best fight scenes you </connor>
<garnt> can find all year so far. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't think of a better anime. </garnt>
<connor> - I think we've said like, it's pretty just disappointing </connor>
<garnt> because it was so popular. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And I don't know, I've heard from a lot of Webtunes Readers </garnt>
<joey> that it basically skipped through everything </joey>
<joey> and just gave you the fights. </joey>
<joey> - That's not how to do it. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, but I mean, it just gave me the feeling of just </connor>
<joey> I don't know, watching like a very good fight animation </joey>
<joey> on like YouTube was something where, </joey>
<joey> you have these fight scenes </joey>
<joey> and it would've worked better being clipped </joey>
<garnt> and put onto YouTube with no context </garnt>
<garnt> than it would have been in like, </garnt>
<joey> - That's what I watched like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I didn't actually watch the anime. </joey>
<joey> I just saw the clips on YouTube and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> there's some cool fight scenes, but is it enough </joey>
<joey> for me to get invested into the show? </joey>
<joey> Probably not. </joey>
<connor> - I watched like 10 episodes of Narrotor like last year. </connor>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Because I wanted to get it. </joey>
<connor> - Wait for season. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like as kids narrator? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like the very. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And that was horrible because, (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh my God, even the story feels like fella. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's why I never got into Narrator. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, I'm watching this and I'm 10 episodes in, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like nothing has happened. </connor>
<connor> We've like left the village and we've gone like, </connor>
<connor> I've watched more opening and ending </connor>
<connor> than I have like show development. </connor>
<connor> And then that annoying show in thing, </connor>
<connor> which I think should be like, it should be illegal. </connor>
<connor> You shouldn't be put in prison if you do it </connor>
<connor> while you put four minutes of the previous episode </connor>
<connor> at the start of the episode after the intro. </connor>
<connor> So it's only six minutes of like, </connor>
<joey> that you've already seen and don't need to see </joey>
<joey> like 43, </joey>
<joey> - We call that shown in recap syndrome. </joey>
<joey> - 14 minutes to the actual episode. </joey>
<joey> And then like seven minutes actual </joey>
<connor> somehow they find a way </connor>
<joey> - To last like six of some One Piece of that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah that's I was about to say, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how there are still anime. </garnt>
<garnt> only watches of One Piece when that is. </garnt>
<garnt> That was like literally every episode </garnt>
<garnt> for the past six years. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I remember the last I watched One Piece, </garnt>
<garnt> was the Punk Hazard dog. </garnt>
<joey> And literally every fucking episode was like, </joey>
<joey> here's an extended opening. </joey>
<joey> And then 10 minutes of filler, </joey>
<joey> five minutes of actual content </joey>
<joey> and then an extended ending. </joey>
<garnt> - It's cause there's only one. </garnt>
<garnt> They only adapt like one chapter per episode times. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, granted the chapters are dense as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> You compare the chapters today of One Piece </garnt>
<joey> to like some of the early chapters. </joey>
<joey> And it's like the like added to like a light novel </joey>
<joey> into his chart in between these dialogue. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> And it's so small and it's so concentrated. </joey>
<joey> But yeah I mean it still doesn't add up </joey>
<connor> to like one entire anime episode worth of content </connor>
<connor> in my opinion though. </connor>
<connor> So yeah reread the Manga of One Piece. </connor>
<connor> - Why should I Gigguk? </connor>
<connor> It's too long Gigguk. </connor>
<joey> It's it's too fucking big. </joey>
<joey> - That's the worst argument I've ever heard of anime. </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> I don't want it's like, why you get a degree Connor? </joey>
<joey> It's only four years come on, man. </joey>
<connor> Why aren't you doing it? </connor>
<connor> It's so good for you. </connor>
<connor> I got degree and it was shit </connor>
<joey> - Okay, but </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but if enjoyed the degree. </joey>
<connor> - Okay what if there's this really good thing right? </connor>
<connor> do you want it to like end quickly </connor>
<connor> or do you want it to keep going on for as long as possible? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause that's One Piece, right? </connor>
<connor> Like you're talking about it like it's a commitment. </connor>
<connor> If you're into One Piece. - It is, it is a commitment. </connor>
<garnt> - Like you can say the same to my Jojo anime </garnt>
<connor> - I guess yeah, but then at least Jojo this like part. </connor>
<connor> So you can like </connor>
<joey> - Yeah would One Piece there's Arcs. </joey>
<connor> - Arcs of different departs though. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know man I stopped at the Punk Cassadaga </connor>
<joey> and I could easily go back to it. </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't feel comfortable stopping mid Arc. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, but that's thing </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry between. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't feel comfortable. </connor>
<joey> - No, no but that's why I ended until the Arc was over </joey>
<joey> to like take a break. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that. </connor>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Because it's the same show. </joey>
<joey> It's the same characters. </joey>
<connor> They're still doing this adventure. </connor>
<connor> I'm not finished. </connor>
<connor> I can't just stop. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't matter because it's going to get shown </joey>
<joey> in recap syndrome at the beginning of the next one anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - So it doesn't matter. </joey>
<connor> - I just, I think the thing is because, </connor>
<connor> it's also daunting for the fact that </connor>
<connor> if I get into it, it's great that there's that much. </connor>
<connor> But it's also terrifying that this, that much </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing like you're saying it </connor>
<joey> in the pretense of like, </joey>
<joey> I'm probably not going to enjoy One Piece, right? </joey>
<connor> I'm saying what's worrying is if I do enjoy, because I'm not </connor>
<connor> going to get anything done for like five years </connor>
<connor> I'm going to be there. </connor>
<garnt> Just fucking reading about how loofy his arms </garnt>
<connor> had ripped off by like, </connor>
<garnt> - I completely get what you're saying because I was </garnt>
<connor> I was having this thought experiment. </connor>
<connor> So if I wasn't already into One Piece, </connor>
<connor> what'd you get into could I convince, </connor>
<connor> could it could future me or could like I could </connor>
<connor> could I convince an alternate universe of me </connor>
<connor> who hasn't seen One Piece to now get into One Piece? </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, that is so difficult, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how I would convince myself </garnt>
<garnt> to get into One Piece. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean. </garnt>
<connor> - Our schedule was already pretty rammed </connor>
<connor> with not reading Manga and the Manga I do get to read </connor>
<connor> is very small parts. </connor>
<connor> And I wouldn't want to read something </connor>
<connor> because I don't read several Mangas at one go. </connor>
<connor> I read one Mongo at a time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I read it all and go onto the next. </connor>
<garnt> And I don't know why my brain, </garnt>
<garnt> just can't I don't really enjoy. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I'm not. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm exactly the same as Connor, when I'm into something </connor>
<connor> when I'm into something has to be that I am into something. </connor>
<connor> I literally lost fucking two days of doing nothing </connor>
<joey> because I caught up to rental a girlfriend </joey>
<joey> and that was just like my obsession for that two days. </joey>
<joey> And if your friends, a girlfriend is like 500 chapters </joey>
<garnt> I would have just lost like. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, no, I dedicated </joey>
<joey> like an entire month just reading bulky. </joey>
<connor> - How many chapters of One Piece? </connor>
<joey> - Almost a thousand. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but like on the flip side, on the flip side </garnt>
<garnt> I really value that because it's so </garnt>
<garnt> like part of me is like part of me of like has, </garnt>
<garnt> who is someone who has been an anime </garnt>
<garnt> and Manga fan for so long. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of missed the feeling like you had as a kid where </garnt>
<garnt> you could just lose an entire week to just to just </garnt>
<garnt> watching this anime. </garnt>
<garnt> Because is it like, is it, am I that you guys are </garnt>
<garnt> the same way? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like so hard for you to like marathon stuff now. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, like, especially if it's like over 12 episodes </joey>
<garnt> it's really hard for me, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's really hard for me to marathon something </garnt>
<connor> but that's why when I'm like into a show and I'm like </connor>
<connor> properly into it and I'm just losing days </connor>
<connor> I really value that. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I search for it wherever I can. </connor>
<connor> But it's so hard for me to find like, </connor>
<connor> even if there's like technically a good show </connor>
<garnt> or a good series, which I can say, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, this, this is a good show. </garnt>
<joey> I felt really fucking good like </joey>
<connor> when I finally marathon Demon Slayer </connor>
<connor> in like two days. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, I haven't felt </connor>
<joey> I actually finished a show that was more than 12 episodes. </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I missed the feeling of just having days </garnt>
<garnt> and time passed where you're not </garnt>
<garnt> like when you're not like. - I was discussing </garnt>
<connor> What, how, why it sucks to be a adult. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> Damn, I just have like no time </connor>
<garnt> - No time to marathon, like working all the time. </garnt>
<connor> But like, I will say that </connor>
<garnt> if you do one that feeling just get into One Piece. </garnt>
<connor> - 1000 chapters doesn't sound that bad. </connor>
<connor> Like I read all of I shields. </connor>
<joey> - There volumes of Jojo than there is One Piece. </joey>
<connor> - Is there more chapters of, </connor>
<joey> oh I guess there's this tendency more? </joey>
<joey> I mean, I read five through seven of Jojo in like, </joey>
<connor> I think just over a week. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah you could easily get </joey>
<joey> from like the Alabaster Loc, to like the Mermaid </joey>
<connor> - That was like a week of me sitting in my bed </connor>
<connor> with a cup of tea nonstop just like </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, if you get into it, then it won't really matter. </joey>
<connor> - That's the problem is that </connor>
<connor> I'm going to lose three weeks of my life minimum. </connor>
<garnt> - You're gonna enjoy the cluster. </garnt>
<connor> - You're gonna remember those three weeks of your life </connor>
<connor> and your you're going to look back. </connor>
<garnt> - I have to show for it, go. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you'll finally be able to come jump </garnt>
<joey> into a conversation about One Piece and being like, yeah </joey>
<garnt> if there was like an X pocket sheet, like a real life </garnt>
<garnt> X-Box achievement where you can be like, I've read one </garnt>
<connor> and you can have like this badge that says </connor>
<connor> you've read One Piece. </connor>
<connor> And it's like something about my driving license </connor>
<connor> tangible to show for it. </connor>
<connor> You have to invest yourself is what I'm hearing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess I don't really </garnt>
<connor> how much free time do I have? </connor>
<connor> It kind of varies I guess on the day. </connor>
<connor> Like some we use YouTube, right? </connor>
<connor> So some days I'm walking all day nonstop. </connor>
<connor> Some days I'm sitting there trying to think </connor>
<connor> of a video idea and nothing happens. </connor>
<connor> And I just didn't do anything all day. </connor>
<connor> Play the game of league maybe, I don't know.. </connor>
<connor> But like if I read something it's so hard to see that </connor>
<connor> as like a, I'm not the type of person who reads casually. </connor>
<connor> It's like, if I read, I need to like focus </connor>
<connor> and decide that I'm going to read and it be a long thing. </connor>
<connor> I can't just be like, yeah </connor>
<connor> I'll read a chapter for five minutes again. </connor>
<connor> - I can't do that. </connor>
<connor> - There's people I know who can pick up a book </connor>
<connor> read two pages and be like, nice that was good, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go do the rest, I'm like what? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What, that's like, that's like getting a semi </connor>
<connor> and being like at a good wank (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I need like a minimum of like five chapters </connor>
<connor> to fully get myself in in like the reading zone. </connor>
<connor> And then once I'm in that zone, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> okay don't talk to me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It's like that sense of flow. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - I don't understand people who can like read a book </joey>
<connor> and watch a movie at the same time, </connor>
<connor> or like have the TV on, </connor>
<connor> in the background. </connor>
<connor> - On the background, can you pay attention to it? </connor>
<joey> - I need complete silence. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, that's because like every time </connor>
<joey> I'd like, Akira story </joey>
<joey> she comes into, you read your Manga, like what woman? </joey>
<connor> And it's like, there's no noise in the room. </connor>
<joey> - I need my total peace to read this. </joey>
<connor> - He's holding like fat lolly acids </connor>
<connor> volume one and what this is woman? </connor>
<joey> I can't, you see I'm reading literature. </joey>
<connor> (both laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh yes. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Make it a Manga, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - That's an oxymoron, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - It's like a color book. </connor>
<joey> - (all laughing) It's a draw Manga, coloring book. </joey>
<connor> - All right, boys, I have a question I want to know. </connor>
<connor> Is there any anime out there that you, you know </connor>
<connor> maybe have a hot take on like an anatomy that you think is </connor>
<connor> either really good anatomy that you like that is </connor>
<connor> highly praised and widely accepted to be amazing </connor>
<connor> that you think isn't that good? </connor>
<connor> Or is there a show </connor>
<connor> that everyone thinks that you think is pretty good? </connor>
<garnt> - Jury's already had his with school cars. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, I've really loved the Cabo bebop dub </connor>
<connor> but the show itself, I didn't think it was like that good, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna to be honest. </connor>
<joey> Like I liked it, but I didn't think </joey>
<joey> it was like the masterpiece worthy. </joey>
<joey> Like everyone says, it's like. </joey>
<joey> - I hate that, I can disagree with you. </joey>
<joey> - like it's, like the dub. - Like it's </joey>
<joey> - I've heard Samurai Champloo a million times. </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, yes. </garnt>
<connor> - Nah, nah, a million times more. </connor>
<connor> - I was about to say I have exactly the same opinion </connor>
<garnt> just with Samurai Champloo. </garnt>
<joey> - No, Samurai Champloo was a million times better. </joey>
<connor> - To me, like this, like I don't know what it was </connor>
<joey> about Samurai Champloo </joey>
<connor> I thought the story, the style and the music was amazing </connor>
<connor> and the music is amazing particularly wrong. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like the reasons why I liked Cowboy Bebop </connor>
<connor> was one the dub and two, nothing to do with the story. </connor>
<connor> I thought the story was kind of like all right, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - I just, I just feel like Cowboy Bebop </garnt>
<garnt> had some really interesting ideas </garnt>
<garnt> because it's kind of like a couple of people up </garnt>
<garnt> is isn't like a long like it doesn't have like </garnt>
<garnt> a very long overarching story arc. </garnt>
<garnt> It's more of these individual ideas </garnt>
<garnt> you know, that's once an IRB wants to explore </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought it had some really good ideas </garnt>
<garnt> and so did Samurai Champloo but </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know something about Samurai Champloo </garnt>
<garnt> just made me feel like the idea </garnt>
<garnt> is just one is interesting individual level. </garnt>
<connor> - Can you, can you sit here and like say to me </connor>
<connor> that Cowboy Bebop deserves to be like in the top five </connor>
<connor> as it always is on every single piece? </connor>
<connor> - Yes. - Really, top five? </connor>
<connor> like when I see it all time. </connor>
<connor> Like when I see it, it's like those people </connor>
<connor> who put Citizen Kane at number one on. </connor>
<connor> It's like yeah, I know movies, Citizen Kane's my favorite, </connor>
<connor> I know the movie. </connor>
<connor> - I is a Rosebud, my favorite quotes. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, when I see that on someone's like top five, </connor>
<joey> I immediately think they're like trying too hard </joey>
<joey> to be a quick cause to me I don't think </joey>
<connor> of animated like a critical sense most of the time. </connor>
<connor> - I just thought when I watched it, </connor>
<connor> I was like it's really cool, tons of style. </connor>
<connor> I just thought the story was kind of mad. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, if you get, if you go into for like </garnt>
<connor> a big story, then it's just a show. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so what about the Samurai Champloo story </connor>
<garnt> was good then. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, it has been a long time since I've watched both. </connor>
<garnt> - Is the same here, same here. </garnt>
<connor> - But I don't know, I remember just having a ton of fun </connor>
<connor> every single episode of Samurai Champloo. </connor>
<joey> - To me the story and like character, </joey>
<joey> like how much I enjoyed the story and the characters </joey>
<connor> about Samurai or Champloo, Cowboy Bebop around equal. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was everything else around the show, </connor>
<connor> like the music, the sound effects, like the animation stuff. </connor>
<joey> that made Samurai Champloo just that much better. </joey>
<connor> - I did not give a about the annoying kid on Cowboy bebop. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I didn't give a fuck about Fuu for like </garnt>
<connor> what are they trying to do again? </connor>
<joey> - [Hosts] Finding the Samurai that smells like sunflowers. </joey>
<connor> Like the plot doesn't matter an E the show </connor>
<garnt> - I just liked the characters Samurai Champloos. </garnt>
<joey> Like I thought, because we had only three of them. </joey>
<connor> It was like, we got a lot more time to like flush it out. </connor>
<connor> Whereas they just brought this sidekick character </connor>
<connor> and a dog and I'm like, why? </connor>
<connor> - To be fair, I love Iron though. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, he's... </garnt>
<garnt> - Iron is great. </garnt>
<joey> - Iron is spike is like one </joey>
<garnt> of the coolest anime characters of all time jet. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think Mugen was cooler, </garnt>
<joey> to be honest with you (Garnt laughing) just saying </joey>
<connor> I think Mugen was way cooler than Spike. </connor>
<connor> I think spike is dope </connor>
<joey> But if I had to like </joey>
<joey> say which one was cool, I'd definitely Mugen. </joey>
<garnt> - Spike can beat Mugen (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Microsoft (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> You have a bike able to survive AIDS though? </joey>
<garnt> - My character can beat up your character, </garnt>
<connor> have you thought about that? </connor>
<connor> You're going to do swing your Samurai sword, </connor>
<connor> Spike and just shoot him then. </connor>
<joey> - (all laughing) Mike, Mike, where's Mike? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I know this has been one of those shows, </connor>
<connor> that I do think is great but just </connor>
<connor> whenever I see it in top fives, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you're just shining out of your. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, okay like I have a very similar opinion </garnt>
<garnt> not of cowboy bebop, but just. - Even galleon? </garnt>
<connor> - Akira, </connor>
<connor> Akira, I think (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I think you guys get a shout (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I think Akira is Mid as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah, you're dead to me. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> You are absolutely dead to me. </joey>
<connor> - I think, I think it's one of those things </connor>
<connor> where it came out at the time </connor>
<joey> and it was a game changer at the time, </joey>
<connor> but I don't think now it holds up, it's still a game. </connor>
<joey> - We watched it several times trying to find </joey>
<joey> what about it, amazing, </joey>
<connor> and every time we want you, </connor>
<connor> I'm like man the animation still holds up the whole time. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, it just, it's just, </connor>
<joey> I don't know, it's just nothing much better. </joey>
<garnt> - You want to share your thoughts on that? </garnt>
<joey> - This is my last episode of trash. </joey>
<joey> I'm leaving after this. </joey>
<joey> I can't handle it. </joey>
<joey> Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> All right, Akira to me is like, </joey>
<joey> I think to this day it still stands </joey>
<connor> as one of the most unique cinematic experiences in anime </connor>
<connor> and I'm not just talking. - You're wrong. </connor>
<connor> - I agree with that. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm not talking about that in terms </connor>
<joey> of like the flashy colors and the fantastic. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, ooh, it looks pretty </joey>
<connor> like I'm not just talking about it like that, right? </connor>
<connor> But like, I just, I don't know like </connor>
<connor> I've rewatched the Akira so many times </connor>
<connor> and every time I've rewatched it, </connor>
<connor> especially like you have to see it in a big screen as well. </connor>
<connor> In my opinion, like I went to go see it. </connor>
<connor> Okay, cause I went to go watch it. </connor>
<connor> Obviously I wasn't born when it came out in cinemas </connor>
<connor> but like a couple of years ago they did a re-screening </connor>
<connor> of it in Sydney, in Australia at four </connor>
<connor> I think it was like the 30th anniversary </connor>
<connor> of the movie or something on the big screen. </connor>
<connor> And like, I loved it on the TV </connor>
<connor> like watching it in my room and was like fuck yeah. </connor>
<connor> But watching it in the cinemas was like, Holy shit. </connor>
<connor> Like this is like an adventure. </connor>
<connor> Like this is, this is just like such an out </connor>
<connor> of body experience with just the music is God like, </connor>
<connor> the voice acting is incredible. </connor>
<connor> Like everything about that has every, every single element </connor>
<connor> of that movie has a quality that can still </connor>
<connor> stand to like modern anime, cinema empire. </connor>
<connor> And like, and I think that's why it's just so incredible </connor>
<joey> because you watch it and you forget, Oh shit. </joey>
<joey> this was made 30 years ago. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but that's my point. </garnt>
<garnt> I completely agree that it's an experience that can stand </garnt>
<garnt> out in modern anime cinema. </garnt>
<garnt> It's but I'm saying it's, it's definitely not </garnt>
<garnt> as mind blowing as it was back then. </garnt>
<garnt> And I mean, I think it's still mind-blowing </garnt>
<garnt> - Every time I rewatched it, I was like </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like I can agree with both. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not saying it's the best Anime movie.- </joey>
<connor> - No, no, Of course. - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - But, Jesus Christ, it's good. </connor>
<garnt> Like I could easily have you read the Manga though? </garnt>
<joey> - I have not. </joey>
<joey> I think that's part of why I didn't enjoy it. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause it just felt like it felt like it kind of just ended. </garnt>
<garnt> It was, it didn't feel like a complete experience. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Well does the Manga continue after? </connor>
<connor> - The Manga is twice as long. </connor>
<connor> So the movie actually the movie, the ending </connor>
<connor> of the movie is completely original. </connor>
<connor> Because Ultima released the movie halfway </connor>
<connor> into a curious serialization because the first like </connor>
<connor> three volumes was so popular that they were like </connor>
<connor> we gotta make a movie of this and they made it </connor>
<connor> but they were like, I haven't finished the monkey yet. </connor>
<joey> What am I going to do. </joey>
<connor> - Bro? I'm trying to finish it. </connor>
<joey> - So the movie is completely original </joey>
<joey> and like the Munga continues for another </joey>
<joey> like four volumes off to the point of the movie. </joey>
<connor> And it's insane, it's fucking insane. </connor>
<connor> Like I highly recommend it, and I'm not just saying it </connor>
<connor> as like a super fan of Akira. </connor>
<connor> I just think in terms of like storytelling </connor>
<joey> am just like, you know, I'm just throwing key tones </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) honestly, </joey>
<joey> story telling. - Characters, development. </joey>
<joey> - Like honestly though, it's good shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Whoa, how many more buzz words can I throw in here? </garnt>
<garnt> - Four progression synergy? </garnt>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> - Again I don't think it's the greatest piece </joey>
<joey> of like anime cinema out there, but like, I </joey>
<garnt> I easily, it's one of those movies where I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> don't be fooled by the fact that it's 30 years old. </garnt>
<joey> I still think I can easily recommend it to new watches. </joey>
<garnt> - You can definitely still watch it today </garnt>
<connor> and not feel like it's dated. </connor>
<connor> Especially as like, as like a, for me </connor>
<connor> like a visual experience and everything. </connor>
<connor> I just feel like, you know, it's I don't know </connor>
<connor> maybe it's cause like cyberpunk </connor>
<joey> has just kind of died recently. </joey>
<joey> I mean, for the longest time </joey>
<joey> until what recent cyberpunk Academy we got recently </joey>
<joey> like Dora head. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's I mean, seeing, seeing a world </joey>
<joey> like that is a lot less, you know, a single word </joey>
<joey> like that now is a lot less common than it was back then. </joey>
<joey> But cyber punk was kind of in its prime. </joey>
<joey> - Eighties was like, like, say like... </joey>
<joey> - So like you can still watch a Kiran feel like, </joey>
<joey> hey this is something I can't really get today </joey>
<garnt> just because cyber punk is just </garnt>
<garnt> it's really rare to find out. </garnt>
<joey> - Because to me like Akira is like one of those movies </joey>
<joey> like those anime movies, </joey>
<joey> where every single person I've asked </joey>
<connor> who is clearly not an anime fan </connor>
<connor> and I asked them, what anime have you watched or enjoyed? </connor>
<connor> 99% of them will say, oh, I watched the Akira </connor>
<connor> and I thought it was fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just a good movie. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a really good movie. </connor>
<connor> It almost defies anime in a sense which is really weird </connor>
<joey> because it is (all laughing) which is really weird. </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, wait, wait, how what'd you mean defies anime? </garnt>
<garnt> What does that mean, what does that mean? </garnt>
<joey> - Like it goes like it an enjoyment factor in it, </joey>
<joey> I can't exactly like describe, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure if someone can explain it better than me, </joey>
<connor> but doesn't it there's some thing about Akira, </connor>
<connor> the experience of watching Akira </connor>
<connor> that you don't necessarily </connor>
<connor> even have to really like animates. </connor>
<connor> Which is really weird, because I actually watch Akira, </connor>
<connor> It is animated fuck. </connor>
<connor> Like everything about that is so anime </connor>
<connor> and yet it somehow is almost not anime at the same time. </connor>
<joey> It's really hard I don't know how to explain it. </joey>
<garnt> - I can relate to what you're saying, </garnt>
<joey> just to throw out my second heartache </joey>
<joey> I guess. - Go on. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I've said this on the Podcast before </joey>
<garnt> but I think I've said it in other places. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I hate Ghibli movies man (laughs). </garnt>
<connor> - I only liked like three. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I like one or two and even like. </garnt>
<connor> - Which ones? </connor>
<connor> - Princess Manake and NASCA </connor>
<joey> - Do you like House Moving Castle? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - I really like House Moving Castle. </joey>
<joey> - I really like House Moving Castle. </joey>
<joey> - The reason I don't like Ghibli is </joey>
<connor> just because I don't like Disney. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know because Ghibli, like </connor>
<connor> when I see a Ghibli movie </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, this is an anime like this is an animate, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a fucking Ghibli movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can we also talk about how Miyazaki </garnt>
<connor> as like fucking asshole? </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, he's an absolute con. </joey>
<connor> - Did you see the clip of like him going to his sons? </connor>
<garnt> - Are you going to recommend that clip as well? </garnt>
<connor> - To this clip, right? </connor>
<connor> You can search for it, but he goes to his son's premier, </connor>
<connor> who's making a movie right? A Director </connor>
<connor> and he walks out of the premiere halfway </connor>
<connor> through being like, he's not an adult yet. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, oh, he's one of those dads. </connor>
<connor> Who's like, he's not, he's not an adult yet, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I haven't deemed him worthy. </connor>
<connor> It's like, shut the up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he goes up lit a cigarette </connor>
<garnt> and it's just like, yeah, this movie's trash, </garnt>
<garnt> you could have done better. </garnt>
<garnt> He hasn't grown up enough. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, are you fucking kidding me? </connor>
<garnt> - As if, as of me as like </garnt>
<connor> he hasn't made movies himself, right? </connor>
<connor> Like not every, like I love Ghilbi don't get me wrong </connor>
<joey> but have I enjoyed every single Ghilbi movie? </joey>
<joey> Absolutely not. </joey>
<connor> - I just hate the kind of Director </connor>
<joey> who is like everyone else is unimportant </joey>
<connor> than my ideas are the best. </connor>
<connor> And you know, he sees me, he gives off that vibe </connor>
<connor> and as much as you know cultural icon for, </connor>
<joey> you know many parts and you don't want to be </joey>
<joey> an asshole you don't want to, talk to anyone for no reason. </joey>
<joey> Because every single time you see him in an interview </joey>
<joey> or do anything he just seems </joey>
<joey> kind of like a come to be around. </joey>
<connor> You would hate to be around him. </connor>
<joey> - You can tell, like he's such a close minded dude </joey>
<connor> because apparently the only movie that Miyazaki is like </connor>
<connor> he has made that he himself cried too, was the Wind Rises. </connor>
<connor> And I can tell you that is the most </connor>
<connor> amid Ghilbi movie I've ever watched. </connor>
<joey> - I've heard good things about it. </joey>
<joey> - It's good. </joey>
<joey> But compared to other Ghibli movies, it is misfolded. </joey>
<garnt> - What are your favorite Ghibli movies then? </garnt>
<connor> - Princess Monaca is easily my favorite. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, obviously I grew up watching like </garnt>
<connor> Now star and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> How's movie castle is really good. </connor>
<garnt> I thought Ponyo was okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ponyo was boring as fuck man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think Ponyo is very much the Jubilee </garnt>
<garnt> of the new generation, oh, sorry, </garnt>
<joey> The Totoro of the new generation. </joey>
<joey> - Totoro, oh my fucking God, </joey>
<joey> I fell asleep during Totoro man I'm like, </joey>
<joey> why am I watching a kid's show now. </joey>
<joey> Why do you expect me. </joey>
<garnt> - To be fair, yes, Totoro is a kid's movie. </garnt>
<connor> That's why I don't recommend it is it's a kid's movie </connor>
<connor> - But so it's Toy story, but I can watch toy story. </connor>
<joey> - Toy Story, the Pixar has done a thing </joey>
<joey> where they've managed to get intermingle </joey>
<joey> like very adult humor with them. </joey>
<connor> - But that's Kids like </connor>
<connor> media is great when it can be enjoyable </connor>
<joey> - But Japanese media does not do that. </joey>
<joey> - It does sometimes though. </joey>
<joey> - Not glibly though (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah not glibly. </connor>
<joey> - What is it the fucking one with the pig flying a plane? </joey>
<joey> - [Hosts] Porco Rosso </joey>
<joey> - And I had to turn it off 20 minutes in, </joey>
<joey> I'm like soo fucking bored.. </joey>
<joey> - I enjoyed it, but I thought it was okay, </joey>
<garnt> like it's not amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that's basically my experience </garnt>
<joey> with a lot of Ghibli movies is that </joey>
<connor> this is the most okay film experience I've had. </connor>
<connor> And I like okay, the reason I really can't get </connor>
<connor> into a lot of Ghibli movies, is that </connor>
<connor> they just don't feel anime, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I don't know because they feel like Disney movies, right? </connor>
<connor> And I know like Miyazaki has gone on record like </connor>
<connor> criticizing a lot of anime animators </connor>
<connor> who are like then they're just like inspired </connor>
<connor> by other people working in anime inspired by real life. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, this is why I go into the medium dude, </connor>
<joey> I like that. </joey>
<joey> - What do I hate that. </joey>
<joey> - I hate the thing that I like as well. </joey>
<connor> - It was a mistake. </connor>
<connor> - On top of that, knowing that he's an it makes it </connor>
<joey> so much worse for me to like try and enjoy it </joey>
<joey> because I think you can make great ship </joey>
<joey> without being a huge camp. </joey>
<joey> - Like absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - I think maybe if you cure every single type of cancer, </connor>
<connor> you know in your lifetime, go ahead, be asshole. </connor>
<connor> Like you probably didn't get that passed. </connor>
<joey> - You know, it's that whole thing like </joey>
<garnt> you know you should separate the creator from the creation </garnt>
<connor> but sometimes it's really hard. </connor>
<garnt> - It's really hard. </garnt>
<connor> - When a person markets that work </connor>
<connor> so heavily as their work, right? </connor>
<connor> Like it's a homey Zacky film, it's not a film, </connor>
<connor> it's a Homey Zacky film, right? </connor>
<connor> So then it's like, well, he's kind of a camp. </connor>
<garnt> So it's kind of like, you know, yeah, I agree. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean sometimes it doesn't detract </joey>
<joey> on like how good this specific work is. </joey>
<joey> Just because you enjoy work. </joey>
<connor> Doesn't mean it doesn't necessarily mean you, </connor>
<connor> you know, you I forgot the first thing of what I was saying. </connor>
<connor> Every time I enjoy the work doesn't mean </connor>
<connor> you can't you have to like. </connor>
<garnt> - I agree with that. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's also like when you don't like the work </garnt>
<connor> knowing the guy is kind of you know, </connor>
<connor> you're like, God I fucking hate this. </connor>
<garnt> - But most people don't know that. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I turned off Porco Rosso halfway through, </garnt>
<connor> I was like you're not an adult yet. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> You haven't done it, you haven't done it. </connor>
<joey> - I walked out of my room, cigarette. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I had to walk out the room, </connor>
<connor> put my arm on the doorframe it's not ready yet. </connor>
<joey> - It's weird though, to me like </joey>
<joey> my favorite is Miyazaki film isn't even a Jubilee film, </joey>
<connor> it's the Lupen III movie. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like way before Ghilbi, the castle will that shit's dope. </connor>
<connor> But like, yeah, I don't know it's (sighs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's great. </joey>
<connor> - I wonder was he always like that? </connor>
<connor> Or is that something that happens when everyone </connor>
<garnt> tells you you've you've come </garnt>
<connor> down from God to bless us with animation? </connor>
<joey> - I would say it's the latter. </joey>
<joey> - He's also like old 150 years old. </joey>
<connor> He's retired like a eight times. </connor>
<joey> - I would like a to think, </joey>
<connor> when I get old I'll be the fun kind of old guy. </connor>
<connor> The one who's like, I give a </connor>
<connor> about what the young people are doing. </connor>
<garnt> Instead of being like, I hate life. </garnt>
<joey> - You say that now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah you say that now, as like a 20 year old. </connor>
<connor> - I hope, I hope, that's why I said I hope. </connor>
<connor> - I doubt Miyazaki is in his twenties was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm going to grow up. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to grow up to be an absolute cunt. </connor>
<joey> - I'll reject all my statements. </joey>
<joey> If I see him, you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> If he comes out, it's the whip, I'll forget. </garnt>
<connor> I'll take (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Just like browsing Twitter to be like, oh man </garnt>
<connor> they think I'm an asshole, I better change my ways. </connor>
<garnt> You know, what I mean. </garnt>
<connor> - They think I'm an asshole, fuck the haters. </connor>
<connor> - I don't care what he thinks, but I, you know, if he </connor>
<connor> if he wants to see it and think I've, you know, whatever </connor>
<joey> but I mean, all I'm saying is that you don't have to </joey>
<connor> be an asshole. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<joey> - You could be, you really have to tell your son </joey>
<joey> his movie was in front of the cameras </joey>
<joey> and go out of this, did you really? </joey>
<joey> - Did you really have to have the cigarette? </joey>
<joey> - This really feels like a drive home kind of thing. </joey>
<connor> Like a son, it wasn't that good, but don't worry. </connor>
<connor> I wasn't going to embarrass you for all the news </connor>
<connor> outlets that were waiting, it's your son for </connor>
<connor> for fuck's sake, are you kidding me? </connor>
<garnt> - That was the thing that broke you? </garnt>
<connor> - That was the thing where I'm like, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> oh, this is too much. </connor>
<connor> You purposely went out of your way </connor>
<connor> to be a cunt, like you could have waited </connor>
<connor> till he got home and texted her and been like son. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the thing that like the, </joey>
<connor> I watched the highlight Zaki documentary years ago </connor>
<connor> and it was such an interesting document </connor>
<connor> because you'd get to learn </connor>
<connor> about his life and like he's full process about everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I don't recommend that like documentary to people </connor>
<joey> nor do I want to rewatch it </joey>
<joey> because in the entire documentary, </joey>
<joey> homie was like, </joey>
<joey> he's just an absolute dick to the interviewer.. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just kind of like, just answer the </connor>
<joey> question, like a normal person. </joey>
<connor> - It's like when people are just making things difficult </connor>
<connor> for the sake of it, and then you have this whole, </connor>
<connor> I'm the best, I know everything, </connor>
<connor> it's like, it's so frustrating to have to put up with that. </connor>
<connor> Did you have to be an asshole though? </connor>
<connor> Why, why did, why? </connor>
<connor> Like, what did you gain from that? </connor>
<connor> Does that make you feel big? </connor>
<connor> Did you feel, I should feel better? </connor>
<connor> Like, just be nice. </connor>
<connor> - But like Stanley Kubrick have the same thing, right? </connor>
<joey> Apparently Stanley Kubrick was Dick. </joey>
<connor> - Apparently directors in general tend to be. </connor>
<garnt> - When some of the most talented people </garnt>
<garnt> and talented visionaries are probably some of the biggest. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, especially with the Director </connor>
<connor> where it is literally like you have to be like </connor>
<connor> put your foot down because I think </connor>
<connor> there's a great YouTube video, </connor>
<joey> was like are all Directors dicks? </joey>
<joey> It was on my recommended for like a million. </joey>
<joey> - I love that tittle, are all Directors dicks? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's actually really interesting go watch it. </joey>
<joey> And it basically just he interviews a ton of Directors </joey>
<connor> asking them, you know should you be a dick? </connor>
<connor> A lot of them would be like, yeah </connor>
<joey> I am because I have to put my foot down constantly </joey>
<joey> and tell them no, you know especially </joey>
<connor> if you're working with some actors who are. </connor>
<connor> - I get being a dick on the job, right? </connor>
<connor> But like, when it's just like. </connor>
<connor> - This is what I mean like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> you can be a dick on set to get what you need done. </connor>
<connor> But did you have to go home. - Humiliate the interview? </connor>
<connor> - Humiliate your son, do you have to do that? </connor>
<connor> Like that, just that, that really like </connor>
<connor> I didn't know what it was when I saw that clip </connor>
<connor> it really struck a nerve with me. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I didn't mind him being an asshole sometimes, </connor>
<connor> I was a guy like whatever, that's his thing </connor>
<connor> and then the office gets it. </connor>
<connor> But then when he did that, I'm like, that is just cruel. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I think what hit me </garnt>
<garnt> about that clip was that he did that in front of camera. </garnt>
<connor> Camera's you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - All the other, all the other people there </connor>
<connor> because all the other old men came out afterwards. </connor>
<garnt> Like it was good, wasn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, no. - And he just left. </garnt>
<connor> I remember there was a </connor>
<connor> Shot of just him going down the stairs and be like. </connor>
<connor> - Dragged his wife out with him. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, Oh my God, you guys chill out. </connor>
<connor> I'm off back home now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just kinda like one </connor>
<connor> of those things you're like, bro. </connor>
<connor> - I don't want to be like that. </connor>
<connor> - No, I don't think I have the life. </connor>
<connor> I could do that to my kid. </connor>
<joey> - That's like your son, like making his </joey>
<joey> first YouTube video and you just like pause and walk. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - My parents didn't do that. </joey>
<connor> - They up Brunel game week. </connor>
<connor> - They pretended like they got it. </connor>
<connor> I know they didn't </connor>
<connor> but I appreciated that they sat through it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, right? </connor>
<joey> - I just have this image of you </joey>
<joey> like you seeing your son doing his first YouTube video </joey>
<joey> and it's a like reaction video or something. </joey>
<joey> I was like, son </joey>
<joey> I expected better from expect creativity from them. </joey>
<joey> I didn't, I didn't raise a son to meet </joey>
<garnt> for him to grow up, to be a reaction YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which PC, is it in? (mimicking breaking PC) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean it was, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's like I said, it struck a nerve. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, I was going to say something else. </connor>
<joey> Like totally forgot I had, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, bottom line just don't be a Dick. </joey>
<connor> - It was like, I read an article as well. </connor>
<connor> Miyazaki actually openly said </connor>
<garnt> that he was just never there for his kids growing up. </garnt>
<garnt> - After that video - Because of course he was, </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - YouTube is making a movie </garnt>
<connor> but then that's when you want to finally come through right? </connor>
<connor> it's your kid's movie. </connor>
<connor> You finally want to be like, son. </connor>
<connor> I know I wasn't there for you </connor>
<connor> but God you did me proud dad. </connor>
<connor> Could you imagine he probably spent his whole </connor>
<connor> life chasing that, that moment. </connor>
<connor> One moment where he just needed this dad to be like </connor>
<connor> you know what kid you did good, I watched the movie. </connor>
<connor> It was better than half the ship made is Zackey May made </connor>
<connor> I watched the movie out of pure spite. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't even know what it was called. </connor>
<connor> I would've said it was the best movie. </connor>
<connor> That's it </connor>
<joey> - I haven't seen it, but I heard it was really good. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty bad (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Come on, come on just say it. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably universally agreed, </connor>
<garnt> it's one of the worst movies Ghibli has ever made. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? (Connor and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Like, I feel mad. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel bad, but man, you know </garnt>
<garnt> I feel bad that Miyazaki just. </garnt>
<garnt> Talk to son. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like, no matter what, as a parent got to-- </garnt>
<joey> - I feel so much better </joey>
<connor> - This could have been a snuff film. </connor>
<connor> I would have sat through my kid's first movie. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I'm sitting through that, like I have to. </connor>
<garnt> - No matter how bad it is, </garnt>
<garnt> you got to have your kids back. </garnt>
<joey> - Give it like, no like no parent, right? </joey>
<joey> Like goes up to their five-year-old looks </joey>
<joey> at the macaroni artwork and goes that's shit. </joey>
<joey> - Lights up the cigarette. </joey>
<joey> - I expect a better from his son. </joey>
<connor> - Son, I saw the other kids macaroni on it was much better </connor>
<connor> than this, you know. - They use the gluten free. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay though, have you ever had a show or series </garnt>
<joey> where you really, really enjoyed and then something </joey>
<joey> came like you enjoyed before and then </joey>
<joey> You learnt about the creator or the author. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> - And has that like affected your view of the show at all? </garnt>
<joey> - Absolutely, when, what happened </joey>
<connor> to the Rurouni Kenshin right. </connor>
<connor> Recently act age happened. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I was enjoying act eight so much. </joey>
<connor> This is one of the most unique Shawnee jump experiences. </connor>
<connor> And then that happened and I was like, well fuck. </connor>
<joey> I kind of don't want to read it anymore. </joey>
<connor> - And people want to always be like, you know </connor>
<joey> you should separate them </joey>
<joey> but it's so hard to do that when you, </joey>
<connor> you really respect the work. </connor>
<joey> - Especially Rurouni Kenshin </joey>
<connor> because like this is coming from a </connor>
<garnt> massive Rurouni Kenshin film. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, I can't read it anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no it's it was one of my favorites show in </garnt>
<connor> Manga and anime hang up </connor>
<connor> and I still have the volumes on my shelf. </connor>
<garnt> It's just like gathering dust now. </garnt>
<connor> - It's, hard as well because you almost respect </connor>
<connor> because you, the work so much that came from the mind </connor>
<connor> and you almost respect like the thought process </connor>
<connor> and the creativity that came from the person right? </connor>
<connor> It all came from a mind. </connor>
<connor> I think what's disturbing is like what all these such </connor>
<connor> amazing ideas came out of the same head that was like, Oh </connor>
<connor> I should, I should, you know, collect this not good stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember I was really into acting as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And then after the news came out, it kind of looked at some </garnt>
<connor> of the, like some, some of the plot points of that age </connor>
<connor> whereas like, like we look at </connor>
<connor> An older guy grooming this 15 year old school girl to become </connor>
<connor> like one of the best actresses of all time. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, it was cool without that knowledge too </connor>
<connor> to just think, Hey, you know, maybe you're just </connor>
<garnt> Trying to help her as like, as like an </garnt>
<garnt> Actress, you know, it was, it was like. </garnt>
<joey> - But now you kind of see like the underlying reason </joey>
<garnt> as to why, he choose that. </garnt>
<joey> - Now there's just this underlying reason </joey>
<joey> that just makes you really uncomfortable. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like I can't shake the uncomfort. </garnt>
<joey> - Maybe that's a complete coincidence. </joey>
<garnt> We will never know the fact </garnt>
<connor> that we can now make that correlation. </connor>
<joey> It just makes it that much more uncomfortable. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And then you see people on Twitter, like </connor>
<connor> but was it legal though? </connor>
<connor> Like what does it matter if it's legal. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't matter. </joey>
<connor> Like, I just don't want to support a pedophile </connor>
<connor> - Really just seeing the replies to the Twitter </connor>
<joey> on that was just like, Oh my God, I hate this world so much </joey>
