<garnt> - Nice cock. - Cum. </garnt>
<joey> Cyberpunk music. </joey>
<joey> - There's just some memes that just like transcend time. </joey>
<connor> - Harambee! </connor>
<connor> - I still laugh at Uganda knuckles meme man! </connor>
<connor> That will never not be funny to me. </connor>
<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> - I showed Joey that I slammed my penis </connor>
<connor> in the car door meme today. </connor>
<joey> - I don't understand that one. </joey>
<joey> - It's not about understanding. </joey>
<joey> Half of the meme is right, </joey>
<connor> that's how it always starts though. </connor>
<connor> You don't understand the meme </connor>
<connor> when you first get introduced. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But you understand it through a weird repetition </connor>
<connor> and kind of mutual respect of </connor>
<connor> not really understanding what the fuck is going on. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Right! - But it's kind of funny. </joey>
<connor> - But like you know, </connor>
<joey> most memes, it's like you can change it up a bit. </joey>
<connor> You can make a derivative. </connor>
<connor> I dunno how much you can derive. </connor>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - You'll be surprised. </connor>
<connor> It's like the whole steamed hams thing, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - It can be pushed as much as it wants to. </connor>
<connor> By the way, </connor>
<connor> welcome to this episode of the Trash Taste Show. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know app your own. </garnt>
<garnt> Not that we say that- - But The Trash Taste Show! </garnt>
<connor> - You Trash Taste Show. - Trash Taste Show! </connor>
<connor> (all chuckle) </connor>
<connor> - I guess we just found ourselves in a topic </connor>
<connor> before we even like started the show. </connor>
<connor> - But welcome, I'm your host Connor, </connor>
<joey> with the boys, Joey and Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - Call the segment, Nice Kong. </joey>
<joey> - In the time that-- </joey>
<garnt> - No, we don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like going back to the memes, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand why I find things funny anymore. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Sometimes I don't know why bass-boosted things are funny, </garnt>
<connor> but like, it just appears in the meme sometimes, </connor>
<connor> so I just like laugh. </connor>
<connor> - I think we're slowly breaking down the human psyche </connor>
<connor> and the human consciousness, </connor>
<connor> and what is objectively funny. </connor>
<connor> And for some reason seeing an Orangutan, </connor>
<connor> and some men going, "Oh, oh, stinky!" </connor>
<connor> seems to always make me laugh, </connor>
<connor> and I can't tell you why. </connor>
<connor> There's no deeper meaning, </connor>
<connor> I'm just fucking stupid </connor>
<connor> and I've been hacked by this system </connor>
<connor> that somehow works against me. </connor>
<joey> - It's just like perfect science </joey>
<joey> of just like the right noises and the right image you know. </joey>
<joey> - You know it's bad </joey>
<joey> when I could show that to a five year old </joey>
<joey> and they would be unamused, </joey>
<joey> but I'm there just pissing myself, </joey>
<connor> like crying, laughing, and it's like, </connor>
<connor> "What has happened? </connor>
<connor> Have we been hacked in a way that </connor>
<connor> like allows our brain to revert to like one years old </connor>
<connor> and find things funny? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't know anymore. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, I feel like the internet </garnt>
<connor> just like broken our sense of humor. </connor>
<connor> Like why is the peak of internet comedy </connor>
<connor> just perfectly cut screams? </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That is just like-- </joey>
<joey> - That will never not be funny. </joey>
<joey> - I know, but why is it so funny? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Like I hear a scream, I sleep. </joey>
<garnt> If you cut it just once like a millisecond in, </garnt>
<garnt> it's fucking like comedy genius. </garnt>
<connor> - Because imagining the disaster is way funnier </connor>
<connor> than seeing a disaster. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what it is. </connor>
<connor> - Like it's like, </connor>
<connor> you've probably seen a lot of the videos, right? </connor>
<connor> Where there's like a punchlines, </connor>
<connor> where people use like massive explosions. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. - It's like the punchline. </connor>
<connor> But you never think like, </connor>
<connor> so like what was that explosion? </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Was that a-- </connor>
<connor> - What was blowing up? - Did people die? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, you like, </connor>
<connor> "Ha ha, explosion go blow!" </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> - Stuff is way funnier </connor>
<garnt> when you can imagine what happens almost </garnt>
<connor> in some aspects, right? </connor>
<garnt> - What do you think is a meme </garnt>
<garnt> that you'll find funny again in five years? </garnt>
<joey> - Any Wiii sports meme for me. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Like at the moment that music starts playing, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, before the joke even starts, </connor>
<connor> the moment I hear the music, </connor>
<joey> it's already funny. </joey>
<connor> - I'd like to think when I'm 50 years old, </connor>
<connor> that there's somebody I can go to, </connor>
<connor> and I'll be like, what's 9 plus 10. </connor>
<connor> (Connor chuckles) </connor>
<connor> And then they'd be like 21. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'd be like, "Yeah!" - Yeah, my man! </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then we'll like, you know what I mean. </connor>
<connor> The same way that my parents </connor>
<connor> mentioned some weird '60s BBC show that I-- </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I know the spotted thing, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I'd like to think that's what it's gonna be like, you know. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They'll be like, "So no head." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like 60 and I'm like pissing myself. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - We're in this weird time </joey>
<connor> where I think humor is gonna be so fucked and liked! </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah! </connor>
<connor> - I mean it's fucked month by month </connor>
<connor> let alone what is going to be like </connor>
<garnt> in like one or two years. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - It's gonna be like some Morse code jokes or something. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah probably. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - We're just gonna hear </joey>
<joey> (Joey mimics) </joey>
<joey> and just fucking piss ourselves off. </joey>
<joey> - It's gonna be visual like a braille. </joey>
<joey> It's gonna be like, "And then he said..." </joey>
<garnt> and it's like just braille on the screen. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're gonna be like pissing it, </garnt>
<connor> and it's gonna be like-- (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like a hilarious meme. </connor>
<connor> - That could be a meme. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> This is why memes are going now. </connor>
<garnt> - Base-boosted braille? </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm laughing at the thought of shitty memes, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Base-boosted braille! </connor>
<connor> - Can you imagine that? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And then he said, brrrh! </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] And this is the thing-- </connor>
<connor> - The idea of that just sound hilarious to me. </connor>
<garnt> - Can we just go with the new meme? </garnt>
<connor> - I think it weird. (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And it's weird </connor>
<connor> because being friends with someone like Chris, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Chris is just on the... </connor>
<connor> Chris in the weirdest spot I think. </connor>
<connor> Because I've shown memes to Chris, </connor>
<connor> where Chris will break down laughing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And they're absolutely stupid. </joey>
<joey> But I've also showed him memes where </joey>
<joey> his boomer side comes out. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right? - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And he's definitely like, "What is this? </connor>
<connor> What is this nonsense? </connor>
<connor> Why is there flashing noises and deep fried? </connor>
<connor> What is that, what is...?" </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like Chris is at that really interesting spot </connor>
<connor> where he's like, </connor>
<connor> Chris can be a boomer when he wants to be a boomer, </connor>
<connor> but he also enjoys Gen Z humor when he wants to. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<connor> - And I find that really interesting. </connor>
<connor> Because I'm totally like, </connor>
<connor> my humor is so fucked now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I can only laugh at stuff </connor>
<connor> when it's like bass boosted and farting noises. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. (Connor and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (Cross-overs) </garnt>
<connor> I feel like I'm a child, I'm a child. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I feel that. </connor>
<connor> Because it's gotten to a point </connor>
<connor> where I don't know why I find the things I do funny, </connor>
<connor> I just know I find it funny. </connor>
<connor> And there's no like formula to it. </connor>
<garnt> There's nothing I can break down to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Ha ha, that was why the punchline was funny." You know. </garnt>
<joey> - You can't explain half the memes any more. </joey>
<connor> - But the problem is this, </connor>
<connor> if you have a favorite comedian, </connor>
<connor> you can be like, watch their standup special. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If I find like base-boosted, (Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> Daffy Duck slamming his penis in the car door </connor>
<connor> with prapid rapid there. </connor>
<connor> How the fuck do I begin to explain what I'm into? </connor>
<connor> - Just send a YouTube link. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But then-- </connor>
<joey> - Trust me, this is 10 million views, it's funny. </joey>
<joey> - Here's the problem </joey>
<garnt> with sending people weird ass memes like that. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. - It's like. </connor>
<connor> And I've had this, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I've been on the receiving end of memes-- </connor>
<garnt> - I think everyone has. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where I'm like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - And it's just as, </connor>
<connor> we've turned to comedy into this weird kind of niche, </connor>
<joey> where it's like the equivalent of </joey>
<joey> liking some weird German techno band now. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, </joey>
<connor> that's what comedy is now. </connor>
<garnt> - Because to get like a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> the most funniest memes to me, </garnt>
<connor> it takes like 10 layers of meme levels. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta go deep. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's something that if you're not invested in this one, </connor>
<garnt> in like one meme aspect, </garnt>
<garnt> then you're just not gonna get the meme, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause it's joke can be random. </joey>
<garnt> - The joke of the meme </garnt>
<joey> is like a reference to another joke and another meme, </joey>
<joey> and so on and so forth. </joey>
<connor> So it's like- </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck is this coffee, hold on. </joey>
<connor> What the... </connor>
<connor> Does your coffee tastes weird? </connor>
<connor> - Well, what does it taste like? </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Like, what's wrong with it? </connor>
<connor> - It tastes like coffee. </connor>
<connor> - What kind, is it instant coffee? </connor>
<connor> - [Man] No, it's not. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's very... </connor>
<connor> - Whoa, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - [Man] It's coffee that Meilyne usually makes. </connor>
<connor> - Is it really? </connor>
<connor> - That's some bass-boosted coffee. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - This is what of described as a crunchy coffee. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Man] Let me see. </connor>
<connor> - Have you had this coffee before? </connor>
<connor> - [Man] No but. </connor>
<connor> - What did I do? </connor>
<connor> Sorry, sorry, that threw me off. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Do you mind if I? </connor>
<connor> - Sure, go ahead. - Go ahead. </connor>
<joey> - Coffee review with Nabi. </joey>
<connor> - Huh, it's very stale. </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck? - It tastes stale, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Did the Nespresso let us down? </connor>
<connor> What's going on? </connor>
<connor> Is it the milk? </connor>
<connor> - Just a betrayal-- </connor>
<connor> - I'll go and check. - Is it the milk? </connor>
<connor> - Get the operations, send in the press, </connor>
<connor> find out what happened here. </connor>
<joey> - It might be the milk. - I'll go upstairs. </joey>
<joey> - Whoa, that's funky. </joey>
<joey> - Like I just don't bother </joey>
<joey> to try and keep up with memes anymore, </joey>
<joey> just because like... </joey>
<joey> It's like, I already thought the fun in Uganda knuckles meme </joey>
<garnt> went by so goddamn fast! </garnt>
<garnt> And now I've realized that Ugandan knuckles </garnt>
<garnt> sticking around for a month, </garnt>
<garnt> was like a feed of accomplishment for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I still find the Ugandan knuckles funny. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think five years ago, </connor>
<connor> it's even quite different from how memes are now. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Mm! - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Now, I feel like, </connor>
<connor> okay, five years ago we had memes </connor>
<connor> and we had like three or four that were pretty big, </connor>
<connor> and you wouldn't really hear about other memes. </connor>
<connor> But now there's always like 10 memes going on at once, </connor>
<connor> maybe one of them will kind of get somewhat mainstream. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And even that I don't even mean mainstream, </connor>
<joey> like normal audiences, I mean like-- </joey>
<joey> - Like on the internet? </joey>
<joey> - The Twitter sphere-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Because there are so many memes, </garnt>
<garnt> like if you ever watched </garnt>
<connor> Lessons in Meme Culture, </connor>
<connor> do you watch that channel? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Guy discusses memes, </connor>
<garnt> and there's like every day there's a new meme. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But most of these memes live and die in the week. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't consider them like memes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, if this is a niche thing </garnt>
<garnt> that gets used a little bit in some communities </garnt>
<connor> and it doesn't really take off. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> you don't really keep up with this. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. - [Joey] Mm! </connor>
<connor> - Because it's scarcely anything to give a shit about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - [Man] I found out why. - Why? </garnt>
<joey> - Because we're using almond, </joey>
<joey> Not soy milk. (man chuckles) </joey>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<garnt> - No, this doesn't taste like almond milk! </garnt>
<garnt> - [Man] No? </garnt>
<joey> - I use almond milk with my coffee all the time. </joey>
<connor> - [Man] That states says almond, I bought almond. </connor>
<connor> - It's the coffee that tastes weird. </connor>
<garnt> - [Man] Is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's the combination of the almond and the coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Man] Probably. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean like, </garnt>
<connor> there are some memes that you see and you're like, </connor>
<connor> this is gonna die off within two days. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I feel like if a meme is too easily replicated </connor>
<garnt> that your mom could do it, </garnt>
<garnt> then it's not a good meme. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - Also, I feel with like some memes it's like, okay. </joey>
<connor> Like a video with like 10 million views pops up, </connor>
<connor> it's like, "Cool, that went viral." </connor>
<connor> But it's like, you can't do anything else with it. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So it just ends up being this one video </joey>
<connor> that has a lot of views, </connor>
<connor> and then it gets forgotten over time. </connor>
<connor> - I think a perfect meme, right, </connor>
<connor> is one meme when you initially watch or discover it, </connor>
<connor> you think, "This is fucking stupid!" </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then third time you're like, "Yeah, okay." </connor>
<joey> - Have you witnessed a perfect meme yet, </joey>
<connor> as the meme master? </connor>
<connor> - I think vocabulary does that quite a lot, </connor>
<joey> like the word like busing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I actually despised it when I first heard it. </joey>
<joey> Somehow it just grew on me. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right now I find it hilarious. </connor>
<connor> So I don't know why I can't stop saying it. </connor>
<connor> They're like "deez nuts" </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like "deez nuts" is not funny. </connor>
<joey> Scientifically speaking "deez nuts" is not funny. </joey>
<joey> - Speaking of some, I find hilarious. </joey>
<connor> But I'll fucking laugh. (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I will laugh every goddamn time. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll find every any opportunity I can to say "deez nuts." </garnt>
<connor> - It's one of those memes where you laugh </connor>
<joey> and you like hate yourself over eternity. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - It's like dabbing. </joey>
<joey> - It's the modern equivalent of whipping yourself, </joey>
<joey> but mentally, you're just like, </joey>
<connor> "Fuck! Got to have to schedule a better help call </connor>
<connor> after this, fuck!" </connor>
<connor> - I feel like a lot of memes now </connor>
<connor> are also like platform dependent. </connor>
<connor> Like there are like so many TikTok trends and TikTok memes </connor>
<connor> that are massive on the platform, </connor>
<connor> but we don't like get exposed to it at all. </connor>
<garnt> And feel like it's only like a super, super, super big meme, </garnt>
<garnt> if it like goes off of the TikTok platform </garnt>
<garnt> and you see it on Twitter or on like YouTube as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Is Japanese TikTok good? </connor>
<connor> - No! (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Because right and I know- </joey>
<joey> - Is TikTok good? </joey>
<joey> - Yes, I think TikTok is good? </joey>
<connor> - I'm gonna say this, right now, </connor>
<connor> before people go accuse me of being like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, let's see what the content gives you, blah, blah." </connor>
<joey> I downloaded TikTok, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. - Fresh account. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yep! </joey>
<joey> - The first thing I opened it, </joey>
<joey> so it knows I'm in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - It's automatically Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - It's automatically Japanese TikTok. </joey>
<joey> What do you think comes up? </joey>
<connor> And like I'm scrolling for a while, </connor>
<connor> What do you think comes up? </connor>
<joey> - Well, my experience? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - From my experience it's just a lot of like </connor>
<connor> Japanese girls dancing. </connor>
<joey> - Goddamn it, that's all it was! </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what it really is. </connor>
<connor> - All these are literally Japanese women, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And yeah, they're very beautiful, </connor>
<connor> very attractive. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Not even dancing, </joey>
<joey> just like moving their arms slightly. </joey>
<joey> - They're just like... </joey>
<connor> - They normally have assets </connor>
<connor> that are bigger than normal. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that was all it was. </connor>
<connor> I scrolled through like 50 TikToks </connor>
<connor> and maybe out of the 50, </connor>
<garnt> I didn't support any of them, just scrolling, </garnt>
<garnt> brand new account, nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> All it knew was that I was probably male, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm guessing knew that from the app store. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. - [Joey] Sure, sure. </garnt>
<connor> - And that's all it was. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like, you'll enjoy this type of content, </connor>
<garnt> You're a Japanese male. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was just like, </garnt>
<connor> don't get me wrong, </connor>
<connor> there's a time and a place for this- </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Grant] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't want this! - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is not want. </connor>
<garnt> - I wanna see the memes. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not a kind of person, all right. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is like a sigma male grind set. </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna see this... - I hate how you said that. </joey>
<connor> - I don't wanna see like women or... </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> That sounds so bad. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Go on, say it, say it! </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna see women! </connor>
<connor> - I don't wanna shit that's trying to make me horny </connor>
<connor> when I'm not horny, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - If I wanna watch stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna go and watch porn. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah of course. </connor>
<connor> - It's very obvious what audience that is. </connor>
<connor> Am I allowed to say that, </connor>
<connor> that's like women just dancing and showing off boobs. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's been like that </garnt>
<garnt> since the beginning of probably time. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm fine with that content, </connor>
<garnt> but I don't want that most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean-- </garnt>
<joey> - There's so much of that kind of content you can consume. </joey>
<joey> - It's the same reason why everyone hated the old... </joey>
<joey> Remember when like YouTube </joey>
<joey> went through this epidemic of the "Reply Girls?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Where it was just girls with-- </connor>
<connor> - Scarcely kind clothes, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Obviously I have absolutely nothing </garnt>
<garnt> against people who wanna make that content. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I support all that stuff and any sex workers, </garnt>
<garnt> you keep doing what you wanna do, man. </garnt>
<connor> I wish there was more protection around stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Obviously this isn't, it's very different. </connor>
<connor> But it's just for me personally, </connor>
<connor> most of the time when I see that stuff, </connor>
<connor> I'm not the audience they're trying to appeal to. </connor>
<connor> Because I don't want to... </connor>
<garnt> I don't see that stuff </garnt>
<connor> and I'm not like, "Oh this is the content I wanna see." </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're also not a horny teenager anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right, </connor>
<connor> but to me it's like as someone who is 25, </connor>
<connor> I'm doing my own thing and whatnot, </connor>
<connor> to me when I see a girl dancing as a content creator, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, "Okay, what am I following for here?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What am I... </connor>
<connor> If I wanna follow this creator </connor>
<connor> what am I coming back for? </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - To watch them dance? </connor>
<joey> Like when it's not dancing, </joey>
<joey> it's not dancing - And not even, </joey>
<joey> it's like your 50 year old adult dancing. </joey>
<joey> - They do this fucking same thing every time, </joey>
<connor> they just go like this. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, it's like you're 50 year old aunt </joey>
<connor> at a wedding. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just the bare minimum of movement, </connor>
<connor> and it's like this is dancing. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<connor> Kind of this conversation makes me sound so sexist, </connor>
<joey> I'm not trying to be. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - But it's not the content, </joey>
<joey> we personally want to see all right. </joey>
<connor> - That's not even like the worst kind of like... </connor>
<connor> How can I say? </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the genre is, </connor>
<connor> but like the sleazy bait or whatever. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know what the genre is? </connor>
<connor> Like I remember that-- </connor>
<connor> - It's obviously sexual </connor>
<garnt> and it's trying to appeal. </garnt>
<connor> And anyone who sees the video </connor>
<connor> and says it's not sexual, </connor>
<connor> it's complete bullshit. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] No, it is absolutely sexual. </joey>
<connor> - You know who you're appealing to. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it's very obvious that like, </connor>
<connor> at least in Japan, </connor>
<connor> and I assume with the rest of the world too, </connor>
<connor> that like the main demographic of TikTok </connor>
<connor> is like teenage boys and girls. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So obviously, what are teenage boys gonna enjoy? </connor>
<joey> - Sorry, (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - That kinda sleaze fest. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I remember like the other trends </garnt>
<garnt> that I saw in TikTok was, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like girls who are obviously very confident </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, trying to... </garnt>
<garnt> No, what was I gonna say? </garnt>
<joey> It was girls that had this audio that played, </joey>
<joey> which was- - It's like we're busing? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, it was like... </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> That one's a good one. </connor>
<connor> - If we had 24 hours of me alone </connor>
<connor> and I couldn't say no, </connor>
<connor> what would you do? </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like-- </connor>
<connor> - The meme are good with one. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> most of the memes I've seen with that, </connor>
<connor> are like parodies of that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But that just means that there are enough people </connor>
<connor> doing this unironically- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - To parodies in the first place, right? </garnt>
<connor> - That's why it's been parody so much. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it is obvious saturated, </garnt>
<garnt> and it is such it's bay. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's such sleaze bay, right? </garnt>
<connor> - You know, and I... </connor>
<joey> Its this a new coffee? </joey>
<joey> Lets just give this a taste, </joey>
<joey> coffee gate Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> - Coffee gate! - Coffee gate! </joey>
<joey> - [Man] Trash Taste coffee. </joey>
<connor> - Is it better? </connor>
<connor> - Still tastes funny. (man chuckles) </connor>
<connor> I don't know what's happened. </connor>
<connor> There's something offensive. </connor>
<connor> I know I'm not offended, </connor>
<connor> but I'm like, "Come on, man! </connor>
<connor> Just because I log on the platform, </connor>
<connor> you've gotta show me this shit!" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - "At least give me something else to look at, </connor>
<connor> so you can kind of figure me out." </connor>
<joey> - Give a little bit of variance in the content. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, "Why are you gonna assume what I'm into, man!" </connor>
<joey> Like yeah, "She's beautiful, </joey>
<connor> good for her, I'm glad she's killing it. </connor>
<connor> I'm glad she's got 20 million views every second, </connor>
<connor> good for her. </connor>
<connor> Why did you assume I was into it?" </connor>
<joey> - No, but that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, I wouldn't even be mad </joey>
<connor> if it was just popping up every now and then, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, yeah, of course, you know, </connor>
<connor> it has to appeal to that demographic, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, I had the exact same experience. </connor>
<connor> When I opened it, </connor>
<joey> it was like 49 out of 50, </joey>
<connor> which just different girls. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not mad, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't want to be like headline, </joey>
<joey> "Man gets mad, that woman is dancing..." </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like that's not it, but also-- </joey>
<connor> - No but like, a little of variance </connor>
<joey> doesn't hurt anyone, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It just means like the algorithm </joey>
<joey> hasn't been tailored for you yet. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] But that's-- - Just like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's kind of sad that that's what it was. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you were a new user in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and I assume they know my age and maybe my gender-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or it just means like algorithmically- </garnt>
<joey> - That's kinda content that works, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So it's the best apparently. </connor>
<connor> And I'm guessing it's because </connor>
<connor> there's a certain age range and a demographic </connor>
<connor> that the algorithm puts you in- </connor>
<joey> - [Connor and Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they're just like, </joey>
<garnt> "This person wants to see this kind of content." </garnt>
<joey> - You wanna see horny content, </joey>
<garnt> we got you, bro. </garnt>
<joey> - And I mean, it's everyone knows sex sells, </joey>
<connor> and it's always been that like that </connor>
<garnt> since the beginning of man. </garnt>
<connor> - I would very much like my horny separate from my life. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (all chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - I like it, when I- </connor>
<connor> - Tell that to the man who likes Hentai on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - I can look at Hentai, right? </connor>
<connor> And I can just be like," Nice!" </connor>
<connor> But I don't feel anything towards it, </connor>
<connor> but when I'm like, "All right, I'm now gonna jack off." </connor>
<connor> Then I'm like, "All right." </connor>
<joey> - What do you think I'm jacking off </joey>
<connor> to everything I like Twitter? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no! (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> But that's what I mean. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, I'm scrolling through like. </connor>
<connor> No, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> Yeah, no, but I'm the same, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, "I don't like all these like Hentai pics </connor>
<joey> on Twitter because I'm feeling horny." </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, that's cool art work!" </joey>
<connor> - I think, I don't know really. </connor>
<joey> Why is it... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when you see Hentai </joey>
<garnt> you're like you're unoffended by it. </garnt>
<connor> But sometimes you can see someone trying to be sexy </connor>
<garnt> and it could be annoying, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's the difference between </connor>
<connor> just someone trying to be sexy, </connor>
<connor> and someone who's done put art into it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I think the same way </connor>
<connor> except when I see like </connor>
<connor> a fucking amazing cosplayer player, for example. </connor>
<connor> - I love seeing cosplay. </connor>
<connor> - I love seeing great cosplay, </connor>
<connor> even if some of them are like very suggestive. </connor>
<joey> It doesn't matter </joey>
<joey> because someone put work into this, </joey>
<joey> someone did a photo shoot, </joey>
<joey> and it's fucking great, you know? </joey>
<joey> And I feel like that is the difference </joey>
<connor> between just like seeing Hentai </connor>
<connor> or like really sexy cosplayers on your timeline, </connor>
<connor> versus just seeing, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what's it, like sleazebag. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna call it that you know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, no, I get that, I get that. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, cosplay is amazing </connor>
<connor> and there's plenty of lewd stuff out there that I enjoyed. </connor>
<connor> But that's why I like Twitter. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you can get like 50 memes </joey>
<joey> and a bunch of lewd stuff all in the same place. </joey>
<joey> - Right, it has variance, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe if I used TikTok more </joey>
<joey> and it figured out that I liked some other stuff. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] I'm sure, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I don't know why, </connor>
<connor> I was just kinda like, "Ah, ah." </connor>
<joey> I know on every ad in Japan is like that as well. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if it's Japan, </joey>
<joey> it might be just Japan that's like this, </joey>
<joey> but like every ad I get in Japan as well </joey>
<joey> is like porn or like dating sites. </joey>
<joey> - Like dating sites, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It is literally like, </joey>
<joey> the number one ad that I get on Twitter </joey>
<joey> is this one website, </joey>
<connor> where you can hire girls to speak to you. </connor>
<connor> - I've seen that one. (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - And I get it all the time! </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> this is sad that this is like the number one thing! </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's a whole another thing </joey>
<joey> about loneliness in Japan. - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Guys struggling like that. </connor>
<connor> - I genuinely don't even think like, </connor>
<connor> even after it gets tailored, </connor>
<connor> that that will go away. </connor>
<garnt> Because I feel it's just the main demographic in Japan-- </garnt>
<garnt> - How much have you used TikTok? </garnt>
<garnt> Well I guess you use TikTok more than either of us? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, when I say I'm on TikTok, </joey>
<connor> I'm not really like religiously on TikTok. </connor>
<connor> I just go onto it every now and then </connor>
<connor> when I'm like there's nothing to see on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> But again, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I haven't used it enough </connor>
<connor> that I see a variance of all sorts of content. </connor>
<joey> I'm still at that early stage </joey>
<joey> where I see 49 out of 50 girls dancing. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, same here. </garnt>
<connor> Which is why I found myself watching more YouTube Shorts </connor>
<connor> because it seems, </connor>
<connor> most of them are just recycled TikToks anyway, </connor>
<connor> but I already have a YouTube profile. </connor>
<joey> And so a lot of the content is already tailored </joey>
<joey> to the stuff I've watched on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> And every time I log into TikTok, </joey>
<joey> I don't see a lot of these TikTok trends </joey>
<joey> that have just become viral. </joey>
<connor> Even though everyone seems to be talking about them, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, it's not appearing on my timeline." </connor>
<connor> I dunno what my profile is set to-- </connor>
<connor> - I take TikTok trends very lightly-- </connor>
<connor> - Have you seen some of the latest ones. </connor>
<connor> Like, have you seen... </connor>
<connor> - Were about to date this episode, but like. </connor>
<connor> - I remember a month ago, </connor>
<connor> I just wanted to die inside </connor>
<connor> because there was this trend </connor>
<connor> called like devious things or something. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Which was just okay. </connor>
<connor> So devious licks are just people </connor>
<connor> who just went to like bathrooms, </connor>
<connor> and kids would start stealing like the soap dispensers. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And then it started off as that. </connor>
<connor> And then, you know how TikTok is, </connor>
<connor> you know the internet is. </connor>
<connor> It starts escalating </connor>
<connor> to the point where people were just full on, </connor>
<connor> like, they're stealing like- - [Connor] Sinks. </connor>
<connor> - Sinks, roadsigns, </connor>
<garnt> and there's like people that stole whole vending machines. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - Okay, hold on. </joey>
<connor> How the fuck do you steal a vending machine? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. - How do you do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you have to pray some of the logistical abilities- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Pertaining stealing. </connor>
<connor> - But at the same time, </connor>
<garnt> you're just combating like almost Grand Theft Auto </garnt>
<connor> and just putting out on the internet to see. </connor>
<garnt> - It was obviously stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a trend that was widely condemned </garnt>
<joey> whenever YouTube under then someone-- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - Made a video condemning it. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's easy. </joey>
<connor> It's a slam dunk when your YouTube would be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey guys, stealing, bad." </connor>
<connor> Applause now please. </connor>
<joey> I will take my applause, you know. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I just can't get over that someone </connor>
<joey> had the balls to steal a vending machine. </joey>
<joey> I don't even think repo men are allowed to do that. </joey>
<connor> - Alright man, all the trees will still get stuck-- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's true. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just more surprised </connor>
<connor> that just people were just stealing </connor>
<garnt> and then filming themselves stealing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, well people aren't so small. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> When clout is offered. </connor>
<connor> - Clout is offered. - Clout is value, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - When clout is on the table, anything goes. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Function like a normal human being or prison time. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did hear about a couch guy, </garnt>
<joey> or the couch guy? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - This one's very familiar. </joey>
<joey> - That was the latest trend as well I heard about. </joey>
<joey> - I'm scared to ask what that is. </joey>
<joey> - So it was this girl </joey>
<joey> who basically surprised visited her boyfriend in college. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And she walks in </joey>
<connor> and the guy, her boyfriend is sitting on a couch </connor>
<connor> and he doesn't seem as excited </connor>
<connor> as maybe one would expect. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So he acts a little bit awkward, you know? </connor>
<connor> And he then he eventually gets up and hugs her, right? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And Twi... </connor>
<connor> I was gonna say Twitter. </connor>
<garnt> TikTok takes us like 30 seconds clip </garnt>
<garnt> and was like, "He's cheating on her." </garnt>
<connor> - They literally went like full Netflix documentary, </connor>
<connor> true crime-- - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Were internet detecting. </joey>
<connor> - Analyzing the frame by frame. </connor>
<connor> And like, it was insane. </connor>
<joey> It was just like the worst part of the internet. </joey>
<joey> - So was he cheating on her? </joey>
<joey> - No, they said no. </joey>
<joey> But they were like, </joey>
<connor> "Yoh! calm the down." - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Big, big facts. </joey>
<joey> Maybe he wasn't just excited. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> There could be so many ways </garnt>
<garnt> you could spin this narrative, right? </garnt>
<joey> And they're all like, </joey>
<garnt> "Literally people just full on projecting </garnt>
<joey> their narrative towards this 30 second clip." </joey>
<joey> Like I saw this one TikTok </joey>
<joey> that was just like, </joey>
<joey> the girl release a statement that was like, </joey>
<joey> and she said, </joey>
<joey> "There's nothing more to this clip. </joey>
<joey> I'm friends with all the girls. </joey>
<joey> You don't need to worry about it. </joey>
<joey> I know the girls." </joey>
<joey> And this one woman posted the TikTok being like, </joey>
<joey> "Girl, you don't need to worry. </joey>
<joey> You don't have friends </joey>
<joey> because I've seen friends like them. </joey>
<joey> They're not your friends. </joey>
<joey> Friends should be excited </joey>
<joey> when their friends steps into the room. </joey>
<joey> We've all been in that position." </joey>
<joey> I'm just like-- - Maybe she was just British. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just like, I know right? </garnt>
<garnt> - If there's anything worse than an internet detective, </garnt>
<connor> it's an internet therapist. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Those are the worst. </connor>
<garnt> Where it's like, "Let me tell you why your wife's sucks." </garnt>
<garnt> You say it's great, but it doesn't. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me tell you why. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "Dude, leave me alone." </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was just like, </garnt>
<connor> there is no way you can break down this much of a narrative </connor>
<connor> through a 30 second interaction. </connor>
<joey> - No, God no! </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's the thing about the internet where-- </garnt>
<joey> - It's like some Zodiac killer shit. </joey>
<garnt> - It is, it literally was. </garnt>
<joey> - They found him out though. </joey>
<connor> - I was, have they found him? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they found him recently. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - They found him, he died, </garnt>
<garnt> and he left a review for the movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did he? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - He left a review for the Zodiac-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, is this confirmed? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - How did they find him? </connor>
<joey> - Ah, there was, oh, I think-- </joey>
<joey> - He died in like 2017 or something. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - They quite awhile about. </connor>
<joey> - I can't remember how they found him, </joey>
<joey> there was some scars. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember exactly, it doesn't really matter. </joey>
<connor> They found him basically. </connor>
<connor> And then he left her... </connor>
<connor> I don't care how they found him, </connor>
<connor> I wanted to know what he thought about the movie. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And he left a review on the IMDB page. </connor>
<connor> - Really? - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Did he say it was good or? </joey>
<garnt> - I think he didn't like it. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, that's just right kind of funny even though. </connor>
<garnt> Makes murder reviews his own movie. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know why, I was just like... </connor>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, wait, before we move on, </garnt>
<connor> I forgot to give you something last week Joey. </connor>
<connor> Me and Sade got a bunch of omiyage for everyone. </connor>
<connor> And I said to Sade, </connor>
<connor> I was gonna give this to you on the podcast, </connor>
<connor> but here's some tea. </connor>
<garnt> - I've got some tea. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - I gave him to me last week off camera. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I'm tryna shield my friendship. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Well, that's perfect 'cause you gave me cookies. </connor>
<connor> Garnt gave me tea, </connor>
<garnt> sounds like a perfect combination. </garnt>
<joey> - Cookies biscuits. </joey>
<joey> - Biscuits whatever. </joey>
<joey> - No, because do you know what I've realized </joey>
<joey> after like buying omiyage for people </joey>
<joey> from like English omiyage. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh very cute. - Very cute. </joey>
<connor> - So tea set. </connor>
<connor> - Nice, thanks man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no worries. </connor>
<garnt> - Because what I've realized-- </garnt>
<garnt> - We're friends, we're friends. </garnt>
<garnt> Guys analyze that click, analyze it all. </garnt>
<joey> Analyze that frame by frame. </joey>
<connor> Well, Jowey wasn't excited (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Joey wasn't that excited. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I mean, there's, there's some going on. </joey>
<joey> There's some going on. </joey>
<connor> - He's definitely cheating. </connor>
<connor> - You tell a lie, you choked. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, there is some kind of truth in that, </connor>
<connor> in some aspects I have seen people on Reddit </connor>
<connor> or the comments, </connor>
<connor> super analyzing our reactions to things like what? </connor>
<joey> I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> This there's been a lot though. </joey>
<joey> There's like, oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> It kind of seems really centered today. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but Redit it's like a free </joey>
<joey> when it comes to that kind of stuff, we just. </joey>
<joey> Say what they want. </joey>
<joey> - It's interesting though. </joey>
<joey> Seeing how people perceive us sometimes </joey>
<joey> and sometimes in a good way, </joey>
<connor> sometimes in a bad way. </connor>
<joey> - That doesn't everyone always say </joey>
<joey> that you always look angry </joey>
<joey> or likes Ty. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Everyone was like, oh, I am tired. </joey>
<connor> A lot of the stuff that's. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I have to, I wake up early, </connor>
<connor> but you know, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Some people like he's angry and I'm like, no, I'm just, </connor>
<connor> I just tired. </connor>
<connor> - This is resting face. </connor>
<connor> - You'll know if I'm angry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Will you, maybe you're there. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I dunno. </joey>
<joey> - I'll storm off. </joey>
<joey> I just won't be here. </joey>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> I (laughs). </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> No, but like, yeah, read it. </connor>
<connor> I've seen some stuff on Reddit where it's like, </connor>
<connor> wow, you got it. </connor>
<joey> Ain't that deep, bro. </joey>
<joey> Like, you didn't have to go to that. </joey>
<connor> - It's difficult because on one aspect, </connor>
<connor> I understand that all they have to go off </connor>
<joey> of ours is our episodes. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And that's all they have to go off. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I wouldn't, by any stretch of the imagination, </connor>
<connor> say that trash taste is reflective of, </connor>
<connor> well, I just said is reflective of who I am, </connor>
<connor> but you miss a lot of nuance. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Like it's very easy to generalize who we are, </connor>
<connor> but also as a show. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So here we are. </connor>
<connor> We do, I won't lie. </connor>
<garnt> There's times where I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> I'm going to keep this argument going. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's great content. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - A lot of the times I wouldn't, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the arguments I get into with Connor or Joey </garnt>
<garnt> or not arguments I'd get into with a random stranger. </garnt>
<connor> - I would just get, I don't, </connor>
<connor> even though I do feel strongly about a lot of things </connor>
<connor> as you guys know very well. </connor>
<joey> I also, in general life just don't give a to argue. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I like arguing in this space with the boys. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even give a on the shot. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<garnt> - The judges, Joe, just like trash tastes. </garnt>
<joey> Like. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, with the guy in the background with the bomb. </joey>
<joey> Just like I don't care. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes I do like to go to explore </connor>
<joey> other sides of opinions as well. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it also is like, if it is, </connor>
<connor> sometimes there are controversial opinions. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But they are opinions. </connor>
<connor> And then they are sometimes commonly held opinions. </connor>
<connor> And it's one of those things </connor>
<connor> where I would like to play devil's advocate </connor>
<connor> in some situations without having to be like Connor, </connor>
<connor> is that kind of person he's like... </connor>
<joey> - Yeah just to get conversation. </joey>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, we've always said </connor>
<connor> we don't have to be a circle track. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - And I always want to be able </connor>
<connor> to talk about topics and say things. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It just makes more far more interesting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, if anything, </joey>
<joey> I would wish that sometimes people </joey>
<connor> would like not assume exactly our thoughts </connor>
<connor> and opinions on things based off the things that we're. </connor>
<joey> - Supposed to buy Harrys. </joey>
<connor> - Does, are you heading back to the office? </connor>
<connor> Anytime soon. </connor>
<joey> - I'm in the office right now. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Tell him to get back fresh, </connor>
<connor> clean, and all shaven looking business like, </connor>
<connor> and let Harrys help you get. </connor>
<joey> - If you don't know Harrys it's time you do </joey>
<joey> because Harrys was created </joey>
<connor> to be hitting different from other shaving companies, </connor>
<connor> little, little reference, </connor>
<connor> how always cross high quality, </connor>
<connor> long lasting blades and durable weighted handles </connor>
<joey> that make a close, comfortable shave quick. </joey>
<joey> And dare we say enjoy. </joey>
<joey> - Ooh, </joey>
<garnt> because Harrys insists </garnt>
<garnt> that you shouldn't have to choose </garnt>
<garnt> between a great shave and a fair price. </garnt>
<garnt> They just give you both refilling blade starts </garnt>
<garnt> as low as two box. </garnt>
<connor> - Even easier. </connor>
<connor> New Harrys customers get their starter set, </connor>
<connor> which includes a five blade razor weighted handle firming </connor>
<connor> gel with Allo and a travel cover. </connor>
<connor> It's a $13 value all for just $3 43. </connor>
<connor> Is that a typo? </connor>
<connor> Typo, that is insane value. </connor>
<connor> And there are a bunch of other products. </connor>
<connor> And now I've actually used, </connor>
<connor> Harrys a bunch myself. </connor>
<connor> When I went to the UK, </connor>
<connor> when I was getting on the plane, </connor>
<connor> I actually saw Harrys in the store </connor>
<connor> and I wanted to buy more. </connor>
<connor> But there's no in Japan, I've actually bought a bunch. </connor>
<garnt> - You leach these stocks up on Harrys. </garnt>
<garnt> - So there's never been a better time to try. </garnt>
<garnt> Harrys going to Harrys.com/trash </garnt>
<garnt> to get their starter set </garnt>
<connor> for just three bucks. </connor>
<connor> It's 100% satisfaction guarantee. </connor>
<connor> So you've got nothing to lose. </connor>
<connor> Go to harrys.com/trash right now to get its special offer. </connor>
<joey> - That's H A R R Y S.com/trash links down </joey>
<joey> in the description below. </joey>
<connor> Like (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - Like one thing that I hate about the internet, right? </connor>
<connor> And this is one thing that I actually despise </connor>
<connor> about being an online creator </connor>
<connor> is that if I want to talk bad about something, </connor>
<connor> I always have to preface it before. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> And we did the study with the thing </connor>
<connor> with like me saying, </connor>
<connor> like, I don't want to see, </connor>
<connor> girls dancing that isn't trying to entice, you know? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I have to then preface that by saying I support sex work. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I think it should just should be a given </joey>
<joey> that that's what's. </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) think so. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So that's the way I feel, </joey>
<joey> but it sucks the internet that I have to always preface </joey>
<joey> that, okay, I support this, this, this, but, </joey>
<joey> and I hate that fact that I can't just talk. </joey>
<joey> I have to then be like, </joey>
<joey> go through the checklist. </joey>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> I want to talk about this stuff. </joey>
<joey> All right, cool. </joey>
<joey> I've got to make sure that everyone knows that I support </joey>
<joey> this, this, this, this, this. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - You got a ride on (indistinct) to fine prime. </joey>
<joey> - Just because someone is always gonna assume </joey>
<joey> the worst of you. </joey>
<joey> They're always going to assume the, </joey>
<joey> what you're saying is the worst thing </joey>
<joey> and it's kind of a bad </joey>
<joey> place that they don't agree. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You can't, say anything bad about something </joey>
<connor> that they agree with </connor>
<connor> because they don't want to hear it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And you know, it's and it's over the internet, </garnt>
<garnt> especially if it was in person, </garnt>
<connor> they put you in a different. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because that's the biggest thing I've noticed </garnt>
<garnt> about speaking on line on the incident </garnt>
<garnt> and speaking to someone person </garnt>
<garnt> to person you like online, </garnt>
<garnt> you do have to preface a lot of things </garnt>
<garnt> because it seems like in person to person, </garnt>
<joey> people are more willing to give you </joey>
<joey> the benefit of the doubt. </joey>
<garnt> - 100%. - 100%. </garnt>
<garnt> - Online people aren't willing </garnt>
<joey> to give you the benefit of the doubt. </joey>
<joey> A lot of the times. </joey>
<garnt> - I think the other problem </garnt>
<garnt> as well is that on the internet, </garnt>
<garnt> it's very much a one-way conversation. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you have to give your entire spiel all in one, go. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Otherwise, if they do reply back to you, </connor>
<connor> then it's not going to be this conversation. </connor>
<connor> It's just going to be like shooting </connor>
<connor> the messenger kind of deal. </connor>
<connor> Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, it sucks that on the internet, </connor>
<connor> common sense. </connor>
<joey> Isn't as common as people make it out. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, when we say bad things about Japan, right? </connor>
<connor> That comes from a place of loving Japan </connor>
<connor> and being here for awhile, </connor>
<connor> we're here for a reason, right? </connor>
<connor> We like, we love this place and we love living here, </connor>
<connor> but it sucks that every time this </connor>
<connor> and this has only happened to Japan and the UK, </connor>
<connor> I never have to say, I love the UK. </connor>
<connor> Only with Japan. </connor>
<connor> Do you have to say, </connor>
<connor> I love Japan, but like, </connor>
<connor> because it has this weird stigma, </connor>
<connor> but there's a lot of topics </connor>
<joey> that you have to do that in the internet. </joey>
<joey> If you want to say anything bad about it, </joey>
<joey> you be like, I love this thing, but. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if you don't say that before, people are like, </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> you come from a place of hating. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know and it's so frustrating </connor>
<connor> that that's what it's become, </connor>
<connor> because I feel that there are so many discussions </connor>
<connor> it's so bloated because you have to go </connor>
<connor> through the checklist of all this fucking nonsense. </connor>
<connor> - That is the biggest difference </connor>
<joey> between us talking in a pub and us talking on trash taste, </joey>
<joey> which we have the same kind of conversations. </joey>
<joey> But it's like, you put your, </joey>
<connor> you putting yourself through a buffer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like have more safety net </connor>
<connor> of the things you're about to say, </connor>
<garnt> whereas I wouldn't need to do that if like, </garnt>
<garnt> there were no cameras filming. </garnt>
<connor> - (laughs) Like putting on the seatbelt, like this 50, </connor>
<connor> like the whole like way, </connor>
<connor> way back with the gambling episode, </connor>
<connor> right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I never, ever once thought for a second. </connor>
<connor> And we were doing that episode, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is, probably like a quite well-known episode </connor>
<connor> amongst the viewers </connor>
<connor> that you guys were addicted to gambling. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - I know you guys, you're not addicted to gambling, </connor>
<connor> no point in your life. </connor>
<connor> Would I say you? </connor>
<joey> You know, and it was weird how, </joey>
<connor> because we didn't that, </connor>
<connor> 'cause we didn't say because you, </connor>
<connor> even though you guys are playing devil's advocate to me </connor>
<connor> and I was very much, </connor>
<connor> I was very much arguing in Gacha specifically, </connor>
<connor> but there should be more regulation </connor>
<connor> and that it should be like that. </connor>
<connor> And you guys were just playing devil's advocate with me, </connor>
<connor> right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I know that you guys want to take it to catch it, </connor>
<connor> but it was weird seeing a lot of the comments, </connor>
<connor> just jump to conclusions and being like, </connor>
<connor> they must be addicted to catcher because they don't agree </connor>
<connor> with Connor's opinion. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, all right, you can, you can, you can be, </connor>
<connor> you can not gamble and not be a gambler, </connor>
<connor> but also think that catcher doesn't need any more. </connor>
<joey> - If you don't specify it, </joey>
<connor> then they think that you're on the very end of the spectrum. </connor>
<joey> You're not allowed to be. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was just weird. </joey>
<connor> Seeing all the comments, getting so aggressive about it. </connor>
<connor> Like people get like angry about it and it's happened on a </connor>
<connor> few other apps. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I think like it kind of happened quite recently with view </garnt>
<connor> isn't it like the trip debates? </connor>
<connor> - Oh my gosh. </connor>
<connor> - I think, I think we, </connor>
<garnt> I think the problem with that was that we were arguing like </garnt>
<garnt> two different things. </garnt>
<connor> - And so it was, that was a weird one. </connor>
<garnt> - And people, people took me. </garnt>
<garnt> I was, 'cause I was trying to argue that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you can have driven the matter how much you pay for it or </garnt>
<garnt> how much is how much the clothes are worth. </garnt>
<connor> And you are arguing that, you know, </connor>
<connor> don't support fast fashion and you know, try to, you know, </connor>
<connor> you try to buy things or buy clothes that are more </connor>
<connor> sustainable in different environments. </connor>
<connor> And you care more about quality nowadays. </connor>
<garnt> And people took that as wow. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor and Joey have just like lost their way. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> People like wow is so privilege. </connor>
<connor> And by most metrics I am privileged. </connor>
<connor> Never. </connor>
<connor> I'm never pretending to be like, I live, </connor>
<connor> like I come from like a really far off, </connor>
<connor> I've never got tended. </connor>
<connor> And everyone's like, you know, it was really weird. </connor>
<connor> That was because at no point in that argument, </connor>
<joey> did I ever argue that that drip had to be expensive clothes? </joey>
<joey> I, </joey>
<joey> my main argument was that the word drip initially came from, </joey>
<joey> you know, when, </joey>
<connor> when you were like the rappers who would wet grip and it was </connor>
<connor> all branded, it had to be branded. </connor>
<connor> You know, that was my argument. </connor>
<connor> And at no point did I ever argue that cheap clothes didn't </connor>
<connor> look good? </connor>
<connor> But for some reason the common section took me arguing that </connor>
<connor> I prefer quality clothes, not looks quality. </connor>
<connor> Like I prefer stuff that lasts longer </connor>
<connor> than that damper support, </connor>
<connor> fast fashion and all that. </connor>
<connor> They were like, oh, well, all these fast fashion, </connor>
<connor> all the high-end ones are using slave labor. </connor>
<connor> Anyway. </connor>
<connor> It's like, well, you're just generalizing it. </connor>
<connor> You're putting them all in the bubble, </connor>
<garnt> but I never made that argument. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<connor> It was, really bizarre. </connor>
<garnt> - Didn't you didn't, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess the issue was that </garnt>
<connor> you didn't put that safety net. </connor>
<connor> - I never, and at no point </connor>
<connor> did I say drip has to equal money? </connor>
<garnt> And that was the problem, </garnt>
<connor> because I didn't say that people assumed </connor>
<connor> that I was thinking that people have to assume, </connor>
<connor> and it wasn't even funny. </connor>
<connor> I said at one point, </connor>
<connor> Joey, he'd you watched it back, </connor>
<connor> Joey joked say, yeah, drip is expensive. </connor>
<connor> You were joking. </connor>
<connor> But Jerry, he was mainly me. </connor>
<connor> Wow. </connor>
<connor> I was like, what is happening? </connor>
<connor> And it was like, the whole comment was like, </connor>
<connor> Connor's privilege is really showing I'm like what? </connor>
<connor> And then like, man, </connor>
<connor> they think with a first-world mindset. </connor>
<connor> And I was thinking that like I was like </connor>
<connor> from a first world country course, </connor>
<connor> I'm going to think I'm trying my best to learn </connor>
<connor> and to expand my horizons </connor>
<connor> and learn more about other countries. </connor>
<connor> But you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm obviously gonna think through a first world perspective. </connor>
<joey> Like that's because that's my world. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> I don't like, </joey>
<joey> is it wrong of me to have that perspective? </joey>
<joey> I'm now because I. </joey>
<joey> - Feel that's the only. </joey>
<joey> Perspective I'm trying to learn about other things. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> - But I'm try to learn (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - But in the case with that argument, </connor>
<joey> it's very difficult to bring in a different perspective. </joey>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<joey> Without a making no sense. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I think the argument is that, </garnt>
<connor> you know, yes. </connor>
<connor> Do you support sustainable fashion, </connor>
<connor> but a lot of people from third world countries </connor>
<joey> con you know, being able to sustain, </joey>
<connor> being able to support sustainable fashion </connor>
<connor> is in itself a privilege </connor>
<connor> because other people can't do that. </connor>
<joey> And you know, </joey>
<joey> some people will do at the moment have no choice, </joey>
<garnt> but to buy cheap fashion because they can hardly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well can never hold it against anyone. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, when I was buying those, I mentioned like, </garnt>
<garnt> when I was buying the suit, </garnt>
<garnt> that was like 30 pounds. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was because that was all I could afford. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't get, there was no other option. </garnt>
<connor> I couldn't even like entertain </connor>
<connor> the idea of getting a suit that costs 100. </connor>
<connor> But obviously when you're doing better </connor>
<connor> and you have more income, </connor>
<connor> I do think it's more of a responsible thing to do to try </connor>
<connor> and buy things more ethically. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> In that episode, you'd never once said, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - I remember seeing this other argument of like, </connor>
<connor> well, they just overpriced the clothes, et cetera, </connor>
<connor> et cetera. </connor>
<connor> And I, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes they do do that, but also, it's, </connor>
<connor> I've had this debate coming from, you know, </connor>
<connor> doing voice acting a lot, </connor>
<connor> which is a job that takes one hour most of the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you get, you can get paid like $10,000. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Most people would think that's, we'd argue, </connor>
<connor> that's absurd. </connor>
<connor> You should never get paid that much </connor>
<connor> for one hour of work. </connor>
<connor> But it's what goes into being able to do it in one hour. </connor>
<connor> The reason why I could do that in one hour </connor>
<connor> is because I'm trained </connor>
<connor> and I can do the job professionally. </connor>
<connor> I know how to use the equipment. </connor>
<connor> I know how to do everything in a way </connor>
<joey> where you couldn't just take someone, </joey>
<joey> you get the quality of sound, right. </joey>
<joey> You get, somebody who can do the quality </joey>
<joey> that you want within </joey>
<joey> one hour in a professional way. </joey>
<joey> And it's the same way with close to me. </joey>
<joey> Like, if I want a suit, </joey>
<joey> if I am in a good enough position </joey>
<joey> to be able to afford a suit, </joey>
<connor> that is a nice suit and I can get it made </connor>
<connor> for me specifically. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> And get it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I got it. </connor>
<connor> I have the problem though, </connor>
<connor> that I have short legs, massive. </connor>
<connor> So pants don't scale like that. </connor>
<connor> They scale wide and down I, </connor>
<connor> the pants I have to get like fitted </connor>
<connor> because my, just </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> so like that was always a challenge. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> I always had jeans that were </connor>
<connor> either too short or too tight. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> And I still have that problem </connor>
<connor> because you can't get tailor, </connor>
<joey> fit jeans, they probably can't, </joey>
<connor> but it's a real easy to get fitted. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I think as well, like, </connor>
<connor> so if you were to get, like, </connor>
<connor> let's say you go to a tailor, right. </connor>
<connor> You're paying a tailor who knows how to do it. </connor>
<connor> Well, he's done this for like 20 years. </connor>
<connor> He's experienced his whole life. </connor>
<connor> He can promise you that he'll do a good deal. </connor>
<connor> It's worth the extra money. </connor>
<connor> If you have the money and you know, </connor>
<connor> you can support a local business if it was one. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> I think if you, again, this is only if you have the luxury, </connor>
<garnt> like it's, it's certainly a privilege you want to do that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I would never, </garnt>
<garnt> ever get anyone's case for not doing that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean... </garnt>
<garnt> If you gotta, you gotta do what you gotta do to survive. </garnt>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<connor> Everyone else. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's like, </connor>
<joey> what I don't understand is the criticism towards like how </joey>
<connor> you spend your own hard earned money. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I earned that money myself. </connor>
<connor> I'll do with that money. </connor>
<joey> However, I please. </joey>
<joey> - That's a good point as well. </joey>
<connor> Like. </connor>
<joey> - Taking care of my finances. </joey>
<connor> It's like, why you care. </connor>
<connor> - You can't listen. </connor>
<connor> The only, </connor>
<connor> the only questionable decision I make is my Jojo collection. </connor>
<connor> Right? That's the, I'll give you props for that. </connor>
<connor> But everything. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty. </connor>
<connor> I compare us to other YouTubers. </connor>
<joey> I think we're pretty normal. </joey>
<connor> Whereas you have a Lambo garden when I rent a car, </connor>
<connor> you know what, like, </connor>
<connor> you know what car I rent a Toyota Yaris. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I love the Toyota guy. </garnt>
<garnt> It is on my couch on that car is fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> It's perfect size. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not too big. </garnt>
<garnt> - We don't. </garnt>
<garnt> We don't even own cars. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I take the train everyday. </connor>
<connor> - It's I hate this thing where people are like, </connor>
<connor> they judge us for what we're fucking doing with our lives. </connor>
<joey> And it's like, bro, just like, </joey>
<joey> I don't come to your house </joey>
<joey> and be like really hot pockets cringe, bro. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We got cheese puffs. </connor>
<connor> Like, no, what? </connor>
<connor> Like what is this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause, like you're going back to what you were saying </garnt>
<connor> about getting paid for like doing an hour of voice. </connor>
<connor> It getting paid like a certain amount </connor>
<connor> that voice actors do get paid. </connor>
<connor> And I give this example to like every artist, right. </connor>
<connor> Or every, anyone working in that kind of field, </connor>
<connor> which is you go to you, </connor>
<connor> then you have to ask the client then. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> So would you rather pay the same amount </connor>
<connor> for me to do this work </connor>
<connor> in five hours or in 10 hours </connor>
<connor> to get the same amount of work? </connor>
<connor> And if they say yeah or no, </connor>
<connor> then you can say that. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> So I'm being punished for, </connor>
<connor> do my job well efficiently in this time period. </connor>
<connor> So you'd rather pay someone else to do the same work </connor>
<connor> for more time. </connor>
<connor> Even though you're paying them for like, </connor>
<connor> you're paying for the same amount of work, </connor>
<connor> but you're paying them to do it less efficiently than you. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like the perception is that </connor>
<connor> because you're doing it this well, </connor>
<connor> you're giving them the same amount of work </connor>
<connor> for a shorter period of time. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That you're charging that much. </connor>
<connor> And that's just how the industry is. </connor>
<connor> You know, you're not just paying for hours, worked in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're paying for skill as well. </connor>
<garnt> And skill is part of the pricing that you pay. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah absolutely. </connor>
<connor> - And also, when it's these big advertising companies, </connor>
<connor> in what realm is it fair for your voice? </connor>
<connor> Be plastered over same. </connor>
<connor> McDonald's all over the country. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Its a branding issue. </connor>
<connor> - You got a brand like, </connor>
<connor> it's a using your voice. </connor>
<connor> So you have a certain right to, </connor>
<connor> to sell that what it's worth. </connor>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of jobs like that. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, like the art, like art design, </joey>
<joey> graphic design, anything, it's, if it's, </joey>
<connor> if it's although like stuff like voice acting, </connor>
<connor> I 100% admit, </connor>
<connor> like it seems very easy from the outside, </connor>
<joey> but to be able to do it consistently </joey>
<joey> and perform what the person wants </joey>
<joey> and be able to adjust </joey>
<joey> and be able to do it all professionally, </joey>
<joey> it's very difficult. </joey>
<joey> - And to be able to do it over and over (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> Build the reputation. </joey>
<joey> - You've got a long way to go, man. </joey>
<joey> There's people who are much better than me who can do it, </joey>
<connor> but you know, at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> you want to make sure everyone's getting the right. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's, one of those tough decisions. </connor>
<connor> Money is always one of those topics </connor>
<connor> that is so polarizing, depending on what's going on, </connor>
<garnt> where you're from and your, </garnt>
<garnt> just your opinions on it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I've had people close to me </garnt>
<connor> who have been like very critical </connor>
<connor> of me earning money, doing what I do. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they they've been like, well, I do X thing. </connor>
<connor> Like I do X thing. </connor>
<connor> That's more contributing to society. </connor>
<connor> So I don't think it's right. </connor>
<joey> That, you would get paid more than me. </joey>
<joey> And that whole argument. </joey>
<connor> I absolutely despise as well. </connor>
<joey> - Because it's like, what can you say to that? </joey>
<joey> That will get them to understand, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like, if you work in like medicine </joey>
<connor> or something and you firmly believe </connor>
<connor> that you are doing something more important, </connor>
<connor> I would argue, you want to accept more important </connor>
<connor> than you are, </connor>
<connor> but that's just business. </connor>
<connor> That's how it is. </connor>
<joey> - That's how it was. </joey>
<joey> We don't make a virus. </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - I think there are jobs that are far more important </connor>
<garnt> than the jobs that we have now. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolutely. </connor>
<connor> - The fact that teachers get paid, </connor>
<garnt> what they do, I think is. </garnt>
<connor> - Fucking atrious. </connor>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - And I think they should like get much better pay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's also like, you got to do what you got to do, </connor>
<connor> make your own bag. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like the world doesn't do any favors (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - That's not something we can do (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - I will advocate for it for change. </joey>
<joey> And I will do what I can from my position. </joey>
<joey> But also bro, this economy's right. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> You don't, it's bad, but it's like, </connor>
<connor> what the that you trooper can afford a house. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> where like now being wealthy as you can afford a house. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Like I'm trying to secure my future </connor>
<joey> because I don't know how long this job last. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Like I've tried to do well while I can, </joey>
<joey> I would never criticize anyone </joey>
<connor> who is trying to do what they need to do to succeed in life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - If you're not fucking </joey>
<joey> over somebody do what you need to do. </joey>
<joey> Like as long as you're not actively hurting </joey>
<joey> or ruining someone's life, </joey>
<joey> you do what you gotta do to get by </joey>
<joey> and you do what you need to do, man. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I firmly believe that whatever you want to do, </connor>
<connor> don't hurt anyone. </connor>
<connor> Go, for it. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it could be. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I think one thing that's one aspect of our job, </garnt>
<garnt> which of the, </garnt>
<joey> which we wouldn't have as like a normal office worker </joey>
<joey> for example, is job security. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you want to get in this field </joey>
<joey> and you want job security, </joey>
<garnt> I think we have negative job security. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Like how hard it is to like, </connor>
<garnt> you apply for like credit cards </garnt>
<garnt> or anything long term financing. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I want to know what your annual income </connor>
<connor> that is literally impossible to give a number as a YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> So I'm not going to be honest with you. </joey>
<connor> It could be like one K or it could be 20 K or 100 K. </connor>
<connor> So basically the whole spectrum of money. </connor>
<joey> - It's hard to go to a banker and go, </joey>
<connor> well I think the next video might do really well. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm thinking maybe like this much. </connor>
<connor> - It must be like the banks when they first met YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> they must have thought they were like horse gambling. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> There were definitely like money laundering. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> This is like, </connor>
<joey> this is what we think like NFTs are now you hunt. </joey>
<joey> You own. </joey>
<joey> How much has YouTube? </joey>
<connor> No, no. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) touching that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some money just comes in </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> when you don't buy or sell anything? </connor>
<garnt> - So it's true? </garnt>
<connor> - What do you, so Sue, who pays you? </connor>
<connor> I remember the first time, </connor>
<connor> like having to answer that question, </connor>
<connor> like when applying for like our visas and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> and I'm having to explain who pays us, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, well Google, so. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And so like you set an appointment </connor>
<connor> for Google you're employee of Google. </connor>
<connor> You're like. </connor>
<connor> - [All] No. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And then we have this thing called patriarchy </joey>
<joey> where people pay us to exist. </joey>
<joey> - So you are employed to patrons? </joey>
<joey> Like. </joey>
<garnt> - [All] No. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like every, every like red flag is being ticked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, when you're a doctor, right? </connor>
<connor> You, your job is secure. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Unless you got around killing people, </connor>
<connor> you're pretty good. </connor>
<connor> Like you, it would be rough not to be employed. </connor>
<garnt> - I just realized how on paper? </garnt>
<connor> Like how similar we must look to like a drug dealer, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Michaelson laundering money. </connor>
<connor> If you, go to the checklist, </connor>
<connor> so you get money put into your account. </connor>
<connor> - I swear. </connor>
<connor> When I have to talk to your accountants, man, </connor>
<connor> it's the most stressful thing </connor>
<connor> because that just like I can </connor>
<connor> see on the zoom calls the look on their face </connor>
<connor> while I'm telling them what I'm doing. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> Just like, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I find, it hilarious. </joey>
<joey> It's the situation of a drug deal, </joey>
<joey> going to a bank to get along. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's like, so do you, so you sell drugs. </joey>
<connor> Do you work for the pharmacy? </connor>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I haven't got the drugs yet. </garnt>
<garnt> So this is kind of like collateral. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Drug dealers. </connor>
<connor> What'd you do? </connor>
<joey> I'm a YouTube. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I provide us (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - I guess it's a timely topic. </connor>
<joey> Well, not timely. </joey>
<garnt> I still be like three weeks late, </garnt>
<garnt> but that the whole Twitch thing as well, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The earnings. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - People finding out how much credit is make, </connor>
<joey> what, was your number, Jerry? </joey>
<joey> - I don't even. </joey>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - I was like probably 20,000 or something. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - So when you're in top 10,000 ducks, both league. </connor>
<garnt> - Hell yeah, let's go. </garnt>
<connor> - This is why I'm a man of the color. </connor>
<connor> I am the man. </connor>
<connor> I am the man of the people I recommend. </connor>
<joey> I represent the common folk. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - He's doing God's work right here. </joey>
<connor> - This man. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I hope, all YouTubes is get leaked before the next, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> this age is poorly forgotten. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> God that was funny. </connor>
<connor> It was seeing it. </connor>
<connor> It was funny seeing the reaction. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you know, as somebody who's been doing this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was not surprised I've seen these numbers. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> Absolutely not. </joey>
<joey> - And also I try to tell, </joey>
<joey> I always try to explain to people, </joey>
<joey> the reason why let's say X QC is earning 7 million </joey>
<joey> and getting all this absurd amounts of money. </joey>
<joey> What it seems like absurd is that, </joey>
<connor> you know that if the number one person in music </connor>
<connor> is making billions TV is making millions, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The number one at anything is making tons of models. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you're on the top, </connor>
<connor> a hundred of something in the world, </connor>
<connor> you're probably making a lot of money. </connor>
<joey> - I mean. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If someone was bothered to leak it, </joey>
<connor> you have a suspicion </connor>
<connor> that it might be a lot of money (laughs). </connor>
<connor> - And also... </connor>
<connor> - There's no point leaking something </connor>
<joey> with the number one sport is making like 15. </joey>
<connor> - If for this to exist, right. </connor>
<connor> For the system to exist where let's say that creator, </connor>
<connor> you watch who is making 100 viewers. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is all of us at one time. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - We were all at that one channel. </connor>
<connor> I distinctly remember for a year or two, right. </connor>
<joey> I only got like 40 to 100 views on Twitch, </joey>
<joey> which I was very happy with. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Absolutely. </connor>
<connor> - For that person to go, </connor>
<connor> to make income and somewhat support themselves </connor>
<joey> that has to be posted at the top. </joey>
<joey> Who's proportionally making a lot more, </joey>
<joey> depending on the audience size, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Of course. </joey>
<joey> - It's a system that works. </joey>
<joey> Is it, super fair that some people make fucking </joey>
<joey> 100s of millions? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) It's up to you. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, what I will say is that those, </connor>
<joey> from what I saw, </joey>
<connor> there is a lot more money on YouTube </connor>
<connor> as opposed to Twitch what it seems. </connor>
<joey> - So the amount of work you do as well, </joey>
<connor> especially. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean the YouTube, </connor>
<connor> like the top 100 YouTube </connor>
<garnt> as a party making a lot more than </garnt>
<garnt> the top 100 Twitch streamers. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - From what I understand. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How it works. </connor>
<connor> - I think so as well. </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) Mr. Beach, </connor>
<garnt> there's no risk to beast on Twitch </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> and all the ones that are </connor>
<connor> on Twitch that involve money </connor>
<connor> in gambling are extremely sketchy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Very, very sketchy. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely. </joey>
<joey> - And that's a whole nother thing. </joey>
<joey> The whole gambling side of Twitch is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's a (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you should have inherently is a massive platform, </joey>
<joey> much bigger than Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - It is much bigger than Twitch. </joey>
<connor> - Like some of these channels that are uploading, I, </connor>
<connor> God knows how much Dom man's making. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure he makes (indistinct) revenue in one day. </connor>
<garnt> (clears throat) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was from sponsors, right? </connor>
<connor> Like it's totally crazy and we, </connor>
<connor> I am still shocked that people </connor>
<garnt> are like top influencers earn </garnt>
<garnt> how much, when there are some of them </garnt>
<garnt> that are going around in private jets, </garnt>
<garnt> Lamborghinis, all this stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's you know, I wish I was I've wished that was me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd love to buy my whole, all of Wales, </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> the GDP of Wales. </garnt>
<connor> I'd love to reinvigorate the economy. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, </connor>
<garnt> I'll be surprised how much Hollywood movie actors make </garnt>
<connor> or how much, some of the top music artists make? </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then like, and then like, </connor>
<connor> this is like a new entertainment platform. </connor>
<connor> Of course, top creators are going to be making millions. </connor>
<connor> You know, we're not at the billion stage yet </connor>
<connor> because we're not as big </connor>
<connor> as the other end statement industries, </connor>
<connor> but these are what the top creators are making. </connor>
<connor> And that's just, </connor>
<connor> we are just like a baby mode of the entertainment industry, </connor>
<garnt> of like the rest of the end establishing </garnt>
<garnt> the industry (indistinct). </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure when like massive Hollywood actors with posts, </joey>
<joey> starting to make these like massive loads of money </joey>
<connor> and that got found out, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure the general public was like, wait, </connor>
<connor> these actors make how much money. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, maybe. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> I feel the exact same thing. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's such a new thing now. </connor>
<connor> And it's also just so unprecedented </connor>
<connor> because it's so different to anything </connor>
<joey> that you see on like TV or radio or anything like that. </joey>
<connor> - This just three guys trying to justify their income, </connor>
<joey> the conversation. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> The Twitch thing. </connor>
<joey> It's like it's most of it's public anyway. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That, was what it was especially with, </connor>
<connor> which thing is that most content creators, </connor>
<connor> sub account is public and this income </connor>
<connor> was somewhat known or close to now. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You could easily have like kind of guessed </joey>
<connor> you would have been. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<joey> So it's like quite odd. </joey>
<connor> - Why is it a surprise? </connor>
<connor> - I think that people that </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of content creditors </connor>
<connor> were like a couple of people are still surprised about it. </connor>
<connor> I think the people that were surprised </connor>
<connor> about it were people </connor>
<connor> who weren't involved in Twitch </connor>
<connor> or weren't touching it at all. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And so we were being like, </connor>
<connor> I'm going to be a Twitch stream. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Good luck. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> That, is harder than YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Twitch is hard. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's, the search algorithms </connor>
<connor> aren't nearly as optimized </connor>
<connor> as YouTube or TikTok or something. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I mean, it's, it just shows that, </garnt>
<garnt> there is, this is a growing industry right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Like this is, </garnt>
<connor> it's weird seeing how YouTube </connor>
<connor> and Twitch have evolved </connor>
<connor> as time has gone on and seeing it go grow. </connor>
<connor> I think that's where the different lies </connor>
<connor> and where they get their perspective from, </connor>
<connor> which was the difference between say Twitch, </connor>
<connor> streamers and YouTubers versus Hollywood celebrities </connor>
<connor> or big music artists is that, we, </connor>
<connor> a lot of us started off in that exact same position </connor>
<connor> as everyone else, it is an equal playing field. </connor>
<connor> So we don't get, </connor>
<connor> we didn't have to go through these auditions or, </connor>
<joey> go get signed by this massive music label </joey>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> We grew organically buyers by ourselves. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Connor} Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's just the shock that someone </connor>
<garnt> who went through that avenue is able to earn that much. </garnt>
<garnt> - True. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - But it's, also like, </connor>
<connor> I think what a lot of people don't like to give credit </connor>
<connor> to is that a lot of creators </connor>
<connor> who are earning that much now, right. </connor>
<connor> At some point or another, </connor>
<joey> they were where they were working full-time hours </joey>
<joey> on top of whatever else </joey>
<joey> they were doing on something that wasn't paying them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> But that's the things. </connor>
<connor> - For years. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I feel like Twitch stream is again, </connor>
<connor> is like a lot like YouTube as well. </connor>
<connor> Like the biggest difference is that I think a lot of people </connor>
<connor> see them more as like this person </connor>
<connor> that's on the same level </connor>
<connor> where I was like a little more portable. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like the dude across the road type of guy. </connor>
<connor> Whereas like, no one views. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - Bone, a billion dollars, and people would be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh Connor." </joey>
<joey> - That's just Connor being Connor. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - With that, it'd be like, oh my God, </joey>
<connor> it's just different. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Then there's this weird kind of dichotomy </connor>
<connor> of how they expect </connor>
<connor> the standards of traditional celebrities </connor>
<connor> to influences and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I've got, </connor>
<garnt> was going to say it was </garnt>
<garnt> because something else got you put up a second salary. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fucking dumb. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, what? </garnt>
<connor> - I was going to say something after Joey's point. </connor>
<garnt> And I totally forgot it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was Joey's point again. </garnt>
<joey> - My point was that Twitch stream </joey>
<connor> is on YouTube as a scene a lot more as like, </connor>
<connor> just like a friend, like, </connor>
<connor> one more possible, not this person in the clouds, </connor>
<joey> like a little like Hollywood act as though. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you know, </connor>
<connor> when you first start making money on YouTube, it's exciting. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> YouTube is on my car. </connor>
<connor> I 100 bucks. </connor>
<connor> It crazy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's insane. </connor>
<connor> And then you're really proud because you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, </connor>
<connor> I can get paid for doing this thing that I love." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then for the first two years </connor>
<connor> I was making enough </connor>
<connor> to maybe buy myself a movie ticket $10,000 </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> the first year, I think I only made like $500 from it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Second year, probably like $5,000. </joey>
<connor> Still not enough to live off, </connor>
<connor> but I was like, whoa, </connor>
<connor> it looks like exciting. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> And then it goes off and it scales up </connor>
<connor> and that's when I think you start to feel bad </connor>
<garnt> about how much money you're making. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you ever get like imposter syndrome about it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think most YouTubes. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Get imposter syndrome. </garnt>
<garnt> - The reason why a lot of YouTubers don't want to talk about </garnt>
<garnt> that money is because a lot of them feel bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, I don't think they should write. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish we lived in a system </garnt>
<garnt> where no one gave a about money </garnt>
<garnt> and people could just be more honest about it </garnt>
<garnt> and that people could </garnt>
<connor> 'cause then I think that would make us. </connor>
<garnt> - Which thing came out because now. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - People like wearing the earnings with, on their badge. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, 'cause I think that it makes </connor>
<connor> a better atmosphere for everyone </connor>
<connor> to be able to negotiate for better like pay in their job. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, there's like in traditional jobs </connor>
<connor> there's sometimes even </connor>
<connor> though they're not allowed to ask you to do this, </connor>
<connor> that the bosses will be like, </connor>
<connor> don't talk about how much money you're making, </connor>
<connor> but you're allowed to, </connor>
<connor> but people don't </connor>
<connor> because they're scared and they don't want... </connor>
<connor> - They don't wanna be judged. </connor>
<connor> - But if you're doing the exact same thing </connor>
<connor> as your colleague, </connor>
<connor> whether it be on Twitch or on the same job, </connor>
<connor> you should be able to argue </connor>
<connor> that you should be valued the same way they are. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's one of those things where, </connor>
<connor> when I meet other content creators in private, </connor>
<connor> I'll ask them like, </connor>
<connor> how much did you get for the sponsorship deal? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'll be like, what'd you get? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I want to make sure </connor>
<connor> you didn't get over because I know </connor>
<connor> how much it should we get it. </connor>
<garnt> - Because like speaking </garnt>
<garnt> from people in the people in industry, </garnt>
<garnt> nobody teaches each other. </garnt>
<garnt> And one of the stupidest things </garnt>
<garnt> that a lot of content creators, </garnt>
<connor> don't talk to each other about this, </connor>
<connor> even though the more content creators you talk to, </connor>
<connor> the more you realize, oh, </connor>
<connor> a lot of people are getting fucked. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because they've never talked </connor>
<garnt> to any other content creator about this right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Tight taking deals that like, for example, </connor>
<connor> like I took a deal for a sponsor on a video. </connor>
<connor> This is when I was getting around about an average 50,000 </connor>
<connor> to 100,000 views. </connor>
<connor> I took a sponsorship for $100. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - And the video got half a million views. </connor>
<connor> That's not, worth it by the way, something a video. </connor>
<joey> Let's say when you're about, </joey>
<joey> if you have 50,000 to 100,000 average views, </joey>
<joey> you should probably be getting a ball </joey>
<joey> about maybe 2000 to $4,000. </joey>
<joey> - It's 20 to 50 times, 2000 (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Which sounds like a lot. </joey>
<joey> I know that sounds like a lot to a lot of people, </joey>
<joey> but this is advertising space, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is eyeballs that you're getting. </connor>
<connor> So you have to think of it like that. </connor>
<connor> So you can naturally. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess that's where our knowledge comes in (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<connor> - Where it's, not like that's not a set number </connor>
<connor> because it all depends on the client. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It all depends on the product you're promoting. </connor>
<connor> Some clients in certain spaces </connor>
<connor> are willing to sell you like this spot for a higher price. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Some aren't it's. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's really comes down to experience. </connor>
<connor> But if you're a content creator, </connor>
<connor> you should really be talking to other content creators. </connor>
<connor> If you have no idea what to charge a client. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - If you have no idea, </connor>
<connor> then I've I've liked. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause here's the thing I've searched up. </connor>
<connor> I've searched up like before, </connor>
<connor> like YouTube of like </connor>
<connor> how much you should be charging certain clients. </connor>
<connor> And unlike all the YouTubers I've seen, </connor>
<connor> who have said how much you should be charging have got the, </connor>
<connor> I've got the number wrong. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's because a lot of them </connor>
<connor> aren't big creators, you know? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like the numbers, </connor>
<connor> really depend on where you are on YouTube </connor>
<joey> and it really comes down to experience. </joey>
<joey> And what your other, </joey>
<joey> what other people are doing in your fields, </joey>
<joey> which really depends on how much you can charge. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I feel like talking to you guys about it </joey>
<joey> before we are now able to charge more </joey>
<joey> because we realized that we </joey>
<joey> all get charged different prices. </joey>
<garnt> For certain... </garnt>
<joey> - Mean, it's also not just about like </joey>
<joey> the sub count and like view counts, stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> So I feel a lot of it, </connor>
<connor> especially nowadays that like companies are looking for </connor>
<connor> forwards, like branding Powell. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like you could have the two channels </connor>
<connor> could have the exact same number of sobs and views, </connor>
<connor> but one could be a stronger brand </connor>
<connor> and that in and of itself. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it depends on like the audience and the demographics. </connor>
<connor> So there's so many components that go into it. </connor>
<garnt> It's not just like a bare bones. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I get this many views on average, </garnt>
<garnt> therefore I should be getting this amount of money. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Like it's completely case-by-case and lunch. </joey>
<garnt> - Which is like, my general advice to anyone </garnt>
<garnt> who is independent and not even </garnt>
<garnt> a YouTube, but an artist, right. </garnt>
<connor> We've had to learn what our value is. </connor>
<connor> That's the biggest thing. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You have to, like, you have to know what your value is. </connor>
<connor> - Not be ashamed to say it. </connor>
<connor> - And not be ashamed to say it. </connor>
<connor> - Whether they ask how much it costs. </connor>
<connor> (Connor chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - - When it comes to negotiations with a company </connor>
<connor> or with a fellow client, </connor>
<garnt> you can't be ashamed to big up your value </garnt>
<garnt> because you are bringing something for them. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> You are, bringing something to the table </garnt>
<garnt> and you need to articles about it. </garnt>
<joey> - Nothing hurts me more than seeing an artist </joey>
<garnt> on the selling themselves. </garnt>
<garnt> - So much. </garnt>
<garnt> It hurts so much. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I always make sure, like, </garnt>
<joey> if I'm working with an artist, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, you sure you want that? </joey>
<joey> Like, I can give you more. </joey>
<joey> I think you're worth a little bit more than that. </joey>
<garnt> You, gotta have a little bit of confidence in yourself, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can't be scared to like, </garnt>
<connor> obviously you can't like ask for an egregious amount at, </connor>
<connor> at a small price, but you know, </connor>
<connor> there is a limit that you can go. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's okay to step over </connor>
<connor> that limit even slightly just to get your name out there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you really believe in your work, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, just, oh my God, </connor>
<connor> I've seen so many artists just be like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I'll give you like this amount. </connor>
<connor> And it's like a 10th of what I was envisioning is like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if you want to do that (laughs) to like, </garnt>
<joey> be a little more confident in yourself. </joey>
<garnt> You know. </garnt>

<garnt> Now. </garnt>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - I can only get so erect. </connor>
<connor> - Joey. </connor>
<connor> I have a question (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - As you know, </connor>
<garnt> I've been reading recently and I've just saved $20 </garnt>
<garnt> on new kitchen equipment. </garnt>

<connor> So get honey for free@joinedhoney.com slash trash tastes. </connor>
<connor> That's joinhoney.com/trash tastes. </connor>
<joey> - The episode. </joey>
<joey> (clears throat) </joey>
<joey> - And then I think another thing </joey>
<joey> that a lot of people don't talk about </joey>
<connor> when it comes to like the economics of YouTube </connor>
<joey> and like getting, </joey>
<joey> getting paid for this as a job is that is the amount of time </joey>
<joey> a lot of content creators will go </joey>
<joey> before they get big doing work </joey>
<joey> and not getting paid and not doing this for money. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I did YouTube for like seven, </joey>
<joey> eight years before I saw my first paycheck. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> And especially in, especially nowadays, it's a super, </joey>
<joey> super competitive industry in a super, </joey>
<joey> super competitive field. </joey>
<joey> So my like whenever someone comes to me and ask me </joey>
<joey> for advice about how to make YouTube a job, I, </joey>
<joey> the first thing I ask them is, </joey>
<joey> do you have the time to take a year off in your </joey>
<joey> life without getting paid and working at night, </joey>
<joey> like working harder than a nine to five job </joey>
<joey> because that's like, </joey>
<joey> that's the minimum sacrifice </joey>
<joey> you will have to do nowadays too, </joey>
<joey> unless you're like super, super lucky to do YouTube. </joey>
<joey> And even if you do that, </joey>
<joey> you might not even get popular. </joey>
<connor> You might, it might not even come to fruition. </connor>
<connor> So are you willing attempt to make that sacrifice in your </connor>
<connor> life for a chance to have this as a job, </connor>
<connor> which is why, like, </connor>
<connor> I feel very lucky to have this position. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Likewise. </connor>
<connor> - But you know, I did. </connor>
<connor> I do, you know, I do know that I, </connor>
<connor> there was some portion of luck within my career path, </connor>
<connor> but also everyone I've met, </connor>
<connor> including all three of us worked super hard as well. </connor>
<connor> We went through a point where we were working harder </connor>
<connor> than the nine to five job </connor>
<connor> without getting paid or being paid like </connor>
<connor> less than minimum wage to get where we are. </connor>
<connor> And we did that for about a year. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like a lot of people who are maybe older </garnt>
<garnt> who are more established to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I got a nine to five job. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't really take a year out in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why a lot of YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> you see a start off in like college or in high school </garnt>
<garnt> when you do have that time. </garnt>
<garnt> And all I can say to that is I'm, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I'm sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just the way it works. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not a company, YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> Isn't like YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> You're not a paid salary, man. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<joey> It's. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, like, as an example, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, you know, like Mr. Bass, </garnt>
<connor> like Jimmy was barely got any views for like the first, </connor>
<connor> like six, seven years of his career. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then all of a sudden he's he's at where he's at now. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> But like, </connor>
<connor> I think what a lot of people forget </connor>
<connor> is that he didn't just come out of nowhere. </connor>
<connor> He didn't just make a video and it immediately, </connor>
<joey> get them 50 million solves. </joey>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<joey> It's like he worked for that shit. </joey>
<joey> - It takes a very long time. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that's the thing that everyone wants to gloss over. </connor>
<connor> And that's not me just trying to justify why people should </connor>
<connor> make 50 million dollars a year, </connor>
<connor> but it's just, you should, </connor>
<connor> you can't criticize it without first understanding that </connor>
<connor> and appreciating that it does sometimes take a ton of work. </connor>
<connor> And the one thing that people love </connor>
<connor> to forget is that life is not fair. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Could, you could put just as many hours, </garnt>
<connor> if not more hours into playing guitar or something </connor>
<connor> and nothing could come of it. </connor>
<joey> I always. </joey>
<joey> - Think of the 100s and 1000s </joey>
<joey> of guitars (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you also have to, like, </connor>
<connor> I think one thing that is kind of oversold in life is that </connor>
<connor> if you put X of hours into something, </connor>
<garnt> it'll just work out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's not always that simple. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's not always that simple. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know if you're getting into something </garnt>
<garnt> that is extremely popular worldwide. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's going to be way harder than if you're, </connor>
<connor> for example, making anime videos </connor>
<connor> on a website called YouTube in 2015. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (Connor chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] I mean... </connor>
<connor> - I it's differences in scale </connor>
<connor> of what you're trying to compete. </connor>
<connor> You know, I'm sure everyone </connor>
<connor> on will everyone in the world started </connor>
<connor> doing the type of content that we were doing. </connor>
<connor> I think we'd be out of a job pretty soon. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause no doubt. </joey>
<joey> There'll be other people </joey>
<joey> who are better than us that would </joey>
<connor> happen, but that's not, </connor>
<joey> but not everybody's doing it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I feel that's why it's called a dream job for or a reason. </joey>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean like I did take a massive risk </garnt>
<garnt> with my career choices, </garnt>
<joey> because back then when I had a steady paid job, </joey>
<joey> I had a career path I could pursue and I liked. </joey>
<joey> - Where did you work a gain. </joey>
<connor> - I worked at the BBC. </connor>
<connor> Did she know that? </connor>
<garnt> - She. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - And to bring it back. </joey>
<connor> - And the timestamps it'd be like justifying </connor>
<garnt> or privileges (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> this a section of the. </connor>
<garnt> - No, because yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> I did sacrifice that a proven career path </garnt>
<garnt> for an industry </garnt>
<garnt> that was not proven that an industry </garnt>
<garnt> that didn't exist back then, that I, </garnt>
<garnt> that wasn't proven where I could do this </garnt>
<garnt> more than a year or two. </garnt>
<garnt> And I took a risk that it was going </garnt>
<garnt> to turn out to something. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was lucky enough that it did turn out. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, nowadays it's a different ball game. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I took that risk with my career path. </garnt>
<garnt> If you want to be a YouTube or Twitch streamer, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to take a different risk. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a different risk, </garnt>
<garnt> but the risk to reward is like </garnt>
<garnt> the rewards are there to be seen. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why people will take risks to get that reward. </garnt>
<connor> - The one lucky thing about YouTube and twitches </connor>
<connor> that you can do in your downtime, </connor>
<connor> you can put a little bit of effort here and there, </connor>
<connor> see some results, </connor>
<connor> see that there's a demand for it </connor>
<connor> and then dedicate more time to it. </connor>
<connor> That is one good thing about it. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, yes, </connor>
<connor> you're going to be at a disadvantage. </connor>
<connor> If you are working like God said, and you are 30 plus, </connor>
<connor> and you've got a life that you need to maintain. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's not impossible. </connor>
<connor> Like there is, </connor>
<connor> there are some ways there are cases </connor>
<connor> where it has worked out again. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just harder and the playing field isn't level, </connor>
<connor> but it never is. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You know, I'm sure that </joey>
<joey> if you let's say you just had a friend </joey>
<joey> who was a big YouTube, </joey>
<joey> you're already at a massive advantage </joey>
<joey> because they can help you out. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or you have a family history </joey>
<joey> of using cameras or editing, </joey>
<joey> like there's all kinds of variations of advantages, </joey>
<joey> but that's life. </joey>
<joey> I feel that can apply with any job, </joey>
<joey> anything in life (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think I can play with any job right? </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct), but I guess </joey>
<connor> because we're somewhat public figures, </connor>
<connor> so it's a lot more. </connor>
<garnt> - I would say every career path has their own obstacles. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Especially like, for example, </connor>
<connor> if I will take engineering, for example, </connor>
<connor> it's actually not advantageous to you to do like, </connor>
<connor> to do a good job in your company </connor>
<connor> and stay in that company. </connor>
<connor> Because like the raises you get are better. </connor>
<connor> If you move companies </connor>
<connor> and you're constantly moving companies. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> And that, I don't think that should be right, </connor>
<connor> because I think you should be. </connor>
<connor> I think every employee should be rewarded </connor>
<joey> for doing a good job at that company. </joey>
<joey> But the sad reality of it is, </joey>
<garnt> is that a lot of the times in a lot of career paths, </garnt>
<joey> you can get a much better raised by changing companies. </joey>
<joey> And then moving back to the original company. </joey>
<joey> And you're thinking like, why can't I just, </joey>
<joey> why can't the original company just see me </joey>
<joey> for my worth to begin with? </joey>
<joey> It's like Twitch stream is moving to YouTube. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> It's free privileged individuals, </connor>
<connor> the fiber, you know what? </connor>
<connor> The one thing, the one comment that I actually, </connor>
<joey> I know I'm just, </joey>
<connor> I'm inviting this comment now you've changed. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I like the old blank better. </joey>
<connor> - And it's like, are you saying that I should, </connor>
<connor> I would be the same person I am at 20 years old </connor>
<connor> that I am now because you're insane. </connor>
<connor> How about if you think that I should be the same post </connor>
<connor> I post, I'm gonna change. </connor>
<connor> If I didn't do YouTube, </connor>
<connor> I would still change. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> It would change regardless. </connor>
<connor> I'm becoming more miserable. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct), you change. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And when people comment saying like, </connor>
<connor> oh, they've changed. </connor>
<connor> You know, they're different from them. </connor>
<connor> Like, yes, of course, as you should, </connor>
<connor> you should become more confident as you get older. </connor>
<joey> - I wouldn't be worried. </joey>
<connor> I wouldn't be worried if you didn't change. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> You should mature. </connor>
<connor> You should change your opinion. </connor>
<connor> You should act differently. </connor>
<connor> That's called life. </connor>
<connor> If you're not doing that, </connor>
<connor> what are you doing? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What are you, why aren't you changing? </joey>
<joey> Why aren't you improving yourself? </joey>
<joey> And... </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I, but then I guess that's. </joey>
<joey> - That's the thing. </joey>
<joey> - It's proving. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> Becoming more gluttonous, more wealthy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - He's changed since he got his Audi Ben he's got. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Spending money on drip now instead of going to primer, </joey>
<garnt> how dare he. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It all changed when Connor got this pumpkin spice latte, </connor>
<joey> Starbucks for the first time. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> you have change. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That one trip to Los Angeles changed everything. </joey>
<connor> - I changed my mind. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I'm not going to be broke anymore. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughinga) </connor>
<connor> - No, but I mean, I agree you should, </connor>
<connor> or you should always be changing. </connor>
<connor> You know, I think there is a difference </connor>
<connor> between changing and, </connor>
<connor> becoming a bit snobby a bit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because you know, like I still can't stand. </connor>
<garnt> What can I say? </garnt>
<garnt> I still can't stand flex culture. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Well, it's weird, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> Because you want to be able to celebrate </connor>
<connor> and support the people who have really worked hard </connor>
<connor> and have done great stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I've made some good content and, and you know, I, </connor>
<connor> I want to see them do well, </connor>
<connor> but then I guess there's a very fine line, </connor>
<connor> especially for audiences. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What is considered flexing and then what is, </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to go around and be like, oh, </connor>
<connor> this is what I bought and I'm killing it. </connor>
<connor> You know, all my investments are doing well. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Well, he's just like full on a video being like, </joey>
<garnt> so here's how my stocks doing this month. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's a doge coin. </joey>
<joey> As you can see. </joey>
<connor> - I got into stocks when everyone got into stocks </connor>
<garnt> in the red for a very long time. </garnt>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> So there's no flexing for me. </joey>
<joey> And. </joey>
<connor> - But it is a fine line between like, </connor>
<connor> what is flexing </connor>
<connor> and what is just being proud of your accomplishments. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, what is the, how, when does it change. </joey>
<connor> - Ah, it's hard, isn't it? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because you don't want to be like, yeah, I'm doing well. </joey>
<joey> But you also, </joey>
<joey> 'cause some people perceive that as you've changed. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> So it's like, </joey>
<joey> what do you do not want me to like </joey>
<joey> show you my achievements or. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> So people will, </connor>
<connor> people support small craters </connor>
<connor> and then they also turn on them </connor>
<connor> when they're, </connor>
<connor> when they find out they're doing well sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's the underground band going three years. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just in a different field, </connor>
<connor> they've changed everything </connor>
<connor> ever since they were successfully </connor>
<connor> signed by the music label, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> don't like their music anymore </connor>
<connor> talking about different things. </connor>
<joey> I liked them before they became an animator of mini. </joey>
<joey> - And I don't get annoyed </joey>
<joey> if someone prefers all the content </joey>
<joey> of mine or they prefer because the style has changed. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> And I understand that when you change your style, </connor>
<connor> not every style is for everyone. </connor>
<connor> And I don't get annoyed and people are like, </connor>
<connor> I prefer the old videos. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, all right, </connor>
<connor> that's fair enough. </connor>
<connor> I get it. </connor>
<connor> - Like, it's your taste. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - But I'm not going to change it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that's not what I want to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, I still get comments that are still like, </connor>
<connor> I miss the anime zone. </connor>
<connor> Well, when are you going to bring back </connor>
<connor> the anime zone reviews? </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, dude, </connor>
<joey> I killed off reviews for like a reason. </joey>
<joey> Okay. </joey>
<joey> Yes. </joey>
<joey> I have changed in that sense. </joey>
<joey> I'm not doing enemies. </joey>
<joey> I'm not doing enemies zone reviews anymore. </joey>
<joey> - And people still ask me for my let's play. </joey>
<connor> I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - But then I also get annoyed at content creators </connor>
<connor> that like wine at that audience, </connor>
<connor> all the time, they're like, oh, </connor>
<connor> why are you complaining? </connor>
<connor> You don't let the new videos. </connor>
<connor> It's like, well, </connor>
<connor> you need to go out your way </connor>
<connor> and make something it's different. </connor>
<connor> You can't expect your audience to just follow suit. </connor>
<connor> And like, it's up to you. </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes you just have to be like, </joey>
<connor> just screw up the audience things. </connor>
<connor> If this is what makes you happy. </connor>
<connor> You do that content? </connor>
<connor> - I hate YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Is that sit there and make videos, </connor>
<connor> whining that they're not doing well. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, go over it. </connor>
<connor> It's you, if you change something or you're doing, </connor>
<connor> you're not making like stuff that is keeping up </connor>
<connor> with the times that's on you. </connor>
<connor> I believe. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That, is part of the job that you signed up for. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - You should know this, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - And if you're a doctor, </garnt>
<connor> you have to keep learning the new medical practices. </connor>
<connor> You can't, go doing shit (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> like the 1960s. </connor>
<connor> - Oh you a COVID here's some leeches. </connor>
<connor> - You can't do that. </connor>
<connor> There's differences. </connor>
<connor> There's regulations and you're forced to do it, but God. </connor>
<connor> Imagine if there wasn't </connor>
<connor> people would never update their thing. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then a reason why they do it </connor>
<connor> is because it's to the detriment of anyone else around us. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The problem is with YouTube, </connor>
<connor> it's not to the detriment of anyone else. </connor>
<connor> If a content creator falls off, </connor>
<connor> there are tons more, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I know. </connor>
<connor> - It is up to you to make sure that you are making stuff. </connor>
<connor> - You are up to date. </connor>
<connor> - When my channel falls off, </connor>
<connor> there can be plenty of curb, </connor>
<connor> your enthusiasm memes </connor>
<connor> of this section of the podcast, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'll, you know, it's, </connor>
<joey> if I stop trying to change, that's on me. </joey>
<joey> If I don't want to do that anymore. </joey>
<connor> I understand that. </connor>
<connor> - Favorite comments I get though, is like, </connor>
<connor> it's not even the you've changed all the, </connor>
<connor> I liked the old content better. </connor>
<connor> It's the youthful and off. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're irrelevant </connor>
<connor> - You're irrelevant now. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> Because you Postly, </connor>
<connor> don't like myself now I'm suddenly irrelevant </connor>
<joey> in the grand scheme of things. </joey>
<joey> It's like. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> There's people who are not going to like what (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - And that's fine. </joey>
<connor> I'm going to try to appeal to everybody. </connor>
<joey> Like if you don't like it, that's cool, dude. </joey>
<joey> There are literally thousands of content crazy. </joey>
<joey> You could go and watch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's not strange. </joey>
<joey> It's strange. </joey>
<joey> I don't really know. </joey>
<joey> What's your opinion gone. </joey>
<connor> Tell me your opinion. </connor>
<garnt> - My opinion on changing. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - The. </garnt>
<garnt> You want to opinion on trash tastes. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> I mean like for me, like changing </garnt>
<garnt> is part of our job. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And life, I think you should change as a push it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I go back and see my friends from school, </garnt>
<garnt> if they're exactly the same as they were in school, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like... </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a red flag. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But some people don't change. </connor>
<connor> Did you notice that? </connor>
<garnt> - I did. </garnt>
<connor> And I don't give a if they haven't that's on them. </connor>
<connor> It's I think it's like, oh, that's odd. </connor>
<connor> Like nothing has changed your point of view </connor>
<connor> in life in five years. </connor>
<connor> Like nothing has made you think different. </connor>
<connor> Not none of your experiences have changed who you are. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> Fair enough. </connor>
<connor> But then I don't want them to be like, oh, </connor>
<connor> you've changed. </connor>
<connor> It's like. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, I have. </joey>
<connor> - Get over it (chuckles). </connor>
<connor> - Well, you, of course I've changed. </connor>
<joey> I moved to a foreign country </joey>
<garnt> and I have no idea what's going on off the time. </garnt>
<garnt> And I barely know how to communicate with my taxi driver. </garnt>
<garnt> I've changed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm fighting for my life, man (laughs). </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - No, because I feel like </connor>
<connor> that just says a lot of us about us as people, </connor>
<connor> because I'm constantly looking for change. </connor>
<connor> I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - Same. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like uncomfortable </connor>
<joey> when things stay the same for too long. </joey>
<joey> And I think that's why I. </joey>
<joey> - Get scared when start to get not right. </joey>
<garnt> - Which is kind of makes YouTube my perfect job, </garnt>
<connor> because I never want to stay still. </connor>
<connor> I'm constantly wanting to change. </connor>
<connor> - I like my boss. </connor>
<connor> - Not just like being in Korea, </connor>
<connor> but in like my own life. </connor>
<connor> Like I, that's why I've moved countries so many times. </connor>
<connor> I still don't know why I want to settle down yet </connor>
<connor> because I'm like scared </connor>
<connor> to like stay in one place for too long. </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<connor> I just like, do you know, </connor>
<connor> that's just me as a person. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I constantly like changing my life. </connor>
<connor> And I'm not saying </connor>
<connor> if you are the type of person </connor>
<connor> who doesn't change and stays comfortable in one place, </connor>
<joey> there's nothing inherently wrong with them. </joey>
<joey> But all I ask is you don't judge us for changing. </joey>
<joey> - For changing (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - Changing as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, </joey>
<joey> there are some people in some people </joey>
<joey> who I was mates with back in the day </joey>
<joey> that I have less than common with now. </joey>
<joey> And that's just part of me having to accept </joey>
<joey> that I have changed and we have less in common with. </joey>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - We're going to push our values on you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> So, you know, just don't (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Sure. </connor>
<connor> - Except for drip by drip. </connor>
<connor> You should buy drip. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But I'll give my opinion. </connor>
<joey> You don't have to take it. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - I'm on very Brashard lipid. </joey>
<joey> And I know that, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not going to cry over you. </connor>
<connor> Not agreeing with me. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I could get annoyed at people. </connor>
<connor> Completely misinterpret what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> That doesn't sound like, </connor>
<joey> how did the did you get that? </joey>
<joey> Like. </joey>
<garnt> - You're standing in a completely different argument that. </garnt>
<connor> - I need a toilet quickly go pitch yourself. </connor>
<garnt> - Speaking of going to your hometown </garnt>
<garnt> and see if people have changed. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> I do have a funny story about someone </garnt>
<connor> who I met in my university town </connor>
<connor> that has definitely changed in a way </connor>
<connor> that I didn't imagine. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> So what happened is I went to see someone mates </connor>
<connor> who are living in Bristol right now, </connor>
<connor> which was by my city where I went to university. </connor>
<connor> I went to university of Bristol. </connor>
<connor> And so we were at this club, right? </connor>
<connor> And we meet, a guy there and this guy who </connor>
<connor> I wasn't very close to him in university, </connor>
<connor> but a word on the street was he was the type of guy who, </connor>
<connor> if you needed certain substances, </connor>
<connor> that was the guy to call. </connor>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, I'm just having a casual chat </garnt>
<garnt> and he asked me what I'm doing. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, oh, I start talking about Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I saw it, start talking about being a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> living in Japan and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And he goes, "Oh, I do something about Japan now." </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like, what the do you do now? </joey>
<joey> What, is this person? </joey>
<joey> So like to, to preface, </joey>
<joey> this is a guy who applied to love islands once. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> He's not the kind of guy </joey>
<joey> who I would expect has any interest </joey>
<joey> in a male in Japan at all. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And he goes, oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like, I deal in ideal Pokemon cards. </joey>
<joey> Now. </joey>
<joey> I was like, off. </joey>
<joey> What, is this? </joey>
<joey> And he's like, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how are you getting Pokemon cards? </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh, I love Pokemon. </joey>
<joey> I've always loved it. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> how are we getting Pokemon cards? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, God, </connor>
<connor> I've got contacts. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> why did you have to make it sound like that? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> So, and so he takes me, </connor>
<connor> he takes me over to one side. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<garnt> He's just like, "Yo, gone, gone, come here, come here. </garnt>
<connor> Look, I've got a good deal. </connor>
<connor> If you're interested in Pokemon go." </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I was just like, whoa. </connor>
<connor> I was like, you're taking the (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> You're taking the. </connor>
<connor> I was like me. </connor>
<connor> I just sent off. </connor>
<connor> I just sent off a shiny MuTu. </connor>
<connor> He got graded nine grade nine, </connor>
<connor> shiny new to make first edition. </connor>
<garnt> You can be yours. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sending it, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'll give you a good deal. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll give you a good deal. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is the weirdest offshoot </garnt>
<garnt> of breaking bad I've ever seen. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've got great. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - And so, yeah, like, </connor>
<connor> so this guy went through </connor>
<connor> a complete career change apparently. </connor>
<joey> And is now as in, is now dealing poker one. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Got contacts and came free </garnt>
<joey> to pause out a bunch of businesses. </joey>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the whole weirdest aspect </garnt>
<connor> of this whole Pokemon card </connor>
<connor> was it was that people were sending cards, </connor>
<connor> they're cards for Logan Paul to open. </connor>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - So that they could be in the video. </connor>
<connor> - Some kind of like modern cooking that I'm not aware of, </connor>
<connor> where like you don't get in trouble </connor>
<joey> without opening your own things now. </joey>
<joey> Or you have to send them to someone </joey>
<joey> else who can open them, </joey>
<joey> but better. </joey>
<joey> (Connor chuckles) </joey>
<joey> It's like a politician. </joey>
<joey> It's like a full of, </joey>
<joey> oh, he's opening that Pokemon cup. </joey>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> like, what is this? </connor>
<connor> We can walk we're gear. </connor>
<connor> Are we in where we don't get enjoyment? </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's like, well, </connor>
<connor> I've gone buy a bunch of Gacha </connor>
<connor> and I make Joey login my account and do it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause he does it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean that also is a thing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Garnt always pulls for me and I kinda get it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Modern. </garnt>
<connor> Cocking is this like, this is, what is this one? </connor>
<connor> When did this begin? </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<connor> There's like a bunch of like ginching YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who gave they get like take like poles for other players. </connor>
<joey> It's like. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like it's just like living vicariously. </garnt>
<garnt> So then just one person. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<joey> Because- </joey>
<connor> - I guess. </connor>
<garnt> - With Pokemon cards, </garnt>
<garnt> it feels like a weird extra step </garnt>
<connor> where you would send these like extremely valuable cards </connor>
<connor> to be open to that. </connor>
<garnt> Do they ever come back to the post? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> They come back to the person. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's, I think I kind of get it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's kinda like sharing your, like, like, </garnt>
<garnt> like this it's all about the experience, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you're, sharing the experience </garnt>
<connor> with say your favorite content creator </connor>
<connor> because you know, there's a difference, </connor>
<connor> you know, there is a difference doing it yourself. </connor>
<connor> Unlike having to freak out by yourself </connor>
<connor> and like doing it as like a group. </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Kind of makes sense. </garnt>
<joey> I guess it just feels like this weird kind of year. </joey>
<connor> Are we in a bit of an extra, </connor>
<connor> some people just don't want to open up their own </connor>
<connor> things anymore. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to invite gone over </connor>
<connor> to open up my Dyson vacuum </connor>
<joey> just so I can get the true experience </joey>
<joey> of how a dog should take off appeals. </joey>
<connor> A Dyson should be on box. </connor>
<connor> God will do it better than me. </connor>
<connor> Isn't it weird? </connor>
<connor> Like, okay. </connor>
<connor> I understand. </connor>
<connor> There's a shared experience, but it's weird. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's strange. </connor>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's strange. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a bit strange. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think it's strange. </connor>
<connor> I would you. </connor>
<connor> - Do it? </connor>
<connor> - Would you send off your cards for someone else? </connor>
<connor> - No, but I would, if I'm like, </connor>
<connor> say opening, like a rare pack, </connor>
<garnt> I'd want my boys in there. I'd be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't want to do it by myself. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I want to like share the experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - Boys. </garnt>
<connor> 5:00 PM. </connor>
<joey> I'm opening up. </joey>
<joey> - The fresh pack right here. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Non crinkled cards. </connor>
<connor> - Look it's, </connor>
<connor> it's just like part of the fun </connor>
<garnt> is the shared experience of </garnt>
<garnt> just doing this exciting thing, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - But when does it not become your thing? </connor>
<connor> It's not your thing anymore. </connor>
<connor> It's someone else's. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What'd you mean. </connor>
<connor> - If you send your cards off to load </connor>
<connor> and Paul to open up. </connor>
<garnt> - Do they, does he send them back? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<joey> But it was a massive difference. </joey>
<connor> - It's like you being cut out, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> There's a massive difference </connor>
<joey> between like you gathering your friends to do </joey>
<joey> it in front of your friends </joey>
<joey> and then sending your cards to </joey>
<joey> someone that you don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Who maybe (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - And they don't know you. </joey>
<garnt> - Thanks (indistinct), thanks for giving me the call. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's it. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's that with extra steps, </connor>
<connor> but like you're sharing </connor>
<connor> that with like say one of the biggest content </connor>
<joey> creators on the platform. </joey>
<joey> So it's like, Joey chose to do this role for me, </joey>
<garnt> Joey is that like. </garnt>
<garnt> - The problem is like majority of like, </garnt>
<garnt> if they're like streaming on Twitch, </garnt>
<joey> the majority of the chat isn't going to be like, oh, </joey>
<joey> this is the card that was sent by this person. </joey>
<joey> Holy. </joey>
<connor> - I guess I kind of get it now that you say it like that. </connor>
<connor> I do kind of understand that you could get more enjoyment. </connor>
<connor> I've seen other people react to your thing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it is your strange, </joey>
<connor> what level of consumerism are we on right now? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> We buy things for ourselves, </connor>
<joey> for someone else to open. </joey>
<joey> For what level is this of Capitalism? </joey>
<joey> Is this is what they're going to use. </joey>
<joey> Unlike other communist, look at it. </joey>
<connor> They don't even buy their own stuff anymore. </connor>
<connor> They buy it for someone else to open it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like, okay, I kind of get it now, </connor>
<connor> but it is strange. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's a bit weird. </connor>
<connor> - You have to admit objectively. </connor>
<connor> It sounds bizarre. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you can make anything sound weird </garnt>
<garnt> if you like put it in the- </garnt>
<garnt> - Try it, try it, do it. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> I'll give you an example. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, I mean like that's kinda like </garnt>
<joey> the same kind of argument when let's play </joey>
<joey> as thoughts to be, get popular, right? </joey>
<joey> Like it's a bit weird, you know? </joey>
<joey> I mean, you kind of just watching someone play </joey>
<garnt> a video game and not even good at the video. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, okay. </connor>
<connor> I would argue with that one though. </connor>
<connor> It's not like I'm buying a physical copy of the game. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah is sending it to (indistinct) plan. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not, I don't have a copy anymore. </joey>
<joey> And then I'll watch you play it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sending it again to the left lane. </joey>
<joey> And then they're like, just after you finish it, </joey>
<joey> just give me back the game. </joey>
<connor> - Again, people do buy games, streamers, </connor>
<connor> but then they normally do that because they want to get, </connor>
<connor> they want to see them have the experience that they had. </connor>
<connor> So. </connor>
<garnt> - It's, all about the shared experience. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - I guess I do understand the feeling. </connor>
<garnt> It's just, </garnt>
<joey> it does seem strange to me </joey>
<joey> that this even was a thought </joey>
<joey> that someone was like, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to send my cards to Logan Paul. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's like, is the way you've seen the sentence. </joey>
<connor> - It's a kin to like being cocked in my mind. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's like I say, my girlfriend </connor>
<joey> - I won't get as much satisfaction out of doing this. </joey>
<joey> I would watching someone else do this. </joey>
<joey> - It is kind of more satisfied. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<connor> I mean, I take </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - (indistinct) That's cool, dude. </joey>
<joey> - No, I mean, like for example, </joey>
<connor> with Gacha it is like a lot more fun to pull on street. </connor>
<connor> - Comes back to Gacha. </connor>
<garnt> - It does always come back to catch a ride, </garnt>
<garnt> but I mean. </garnt>
<joey> - That's kind of peak entertainment, 2021. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, that's what Pokemon cards are, right. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's. </joey>
<connor> - Just physical. </connor>
<garnt> Gacha right. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> So it's a lot funner to do with your mates. </garnt>
<garnt> Like every time I remember </garnt>
<garnt> when we were like addicted to art legs, every time, </garnt>
<garnt> every time Joey was in the office, he was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to do a pool. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're like, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> let's see what he gets. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a lot more fun to do with mates </garnt>
<garnt> because if you don't get it, </garnt>
<garnt> then your mates will be like, ha you're a idiot. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's like your buying packs for Joey to Paul because. </garnt>
<garnt> - He got the cards back. </garnt>
<garnt> So. </garnt>
<connor> - Let's say, yeah, yeah, I guess you do. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But I guess like the equivalent of that is like, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna give you 100 bucks to pull on dark nights. </joey>
<joey> But once you finished the polls, </joey>
<joey> I need you to send me the 100 bucks back. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> I like, that's a little weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it's more like </garnt>
<garnt> you're just giving the phone to another person, </garnt>
<garnt> Joey, you do the pool for me trust (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Giving your significant others </garnt>
<garnt> or someone else for one evening. </garnt>
<joey> Magical love, nature that you can view. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - While you sit back and enjoy the show. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not crazy right. </connor>
<joey> With this comparison I. </joey>
<connor> - Get where you're coming from. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But it's just, now that I think about it, </connor>
<connor> it is not as weird (laughs) as I initially thought. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - That's weird. </connor>
<connor> Is that weird that we don't find that weird? </connor>
<connor> - Let me, you let me sell you another idea. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> So, like you watch movies </connor>
<connor> and enemies and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> So, that. </connor>
<connor> Like imagine instead of watching a two hour movie, </connor>
<connor> you could watch three blokes sitting on a set, </connor>
<garnt> arguing about chicken breasts and chicken thighs. </garnt>
<garnt> How's that sound? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like quality context. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I have one question. </connor>
<joey> Why subscribe? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I sign up. </joey>
<joey> - I suppose. </joey>
<joey> What would you categorize? </joey>
<joey> Why'd you think? </joey>
<connor> Why do you think trash taste is successful? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) is a sucking our own Dick. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct). </garnt>
<connor> - So good. </connor>
<joey> Can you explain? </joey>
<connor> - Why do you think, what is, </connor>
<connor> why would someone go and watch us </connor>
<connor> instead of watching a movie, </connor>
<connor> which objectively better entertainment. </connor>
<garnt> - I could give, </garnt>
<garnt> like a really deep answer now that is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like... </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm ready for the truth bond. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like we've, </garnt>
<garnt> the whole shared experience thing we've talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of people would now crave kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> that feeling of like a relationship </garnt>
<garnt> or like a closeness of someone and people. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of people can feel that parasocial eat by, </garnt>
<garnt> for example, sending their, </garnt>
<garnt> their cards to their favorite streamers </garnt>
<garnt> or sending some money </garnt>
<garnt> for their favorite Gacha streamers to pool, </garnt>
<garnt> or just watching three blokes, </garnt>
<connor> three friends talk for two hours. </connor>
<connor> You know, you get that feeling </connor>
<connor> that you're connected with someone, </connor>
<connor> you, they, you have that feeling of connection, </connor>
<connor> even though that connection isn't technically real. </connor>
<connor> You know, and I feel like a lot of content nowadays, </connor>
<connor> especially with the younger generation </connor>
<connor> is gut like a lot of the most, </connor>
<connor> successful streamers and a lot of the most </connor>
<connor> successful content creators are people </connor>
<connor> who can accurately represent </connor>
<connor> that feeling of a close connection, </connor>
<connor> a parasocial relationship I'd say, see it. </connor>
<connor> That was, my deep answer. </connor>
<joey> - I'm 14. </joey>
<joey> And this is deep, bro. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - My, meme answer is just, </connor>
<connor> it's just three blocks shine ship. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I guess. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we died, </connor>
<connor> we didn't strive to have that. </connor>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> We just make, we just talk, </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> but it's always much deeper. </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) self satisfaction. </joey>
<joey> - We just wanted to make it show we just chat shakes. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, we didn't try for that. </joey>
<connor> It just happened by (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - Complete luck. </connor>
<connor> So like, I guess the whole, </connor>
<connor> I watched a video by what's his name? </connor>
<connor> Glinka is it whose name did it be about only fans </connor>
<connor> and the more, not the sexual side, </connor>
<connor> but more so the power of social side </connor>
<connor> where a lot of guys are on there </connor>
<connor> because they that's like the closest they feel </connor>
<connor> that they can get to your girlfriend. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that was really sad watching that video </connor>
<connor> because you had interviews with people </connor>
<connor> who are only fans subscribers know, </connor>
<connor> and as much as we meme on only fans. </connor>
<connor> And then to know that, </connor>
<garnt> that whole thing about, </garnt>
<garnt> earlier we mentioned the whole density, </garnt>
<joey> we're going to take jokes. </joey>
<connor> I do feel very sorry for these guys. </connor>
<connor> Like a lot of them that feel </connor>
<connor> that they have no other choice </connor>
<connor> or there is no other choice for them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just life circumstances or maybe what I was going on now, </connor>
<connor> that's, you're busy, it's, and it is, </connor>
<connor> it isn't just the sheriff </connor>
<connor> or guys you think here at doing </connor>
<connor> stuff like that, who consume that? </connor>
<connor> You know, sometimes it's people just have no time. </connor>
<connor> They're very successful and they have too much money. </connor>
<connor> But the one thing that you don't have is time, which is, </connor>
<connor> and the ability to go and make friends. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Especially if it's. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it is hard. </connor>
<connor> Like a lot of people are lonely it's, </connor>
<connor> especially during the times of the pandemic as well. </connor>
<connor> That's like only kind of just extrapolate extrapolated. </connor>
<connor> That's only kind of exaggerated. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Exacerbates. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel sorry for a lot of guys, </connor>
<connor> obviously as a male myself, </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of those things </garnt>
<garnt> where you can't really openly talk </garnt>
<garnt> about being lonely. </garnt>
<garnt> It's quite difficult to do it, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> And it's often hard to just reach out to friends </garnt>
<joey> and be like, Hey man, </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<joey> I'm just lonely, man. </joey>
<joey> You want to hang out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, it's really hard to do that. </connor>
<joey> And that whole stigma of like macho insecurity, </joey>
<connor> - I always want to try and dispel that and be honest and try </connor>
<connor> and be open with my are my emotions and what I'm feeling, </connor>
<connor> just so that hopefully other people </connor>
<connor> can be more open with it as well. </connor>
<connor> Like I feel like when you're a public figure, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of your responsibility to try and improve the </connor>
<connor> understanding of topics like that I think. </connor>
<joey> - Generally. </joey>
<connor> You're allowed to feel emotions. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, bro. </joey>
<joey> I know. </joey>
<connor> So, 'cause you know, more often than not, </connor>
<connor> there is a lot of toxic masculinity </connor>
<connor> and pride that men have </connor>
<connor> and especially to be successful and provide </connor>
<connor> and you know, basically not be a up. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But this pressure pressures a difficult man. </connor>
<connor> I feel like a lot of guys end up pushing up, </connor>
<connor> pushing a lot of friends away. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they're so focused on trying to not be a failure. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like, especially with guys, </garnt>
<connor> it's hard to talk about. </connor>
<garnt> It's hard to talk about something negative. </garnt>
<connor> Like I remember. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I remember like I remember when we went back </garnt>
<garnt> to see all our mates and we had that Airbnb </garnt>
<connor> where we all caught up. </connor>
<connor> I remember like going into like a conversation, </connor>
<connor> like a deep conversation that </connor>
<connor> some of our guy mates were having at the time, </connor>
<connor> I remember sitting down on the table and like one </connor>
<connor> of our mates was talking about, </connor>
<connor> going through therapy for </connor>
<connor> one of the things that they went through. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> And you know, more, </connor>
<connor> more and more people started sitting like sitting in </connor>
<connor> and then started sharing their stories </connor>
<connor> about how they also were going through something rough, </connor>
<connor> especially during COVID. </connor>
<connor> And they had to like seek therapy about it. </connor>
<connor> And then eventually we just had these CR this whole table, </connor>
<garnt> this group of guys, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just like, wait a minute. </garnt>
<garnt> Has anyone here not been to therapy? </garnt>
<garnt> We look around and nobody puts their hands up. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, so wait. </garnt>
<garnt> So everyone here has been to therapy. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> how have we never talked about this before </garnt>
<garnt> for like four years? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a shame thing, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, people got a lot of guys feel shame admitting </garnt>
<connor> that they have any of those problems. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Exactly. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> if something should be normalized and not being ashamed </garnt>
<garnt> of frowned upon, it's just, it's this, </garnt>
<garnt> it's admitting that you have a problem </garnt>
<garnt> and you're seeking help for it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, I feel like, especially, </garnt>
<garnt> especially in England and especially in Asian culture, </garnt>
<garnt> it is very much frowned upon to like say, Hey, </garnt>
<garnt> I went to therapy or I talked to someone </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just like, 'cause like the mentality </garnt>
<garnt> is that if you go to therapy, </garnt>
<garnt> then you're inherently trying </garnt>
<garnt> to fix something about yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> You're in here. </garnt>
<garnt> There's something inherently wrong about yourself. </garnt>
<connor> - But I think people don't want to admit </connor>
<garnt> that there's something wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> Just avoid it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> And I think that's absolutely. </garnt>
<connor> You know, just speak it, </connor>
<garnt> like try and trying to keep like a healthy, </garnt>
<garnt> like a good mental health is not, </garnt>
<joey> it's not something that should be frowned upon, you know? </joey>
<joey> And I feel like America in this, </joey>
<garnt> I like leagues ahead of other cultures and just accepting </garnt>
<joey> this and... </joey>
<garnt> - Gender doesn't stop you from being sad. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you're sad, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't matter what you identify as if you're sad. </garnt>
<joey> And if you need to talk about it, </joey>
<joey> you need to talk about. </joey>
<joey> - The, male suicide rate is so high man, like, </joey>
<joey> I should have sort of sat thinking about (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - Well male depression rate is so high as well. </joey>
<joey> Like no one talks about it. </joey>
<joey> - Books about thing. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<connor> What I'm saying in my first year of living in London, </connor>
<connor> looking back, I could easily tell you I was depressed. </connor>
<connor> But at the time, I didn't know. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know why I was miserable. </connor>
<connor> I didn't think I was like, </connor>
<connor> I have no reason to be sad. </connor>
<joey> So I'm not sad. </joey>
<joey> - Just because he had no one to talk about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) a bad mood. </joey>
<joey> But I also didn't even because I hadn't been educated on it, </joey>
<connor> no one even told me that that was like, </connor>
<connor> who tells you what depression feels like? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How do you learn that? </connor>
<connor> I didn't know what it was. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't understand what it was. </connor>
<connor> And only now when I look back and I think, oh, </connor>
<connor> I'd like all the, the trademarks, if depression, like, </connor>
<connor> I like didn't want to hang out with anyone. </connor>
<connor> But I also was lonely and (indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - Let us catch 22. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's like, it's normally it's being your own worst enemy, </joey>
<joey> but I didn't understand that. </joey>
<joey> And, I'm very, very lucky </joey>
<joey> that I managed to just get out of it on my own. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that now I'm much better. </connor>
<connor> And I think it was a whole slew of reasons </connor>
<connor> of why I don't feel that way anymore. </connor>
<connor> Mainly like just life reasons changing. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I wish that I'd had more education on it in school. </connor>
<connor> Like in Wales, it was never brought up. </connor>
<connor> Depression was for people who were crazy. </connor>
<garnt> That was not what healthy people </garnt>
<garnt> have with normal jobs and wives. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you can't be sad if you have a job in a wife. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You've got a 50 inch plasma screen TV. </connor>
<connor> You can't be depressed, (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Depression is people who killed people. </connor>
<connor> That's what it was like, obviously exaggerating. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, that. </connor>
<joey> - And I feel at school as well, </joey>
<joey> like it's hard to take seriously </joey>
<garnt> because of the environment that you're in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I was just miserable in school anyway. </joey>
<joey> Like I, yeah, it's really difficult. </joey>
<garnt> And it's a really uncomfortable thing to think about. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - There are times in my life where I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah, I'm there. </garnt>
<garnt> So that I was like miserable </garnt>
<connor> and very, very unhealthily. </connor>
<connor> So very self-destructive. </connor>
<connor> But I just didn't recognize it. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't know why. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I guess the main reason is like why yeah, no one, nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> Most of the time, nothing makes you depressed. </garnt>
<garnt> It just happens. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like, </connor>
<garnt> it's go going back to what you're taught in school. </garnt>
<connor> It's just like, oh, the, seeking help therapy. </connor>
<connor> Those are for the crazy people. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> You don't want to be associated </connor>
<connor> with the crazies with some something, you know? </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, that's just not how real life is at all. </connor>
<connor> A lot of people will have a lot of issues </connor>
<connor> and like some on varying scales, </connor>
<connor> but there's nothing wrong with just talking </connor>
<connor> to someone professional about it. </connor>
<joey> - There's nothing wrong with seeking help. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Like, you know, when you've had it </connor>
<connor> for an extended period of time, </connor>
<connor> I didn't know. </connor>
<connor> I was like, well, this is just normal. </connor>
<connor> This is how I've always felt. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't know anything else. </joey>
<joey> This is what do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - That's when it starts to get scary. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> because that's all I like for awhile. </connor>
<connor> That was like how I just felt all the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I was like, oh no, </connor>
<connor> it was nothing to complain about </connor>
<connor> because this is how it's always. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause, your memory is very good at letting you forget </connor>
<connor> things over a year. </connor>
<connor> So you very much forget how it was. </connor>
<garnt> - You'll be sued. </garnt>
<garnt> You could be, </garnt>
<connor> you'd be surprised how easy it is for your mind </connor>
<connor> to just accept things the way they are. </connor>
<connor> - 100%. </connor>
<connor> - Now you can get used to a lot of things </connor>
<connor> and it's scary how you can just get used </connor>
<connor> to like a lot of like a toxic period </connor>
<connor> in your life or like a really bad period in your life. </connor>
<garnt> And your mind just like accepts that as the norm. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you forget that life could be better, that's you? </garnt>
<garnt> That not everyone should feel this way. </garnt>
<connor> - And unfortunately our mind </connor>
<connor> is a terrible way of coping with situations. </connor>
<connor> We don't like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah </connor>
<connor> - And I'll brain is amazing at that. </connor>
<connor> Like hiding from us. </connor>
<connor> So for a long time, I didn't know why we're sad, </connor>
<connor> but I couldn't figure it out. </connor>
<joey> Like. </joey>
<joey> - And he's very good at just like putting </joey>
<joey> on the emergency handbrake. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes it'd be like. </joey>
<connor> - It's really good at like </connor>
<joey> that little brain is really good at that (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - You really that boy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh year. </joey>
<joey> - I employ you to think about it more. </joey>
<connor> And if you want to get help, don't be ashamed. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't don't be, </garnt>
<garnt> and don't be ashamed to talk to it about your, </garnt>
<garnt> to talk with your classmates about it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause that's the biggest thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I think. </garnt>
<joey> - You're very blessed to have a good friends. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And if you mates don't take it seriously then, </connor>
<connor> that's something that's telling all your mates. </connor>
<garnt> Probably not your mates. </garnt>
<joey> - That's telling. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That is telling because I've, </joey>
<joey> I realized then that I was lucky enough to have mates, </joey>
<connor> including you guys who I can talk to anything about this, </connor>
<connor> and it's not just here, it's back home as well. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, I got a pretty good group of friends. </connor>
<garnt> I feel pretty blessed right now know. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm obviously not gonna bring it up every conversation. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can, bring it up. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It was a bro moment when I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> I'm glad we're talking about this now, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I want all my friends to feel like </connor>
<joey> they can come to me in trust and be like, listen, man, </joey>
<joey> I'm really struggling. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, let's do so let's sit down. </joey>
<joey> Let's talk about whatever you need, man. </joey>
<joey> Whatever you need man, </joey>
<joey> Let's figure it out. </joey>
<joey> Like let's, do it. </joey>
<joey> Like I want you to be happy (chuckles). </joey>
<joey> - Mates don't wanna see mates being sad. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Oh man. </joey>
<joey> You know the one thing that I've learned </joey>
<joey> as I getting older golf a bit I'm twenty-five </joey>
<joey> and I'm saying that it is. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I noticed it is harder to make friends. </connor>
<connor> It gets, more difficult to make good friends </connor>
<connor> because everyone's doing, you know? </connor>
<joey> - And I feel at that point as well, </joey>
<joey> everyone already has their establishment for France. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And groups and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And you know, and it's time, man. </joey>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - I remember when I was growing up, everyone was just like, </connor>
<joey> time is your most valuable resource. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, fine. </joey>
<joey> - What does that mean, off. </joey>
<joey> - Off I'm not (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Give me a million dollars and we'll see </joey>
<joey> how it buy me a McDonald's meal. </joey>
<joey> - A time is gonna buy me McDonald's meal. </joey>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Shut up, dad. </connor>
<connor> Logan is opening my (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It really started to hit me </garnt>
<garnt> when I just wanted to hang out with Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> And now she's like got her own career and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And we literally have to like schedule a date. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Never had to do before. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like what we have to book out time to spend </joey>
<joey> time with each other. </joey>
<joey> - You have to pencil in a date (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - I have to pencil in time to spend time </joey>
<connor> with my significant other. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, what is there? </connor>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is very weird. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, time management is a thing </joey>
<connor> that you have to learn as you're growing older as well. </connor>
<connor> And like also, </connor>
<connor> you just don't have as much energy as you did before. </connor>
<connor> Like it's like your energy levels do like go down </connor>
<connor> because your patience for. </connor>
<garnt> Just like just, it dwindles, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> I have zero of that now just like immediately. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I'm not gonna waste time on this </garnt>
<garnt> because now I know how valuable my time is. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I finally understand </garnt>
<garnt> that time is your most precious values. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know right? </garnt>
<joey> - I finally understood after all the I went to like, oh, </joey>
<joey> this is what this means. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's not even like, oh, </garnt>
<joey> I could use using this time to make money. </joey>
<joey> No, you're not. </joey>
<joey> I mean. </joey>
<joey> - I could be using this time to be happy (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - I can be using this time to hang out </joey>
<joey> with my homie to play some games, like... </joey>
<joey> - Anything like but this. </joey>
<joey> - Like if there's something that makes me angry nowadays, </joey>
<connor> it's something that wasted my time. </connor>
<connor> I'm literally like, literally, like, </connor>
<connor> I don't have many pet peeves, </connor>
<connor> but if I feel, </connor>
<connor> if I do something and I feel like I could have been, </connor>
<connor> I could have used that hour doing something else. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I that's the biggest thing that makes me angry. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I could have been like, </joey>
<garnt> I could have been playing it like a good game. </garnt>
<garnt> Could have been hanging out with my homeys. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Have been doing anything. </joey>
<joey> - Anything, to make me happier than where I am now. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Japanese government and building (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> 20,000 hours of waiting. </connor>
<connor> I've had a question in my mind. </connor>
<garnt> That's been haunting me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - This guy came out of the toilet. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - In the public toilet. </connor>
<connor> And he flushed the toilet as he left. </connor>
<connor> When do you flush the toilet? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Because I do you like, because... </connor>
<connor> - Well, it depends on what you're doing. </connor>
<connor> - You've done it number two. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. Number two. </connor>
<connor> - Yu have your, you stand up, right. </connor>
<connor> You now have two options. </connor>
<connor> You can start buckling your belt, </connor>
<connor> putting it back up, putting it, </connor>
<connor> getting metal ready or you can flush the toilet. </connor>
<connor> Which one do you do first. </connor>
<joey> - While standing up? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because there are some people </connor>
<connor> who flush while they sit. </connor>
<connor> - That ain't right. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> You know, you just typhoon in your, water. </connor>
<connor> Like that's terrible. </connor>
<connor> Well, the circumstance upon which you are allowed, </connor>
<connor> I will give the past to be able to flush the toilet while </connor>
<connor> still sitting on it. </connor>
<connor> You know, that smell is so bad that you, </connor>
<connor> your cheeks are the only thing. </connor>
<joey> Keeping it in. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> I Personally stand up first when I flush. </connor>
<joey> - Obviously you can 'cause you're human beings. </joey>
<connor> - I'm not (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - Do you then, right. </connor>
<connor> So let's say you've unbuckled, right? </connor>
<connor> Your pets. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you obviously you've unbuckled them. </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<connor> This has been burning on my mind because this man did it. </connor>
<connor> He clearly right. </connor>
<connor> He clearly got up, </connor>
<connor> did his pants and then flushed the toilet and left. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But which one do you do first? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause sometimes I immediately, </joey>
<joey> I just close the thing, </joey>
<connor> flush and then something up my pants. </connor>
<joey> - I buckle up my pants first. </joey>
<connor> - I buckle up my pants first. </connor>
<connor> - Then flush that leak. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Why am I the weird one? </joey>
<joey> What happened in my childhood? </joey>
<joey> - Like, it's weird. </joey>
<connor> Like the way you do it is weird </connor>
<joey> because it's that means you're literally standing </joey>
<joey> there flushing the toilet with the pants. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So like this right pants here. </joey>
<joey> I'll simulate it. </joey>
<joey> I'll simulate it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Say it's like this. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, okay, close the lid, flush. </connor>
<connor> And then I do this while it's flushing. </connor>
<connor> - But your pants down, right? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Well then that's exact thing. </connor>
<connor> - Right when I'm like this. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> I come up and then as I'm getting up, </connor>
<connor> I kind of like pull it up to the point of light. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's that? </connor>
<connor> But I just gotta zip it up and do the belt. </connor>
<connor> You don't have you understand what I mean? </connor>
<connor> You want to send what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<joey> - No (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - I don't. </joey>
<joey> I fail to see the difference. </joey>
<connor> What's the difference? </connor>
<connor> - What'd you mean? </connor>
<joey> - Like what's the difference </joey>
<joey> between the way you do it and the </joey>
<connor> way I do it. </connor>
<connor> - So, when I stand up... </connor>
<joey> - I like to have a conversation has gone to or. </joey>
<joey> - I just sold the cafe. </joey>
<garnt> - We just, had like the deepest therapy session. </garnt>
<connor> - How do you flush (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - This has been on my mind for like three days. </connor>
<connor> I just saw someone did it... </connor>
<connor> - And I need a therapy session off this conversation. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I stand up right. </garnt>
<joey> And I picture it right? </joey>
<joey> Anyone with any pants doing this? </joey>
<connor> You pull it up right now. </connor>
<connor> There's a moment where you can now decide </connor>
<connor> to wear your pants up. </connor>
<joey> You're standing up your hands on, </joey>
<joey> are free for a moment </joey>
<joey> you can choose to then move your hands </joey>
<joey> to the zipper and the belt to fully close your pants. </joey>
<joey> Or you can flush the toilet. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<garnt> - I choose to choose to flush. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I choose to do my pants and then flush. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like how do we develop these behaviors? </connor>
<connor> That's what I want to know. </connor>
<connor> What makes us, why do we do this? </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) It's deep. </joey>
<garnt> - It's because I would like, </garnt>
<garnt> before I flush the flush, right. </garnt>
<connor> Is the, signal that I have finished everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, 'cause here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> Here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Sometimes, you're in a public toilet. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> I hate the people who like flush. </connor>
<connor> Like sometimes you're desperate. </connor>
<connor> You're just like, God, I need to go now. </connor>
<connor> And you're waiting for something </connor>
<connor> to come out of the toilets </connor>
<connor> and here the flush right here, </connor>
<connor> the flush, or you're just like, </connor>
<connor> all right, </connor>
<connor> they're coming out and let's stay in there </connor>
<garnt> for another five minutes doing God knows what. </garnt>
<joey> - The flushes, like a Pavlovian. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, you hear the flush. </garnt>
<joey> It's all ready to, it just doesn't happen. </joey>
<garnt> - It's just like, if you flush, </garnt>
<connor> you better be coming out of that. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> If you flush, </garnt>
<connor> there must be a ten second window </connor>
<joey> where you have to get out the toilet. </joey>
<joey> You're signaling the end of your. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> That's why I want to be fully ready to get out the moment </joey>
<connor> I flushed. </connor>
<connor> - I saw a sprint, man, </connor>
<joey> - I don't want to keep you guys waiting. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just wondering, </joey>
<joey> is there something in my brain </joey>
<connor> that makes me decide to do that first? </connor>
<connor> - You're just trolling. </connor>
<connor> Aren't you? </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I do wonder this like psychoanalyze. </connor>
<connor> - You're like, I want to take my time. </connor>
<connor> - Like little things I do. </connor>
<connor> And I wonder like, </connor>
<joey> why do I do like that? </joey>
<joey> Why do I do those things? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe it's a habit you had since you were a kid. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like maybe when. </connor>
<garnt> - You, did you notice this in the first place. </garnt>
<connor> - I noticed that this guy immediately left </connor>
<garnt> after he flush. </garnt>
<connor> And I thought to myself, I hold on. </connor>
<connor> I do like to flush and then take a moment and just kind of. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, you're the one person I would hate to be. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You're that awesome like, give me five minutes. </connor>
<connor> - The total giant social time. </connor>
<connor> Doesn't change. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> But the perception of time changes. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - So you it's 10 seconds </garnt>
<connor> after you flush to us it's 10 minutes (laughs). </connor>
<joey> - Overall. </joey>
<connor> It's the same time I'm spending in there. </connor>
<connor> So it doesn't matter. </connor>
<garnt> You're going to get into this. </garnt>
<garnt> - So to me, if you don't leave the toilet, </garnt>
<connor> by the time the flush is finished, </connor>
<connor> then you are taking too long. </connor>
<connor> That is the ESCO, right? </connor>
<garnt> That is, the. </garnt>
<connor> - Because you will sorry </connor>
<connor> if we covered this on channel before. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if we have, </connor>
<joey> how do you prove in public bathrooms? </joey>
<joey> Do you care about that? </joey>
<joey> - We haven't. </joey>
<joey> - I remember in school, </joey>
<connor> I was always the weird one </connor>
<connor> because I didn't mind pooping in the toilets, </connor>
<connor> but I also was like, </connor>
<garnt> what am I going to do? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like to me, it is like a last resort ruby toilet. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I've seen crime. </connor>
<connor> It seems less messy than that (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - One thing I do remember now that we're talking about this. </connor>
<connor> When I was back in London, </connor>
<garnt> I went to, I needed the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> before I got my train and Euston station. </garnt>
<garnt> Now one thing about Euston station in London is that it's </garnt>
<connor> probably one of the dirtier train station. </connor>
<connor> They'd say. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's definitely one of the rougher looking stations. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't look as nice. </connor>
<joey> - As this train stations aren't already dirty. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I've been King's cross is pretty nice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It looks pretty fancy. </connor>
<garnt> I'd say. </garnt>
<garnt> - One thing, I noticed after going back was like, </garnt>
<garnt> compared to Japan, everything's doing train stations. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's true. </garnt>
<garnt> Train stations. </garnt>
<garnt> Suck in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> Then you don't find out what platform your train </garnt>
<connor> is on in Houston until like five minutes before. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So everyone's just standing there. </connor>
<connor> And then when the thing comes up, everyone's rushing. </connor>
<joey> And it's like, why don't you just tell me it before? </joey>
<joey> And then I guess there's some system on their end </joey>
<joey> where they don't know it's stupid. </joey>
<joey> They should know. </joey>
<joey> They should figure this out. </joey>
<joey> Come on, figure it out. </joey>
<connor> But, so I went to the toilet in Houston station </connor>
<connor> and this was absolute war crimes. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure some Geneva conventions are broken. </connor>
<connor> Then this toilet. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - There was no toilet seat in this toilet. </joey>
<joey> - This was just the bowl. </joey>
<connor> - It was just the bowl. </connor>
<connor> - I've seen that before. </connor>
<garnt> - And I thought it must be a mistake. </garnt>
<joey> I went to, I refuse to go in this one. </joey>
<joey> It was very busy. </joey>
<joey> I might... </joey>
<joey> - (indistinct) someone steal the lid or something devious. </joey>
<joey> Like you notice I go to the next one. </joey>
<joey> It's the same thing. </joey>
<joey> I go to the next world. </joey>
<connor> And then now there is now there is a toilet seat, </connor>
<connor> but there is like, it is, </connor>
<connor> it is like something has happened in here. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not only is the smell apparent, </connor>
<connor> but like there is like four pieces of toilet tissue left. </connor>
<connor> And it's that horrible, </connor>
<connor> horrible system of like one tissue </connor>
<connor> that they ration out that you have to, like, </connor>
<joey> you have to pull out 50 to get one wipe with anyway. </joey>
<joey> It's like, what's wrong with you people? </joey>
<joey> I get it that you don't want me to take a out of the role. </joey>
<joey> I understand that. </joey>
<joey> But why do you have to make it such a small amount? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like I, and it's always like half apply. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, if I held this up, </joey>
<joey> I could see through it </joey>
<joey> and navigate perfectly in a car and a car. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So there's this toilet seat. </connor>
<connor> Oh, it's terrible. </connor>
<connor> And then not only that, when you leave it, </connor>
<joey> I hate when Polly bathrooms do this. </joey>
<joey> They don't have any soap anywhere. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - No soap, no way to dry your hands. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, are you, </connor>
<joey> you're just telling me not to dry. </joey>
<joey> You're not telling, </joey>
<joey> you're just asking me not to wash my hands. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> Like, so I go there, I do the obligatory, </joey>
<connor> put water on my hands and leave and I feel dirty stuff. </connor>
<connor> My hands are wet. </connor>
<connor> I can't dry that I'm depressed. </connor>
<connor> Not only was there stains all over this thing, </connor>
<connor> that stunk is terrible. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Shocking. </connor>
<connor> How do they not keep these toilets clean? </connor>
<connor> I don't understand. </connor>
<joey> - And it's just not getting paid enough. </joey>
<joey> - You have one job and it just literally to keep them clean. </joey>
<connor> I don't think there's anything else you need to do </connor>
<connor> in the toilets. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, the thing is that's why I don't in public, </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's, </joey>
<joey> there is a big difference between the toilets, </joey>
<joey> the toilets in Japan versus the toilets in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, as you mentioned last week, </garnt>
<garnt> the first thing you noticed </garnt>
<garnt> is things are a lot dirtier in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, after you've been living in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> for like this long, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Oh, I remembered another story. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Go for it. </connor>
<connor> Go for it. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry. </connor>
<connor> I went to this toilet in a coven garden. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I went to a coffee shop. </connor>
<joey> Coffee shop was too small. </joey>
<connor> They didn't have their own toilet. </connor>
<connor> They used a toilet in coven garden </connor>
<joey> that was connected to the church. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - And it was 30 Penn center. </joey>
<connor> It's about 50 cents maybe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And- </joey>
<joey> - How much were you guys charged for toilets. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God. </joey>
<joey> This toilet was, </joey>
<connor> it was like, entering some sewer level </connor>
<connor> and a video game going down these stairs. </connor>
<connor> So it was in the stairs down. </connor>
<connor> You just go on the street level, </connor>
<connor> you have to go down this really looking 1800s </connor>
<connor> at architecture. </connor>
<connor> You get to this like this I'm kind of Cove looking thing. </connor>
<connor> It's, this Archway. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> And again, it looks like from something </connor>
<connor> out of the 1800s that was never replaced. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is amazing, great architecture. </connor>
<connor> Whoops. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But this is then this is turnstile </connor>
<connor> and it is the most disgusting color </connor>
<connor> of orange green wall that you've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> And the lights are flickering and yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It sounds like you're about to enter a Doxil the level. </joey>
<connor> - And I'm near certain, </connor>
<connor> I'm the only person on earth </connor>
<joey> who actually pay to get in </joey>
<joey> because the moment I got it, </joey>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> I got in two guys just jumped after me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I go in here. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> And only one of the stalls is open. </connor>
<connor> So I go in there and I to do my business now, </connor>
<joey> unfortunately that was only </joey>
<joey> like two sheets of toilet roll life. </joey>
<joey> So I was already, </joey>
<joey> it was already a bad time by the time. </joey>
<joey> And there was no bad day, obviously. </joey>
<connor> - Tragedy. </connor>
<connor> - So my never quite felt clean. </connor>
<connor> So I was constantly, </connor>
<connor> I was also struggling with that every single day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I definitely felt my was not clean that January you joked. </connor>
<connor> But I walked in on many days thinking like, </connor>
<connor> holy and need you to bring a portable today. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm in this thing, right. </connor>
<connor> I'm hearing noises from the two stalls and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> that's not a big deal. </connor>
<connor> It's not a big deal. </connor>
<connor> And then this guy drops a can. </connor>
<connor> They're kind of ominously rolls into my store </connor>
<connor> and it's a kind of Guinness </connor>
<connor> and I kind of like kick it back and I'm like, there you go. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Cheers." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, hello? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, okay. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, it's a nice day to day in it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> you talking to me while I'm in the middle of this. </connor>
<connor> Like, I me he's like, "Who else would I be talking to?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "I don't know." </connor>
<connor> I'm like what? </connor>
<connor> And I'm just confused. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah, it's nice. </connor>
<connor> So I go out and these two guys come out. </connor>
<connor> One of them is homeless. </connor>
<connor> And one of them just looks like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know who this guy is. </connor>
<connor> He doesn't look homeless. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But one of the other guys is clearly homeless. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause his stall was just had his sleeping bag in it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, "What on earth is going on?" </joey>
<joey> And the guy was like, "You didn't actually pay for it. </joey>
<connor> Did you?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Yeah, I did." </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Oh, you're a ticket." </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then washed his hands and left. </connor>
<connor> And then the other guy just stared at me. </connor>
<connor> I was like, </connor>
<connor> this is the most comfortable toilet experience I've had. </connor>
<connor> I was just happy. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - I thought I was gonna die. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like, </connor>
<connor> okay, I'm just going to go through. </connor>
<connor> And I just worked the toured sandwich of depressed, </connor>
<connor> like some kind of emergency meeting button X to get out. </connor>
<joey> It was horrible. </joey>
<joey> - The kicking back the Guinness </joey>
<connor> can just sounds like an event in a game. </connor>
<connor> It was wait, this is how you activate the store. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I heard something drop. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then it had that really ominous noise of rolling came </connor>
<connor> over and I was like, kicking it, </connor>
<connor> like take it back. </connor>
<connor> I don't bunch with kidneys. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] It's a side quest in Yakuza. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> Because the side quest. </joey>
<connor> - I, this short I'll take a. </connor>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - If there's one place, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to have a conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> It's on the not, not, not, you know, </garnt>
<connor> maybe if we're in some kind of Ritz, Carlton, toilet, wets, </connor>
<connor> it's amazing hand towels. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor and Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, when you're in a fancy place, </connor>
<connor> that's their tissues. </connor>
<connor> There's towels. </connor>
<connor> There's a pile of towels to wash your hands. </connor>
<connor> That's actually how my day is, how is it? </connor>
<connor> I'm just enjoying the fun selection of towels, SERPs, </connor>
<connor> and moisture. </connor>
<connor> And it looks, you know, it's great. </connor>
<connor> That then talks to me (laughs). </connor>
<connor> But when I'm in the sketchiest toilet in London, </connor>
<connor> no thank you. </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) next to you. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know. </connor>
<connor> This guy had his whole set up in there. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I've been like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if that's okay. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, </connor>
<connor> I'm glad you've got some accommodation </connor>
<connor> for now, but like, me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Scary. </connor>
<connor> And I just didn't know why they called me a. </connor>
<connor> I paid for it. I should I be a good citizen? </connor>
<connor> Know someone has to stock the toilet paper </connor>
<connor> or else they're gonna afford it. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the only like bad public toilet stories </garnt>
<connor> that has happened to you because like... </connor>
<connor> - Like when I went back. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, when you went back, </connor>
<connor> that's why you just don't in public. </connor>
<garnt> In the UK, at least in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> No, no, it's not. </garnt>
<connor> No, it's not in Japan. </connor>
<connor> There is a common phenomenon in Japan. </connor>
<connor> If you go to some places at night, </connor>
<connor> there was a big thing where dudes try and watch your PP. </connor>
<connor> If you've had, have you seen the videos on Twitter? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - You've seen them. </connor>
<connor> There's loads of videos, right? </connor>
<connor> In certain areas. </connor>
<connor> I think there are very, </connor>
<connor> more likely to happen. </connor>
<garnt> There's videos of dudes like jacking off in urinals, </garnt>
<garnt> like right next to other guys. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just seeing this. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Man] No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I've heard stories about this. </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen this on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not Surprised by this. </connor>
<garnt> - I've never been a lot of stories of like dudes, </garnt>
<connor> like, looking at it and stopping, looking at it. </connor>
<connor> And that's apparently somewhat common in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I'm not surprised at all. </joey>
<connor> This is Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Common. </joey>
<joey> - It is also, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> When you, kind of treat your treat, </joey>
<joey> gay people kind of harshly here. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> I guess they have no choice. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Don't feel comfortable, </connor>
<connor> but it's still strange. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've had friends who had happened to hear. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Well they've just started like pull it out </connor>
<connor> and going at it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Sorry. </connor>
<connor> In which, areas I want to know. </connor>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> Okay, well I'm sketchy parts sheets. </joey>
<joey> There are some sketchy parts in Shinjuku. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - I have seen, there has been a couple of instances </connor>
<joey> where I have seen dudes in public jacking it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they do it. </connor>
<joey> It's not weird. </joey>
<connor> It's not always, </connor>
<connor> it's not unusual to see. </connor>
<joey> - Unfortunately it's not unusual to see. </joey>
<garnt> And it's definitely scarring. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Having a Georgie Strausser Shinjuku. </garnt>
<joey> And then it's like, oh, just jacking in the alleyway. </joey>
<joey> - We don't normally hang out </joey>
<joey> at those like kind of like establishment. </joey>
<joey> So it doesn't really surprise me that area. </joey>
<connor> But like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean most public toilets in Japan are like cleaner </connor>
<connor> than like most people's private toilets. </connor>
<connor> It's rediculars. </connor>
<connor> Like the concept of clean public toilets didn't exist </connor>
<garnt> in my mind until I went to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, wait. </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen some really dirty ones in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Occasionally there is some way. </connor>
<joey> - Occasionally it happens. </joey>
<connor> But normally you never see clean public toilets, </connor>
<connor> especially in England and especially in Thailand as well. </connor>
<connor> My God Southeast Asia. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<joey> I achieve. </joey>
<joey> Wait, wait, wait. </joey>
<joey> I actually realized going back why? </joey>
<joey> I don't like days. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> And it's because I realized, oh, </joey>
<joey> I've grown up my entire life with birthdays </joey>
<joey> because Southeast Asia have their own days. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] What? </joey>
<joey> - But okay. </joey>
<joey> Because, but in Southeast Asia, </joey>
<joey> we have this thing that, </joey>
<joey> which we call a bad day, </joey>
<connor> but it's not a bad day. </connor>
<connor> It's a hose. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> So. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Now I'm civilised. </connor>
<garnt> - (indistinct) in Japan, you have (laughs). </garnt>
<garnt> - Toshiba's system, the measures, </garnt>
<connor> the moisture of your to deliver the perfect blend. </connor>
<connor> - So read the reason I hate the feeling of bodies </connor>
<connor> is because my entire life </connor>
<connor> I've had like Southeast Asian bodies, </connor>
<connor> which is just like every toilet has like this hose. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> You know, how in the buddies in Japan is like </connor>
<connor> this precision sniper. </connor>
<connor> - I was being shot at your hole. </connor>
<connor> It's not political down. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - In Southeast Asia, </garnt>
<garnt> you have this host put a shotgun. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a shotgun </garnt>
<garnt> that you shot gun your entire house. </garnt>
<connor> - How did you use this? </connor>
<connor> If you're like, you know, you're, </connor>
<garnt> are you on the toilet? </garnt>
<garnt> - You're on a toilet slow. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have to like put the hose between your legs. </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Which is still weird. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] It's like, what the fuck is the wet? </joey>
<connor> Why is it always wet? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I don't want to be reminded of a theme park </connor>
<garnt> when I'm going to the toilet. </garnt>
<connor> I don't want that. </connor>
<garnt> - And so like a lot of public toilets in Southeast Asia, </garnt>
<garnt> you see the toilet seat and it's wet </garnt>
<connor> and it's not wet from. </connor>
<garnt> It's just wet from the day. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> And so that's why, that's what I, like. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've been grained that into my mind to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, that feeling of water on your. </garnt>
<garnt> That's bad feeling. </garnt>
<connor> - I've tried to I've. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> I like how we've just managed to go </connor>
<connor> from deep to the again. </connor>
<connor> I apologize. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure we'll run out of topics to talk about with this. </connor>
<connor> Eventually I, in Japan, </connor>
<connor> sometimes you do come across the old style toilets </connor>
<garnt> of Japanese starlets. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you ever used them? </garnt>
<garnt> The waspy toilet? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I'll talk you about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was you just AKA a hole in the ground </garnt>
<connor> and you squat over it and you just do it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Now I have used it one time </connor>
<connor> and I just could not get over the feeling </connor>
<connor> that I was just kind of dropping something </connor>
<connor> that was just going to splash everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I could not get over that feeling. </connor>
<connor> I was squatting real low, </connor>
<connor> but I just, I couldn't, </connor>
<connor> I did not enjoy it. </connor>
<garnt> It was not fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I hate about those. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I've had to use that plenty of times </garnt>
<garnt> as well in Southeast Asia. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially like, </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you're on a long drive. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like if you, need to your business, </connor>
<connor> every public toilet, </connor>
<garnt> is that holding on the ground. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If, it came to it and the only option </garnt>
<joey> I had is that a hole in the ground? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure I'm in a hole in the ground. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Can I have it? </joey>
<joey> I bought, if I can, </joey>
<joey> I will obviously go for the premium wall </joey>
<connor> mass bid day blasting. </connor>
<connor> What temperature moistening experience </connor>
<garnt> any day of the week I would choose. </garnt>
<garnt> - The thing that makes me most uncomfortable </garnt>
<garnt> is like with a normal toilets. </garnt>
<connor> There's the seat. </connor>
<connor> And the seat is like a safety barrier, </connor>
<connor> nothing penetrates this barrier. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - So I liked that. </connor>
<garnt> I couldn't miss. </garnt>
<connor> I've never missed the toilet. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Hey bro. </connor>
<connor> You have to play like mini-golf we're there. </connor>
<garnt> But like if you miss the whole, </garnt>
<garnt> he got to clean that up. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Total paper and scoop it in. </connor>
<connor> What happens. </connor>
<connor> Does anyone know? </connor>
<connor> Is Eric, is there a courageous? </connor>
<connor> - You don't miss. </connor>
<joey> - I have gone 25 years or probably like 23 without missing. </joey>
<connor> I'm very happy to keep my streak alive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't want to even attempt to miss. </garnt>
<connor> And also I just like sitting down I'm lazy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't like that. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you you're propping yourself up </garnt>
<connor> with your own legs. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if you don't then, and you fall over. </connor>
<connor> - I don't do exercise. </connor>
<connor> - Supposedly it's supposed to be better to squat. </connor>
<connor> Like just like, that's what I say. </connor>
<connor> It's less likely you're going to get hemorrhoids </connor>
<connor> and (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> Like. </connor>
<joey> - But if we just stop at McDonald's, </joey>
<joey> but I still do a lot of things that are better for me that. </joey>
<joey> - True, true. </joey>
<joey> Why did we get on this topic? </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm so sorry. </connor>
<connor> This is my fault. </connor>
<connor> I was just, he was on my mind. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, I didn't bring it up (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - Was it on your mind this entire time. </garnt>
<connor> - Spent on mindful of three days, </connor>
<connor> I saw the men do it and I woke up thinking about it. </connor>
<joey> - I'm also very used to just like </joey>
<joey> in a hole in the ground </joey>
<connor> from like going camping in Australia </connor>
<connor> because (indistinct) we have long drops </connor>
<joey> and it's just like, it's literally. </joey>
<joey> - No, that's just, well, she just do that anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But when you're camping, you have no choice. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> Because it's a hole in the ground. </connor>
<connor> But it's like, it's not like a shallow hole in the ground. </connor>
<connor> And it's like a real deep hole. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, really should dig. </connor>
<connor> When we used to go camping, </connor>
<connor> we'd dig up tiny hole and fill it up. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<connor> Those ones where it's like. </connor>
<connor> - What are you doing? </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> It's like ones that have built into the campsite. </joey>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<joey> - Like in a cabin. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, they made an outhouse, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like an outhouse space. </joey>
<connor> - Outhouse. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But it's like a wooden log cabin </connor>
<connor> and you walk in and it's just a whole, it's. </connor>
<connor> - An outhouse. </connor>
<connor> - And you like put your torch in it and it's like, </connor>
<connor> you can't see the bottom. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's an outhouse. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> And yeah, I had to do those. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> This is the worst experience of my life. </connor>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> So picture it. </connor>
<connor> You're skiing. </connor>
<connor> You have those ski boots home. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> So have you ever have you want ski boots? </connor>
<connor> Actually. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It is impossible to have precision movement </connor>
<connor> in the ski boots. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> - You also like a roadblocks. </connor>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> So you do, you bought like you're in roadblocks. </connor>
<connor> (Connor chuckles) </connor>
<connor> So the only option at this particular skiing place </connor>
<connor> for some reason was a port-a-potty. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Can you imagine a port-a-potty in ski boots? </connor>
<connor> It doesn't work, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you need to sit down. </connor>
<connor> You got to aim yourself. </connor>
<connor> You gotta have room to close the door. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> That was bad enough that it was a port-a-potty I thought, </connor>
<connor> oh my God, </connor>
<connor> I gotta get used a port-a-potty </connor>
<connor> and ski thing and ski boots. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I get in this Porter potty. </connor>
<connor> I think it was in, </connor>
<connor> might've been Bulgaria. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I get in this Porter potty. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how this has happened. </connor>
<connor> There is, toilet roll with on it, </connor>
<connor> on the roof, on the sides. </connor>
<connor> On every, it looks like some kind of someone </connor>
<connor> has tried to do you use </connor>
<connor> like ancient talismans of on this port-a-potty </connor>
<connor> to get spirits away. </connor>
<connor> It is. </connor>
<connor> I immediately threw up when I got in there. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Because I was still needed to go somewhere. </connor>
<connor> I stuck with it. </connor>
<connor> But right after I was done, I threw up, </connor>
<connor> it was so disgusting. </connor>
<connor> I'd never seen anything like it, </connor>
<connor> I was, it was almost like a trap </connor>
<connor> that they put that for tourists. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> There was like, you, tourists coming to our place. </connor>
<connor> It was horrible, man. </connor>
<connor> You go into this thing. </connor>
<connor> It's tiny. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You can barely sit there. </connor>
<connor> Your ski boots, belly fitted. </connor>
<connor> So your knees are touching the door. </connor>
<connor> That also has on them. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how that would happen to this day. </connor>
<connor> I still don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - They should apologize viewers. </joey>
<joey> You have to listen to this. </joey>
<joey> - It's disgusting. </joey>
<joey> It was, oh God. </joey>
<connor> - That's what my thoughts were. </connor>
<joey> Like. </joey>
<joey> - That's why, I flushed the toilet down. </joey>
<joey> - That's why, that's why I never shot. </joey>
<joey> Like when I was in high school too. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause like my high school, </connor>
<connor> because I went to an all boys school. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> So obviously there's going to be some afoot, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> like in places where there's going to be </connor>
<joey> in places where they shouldn't be. </joey>
<connor> - That was always the pranks were there. </connor>
<joey> - There was always the pranks. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like guys like where we're not animals. </joey>
<connor> - The people shooting in urinals. </connor>
<connor> - Oh dude. </connor>
<connor> I don't think there was ever a day </connor>
<connor> where I went to the urinal. </connor>
<connor> There wasn't in it. </connor>
<connor> Like it was actually discussed. </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) to the different cups. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Even in South-East Asia we're kinda like... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was, it was gross. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Never. </joey>
<connor> Whoa, whoa. </connor>
<garnt> Humans show disgusting. </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<garnt> Why can we not properly? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Apparently. </garnt>
<joey> - Toilet training is alive. </joey>
<joey> - 2000 years to get this right. </joey>
<joey> - And we're still. </joey>
<joey> We're only one step ahead. </joey>
<joey> I was just. </joey>
<joey> - Sitting in the hole in the ground. </joey>
<garnt> God dumb it. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do we always talk about shooting? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> I really didn't want to. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanted. </garnt>
<garnt> - To get away from anyone like eating. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whether they get away from me. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't want you to stay to be the podcast, </connor>
<connor> but it also been on my mind. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm done. </joey>
<connor> There's no more. </connor>
<connor> Now I promise you. </connor>
<connor> Won't talk about for 10 episodes. </connor>
