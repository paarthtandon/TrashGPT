<SPEAKER_07> day is just cancel council council </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> council council council cancelled um so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how bad was the storm it was really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really [ __ ] bad it was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i've obviously not had much experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in like cold weather and snow yeah so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> this was the first time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> this was the first time i'd ever been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i guess caught in a snowstorm and i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember um i remember when like during </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the snowstorm we had to take a taxi to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the airport because um all of the trains </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> had stopped running so it wasn't just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> planes we were we were looking at oh can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we take you know the shinkansen or the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> train back from hokkaido to tokyo nope </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everything everything was gone which </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> says a lot with hokkaido right because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like hokkaido is one of those places </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it snows so often yeah even like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like a little bit of snow or like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> substantial amount of snow it's still </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like yeah we'll just power through it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah unlike tokyo where it's like 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> centimeters of snow stop the trains stop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything bro the uk can't imagine man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the uk can't imagine right i remember we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we like constantly go through grit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shortages in the uk because we're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so ill prepared for just the tiniest bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of snow they always do this the exact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same speech every time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like why aren't the buses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> running the buses were running during </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> world war ii and now they've stopped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of a bit of snow what is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but they do this every single time right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes they say how dare the buses stop the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> absolute state it's like what what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because another country attacks or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because nature attacks yeah what do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think is scarier nature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely yeah so i remember like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember during the snowstorm um i had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go outside for just a few seconds um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go to to go from my hotel front door </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the taxi in the road in front of me a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> simple one to two minute walk you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever we've all done it and i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking it's just a bit of snow it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just a bit of wind i've handled that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before i go out and then i've never felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like nature's just like beating the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of me just as soon as i stepped out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the door right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like this snow i'm like i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> felt snow before it's like it's you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i felt snow before it's soft it's fluffy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's soft it's fluffy enough this snow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like [ __ ] ice man yeah like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> wind had turned this soft fluffy snow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into like an into like a [ __ ] wmd or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like my face literally like i felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my face was like getting cut from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the brief moment that i didn't have my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hood up the weekend album </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and so and seeing you caught in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a pokemon attack yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically it like this was literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just blizzard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i could feel like the hail just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] beating the [ __ ] out of my face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that 120 power point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh like and it was even worse for sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well because for some reason uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sydney decided that she shouldn't bring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any footwear to hokkaido other than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> heels so i mean it was like it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boots right but it was like boots with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like heels on them yeah yeah um that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh like yeah i know i know i know you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> what was she expecting up in hokkaido </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i think it's just been so long since </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> she's seen snow right that she has </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> forgotten what you know other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well other environments it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> wisconsin right doesn't it snow like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] up always yeah it does it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does because i was i was just like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember asking her oh i remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> telling her oh i've never seen like snow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like this in my life and she was like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been a long time and i was like so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been a long time for you and yet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you are still so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> less prepared you're so prepared for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this weather </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um but yeah i mean we just weren't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously we weren't expecting it to uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> be that harsh yeah the weather </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> conditions would be that hard so hard um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and yeah we had to stay in hokkaido </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically we were living out of an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> airport hotel for two days uh because we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> woke up the next day uh we i remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because i messaged these guys uh guys </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we're gonna have to possibly delay the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> recording by like an hour or two maybe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm gonna get an early flight it's all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gonna be good it's only like the weather </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> forecast it's only scheduled for the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> snow to be really bad on this day i wake </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> yeah um and an hour passes and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> every flight is cancelled again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and in in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the defeated manner boys guy and going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like sorry boys i'll let you down i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let you down boys i'll let you down it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't so much you that let us down it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was the [ __ ] weather yeah like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> wasn't your fault </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and just fight through it yeah just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> walk back just walk back it's walkable </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because like because like we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been through hokkaido like a few times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before yeah and like i swear to god it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like like sweating on every time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to hokkaido you're playing gacha </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the planes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because a lot of planes get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cancelled like very frequently right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously not as not in this kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> state where like literally the entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> airport was shut down but you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally playing gacha when you go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hokkaido because one or two planes will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally get cancelled or rescheduled or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like heavily heavily delayed but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's when you discovered why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> airport which is the airport in hokkaido </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is so well equipped right right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it is actually like chitose airport </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like one of the best airports </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've been to in the world i think just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just i mean just with like how many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurants and how many like resources </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are there there's basically like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> shopping mall inside the airport yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah basically because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like the airports that stick out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me are airports like singapore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> airport yeah which is just that that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like an amazing airport like uh the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hokkaido airport is more like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's that's more like a shopping mall </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with an airport attached to it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah where most because most of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff you see is before you go into the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> departure zone whereas most airports </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's the departure zone which </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really has all of the restaurants all of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the shops and all the everything but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah in chitosa i mean there's even like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a uh there's even like a cinema there as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> well yeah which uh there were there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah i don't know yeah i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you watch something i didn't the only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> film they were playing was uh the jiu </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jitsu tyson movie do this just go watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just go watch it i mean i i i i am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> actually gonna go watch it this weekend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is which is the only reason why i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't watch it when i was in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hokkaido um but yeah i mean i mean it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't it wasn't too bad because of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> airport there luckily i was able to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an air uh get a hotel at the airport </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um it was just more annoying because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously i wanted to be back i wanted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be working </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but yeah i mean that was there's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's not really much to say about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean like i'm sure this is like every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other day for a canadian yeah i like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember like there's going to be a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> million [ __ ] people in the comments </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> imagine living with sort of that every </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> day of the week </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it was just weird just like because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just used to no matter what happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's always kind of like a plan b </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can fall back on a possible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> plan b um but it was just the roads were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> closed airports were closed trains were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> closed so i was literally like stranded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you basically experienced quarantine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah basically yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i was basically stranded at the airport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was no plan b there wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was no services i could call to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get myself out of there to a place where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i could get some public transport to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> tokyo because did you go around uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting the shopping carts to get some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money together so you could buy a burger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> collecting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> plastic cans oh yeah so yeah so yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically just lived the terminal except </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sorry unfortunately i wasn't tom hanks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like i think one of the craziest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like weather phenomena i've been caught </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up in was uh when i was in vegas and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they have dust storms there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dust storms yeah so basically just think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of a sandstorm but instead of the sand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coming in from i've never even been in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the sandstorm right well i haven't been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a sandstorm but i've been in a dust </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> storm and it happens pretty frequently </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the difference between sand and dust uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i i don't i thought it was a sand storm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at first right but then everyone all my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> friends were like oh it's a dust storm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> coming and it's like a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> vernacular maybe or it's like maybe it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not just sand maybe it's like sand and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all the crap like mixed into it but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like i i was driving around in uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in vegas you know just with a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friends and then like on the radio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he had the radio on he just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly switches on and he's like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a dust storming coming um so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please you know please evacuate kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing and i was [ __ ] my pants i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what the [ __ ] is a dust storm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then uh but everyone else there the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> locals just like oh yeah it happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty frequently let's let's just go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a restaurant get something to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so uh so we we go into this restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the dust storm hits and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just yeah just think of like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> typhoon right so it's like just really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> insane winds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't see outside like the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> windows are like like nothing it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all sand it's just like like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a blizzard but instead of white </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like grayish brown it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> survival game yeah but what's more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> terrifying in my opinion than a blizzard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the fact that uh in a dust storm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it can cause static electricity oh so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> basically you have like thunder strikes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at ground level </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because of all the particles rubbing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> together right so every now and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it'll just be like blowing and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll just hear this like boom sound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from outside and i'm like the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening it's like oh that's just the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> electricity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like why are you saying it like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's just my friend like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like saying it so casually yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah so that's really interesting yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> so that entire time i was [ __ ] my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pants while we were in this uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're in this ramen shop because of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> course they were like oh joe's japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's just go to a japanese restaurant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'm here all the way in vegas to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat some japanese sub-par japanese food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all right so we were so basically i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stuck inside a ramen shop called naruto </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are you serious i'm not even fronting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it was called naruto they have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> naruto like uh i mean they did that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah like the walls had like naruto </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and like i thought you could have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been named after the location no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was uh and and the ramen it was very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obvious they tried to replicate the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> naruto ramen as best as they could right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to you know to to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> not that great levels admittedly i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was the most three out of ten ramen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i've ever had so i was like great i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> stuck inside this [ __ ] restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called naruto eating at this poor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> restaurant getting destroyed i don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> think it exists anymore yeah so someone </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> natural phenomenon of what those uh i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saw sun in the uk one time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were like oh i was like what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> holy [ __ ] i've seen fire tornadoes in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> australia what the [ __ ] is a fire truck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> we have it is in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so you have tornadoes yeah and you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bush fires yeah so what happens when a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> tornado enters a bushfire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you basically get this spiraling like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pillar of fire that's it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> awesome to look at from a distance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> these like u.s settlers must have been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so [ __ ] confused </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> when all this [ __ ] was happening they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> were like what the [ __ ] is happening i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty sure that's what the british saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time they found like the swamp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in florida they're like what yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bit humid in here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like australia is just like a real life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> island in one piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it is an island on the ground line at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this point you know because like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> survival instincts you need in this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> island like that that's taking out most </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the [ __ ] pirates in one piece at this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> point imagine being the guy who has to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like write the guide that they send back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to like people are going to come again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like so so by the way you're not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to believe this right you know how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's sun sometimes right yeah it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that all the time all the time and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes i don't know how this happened </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was just by a tornado i don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> what a tornado is we've never seen one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of those yeah this is a tornado </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it says but it's such a weird thing as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well because it's not like uh i i kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of described it like there's a bush fire </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then a tornado comes along and like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eats up the fire it's also like the fire </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> is so strong that it basically creates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an up current that starts to spin and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then it just creates like this pillar of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that just like crashes through this just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sounds really cool to see it just sounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like a [ __ ] anime attack at this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like well like like i was like i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like is there a pokemon battle happening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over there like someone did firespin i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know like it's like two jitsu's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> being combined together in naruto you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stomach after having that narration </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i did i did see actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there recently like the uk or at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> london went through like a pretty bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> storm yeah yeah yeah um which i like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know how bad it was because like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> when i when i see i want to see like uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> really bad it looked really bad because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like when i see but like you know when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you see uk headlines yeah you see like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh uk go through like a bad storm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the strongest wind scene and i'm just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is it like obviously it's going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bad for the uk but like how bad is it on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a global scale there is videos of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> picking up people and throwing them oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> seriously yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because when i saw that headline i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought it was just like the british </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over exaggerating it no dude as you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> usually just like oh my my friend's 2p </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> fell off it's an absolute travesty like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so strong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i saw some videos people get thrown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around i was like oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like like rip if you're trying to open </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that car door man yeah trying to get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because like this okay so like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just shows how unused we are to this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these kind of like weather systems and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weather phenomena right because like we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um we're like me and connor in like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> group chat of like our friends back in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the uk um and sometimes you know they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> still meeting up and they're still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> planning meetups and everything like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that and i saw in this group chat that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they had planned a meet-up or to hang </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out on this day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i remember like right up to like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> last moment people were just like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'll see you guys in an hour i'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see you guys now right we're still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> meeting in an hour and people like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'll see you in an hour and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just see you just see this the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> replies going yeah let's maybe not meet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up today maybe that's not the best idea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like the thing is if this was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the worst storms that uk has gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has gone through like i'm i am also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really used to the idea that no matter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what you can still go out and have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pipe yeah you can still go out and have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a point no matter what yeah the pub has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> been canceled so like that's how i knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that this storm was like the real deal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah if my mates were not going to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pub to meet up because of this storm you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know shit's gone down if the pub isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> closed then that means i can still go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no matter what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is basically that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> oh god yeah that is uh another episode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of uh uk people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> severely unprepared for you know weather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> systems yeah because like i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know when i first met my first like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know british person like from the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exist yeah they exist i was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my god you guys exist but second of all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know they're always like oh yeah we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have nothing going on in the uk like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad weather no like dangerous animals no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing i'm like really like really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i found that hard to believe as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> someone who came from the polar opposite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that yeah from doom just yeah i came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from doom i came from hell basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the underwater </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because it's like do you guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> really not like what is the most like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dangerous thing floods okay yeah i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about to say we got a lot of rivers so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously when it rains a lot it can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flood but yeah depends on what depending </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on where you are in the uk there aren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> floods like what if you're like nowhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> near like the rivers yeah then you don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> occasionally you guys get a lucky yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we've had hurricane scares before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> at least in my lifetime but nothing that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> actually like manifested anything felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a hurricane right yeah it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a bit of strong wind yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's that's pretty much it yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean we don't have a lot to fear in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uk which is why whenever i travel abroad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um whenever i uh sorry i lost my trail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of thought uh whenever i travel aboard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> all aboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever i travel abroad i got it i got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it this time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes it just like surprises me um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about some of the things you have to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> careful of just because in the uk we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't have to be careful of anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know with camping you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be careful about bears or you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starting a forest fire which to me like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starting a forest fire was like so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside my perception of walk of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disasters that could happen just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one person but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you think about it yeah of course it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> makes sense you know you see you look at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> australia being on fire california like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half the year being on fire yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> our country was on fire for nine months </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> straight because of one guy starting a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fire yeah yeah yeah to me like that just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like that's just so outside of my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> perception of what could [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> possibly go wrong of one like one stupid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> person doing like a stupid thing you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know yeah so yeah i mean all the trees </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are like wet in the uk it was very hard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get even i remember when we were camping </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was even hard to get like trees that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weren't too dense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to burn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean you could you could come in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like a [ __ ] flamethrower and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it'll probably be put out by the day the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flamethrower will run out of gas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i've ever seen anywhere like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nature on fire in the uk really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no fire is just not like it's hard to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get started yeah yeah it's very hard to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> get nature fires aren't like a thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we have to be careful about and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah one of the biggest uk hits was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> firestarter so you know that's a bit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ironic isn't it because they they had so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much time while they were making the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fire starter yeah um they yeah part of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yourself make a song about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you do the fire on me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why it's an achievement right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like it's easy to be a fire starter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anywhere else in the world in the uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's a medal i'm a firestar i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like damn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> does he manage that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i want some forest fires like natural </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this that needs to happen sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to clear a lot of the like dead trees </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah so obviously a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> them recently are like not yeah so we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have we have uh controlled bushfires uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in australia that happens like pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> frequently um because we also have uh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know the the details about it but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have this specific uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it breed i don't know i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the word for it is of tree or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sapling uh where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's type of eucalyptus i think where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the the seeds from the tree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put into a fire in order to open up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so to keep the forest alive they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually have to burn these seeds and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically start a bush fire for that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> area of the bush land to grow in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like which is the most like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> backwards thinking that nature has ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> done it's like so imagine if like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dead trees pile up and then it's as hot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as it is in australia yeah it'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> naturally catch up oh yeah we got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> natural bushfires all the [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just because of how hot and powerful </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> australia literally is like the last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dungeon area like even nature is high </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> level in australia like what they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing like randomly just start fighting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally the desert level of time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the breath of the wild </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> it's literally a desert level in breath </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the wild where like if you don't have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> the right equipment you are forever like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gaining damage from this yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think in israel i think it's well i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't remember i might have been one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those generic vox videos where you learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about [ __ ] you didn't know you wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learn about and then you learn about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like okay you're in every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> youtube video no mainly vox videos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube shorts always like that so so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the us for so long was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actively stopping all the fires </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it turned out that a lot of the branches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> needed to just be set ablaze so that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they could get rid of them and then it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could go back in the system you know it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> turns into ash so they had like a build </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up of a lot of dead uh dead trees and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff like that so when the fire did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> start it went like crazy yeah nearly as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> big as it was i mean like yeah we think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i could be wrong on that yeah i mean we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like so many like controlled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bushfires just because we do have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just at least in my area we have a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like wildlife and like nature </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reserves and stuff like that but you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know sometimes unfortunately they're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know some of those fires aren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> controlled 100 of the way and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what causes bushfire scares and straight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up bushfires sometimes so i think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why we have a lot of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because we're trying to maintain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the nature and then sometimes nature's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know what i'ma go ham a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they go ham only controlled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> fire in the uk is from trying to boil </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> your water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> help as an australian what is like your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> biggest fear over there in terms of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nature or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> nature-wise um like what you have to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> careful about the motion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah honestly the people scare me the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's such a video game movie thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's not the animation worry about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> kids it's the people it's the people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> humans are the scariest of them all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the humans were the monsters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can predict a black widow can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> predict a human </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> guns don't kill people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> people kill people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um in terms of wildlife like i'm usually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pretty okay with like insects and like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> snakes and spiders if i know it's not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> going to kill me have you ever had like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> a big scare yourself of like you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> encountered something you're like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this could this [ __ ] could actually oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah many times like i've i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thought the health bar comes on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole part of the screen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah many times like uh i remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i was actually this close to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically dying at one point uh because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i was this close to being bitten by uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bitten by one of the most venomous ants </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> in the world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so we're not only so australia so people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> outside of australia think that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> australia is just like yeah venomous uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spiders and snakes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah we have a lot of uh venomous </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> insects and we have this one ant uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> species called the bulldog ant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> supposedly the most venomous ant in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> world and i almost got bitten by one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when i was like 10 years old right i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like dark souls is like way more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> balanced than australia at least it has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a hitbox you can see so basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so basically like i was i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> camping uh you know that's where most of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the accidents happen you got the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> campfire right that makes sense yeah no </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> thing you mostly have to worry about if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to the beach in australia is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> jellyfish i was going to say the second </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> thing that [ __ ] terrifies me we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> a ton of those jellyfish not toxic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> jellyfish though oh but the ones that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are like extremely painful oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean because like we you're probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seeing a box jellyfish right yes okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like i've never seen that in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waters i've never heard of anyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting stung by that but like that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the one that can kill you yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever people have yeah where it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> puts you in so much pain that you drown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you have zero control over your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> body yeah it basically paralyzes you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately have people like survived uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> people have survived yeah but a lot but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean like it's it's a very uncommon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> way oh sorry it's a very rare way for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anyone to like i think only like maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like two or three people die a year from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it or something so it's like it's very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very rare considering the amount of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people who go into the ocean in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> australia like it's you've got to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really unlucky fish jellyfish just scare </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me yeah but i mean like i've been stung </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> by the other kind of jellyfish that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> way more common is they call blue bottle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> jellyfish and they're not they're not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> toxic or anything like they won't kill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you but it hurts a lot when you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sunburned yeah my friend got stung by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when we were swimming in the in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some shitty ocean yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> okay and and the trick in australia is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have a mate who's been stung by a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blue bottle you you pee on pee on that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> think this is one of those rumors though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just one of my jojo fans all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't think it actually i think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think the actual way to do it is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got to like pour vinegar or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> something on it but it means </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having your mate piss on you feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> relieved yeah it's not it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when you say it out loud it does feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a scene from jojo yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've been stung by a stand the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gordon experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 36 degrees right there dog like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that's warm as [ __ ] this is why this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> isn't a problem in the uk everyone's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> always got a hot furnace ready for the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> tea their bodies are just like get the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> tea thermos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this could make it worse actually oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really depending on how i see what's uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry for peeing on your leg that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember we were swimming and a bunch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of a bunch of the jellyfish is washed up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah oh that's normal yeah i've i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seen that in the uk as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bunch of them washed up and this little </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> ten-year-old didn't know what they were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mm-hmm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i think i was twelve dived into it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like picked one up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well you can you can pick them up by the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> head yeah i know you picked it up by the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's probably immediately started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crying and screaming and then oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah [ __ ] that i remember there was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> loads of them i remember i got really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> freaked out because i was like what the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] is that yeah this is not how they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> were in finding nemo that's what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> i think there was any journey fishing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> weird fish yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that wasn't that jellyfish but what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> fish freak me out so much more than like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> animals do like what is fishing on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> animals </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no fish fish right animals are animals </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah jellyfish isn't an animal i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an animal but [ __ ] like coffee like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] is going on with fish i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> mean it doesn't have a brain injury </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> jellyfish is just god's spunk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that's just what they are like fights </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean like that's the closest way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is the ocean sperm cell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at you know that mr incredible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meme where he's like smiling and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gradually getting like more sound yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> he's like you look at dogs you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes and you get out of like horses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like yes yeah then you get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like rats you're like okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and then you start getting these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> weird fish and you're like what though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like the deep sea fish yeah then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start getting into the real [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird fish the ones like all like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eyes and just old teeth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what the [ __ ] is happening down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there it's like something it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> creatures it is like legit like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fit like what's going on with fish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] like that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what who who's this is an episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of science who's in charge what is up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> with this who's in charge of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> evolution down there it's like out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> control you guys heard about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> immortal jellyfish no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> listening so there is there is a species </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of jellyfish that scientists believe are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like immortal like they cannot they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cannot be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> killed by like time by old age so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously they can still be killed by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> external forces </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever but that's brilliant but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's believed by scientists that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a sense immortal and that scares the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] out of me that's just because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing should be immortal nothing alive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> should be immortal that's just the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> survivor stand from past seasons yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they just have like nowhere yeah that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just a stand right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't die apparently they reckon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that aging is uh like a process like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cells and stuff yeah it's on purpose </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'm not bullshitting right actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there is something called the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immortal jellyfish yeah apparently it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just regresses into like a pollen form </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it comes back again oh yeah so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's literally just like a single cell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like organism kind of deal where it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's just forever just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> re-creating itself basically yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so a car accident just turned back into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a baby and grew back again that's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> benjamin button </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's actually just a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> superpower that's pretty that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cool dude yeah yeah but could you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine though if like humans were able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to somehow like study that [ __ ] enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and be like we're trying i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah and you know being like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right this might actually be like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> key to immortality what's the point of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being immortal if you get to 60 and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like you're useless at 60 and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like what are you gonna do for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another hundred years well that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can regress in age as well because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they're gonna get to like a point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like [ __ ] i can't like i can't </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> another 130 years another 100 years like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you gonna do like just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> catch up with like the rest of game of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thrones yeah that's why like that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i remember uh [ __ ] you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in futurama episodes yeah you know when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have all those like old celebrities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from centuries ago just as heads yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i remember one of my friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh man wouldn't it be cool if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we like humanity got to that point in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> technology i'm like no what are you what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you want that would be horrible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you'd just be sitting on a shelf for the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rest of humanity like the rest of yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time rest of time rest of time just just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> doing what how do you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you how do you have fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just a head in a [ __ ] jar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know perfect beat boxing or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like yeah that's that's all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as a head just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that trick right with the cherry stem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you can tie it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what else you're going to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well there's perfecto jojo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> learn languages i guess for the rest of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> time in every language in the world yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> probably or just or just so now i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about there is a few things you can do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just watch pokemon in your mind yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly the ultimate life hack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> oh what are you doing i'm just watching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the 6 000th of rerun of pokemon yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> mean like i mean like i i guess it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really philosophical question of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you could be immortal would you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be immortal and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i wouldn't want to be a muscle maybe i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't want to die at like say 80 or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90 or whatever but like there's a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where i would like my body to keep up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with what i want to do right okay well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then different question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how old if you could choose how old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> would you want to be when you die </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what to me it depends on how functional </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i am yeah right because like i yeah i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've met 90 years old 90 year olds who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like still in like [ __ ] tip-top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shape yeah yeah yeah um and i've also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> met you know like 60-year-olds who have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> trouble doing things that i would want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to do as well 50s yeah yeah yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> depends on how unlucky you get really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah you know some of my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> friends you know that that some of their </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dads like 55 already getting like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dementia and stuff yeah [ __ ] yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would hate to get that especially if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like my kids are young like i don't want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them to feel like yeah they've got to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> help me out yeah i think i think the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coolest answer was uh like my grandad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently like in his twenties he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like from from his twenties he was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna die at age 80. just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just no cap i'm gonna die at age 80. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and for the longest time i was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> why why would you say that from a young </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> age and he's like because it gives me a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> time limit to do all the things i want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to do before i die right and so it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like self-motivating and and this is how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> much of a chad my granddad was he died </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly at age 80. and he was literally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> he was he was literally like i'm i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good man i'm good to go i'll ask how he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> dies from lung cancer but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> i was gonna say i'm like the dish man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> how did that go down i mean the thing is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it sounds like he did everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he was literally like on his 80th </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> birthday he was like i can go now with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no regrets just like waiting for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the clock to turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's like it's like ready to pour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna pull the plug </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but like i thought i thought that was so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] cool right because like there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that like very common philosophy of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know if you became immortal you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would do nothing because you'd have no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like rush you'd have to drive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> because you can do it whenever you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so yeah i mean that's my reasoning for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> why i wouldn't want to be a model also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i don't know i don't want to see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone around me die </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that should be so funny i mean like if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you live in a society where everyone can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choose how you know when oh so okay so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if we were living in an immortal society </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah society </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we lived in the society </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> then i think we'd just like regress to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the [ __ ] stone age at that point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like no one would want to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anything yeah yeah yeah i mean like for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> personally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i find like the most badass people are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the people who like live till like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> late they're late ages and they like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they seem fit they seem able and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one day they just decide to like their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> body just decides all right peace out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know that's the way i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to go you know i don't want like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i think everyone wants to go like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that yeah but like life is brutal it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i like uh i think it's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tezukosama the the guy who basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> popularized manga he died while drawing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manga in the hospital then and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's so [ __ ] badass the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this man literally till the moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he died was doing what he wanted to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah god's gonna be doing that final ten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pull </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he gets 10 ssrs and he's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> connor's going to be on like jump king </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 20. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the phone the final jump </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no but yeah because like my my like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my grandma right now is uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is still alive and like she's in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> her late 90s right now and i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i introduced her to sydney for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh and i remember i was telling sydney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh you know she's she's in the 90s you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know i think you've definitely told this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story have i told his story i think you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay so yeah uh my grandma like squeezed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> took sydney's hand and squeezed it she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> squeezed it so hard that sydney was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> writhing in pain for like a good hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of how hard she squeezed it um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and yeah that was that was a cliff notes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the story because i think maybe i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have told this on trash too so basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> your grandma's giga chat yeah yeah have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you ever heard the story i think so yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think they seem familiar i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't see sometimes you can't tell if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you told if i've told you this at a bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something on the podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately we talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot unfortunately we do talk a lot i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wrote i saw a recent comment on one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the trash today's episodes being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so impressive how the boys still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> manage to find topics that they've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taught i don't even know like yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't even know i just talk and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes we get called out for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes we don't i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's whatever yeah definitely spoke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about [ __ ] up fish in the ocean i know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that have we no we haven't oh we haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> no i haven't there's so many [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> little fishes the animal that scares you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the most men no chewing um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> martians martians </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think you know like those t lists of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like animals that i could take in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fight yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know why i just think like a a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deer would just [ __ ] me up i mean they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could yeah like more i think i'd have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more chance of like being able to outwit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bear or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like being oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> has taught me anything don't [ __ ] with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bears which are the ones with like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> massive antlers is it dears are they all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dears i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know no maybe not moose but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's some caribou i've i've seen some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of them that are [ __ ] insane i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moose are like [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> insane yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like people imagine moose and they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like oh yeah that's like just a big deer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right i'm like no they're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're like huge </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> insanely huge it's scary even though i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think i there's like a 0.1 percent </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chance that i could </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> live it with a bear encounter yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> i at least think that like a deer i'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have like zero if it wanted to kill me i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like it would just chase what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what what logic are you facing this time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what kind of thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the way it looks at me i don't know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're talking you're talking about like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the deer from princess monarch okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they got to look in their eyes </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> there's like stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what logic are you playing there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely zero logic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just the way it looks so are you saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like you can't take on a male deer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you could take on say like a male </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> elephant </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_07> life let's say i climb a 20-foot tree i </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> talk with me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with the deer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this isn't what bring them like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> tablespoon it's just a deer right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> those would [ __ ] you up this is the mail </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> impaled bro you'll be in the tree like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> tree i'm not not saying they won't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you up but i have regrets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd rather take on that than a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bear yeah as well because when you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you think it's cute right you think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh it's cute and then it [ __ ] stabs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you right a bear you're not getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anywhere near that you're cautious right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's about the position no i'm not going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> anywhere near a thing that has horns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that but they taste good though so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd understand why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so if bears tasted good would you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is one of those things where it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like it's gonna make me look stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this argument but it's just pure like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gut like this is no logic whatsoever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is just my gut feeling so is is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dear like s t for you like s t is scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> s here will [ __ ] you up and you didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expect it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> bear is 80 because i know it i know it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna [ __ ] me up but also it might not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it might get bored it might just leave </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me alone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but what were you getting this idea that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dears are so [ __ ] aggressive yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've i've seen videos man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i've seen videos of bears being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> aggressive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because some dumbass is provoking a deer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like yeah of course they're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get pissed off i don't know you know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just think that uh bears are you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> friendly because my experience with most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deers like even ones like that is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go like [ __ ] in a few again this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is a 50 meter radius </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i am not trying to make any sense this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is all just got no you're not now you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> not making sense i know i know it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't i know this isn't making it why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are we trying to glean some sense out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like tigers are scary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also you know the tiger king seemed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like he had a good hand of it so maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it is like it is he slapped them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with his uh his stick and they let go of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> him so if i just give him a little get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stop that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that was the problem with like all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the prey that you see they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah there was like a story from like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i think brian blesses you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brian blessed he's a very famous british </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he he's this really famous british guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who has like yes the most booming voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this right and apparently he was in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the arctic filming something and a polar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bear came up and i think he either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> punched the polar bear in the face or he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> screamed at the polar bear and it ran </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> away scared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this story so i'd like to think that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> could if it is true that you could scare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a polar bear from shouting at it i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll be all right well i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bucky has taught me that like the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way to beat a bear is to punch it in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nose yeah i heard that you could punch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it in there but probably not the grizzly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bear probably just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah well i mean if you're fast enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean not fascinating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean at that point you're lucky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at that point you're kind of playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gacha with your life you know yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the same thing with sharks right if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you if you punch a shark in the nose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it'll just be like that is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> true i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've tried it i wouldn't try it i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not going to try it but you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like nature's like world's slowest punch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> underwater punch nature's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> giving them a weak point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i punched the shark for massive touches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> where you're gonna punch a deer huh you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can't punch it anyway it's got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> big spiky things right i feel like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like you could like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dodge at the last moment yeah you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like devil back yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> what are you talking about bears are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] fast as [ __ ] when have you seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a bear huh this is the most dumb </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> conversation we've ever had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you're so like if you see a bear like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a grizzly bear you are not running </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> away from that no you can't now run a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bit yeah no but like the best tactic is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can outrun your mates maybe i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can maybe i can shout at it ask it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kindly to stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> okay let's have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why don't we ask survivors of bears </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right what they did to survive the bear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh i like to ask how many bear survivors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> do you know there's got to be a few out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> there are sure yeah because no one talks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about it because everyone sometimes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> deals because they know if they talk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then it's going to come back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> is going to come back for something then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> comes back with his family like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you should be smitten </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like how many horror movies are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there with deers as like the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> monster that's because [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> people are too scared to talk about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dears </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the next like when's the next deer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> coming out in the godzilla trilogy or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> king kong vs king kong and godzilla </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> versus deer they need to tag team the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ultimate monster do you man it can it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can go run super fast launch itself in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with those hooks you know you're done gg </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so would you say the deer is the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> powerful animal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the most powerful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> spiritually if it were to animal like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> battle royale would you pick deer no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no who would you pick for an animal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> battle royal animal kingdom battle royal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm definitely picking polar bear for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sure i feel like you're going for low </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging fruit i feel like there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably something stronger yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm trying to win yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like there's probably better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> animals maybe if you ask tls the tiazu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guy i'm sure boris </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> walrus </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't think so okay okay the only </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> reason i say this is because i i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> literally saw a video where like a polar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bear truck was like [ __ ] starving </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hadn't eaten for a while uh so he was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to hunt and he comes across these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this group of walruses i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the proper word is the herd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and like he literally tried to like try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to take a bite out of any walrus yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and their hides were like so thick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he that like they couldn't he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't grab on and walls just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shook him off and he tried with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> several walruses and like he just failed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so maybe maybe it's walruses that are at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the top of the [ __ ] food chain and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just never thought about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the honey badger that one's like a scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would like a [ __ ] i think the polar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bear would destroy the honey badger i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean human versus honey badger yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the honey badger is probably gonna win </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but like you know because i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to [ __ ] with a honey badger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is a honey badger it's a badger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that eats honey no it's not no it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no yes it is is it primarily honey i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought it was like this yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not like [ __ ] crazy isn't the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whole thing of it with a honey badger is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like its height is so thick that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a bee sting literally can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> penetrate it i don't know why they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that shit's crazy i i remember i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> read something about it shrimp you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mentorship i know [ __ ] manchester </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> united </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah my god like that okay that that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when nature is [ __ ] cool yeah see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fish it's always fish like what's going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like manchester shrimp is like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bucky of the scene why does this fish </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have like a cannon for an arm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on with that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just gonna i'm just gonna throw a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fist and create a sonic boom yeah what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> happened with evolution </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm telling you man evolution in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sea is [ __ ] like i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's going on when is the next state </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like stage above that it's like oh i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> throw a punch and a nuclear fusion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> black hole with my fist yeah i mean if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you use like sliced up a manta strip but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it could possibly like create a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] vacuum that sucks sucks the area </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and sucks his opponents in so that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what bucky should have done instead of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagining a human-sized uh praying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mantis he should have imagined a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> human-sized manta strip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna be the one punch man yeah of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> course why are we talking about this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the one punch man of the sea you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you know what one uh thing that um i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> always </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's like i think this is youtube </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> videos where like people like kind of uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> go to like nature and they like save the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> animals that are like being hunted or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> something yeah yeah by other animals </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay right and then they ask like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> david attenborough questions like do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever feel like you should uh help the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animal that's being hunted and stuff and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's literally nature why would i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] interfere yeah like i i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand why people always make these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos being like today we're gonna save </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fish from being eaten it's like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> to survive as well that's like a seagull </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> what's the what's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> strongest animal you genuinely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wholeheartedly think you could you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be in the fight what it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> define beat in a fight </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like just a fist because like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> animals are going to be like oh there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like like bring it bring into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> submission </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of thing like what are we talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about i don't know like or like run away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like the amount of runs away or like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like or you're like not like it's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fight or a fight to the death yeah for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some reason you're in are we allow tools </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no just your bare face just your bare </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fist and whatever is laying around on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the ground all right i got it uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> realistically realistically dog human </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why are you fighting a doctor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you were human or human yeah he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dog </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> patients </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not that i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no like like a bit like a bit like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not counting humans like a big dog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is probably the max i can go because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even then like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's [ __ ] scary a big dog would beat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you up actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean a big dog i mean like some really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big yeah it could really [ __ ] hurt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could you take on a wolf </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean it'll be hard but i feel like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're fighting for the final year of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> the movie for sure yeah yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> feel like you could take on a wolf not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not a guaranteed win yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like on the edge of what i imagine if i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was fighting for my life is it like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hundred percent like success rate no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like you know but like could i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> possibly get a wolf into a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> chokehold or something go [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] ufc on his ass then maybe maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if i had the right techniques </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all i'm saying human wolf versus wolf in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the octagon i'm just like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> learn some bjj you have some bjj maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like maybe you might have a more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> fighting chance you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> you're dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because i mean how how small do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think a wolf is pretty big do you take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a sheep maybe you're gonna beat up a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sheep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beat up a sheep i mean not that i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to i don't think this sheep would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> even fight no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i think you should just be like just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> take me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's just take me away right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what about you connor what about you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> what what is the absolute max that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would think like okay i could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> survive this catfish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a catfish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't even know i don't even know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't really think about it well yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't think about this either </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe a very you know there's some tiny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> monkeys very small monkey very very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> small monkey maybe yeah they'd probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give me a good [ __ ] fight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah definitely it'd be three rounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at least of course connor says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> course the weaker genomes of some of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weaker ones you know species of monkeys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> could you take on a chimp [ __ ] nerve </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chimps [ __ ] chip what's your murder yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> okay why are birds so [ __ ] sassy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what why why why are they so cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like what do you mean by sassy they just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have attitude like like so many [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've seen like you fly i mean come on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i would be sassy too if i could watch an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally looking down yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like probably but it's like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you like the birds of prey aren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sassy ones it's like the like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> domesticated the small the smaller the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> birds like the parrots right yeah the </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> parrot um like a cockatiel and like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> lorikeets and stuff like that and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god they were both that's again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean that's pretty [ __ ] cool i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah cause like my my parrot used </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> replicate like sounds that we would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> teach him but he would also just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> pick up sounds through osmosis right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i've told this story how much is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> something no you haven't you haven't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> told this oh okay okay so like we used </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to own uh this like uh cockatiel which </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is like do you know what a cockatiel is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yes yeah so it's like a sassy sassy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] yeah yeah sassy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] right but um yeah cause </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're parrots so like they replicate a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of things so like we taught it to uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whistle the adam's family theme song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah right so like every like we'd wake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> up in the morning and it'd just be you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know whistling the animals and things </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like and everyone was like oh that's so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cute but then other times the sassiness </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would [ __ ] pull through on this mofo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he would uh replicate sounds that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> confuse the [ __ ] out of us so he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> perfected uh the sound of the microwave </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not not just like he would replicate the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> buttons like presses perfectly so be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but then like you know when it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> finished and it goes like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it would replicate that perfectly so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> many times where like oh i'd be in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> living room and i would hear that and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would walk into the living uh into the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kitchen thinking that like someone was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there no one's there i'm like oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a [ __ ] ghost and then i realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's my it's my [ __ ] sassy bird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also like it would replicate like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the phone ringing and [ __ ] like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're really smart they're really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really smart and uh it would also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> replicate uh my mom saying good morning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so it'd be like it'd just be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if i ever get another lorikeet i'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm gonna teach you to go yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to see how well i could replicate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh my god anyway i remember there's some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like youtube videos where people like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mix it badly and they put beeps in it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for some reason yeah and when i'm in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> other room and i like the videos playing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and i hear a beep i'm like what's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> happening in my kitchen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i hate people who do use beeps really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loud beeps in their youtube videos yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shouldn't do it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was gonna i was gonna i thought you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were gonna go a different direction with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that conversation because i was gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talk about uh bass boosted monsters inc </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> memes because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> how are you going to [ __ ] transition </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i want to hear how this happens because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're talking about people putting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds in like youtube videos and stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that and i'm just like yeah i get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like on a tangent i still think the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> funniest thing uh one of the funniest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> videos is just people who like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take the bass boosted monster zinc theme </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you [ __ ] love it and throw it into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like someone's sleeping or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like to me that is just pete comedy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know i just wanted to bring it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bring back the monsters think bass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> boosted memes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> literally had nothing to do with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conversation and i was playing your mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is just thinking about bass music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> monster thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i was playing 5d chess trying to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> relate these two things you were playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 5d chess we were playing checkers right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not even the same game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anyway enough about animals what have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys been up to in the past week uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i had i bought a pc and it didn't work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah i saw yeah twitter thread on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that that was pretty sad so what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> happened with that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so i was building it live which was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> more stressful than last time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i think last time because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we did it like three times rip gant who </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> went first joey went to sleep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i went first yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so doing it live was really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> annoying because i was actually reading </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chat when i just shouldn't have read </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chat yeah because chat kept saying yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or no yeah like i'd be like is this the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right thing to do half says yes half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> says no yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well it shouldn't you already know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've built yeah yeah it needs to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the pc master right yeah you've always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've already built a pc live on camera </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i probably could have just done it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i just kept getting confused and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then when i get confused i get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nervous because i'm live and i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what if i do something wrong and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone sees that i did it wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because people are laughing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so so i wasn't about the whole point of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that but i wasn't really worried when it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was my turn doing it live because i'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> already seen two people build it so it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was really easy all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> um yeah last time she'd been more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stressful because it was a speed run as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well yeah yeah and it was okay it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah i still [ __ ] some things up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all right the m.2 i had trouble with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> again yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that m.2 man yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i built this whole thing i spent five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hours doing it because i [ __ ] up and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was wasting a lot of time and doing a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> bunch of other stuff and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> preoccupied so i finally built it to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five hours and it didn't turn on damn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did you find out why oh yeah so it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> working now i have it so uh the next day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i you know i gave up it was like 1am </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i tried to boot it and it wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> working and um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm so i i was like all right fine i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just uh i'll give it a go tomorrow i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a you know i have a clear head i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> try all the problems i basically took it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all apart and rebuilt it all again going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very carefully through it all and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same error kept happening and i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i even took like the cpu out put it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all back in make sure i did all that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right i just like could not figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out what's happening cause it wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go to the boot screen it was just black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> screen and everything everything was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whizzing and you know glowing and all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that oh my god damn it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so then uh i'm talking to gigabyte and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm like hey </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what's happening why isn't it working </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> everything is working why what what what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> is happening yeah and so essentially </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because i got a new </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh new specification it was a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> motherboard that is a ddr5 ram </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> motherboard right now to those who don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know anything about pcs uh basically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> every now and then they they upgrade it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they're like hey why don't we just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> change the connectivity to [ __ ] with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone and uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it does make it faster as well but they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> change the specifications you have to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> buy specific things yeah now this ram </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> slot that was called ddr5 i was like oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay i'll go on amazon and buy ddr5 ram </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well apparently that's not what you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> allowed to do with ddr5 because it's new </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh motherboards have a set list of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> specific ddr5 right that works with it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> so not all ram so previously i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ddr4 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like all ram basically worked with all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ddr4 i think yeah right i've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mostly nearly all of it it was like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd have to try real hard not to do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so yeah so then i was like oh okay is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that the issue it must be so i ordered </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this new ram plugged it in worked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> perfectly right so i wasted like two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> days i was like a whole extra day trying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to fix this thing for no reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah that's the thing about building pcs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sucks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to me instead of building another one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah to me i feel like to me the hardest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> to me the hardest part is actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> selecting the parts right because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> building a pc like we said you know it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's frustrating but you can like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can get through it it's like lego i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> used pc part picker as well did you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> actually check for compatibility issues </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's all good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's all good go ahead go ahead you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> got debated </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> damn yeah i mean it's it's it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> things like that that scare me because i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember the first pc i built um the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> biggest thing that went wrong was that i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> had bought a motherboard that was not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> compatible with the cpu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um because i had bought a i bought like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> an intel cpu so i was just like okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this me being a pc building virgin i was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i got i bought the motherboard i saw it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was intel compatible yeah not knowing at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the time that there are different types </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of cpus and different types of chips oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that happened to me as well yeah i had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> uh the motherboard as well the cooler </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> doesn't fit but i just kind of shoved it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> in place and now it's working </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that's scary </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> it's working it's working was was this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first pc you built in japan or just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first one ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> third </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> in japan oh okay yeah i've built four </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pcs in my life how did you 20 mine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh fan five </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and you still somehow found a way to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] it up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> again i went to pc part picker yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it said it was okay so i had faith in pc </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> part picker because in the previous four </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> times i've never had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh an issue </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but what happened was is that the cooler </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they sent me was one that was a bit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> older </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> so it didn't include the like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> adapter bracket to mount the cpu but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this thing had like sliders so i kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slid them in the middle which they would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'd you could tell that things didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to be and then i screwed it on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right it works it all feels good it'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> feel secure did you call chris </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't i didn't i could have done it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone's like called chris i'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what so he can tell me how his </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mcdonald's tastes </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_01> yesterday and he was just eating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i saw that and i was like chris like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is not what i normally eat for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breakfast and i was like what a lie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry chris yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speaking of breakfast um so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as you guys as you guys know like i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been on like a little bit of a diet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recently you know because i gained a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of weight when i went back to england </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um i wouldn't exactly say recently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you've been on a diet for a while now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because here's what happens right i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go on a diet for like a month have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a week holiday either with the boys with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sydney pig out a bit gain on getting a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bit more weight so i'm still like i go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back to the diet after i'm back it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a healthy lifestyle i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> think it's a diet i think you should eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any help that's not a diet i mean i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i am eating healthy but i am definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taking in less calories than i it would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take to maintain weight so i'm not like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm not like this isn't a speed run but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a it's it's like a slow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lose weight gain a little bit back it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a slow run yeah yeah it's a slow run </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a slow run um and yeah the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is uh when i went back to england </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally in [ __ ] september or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh i gained a [ __ ] ton of weight because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i ate like [ __ ] and i drank every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think like it was the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i could physically feel my body had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gained weight so much that i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i saw like a few comments of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the before and after like trash taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recordings after i came back trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed recording i think you can see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i definitely i definitely did i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't say like overweight or anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> closer but you could definitely see i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did gain a little bit of weight so i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been like working to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since that one holiday working to uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working to lose that weight and now that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm taking in lower calories every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm doing things that i wouldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> normally do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like uh having breakfast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because normally i just normally what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you a functioning member of society </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i know right i know right i never eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> breakfast getting on his high horse i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eat breakfast yeah so because like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know because i'm taking less calories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've been getting hungry in the mornings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so i'm like oh okay maybe maybe it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time to start being a normal person uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like everyone else in society and start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having breakfast like people like like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people like to talk about so have you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been enjoying it so yeah so because that </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> mean it's not so much i'm enjoying it so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much as i'm eating because my body </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> craves something inside my stomach </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because uh that's usually what hungary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is yeah that is that is what hunger is i </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> normal yeah so like me and sydney have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> been starting to eat like cereal and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember like as i've like added cereal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to my diet if you've been following my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> twitter you'd know what i'm about to say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i remember like having i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like eating the cereal one day and i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm about to have a food take and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brace yourselves brace yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brace yourself i think i'm about to have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an opinion guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and i realized i think cereal is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better without milk oh god he said it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh he said it and i'm i'm 50 50. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i like it with and without and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember i remember i remember just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eating one day and i just said it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> casually to sydney uh and she looked at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me like i just murdered someone she just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dropped the spirit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she dropped the spoon in the milk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is that really that bad of a take </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean apparently it is um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know weetabix in the uk as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> kid i usually just eat those dry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think because i can understand that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because when you put that in milk it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just turns into wet cardboard yeah well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like i think it's better without milk i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's i think that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> anxious it's my mood you know some days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i want because you know it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> challenge having to eat cereal without </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> milk it is it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like you're eating you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating scooby snacks like your dental </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> workout is insane but like i i hate it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> when you pour the milk in okay and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the timer starts because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just pour less milk i just put less than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i need how much milk are you putting in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm putting in the normal amount of milk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's clearly you're not you're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's getting wet oh it's getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> soggy i hate soggy soup you should put a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> little bit in and then mix it like force </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it through the milk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but i also think that waters it down as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well you're having like cinnamon crunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something and then you i want the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cinnamon on the crunch i want the crunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the cinnamon together but like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put the milk in i wouldn't put any more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> milk water down wouldn't putting more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> milk water in there no that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i'm saying i don't want any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> milk in there because i like the taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of cereal as it is but if you just put a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit of milk just to wet it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just a wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it like brings out the flavor i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally put like the bare minimum milk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if i do and then i just keep like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rinsing it through the milk yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> exactly what i do so that by the time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you finish it you only have like a tiny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> pool of milk do you think it tastes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better with the milk in it though yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> just because most of the time when it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a no milk i'm like tired by the end of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not that i really eat a lot of cereal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> anymore but yeah every time i do feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like a cereal like bottle i just yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's milk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is is cereal that good for you i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like cereal is like you don't need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it that much well it depends on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> cereal yeah it depends on the cereal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like you know a bowl of fruit loops </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> isn't going to be like breakfast is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pretty good right i like bran flakes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but then i bought this bran flakes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan and it had like fruit in it and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like oh okay that sounds nice it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got dried fruit yeah i like that and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then i look at the back of the package </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like a normal serving contains 50 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grams of sugar what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what are they putting in this this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i think that's why i stopped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating cereal not just because like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started to not get hungry in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> mornings i was like so bad for you but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah a lot of it is depending on the ceo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it depends on the cereal that you buy i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean yeah i'm sure you know if you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eating like a bowl of wheat wheat picks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right then like yeah obviously that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> got a lot of you know health benefits </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but also i don't want to start my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> morning with wet cardboard in my mouth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i just don't want to start a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> morning like that i'm sorry maybe you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just hate wheat to mix jokes i do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i do i [ __ ] hate it i feel like maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's just no saving like even like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with milk or without milk it just tastes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like [ __ ] to you i'm going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so non-australian when i say this i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] hate weepics it's it's like and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know people are like yeah just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can just like add sugar or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yogurt or like you know other things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into it i'm like well then that kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> takes away from the health benefits give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> me the yogurt just yeah just yeah i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just eat a top of yogurt that's fine see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like for me like cereal has always been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even even now as i see it i've always </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> felt that it feels like a snack right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because to me like to me people like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people have told me that they can't get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> full </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> having cereal without milk and i'm just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like well to me it's like i'm not even </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that hungry and breakfast you know to me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like cereal is just like a quick snack </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before we get to lunch yeah that's your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chat in my in my lifetime i think i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> eaten more cereal past 1 a.m than i </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> like that opens a lot of possibilities </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> snacking options unfortunately i don't </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> stopped eating cereal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i show up to toast when i was a kid yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> after halfway through school i must have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> decided that i prefer toast so i eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four pieces of toast i think i had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> very brief period from cereal to toast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it just very quickly went from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> toast to nothing but i feel like toast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and cereal in like the same category of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not very good nutritional value but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not the worst thing in the world yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's not bad but it's also not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great actually you know the moment i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> actually know the moment i switched from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> toast to no breakfast was when i started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having coffees in the morning yeah no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tea for me too yeah like just having a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> piece of toast with a hot drink you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't beat it not even that for me it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like just replace the toast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a cup of coffee wait what wait wait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what like from like like i mean i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do that now yeah i do that now as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like from like i'd say for me maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 17 18. i was just like yep coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's it that's all i need i would eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> toast in japan but the bread sucks and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the other place you get good bread from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like bakeries and they're stupidly </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> my own bread before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a bakery near me that i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the loaf of bread is uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> six bucks i think how being half half a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> standard size </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah okay half a standard size i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> sure it's great i'm sure it's great i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just don't want to pay six bucks for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half half my life i've had yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like mine i have to cut it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me yeah like for six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bucks i'm not [ __ ] cutting that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's ridiculous i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought that as well but then at my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> previous place we lived right next to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this like really high-end bakery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like a full loaf like like this big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like nine bucks or something which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is like [ __ ] audacious still still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> expensive but then and i thought it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> just like a scam being like oh jack just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is just japanese people not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> knowing good bread but then when i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bought it and i had it and you know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to slice it myself god forbid i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to slice it myself and uh yeah i made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> toast with it i'm like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can see why this is nine bucks no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was amazing it was very good but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was not no no i wouldn't pay nine bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for that outside of japan is what i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why why would you pay for inside japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because every other [ __ ] brand of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan sucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like look don't get me wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm not [ __ ] buying this every day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for me this is like this loaf of bread i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would this nine dollar life of bread i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would buy was like maybe like once every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like couple of months how good was that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like in terms of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bread in general this nine this nine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dollar bread compared to like it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] good like it was better than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like any like supermarket bread i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buy in like australia or like anywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of japan so it was like i've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same bread because i bought it it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it was good it was really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> good like i was like okay this actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tastes like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> how does it compare to like say the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bread in europe you know i think the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> bread that i had in france and germany </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was better well yeah oh no obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm asking how much better was it than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this top-tier bread top-tier nine-dollar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread that we have brought in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> marginally it got to that taste where it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was good like it was very good yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right but then that the one in germany </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or france will cost like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one euro fifty yeah obviously yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not i mean you know opposite opposite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> opposite with rice right if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having rice in europe then obviously the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one in japan is going to taste better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because you know in the uk it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like what were pound for warburtons is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it warburton's the toast bread i love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that yeah it is very good bread </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> although i would not and even in the uk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right when you buy animals when you buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the loaf bread at the supermarket the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one that isn't cut yeah you can be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> can you can you can you cut it for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you can buy uncut bread at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> supermarket yeah we have baker we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bakeries in the you know we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bakeries in the supermarket do you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what a bakery is there's a bakery right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then when you get your your pastries </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wherever they all sell loaves of bread </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pastries i've never seen a loaf of bread </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they have it and if you want the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> loaf of bread uncut you can who does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that who asks for that a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do because a lot of people like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if they're making their own stuff then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not not a big deal that they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cutting because they want it because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> moment you cut it the time is ticking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's already going bad right yeah that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> why you don't want to cut the whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread then put it back in because then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those slices that might have tasted a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bit fresher 2-3 days are gonna be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> rock-solid did you never put like your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bread in the freezer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what no because that's the way to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bread long-lasting that's what we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> used to in australia i'm sure a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's to preserve exactly it's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> british it's 20 000 degrees it's to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the bread last longer that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> putting ice in beer you know like like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you just don't do and like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gotta understand like the loaf of bread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the uk and in europe it's bought on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the day intended to all be used on that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day oh okay it's not supposed to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously you can have it a day yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not a big deal but but we don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know freeze the bed because because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're strange because the australian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lives are bred there's like 20 [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slices right so even a family can't go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through it in like a day how big is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bread like this just buy a smaller like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> plus a loaf of bread like this yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's like regular like this big or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 20 slices in it so obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah does it taste as good i want an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> image of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly i need an image of australian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread no yeah so what you i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> believe that it's like the bigfoot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bread this can't be real yeah so like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know just to make the bread last a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> little bit longer because you don't want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to have [ __ ] loafs of bread every day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right especially if you're living in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like my household which was kind of half </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rice half bread </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like this yeah i'm not even the bread </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> guys like the size of the uk one but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they're way thinner older </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but like anyway so like yeah to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> make the bread last longer uh we'd put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know we would use the slices we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> needed to use on the day we buy it and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then we immediately go into the freezer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it'll last like an extra two or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three weeks and then you just and if you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want it if you want a slice of bread you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> grab it you know obviously it's frozen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's been in the freezer if you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> throw it into the toaster </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> instantly defrosted tastes like i'm not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> even the bread guy and i would never put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> myself down to such savagery as [ __ ] as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pudding as putting uh bread in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> freezer i'm sorry you higher privileged </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people could buy bread whenever you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted my family was saving money all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> your family had a financial advisor joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> what are you talking about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and that financial advisor was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> freeze your brand you got to change some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things around here you want it you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you want that new apartment you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better freeze your goddamn bread boy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the asian mentality yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put everything to put everything in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> freezer last longer save money yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly no i think this is [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is just your excuses for living like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> savages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we're australian yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it was something like oh we don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want the spiders to get it okay well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that too no no because you would get a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread bin yeah no because the bread bin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> would be [ __ ] annihilated by the ants </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> what yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we're in australia this you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> can't escape from the wildlife </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you leave the door open for one second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too long your house is [ __ ] overridden </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by ants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the one thing that makes me not proud uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be thai is one thing that they do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i just said it they they put ice in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their beer that's disgusting and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i i see the logic because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously it's like 30 35 degree weather </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beer's gonna get warm uh beer's gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get warm a lot faster but even me even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me i'm just like no no ice my beer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please no we're not we're not we're not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to go is that like an option you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> can get at any restaurant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um they normally was that like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> backyard thing no no by default okay by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> default in thailand in a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if it's open air right um you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> order a beer they uh they take a cartel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they say they give you the beer and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give you a glass and they put ice in it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they pour the beer in the glass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> full of ice and you have to specifically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ask in a lot of places for them not to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do that right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um we're just trying to hide the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah is there anything worse than </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watered down thai beer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> what a nightmare i mean i mean you see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you do that with a chang beer and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like this beer was already watered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down and uh you're watering it down even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> more beer flavoured water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry sorry germans watching this yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the germans had a heart attack listening </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm not doing that i'm not saying you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> should i was just saying that's what we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did and uh i know i thought it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is it is it like do you have to like put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like eggs in the fridge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i can't i can't i can't remember where i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heard it from where like if you have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put like some things in the fridge or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some things are fine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and how it's cleaned right i believe in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> some places in europe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh they recommend you not to fridge the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eggs can you google this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if i recall correctly i think we didn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> keep our eggs in the fridge yes growing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up yeah don't think we did i don't think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> we did either in japan you're supposed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to keep the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eggs in the fridge or i don't think yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to oh yeah you have to keep it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the fridge european countries say you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> do not yeah that's right that's right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really that's right i don't we had it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a cupboard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really yeah well that's weird and in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> america i think they put it in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fridge i don't know about japan i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know as someone who's was just born of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of you know every time i went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shopping with my mom and we'd buy a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment we should like open the front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> door she'd be like eggs in the fridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> now quickly they're gonna go bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> apparently it's illegal to wash eggs in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> europe so yeah like i've got like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff illegal so you're putting the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fridge it's actually gonna grow back to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you what the egg police are gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] rock up to my door be like um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> i think it means for like transporting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it and stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah we don't yeah we kill them in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> cupboard i remember that yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread you've never put in the fridge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eggs we've never put in the fridge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> potatoes i don't think we've got that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> potatoes were in the pantry yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i think if you put in the fridge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it grows sprouts right i don't know or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something like that i don't know i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i know potatoes you're not supposed to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put in the fridge and onions yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> think cause i feel like rules different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with every different country i go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because in thailand it's just like 90 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> percent of everything goes in the fridge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because it's so much [ __ ] hotter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there yeah yeah it's hot it goes yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah hot and humid is like not the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> best temperature and conditions for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bacteria right so yeah yeah exactly well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like other things you shouldn't like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like chocolate you're not supposed to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put in the fridge i know i like putting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> chocolate in the fridge wait why do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why i think it's because like if you put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> chocolate in the fridge then it turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> white and that just means that like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gone bad what i've never seen i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> chocolate in the fridge this sounds like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some [ __ ] i i love my chocolate it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> hot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> into it yeah white stuff is not that the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chocolate it's just some other stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what what is that some other stuff i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> worried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know like i i i always heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i always heard you shouldn't put </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> chocolate in the fridge for too long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like you could you can't let it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sit in the fridge i don't know maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's either sugar or fat but it's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the chocolate oh yeah okay yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely prefer my chocolate in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fridge okay there's there's two like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> states of chocolate that are like my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite one is just like in the fridge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's hard you get a nice nice crunchy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bite out of it and the second stage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like like cheaper chocolate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like when it's perfectly room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> temperature but not melted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if if like when you put in your mouth it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> easily melts yeah yeah you put it in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> your mouth and it doesn't like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't melt but it just like dissolves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in your mouth right that's like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like my second state of chocolate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you don't like that no it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it gets all over your gums you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't even need to chew at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point you just put it you just let it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> melt and it just like disintegrates i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't want it to do that's like a meat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it's cold you can like chew into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it like snaps apart and breaks into nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chocolate bites i like that i don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it i don't like that too much because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've had some instances where i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's going to break first the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chocolate or my teeth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't want to find yeah there are some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolates are like way too hard for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah there are some like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> caramel bars i've never put in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fridge oh my gosh it's hard if you put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> hard caramel in the fridge like goodbye </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just literally jawbreaking you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just eating rocks at that point yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what about ice cream do you like do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you like your ice cream like hard or </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> okay yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that's an ice block your ice cream hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or soft </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> well you've had like feasts right where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's like an ice cream one you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know if he's wears like a like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chocolate in the middle and it's like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ice cream around it oh you mean like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's more of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not so much ice cream though it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more of like a ice cream bar i'd say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's more of a it's got like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> layer around it yeah because i know a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of people they cannot take like they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of cannot chew on like cold things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> or like really cool things yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> at all i can't yeah can you not no i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i i love it too much where if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i start chewing on ice yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always hear you're like you'll be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talking to someone you're here like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> just looking it's gone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's gone it's gone god's not even </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> looking at you just staring off to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> distance like doing it crunching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i love crunching on ice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the best texture i love it i don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know why i just it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not good for my teeth at all i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> been told by my dentist and pretty much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone around me to like not do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like there will be times where i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i i literally have to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> consciously not put ices in my drinks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now because i do it so much that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's advised me to not do it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the real reason why you don't put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> ice in your beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't wanna chill on this ice man [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the beer have you been in a social </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> situation or you like drinking your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> drink and then you're like all right i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gonna i'm gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> take this ice i'm gonna put it in my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mouth yeah but the cube's a little too </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> big </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and your mouth's really cold but it's in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> your mouth right and it's in there it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in one of your cheeks if your thing is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> freezing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you have that moment where you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if i i'm you're talking to someone you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't look like a weirdo you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah if i bite into this it's gonna look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird but if i swallow this i might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> choke and look weird so what do i do i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to reply in 10 seconds and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stop speaking do i spit the ice back in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the drink and look like a [ __ ] weirdo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if i if i go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so you were safe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have you been in that situation yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many times and i'm like i'm like my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go-to option is normally like just pray </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can swallow this without dying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just pray really yeah my my option is to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just start crunching on that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean that's the least weird one yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that is the least weird one i've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had an issue because i'm like constantly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crunching anyway i can't crunch it i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always definitely worried that they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just going to think i'm a [ __ ] weirdo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i spit it back in but yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because if you spit it back in they'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like what the [ __ ] yeah spitting it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah spitting it back in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the worst but my teeth can't bite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into it but i also don't want to be that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> guy who's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so i've been in a situation before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> keep throwing an idea where i'm like all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right boys here we go this might be it i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> might be dead how many ice cubes have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you swallowed in your life like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uncountable uncountable over 10. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah that's a lot like normally i would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> just try and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come up with a pb would kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of try and move it around to get it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a swallowable size all right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> as fast as you can or maybe just get it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so that it doesn't have harsh edges </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wait you've swallowed ice cubes with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hard edges yeah like where they're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> full cue </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no [ __ ] way no [ __ ] way yeah i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would not i would be so terrified </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normally the technique but the problem </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that this is where the technique </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fails is that i'm normally doing this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after i've drank it so now i can't use </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> water to assist it flowing when i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> swallow right so i have to swallow a dry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ice cube yeah i was saying that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like you just like take a swig of water </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or something that will like you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that would like help melt it a bit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i just swallow it and uh yeah one time i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think i had a really big scare one time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it got stuck </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but i remember i had to play it cool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i was like i don't want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make them do a heimlich maneuver on me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i would just kind of keep like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keep trying to swallow it before i take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a breath and then eventually it went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down and oh my god my esophagus was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much [ __ ] pain yeah and by the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> never risk your life for a bit of social </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh awkwardness just i should have just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spat it out but yeah it was it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> terrifying just chewing it like a like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> could feel it because it was so big i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> could feel it going down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then getting stuck a little bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes yeah and then waiting and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously it was because obviously my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> body's really warm yeah so it would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> slowly like dissolve you just gave your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> esophagus like freeze burn what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] hurt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so much yeah no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> don't do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh the lengths that a british person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will go to not be awkward in their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> social circle just spit it out at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> point just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just spit it out you know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i was playing like the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> important you know you know i will say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i didn't love chewing on ice so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would probably do the same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i would rather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> potentially risk having a choking uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> incident as opposed to having 10 seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> of social awkward interaction yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why really yeah yeah that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> british in me we just can't we can't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it i don't know man like just like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna be like yeah it's going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] weird you know like speeding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> your ice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> drink or whatever but like it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know how many situations can you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think of where you've saved in to dinner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with some other person right what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> first date right first date with someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah first day for example right if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're on the first date with someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right how many times have you gone to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant with say another a lady right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she's gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway yeah and then that at that point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your head's like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> wait wait i thought it would probably be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when is winning spitting ice back in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your glass the game changer i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna lie it's one of probably the least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> attractive things you can do it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very unattractive don't you think so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no no no no i think something that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> less attractive is you choking on an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> iceberg </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've actually been in the situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before actually not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i haven't swallowed it i've just i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just remembered right on a date you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they want to know that you swallow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they didn't even notice it they didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even know that you just swallowed an ice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> my chest is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> no it's it's it's the tissue technique </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's the tissue technique no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not for a big ice cube they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to see your tissue on the table </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't put it back on the table you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go for the tissue you pretend you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just wiping your mouth or whatever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just like just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you've got to be subtle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because now they're going to think oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy just choked out a massive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> loogie in front of me this is this ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> this this ice cube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> when you when you like exude another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exude when you take out an ice cube out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of your mouth you don't go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no no no god this was this was like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe a what the how big of the ice cube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> we saw this is like a four four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> centimeter cubed a four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four by four by four by four centimeters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's say let's say that's a big [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> ice cube dude yeah that's what i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about okay okay no no if it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that size i never take the risk of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> putting it in my mouth yeah i'm not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> putting in my mouth i was dumb i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know why i did it because like at that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> point right at that point um you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably would have hardly even drank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your drink right because huh i'm the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> speed let's see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like gone like it's let's say it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a banging cocktail yeah like it's an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute winner yeah i love the cocktail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much or maybe you know uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i'm like i want to order a bunch more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want to try for more so i drink it all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the ice cubes are still fully formed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like at that point like the ice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cube just doesn't feel nice like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you can feel the edges on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ice cube it doesn't it doesn't feel nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in your mouth i thought i thought when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you say when you swallow ice cubes i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought you were talking about like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know when you buy like a drink like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mcdonald's or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you swallowing whiskey rocks no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like a i can't watch what i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're literally swallowing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whiskey like it was like a full-on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> formed ice cube like it was a nice ice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cube that's why i wanted to put it in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mouth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> i was i i remember i was like yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like 19. i was you know thinking i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> was fancy it probably i don't know what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i remember the exact scenario i remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> this specific scenario the reason why i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> committed to potentially dying to avoid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> social awkwardness it was because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> uh it was a first date and i was very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nervous and she was very attractive okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i really wanted this to go well and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were like i'm gonna eat this ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and so for some reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the 19 year old like was tapping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into like the fit 15 12 year old to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that ice cube looks real good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know sometimes you see an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ice cube and you just put it in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mouth because you're because you're dumb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're a kid and you you want to of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> course i now would i know i have no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> desire it really depends okay it really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> depends as someone who has eaten a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of [ __ ] ice cubes in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as as the ice cube connoisseur here like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> there's so many different factors right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because sometimes sometimes it's big but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like for some reason it's like hollow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> inside right so you can take a good you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> could shut it off sometimes it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like completely solid it's just like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> solid block of solid block of ice and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there is no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like there is no biting down on that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> unless it's at least a little bit melted </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah that's all and at that point it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to take at least like one or two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> minutes irregardless of the size which </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> [Applause] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all right switch to space to grinding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technique </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember it was quite a hefty boy it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was it was a weighty boy hence why again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wanted to put it in my mouth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks like i want all the trash they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> said it's taken out of context it looked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> too good not to like to allow it to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> away so i had of course yeah so for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the opposite for me if it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfectly the edges are like perfectly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rounded that's that's that's the that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> peak ice that's peak ice to put in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mouth that is peak ice to put in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mouth because it all you know you're on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the throttle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the giant balls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> no joke every time i get like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recommended a video of like one of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> waiters like shaving ice yeah it's what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the most satisfying yeah in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> life whole yeah i need to say i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to put it in my mouth um because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't want to die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah i yeah i've learned my lesson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with that it was also like clear ice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> superior ice superiorized to like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] frosted ice that you get where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like clear outside and frosted in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the middle that's that's trashed here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this is just like level one bartending </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no i mean just like i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to chew on it as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah sorry i'm just this this is like my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] five-year-old this is live now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like my favorite crayons taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like level of conversation it's like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the the maroon one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i like cherry red because it's got the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> word cherry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you prefer do you prefer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cube dice or how do you feel about uh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't give a [ __ ] no no no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i know a lot of people who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] hate crushed ice oh yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> actually yeah i do hate crushes i really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like crush i like crushed eyes yeah why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did you it's like a slushie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get like okay so you everyone knows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my soda take right where i i like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just the wrong one yeah i just i like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where you know you take a little bit of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fizz out and like to me like crushed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ice has more of a surface area to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just like to just like make soda like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the perfect the perfect texture and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> perfect flavor because if you drink it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> without a straw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right yeah well it's it's great because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> if you drink it with without a straw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you get a lot of crushed ice that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can chew on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's perfect you get the best of both </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worlds this is like this is like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah i don't mind they bring extra </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> extra colors in the crown package </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> to eat yeah yeah this is i i don't i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> don't want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste the ice [ __ ] slush in my mouth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i want to taste the drink being cold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is why when we go to denny's in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> japan i hate their [ __ ] ice machines </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's the nice is always the the shitty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the shittiest like shaved ice yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you drink it and you just get a mouthful </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of shaved ice and you got to do that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> technique where you're like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> putting it in my mouth oh my god </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> i like it when it's like at the bottom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the glass and then you do this and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then just oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh i mean you gotta like drink it you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know you go i mean it depends because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have you you've hung out with me so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've seen how much you've done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i've seen how much shaved ice i put into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there minimum yeah the minimum amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shaved ice i put into a cup if i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the choice is half the cup yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the minimum for me this is why when gang </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes to the movie theater he's like wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look how much value i'm getting i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm drawing four drinks today it's like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> with advice this man buys chips and goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me like to me the saddest sight i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've ever seen in my life right is when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to like a shaved ice machine and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people put like a bit in like like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a tiny bit like five percent of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] cup i do like one percent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then most of the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you yeah and then you fill up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the soda right i'd rather people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put no in because you fill up this with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a soda the saddest [ __ ] sight it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just seeing like one or two bits of ice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like floating around in the soda </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that that's doing nothing it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally doing nothing why would you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put ice in if it's if that's all you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually gonna put in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm not living in a cap i've never given </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> probably get a [ __ ] melt </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm gonna predict god's next take he </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> they will serve it to you in a plastic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bag yeah is that southeastern is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes yes </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> i don't know why it is right but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember the first time like that's as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> weird as bag i remember the first time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i remember i thought this was a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normal thing right because when i was a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kid i'd go to like a thailand every year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and on an especially hot day you'd you'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go to a stand you'd order a soft drink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and what happens is uh they will have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> glass bottle and then they will yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like like that like that like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so what happens is they they will have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> glass bottle or whatever soda you order </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll uncap it and then they'll take a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> plastic bag out just like put in that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] ton of ice in the bag and just pour </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the soda into the bag and give it to you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't sound that bad actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's actually kind of cool like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comically large straw yeah they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> give you a straw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they give you like a twirly straw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so like what happens like let's say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like well [ __ ] you know this is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of soda like how much you're talking </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> halfway through the can you're like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sheesh i wanna just put it down for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> second you can't put it down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hold on let me hang out my dreams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like how do i put it yeah so a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurants will have these little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little hangers on like on like the table </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or something that's actually kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's true i completely forgot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about that they got they got the hooks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well okay question then questions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because we were talking about chewing on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ice yeah how the [ __ ] do you chew the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ice from a plastic oh he shovels it with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> his hands you just like grab it with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you can't like you can't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do this right so when you're after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you've done drinking so you take the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plastic you can actually just take one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by one and just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and they're like yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> or you take you or you take the straw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just like you scoop a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these like brand new plastic bags or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these like reuse from the guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> shopping you can be combined like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know like grocery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can be oh should you get the aldi bag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bro i'm using lidl bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i've never really thought about that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until yeah i want to know like how clean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is yeah yeah i'd be very concerned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if he just whips out like some crushed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one from somewhere i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a part of southeast asian culture that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't normally talk about i realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a it's a good drink yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's got i i like surely i i know this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is complete nostalgia talking but i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way though oh yeah the amount of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plastic in a bag is enough to make like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one cup right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you mean like surely you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make a cup from one bag it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinner it's like thinner right yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plastic bags are quite what else now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what i want to know is why do they not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just give you the bottle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah why not you on the ice why do they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have to grab the bottle and empty it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> into a bag why can't they just give you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the bottle i believe because they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recycle the bottles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay they send them back off i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> believe that's that's what's happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's you can get a lot of drinks in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> south asia they're kind of like a tub so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they yeah they scoop it out but surely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like the plastic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the plastic used on all those plastic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bags you could just convert into one cup </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a lot of plastic in one plastic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bag yeah as the turtles well-known yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh no like like i don't think i think i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't think a lot of southeast asian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> countries at the moment uh have much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> awareness about plastic and trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reduce the amount of plastic i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> uh i remember i'm just genuinely curious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like yeah yeah why it was i decided i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just genuinely think that that's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how it's been like some dude was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just one day i was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what if we put it down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know where the plastic bag is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that should be hilarious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i could be showing my ignorance with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that but i'm just like surely there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm sure there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with our cups and stuff we line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starbucks cups like waxing maybe they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just i don't know maybe they just don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> give a [ __ ] it's just like i just want i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just want my drink i don't care what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's in i guess i mean i would be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] well well maybe you know maybe they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they are thinking in a recycling manner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like after they finish the drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll be like all right off to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> supermarket just like what fold it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> inside out yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> all right brand new there we go i put my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> groceries so like all right so you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> a car right yeah the cup holders was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> useless </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or just like we don't use okay so yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just hanging it up on like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know the uh what's what's the thing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you uh bro god forbid you you get a bump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in that car you go this is coke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you just go over like a patchy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're going up the mountain road </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh jesus christ well now what's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> worst is like what if you're you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just walking along and then you happen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like nick onto something and then the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a tear in the back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're in your pockets you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> spilling it yeah then you're just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you've got a shotgun that that has </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> happened before you just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i think we got it right a few thousand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> years ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think we got it right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cops were invented for a reason i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cup was pretty damn good you know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't want to sound like an [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not trying to like be like your culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not saying it's the next best thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off the sliced bread or anything but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's you know it's pretty good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty sure the cup came before the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wheel like that was we had a really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> nice the cylindrical uh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cylindrical can right that was the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> invention right i've see i've seen that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube video i think everyone's saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i've seen that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 30 million views </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a pretty neat invention actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's uh the pressure is designed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we get it you watch youtube yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speaking of youtube um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> speaking of youtube youtube i've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching a few more youtube shorts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recently even though like like i know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like every time i go on like a youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shorts binge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like it's like bad for my health </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like yeah there's it's to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> watching youtube shorts or watching tick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tocks is the equivalent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eating mcdonald's or eating fast food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like i know i shouldn't do it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes sometimes just lying in bed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just scroll through and you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you just want that quick meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like [ __ ] 30 minutes have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> passed and i've like consumed nothing uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so like i've fallen down to like i felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i fell down into this hole of like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know life advice youtube or like life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> hacks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah and it's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like remember before where we went </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> through that life hack phase of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> buzzfeed videos where like the hack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't actually a hack so i thought that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> died out but apparently that just went </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to [ __ ] tick tock yeah right because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember i saw i saw like a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like career hacks of things you can do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like to help you increase your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chances of getting a job interview right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's this i think i saw that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's this tick tock of like that this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is how this hour goes the job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> interviewer offers you a glass of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the same thing yesterday </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the white guy right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so the job interviewer offers you a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> glass of water and then you take the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> water and that's the hack because the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hack is if you take the glass of water </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when it's offered to you they ask you a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> difficult question and you just go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well you see the thing is and then and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the hack was because you have a glass of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> water it gives you more time to think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the answer and that was the hack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i was just like losing my mind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you could call this career advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or a [ __ ] thousand likes and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this feels like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the only time i ever see people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take a sip of water right for answering </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the question is it like the criminal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trial yeah like when mark zuckerberg was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh questioned by the senate yeah every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> single question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah he was using a life hack dude he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was thinking about those answers i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> saying you don't look like a criminal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when i ask you a question you don't be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> good i'm just i'm just like i i i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like a more like logical thing would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like uh can i just take a bit of time to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think about this answer yeah no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you've got to seem confident </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i'd be like that is a fantastic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> question yeah think of the way to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> appropriately answer that no you you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> what if you combine it right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah you gotta combine it with the water </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the fantasy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what if what if the water doesn't give </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you enough time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are you just like downing an entire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] jug of war you're sitting there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> for like 10 minutes just going they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like gone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what's your fault </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> your favorite food is oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> well what if or what if you know you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get off of the water right and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're just like really thirsty and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get to that really difficult </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> question you're just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like what do i do now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> never told me sir you've gone through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three litres of water during this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interview are you are you feeling okay i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have to say like 99 of life hacks or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some [ __ ] i just immediately forget and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never remember and we'll never ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> practically use yeah yeah yeah i've seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many others especially when it comes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like [ __ ] survival like these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these kinds of like hacks or like advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you see on tick tocks like i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we've ever talked about this on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> podcast i think we've only talked about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it in private but like the [ __ ] shaq </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> financial advice which is an entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> genre </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is which is an entire i think an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entire genre of video on tick tock and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube shorts now where it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shaq motivational like life advice and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half of it is just like taking your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paycheck and apparently just ripping it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in half shaq what's the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> between being rich and being wealthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like when you're rich you do this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but the wealth you do this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is one million likes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> thank you shaq i am no longer poor now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i will </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> the financial advice the problem is with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of these financial advices on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tick tock and youtube and again i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shaq is somewhat guilty of this it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> assumes you're even making enough money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to save like most people don't aren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> able to save money because like we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] right now yeah you most people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spend all their paycheck that's that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how it is how do you then go to them and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like you're just not saving enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just not saving enough that rent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe you can get rid of yeah who's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who's living on minimum wage and being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like oh i didn't i shouldn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are there people who spend it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> responsibly hell yeah there are yeah is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that the reason why everyone isn't rich </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was just so weird falling into this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hole of just like you know you see these </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tik tok with like made up scenarios </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where the the perfect life hack for that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> scenario will pop up it's always the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> same it's one guy is in this part of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> frame and he's like so you want this and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then another guy on the frame probably </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with glasses yeah yeah no no that's not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how you do it it's literally always like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that and with the worst acting and the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> worst script and then it's like 20 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> million views and i'm like i'm quitting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much yeah i'm terrible at my job it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like an entire [ __ ] genre of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just takes place in the dharmand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> universe you know it's just like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> extended darman universe where you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything just works out because of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these because i drank water in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] job interview like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the dcu </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> man cinematic universe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the one that also just like that i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been getting a lot recently off youtube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shorts is the ones where like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ones where they take like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> those like five minute crafts like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] like life hacks and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's always some like dude who's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm gonna find out if this is actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> legitimate or not and then they do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they tried themselves and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay it was legitimate like for more if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the thing that's a thing okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i've seen so many of those like so many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> times where it's like oh if you you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get a black marker and you draw it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on your hand and then you take a picture </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of it on flash then it apparently zaps </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you some [ __ ] like that and and it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> always some guy being like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no it's not factor cap all right let's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> try it let's try to figure it out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> let's try and figure it out my new </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> favorite shorts or tic toc uh category </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is uh the tick tocks that need way more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> explanation as to what's going on but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they the person doing the video does not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> offer any explanation as to why they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> doing the thing they're doing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like what there was one time i watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this tick tock and it was a guy he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so here's how i made a case to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> carry my ipad farm and then he makes the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> case and i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me and all the other comments were like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> think i've seen that one with the long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> case yeah yeah yeah like and like he </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> why did you have an ipad phone no no he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> makes this ipad farm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to test out if he could make enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> passive income that's it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to justify making an ipad farm and like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> this guy was talking about that's been a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of criticism of youtube facebook and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all these platforms they push you to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> more fringes of the content and um yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean that's one of the parts that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not so good yeah i think one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weirdest ones i've uh the one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weirdest genres i've seen that's popped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up recently is we've gotten to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where youtube shorts are now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> commentating on youtubers oh yeah where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll be like lundwig just did this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> last week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you won't believe what he did and i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this is why saikuno doesn't take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sponsorship </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right cool i guess like it's like mr </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beast just sent chocolate bars to every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> influencer you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's like news flash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't know it's just it's just so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just so weird seeing all these like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> new genres and new types of content pop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up um on on i guess like a new for a new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> type of platform and everything like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that yeah um but like i don't understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it at all do you think youtube sure is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna stick around do you think it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna get to a point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] around so yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's you know it's what it is but at the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> end of the day the long form content is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> still very valuable and that's what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> makes the money of course yeah and until </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tick-tock find a way to uh properly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> monetize that platform without uh paying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> their creators way less than uh what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> they deserve then uh yeah i think long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long form content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will be king for now that's us that's </SPEAKER_01>
