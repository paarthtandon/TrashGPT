<SPEAKER_04> - Teens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I just wanted to

<SPEAKER_02> - Now I know how stupid
it sounds. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, did you think
it sounded not stupid? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you think it sounded? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't think it sounded that stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey did it. He's that was a good one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In my head, I was like damn got bars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How come I didn't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yeah welcome to
the Trash Taste Podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm your host for today? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt and with me again, are the boys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey and Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's me, that's awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How's your week been guys? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's been all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we should be
asking you that question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause you've had a...
- Are we here on a Thursday? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah we are here on a Thursday. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I know if you couldn't tell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I know I've not
been putting Trash Taste </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on the best of records recently. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> We've put the streams, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we've delayed the streams two weeks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I unfortunately got COVID </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and now we've had to delay
the stream for two days now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because I got stuck in a snowstorm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was up in Hakaido. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man I can't get a dog. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am playing Gaon life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I am losing on every
role I swear to God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, no, that's exactly how it felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was up in Nokado </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just on a trip with me and Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a good four five days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And we were scheduled to
come back on the Monday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if anything happened on the Monday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could have come back Tuesday morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to record Trash Tastes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because my entire life is planned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around Trash Tastes, recordings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure your guys are
lives days now as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pretty much yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And unfortunately on Monday I woke up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> checked my flight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My flight was canceled. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was all right, whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's okay we can expect that to happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes I look on the
site to rebook my flight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and every single flight
for the entire day is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just canceled was canceled, canceled. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So,
- How bad was the storm? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was really, really bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I've obviously not had much experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in cold weather and snow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So this was the first
time (laughing) I never, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> this was the first time I'd ever been, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I guess caught in a snowstorm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I remember when during the snow storm, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we had to take a taxi to the airport. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause all of the trains
had stopped running. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So it wasn't just planes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We were looking at, oh, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can we take, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the Shinhan or the train
back from Hakaido to Tokyo? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Nope everything was gone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which says a lot with Hokkaido. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because Hokkaido is one of those places </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it snows so often </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that even just a little bit of snow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or a substantial amount of snow, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's still yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We'll just power through it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Un Tokyo where it's 10
centimeters of snow, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stop the trains, stop everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Rather UK can't imagine man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the UK can't imagine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember we constantly go through grit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shortages in the UK because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're just so ill prepared for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just the tiniest bit of snow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They always do the exact same speech. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time the snow, they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why aren't the buses running? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The buses were running during world war II </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now they stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause of a bit of snow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They do this every single time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They say, how dare the buses stop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The absolute state. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's what is another country attack? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or because nature attacks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which all do you think is scarier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nature for sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nature definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I remember I remember
during the snowstorm, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to go outside for just a few seconds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go from my hotel front door, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the taxi in the road in front of me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> simple one to two minute walk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we've all done it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember thinking
it's just a bit of snow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a bit of wind.
I've handled that before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go out and then I've never feltnature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just beating the outta me just as soon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as I stepped out the door. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because this snow I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt snow before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's I felt snow before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's soft, it's fluffy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's soft it's fluffy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, this snow was ice man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The wind had turned this
soft, fluffy snow into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into a WMD or something that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my face literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I felt my face was
getting cut from the brief </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moment that I didn't have my hood up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look the weekend album. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
And seeing her caught in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a Pokemon attack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah basically it this was
literally just blizzard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) I could feel the hail, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just beating the outta my face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That one 20 PowerPoint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh and it was even
worse for Sydney as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause for some reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney decided that she
shouldn't bring any footwear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to her Hakiddo other than heels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was boots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was boots with heels on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - What was she expecting up in Hokkaido? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it's just been so
long since she's seen snow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That she has forgotten what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other environment just (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wisconsin right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Doesn't it snow up in Wisconsin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I was just , </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember asking her, oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember telling her, oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never seen snow this in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, it's it's been a long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's been a long time for you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And yet you are still so ill prepared. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You less prepared. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You are so ill prepared
for this weather. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah we just weren't obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we weren't expecting it to be that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> harsh weather conditions
to be that harsh so hard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And yeah we had to stay in Hakaido </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically we were living out of an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> airport hotel for two days. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause we woke up the next day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember cause I messaged these guys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Guys were gonna have to possibly delay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the recording by an hour or two maybe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna get an early flight. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's all gonna be good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's only the weather forecast. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's only scheduled for
the snow to be really bad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on this day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I wake up, I look out my window, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the Blizzard's still going and I'm guys, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so guys, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can make it back. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can make it back. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The flights aren't council yet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I remember trying to reorganize </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with these guys to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay, I'm gonna make it back on this hour. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can make back to the
studio at this hour. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We can record. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We can still stream. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's all good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's fixed guys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We can still do Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And hour passes and then every
flight is canceled again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And in the defeated manner
I text these boys going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry, boys I let you down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wasn't so much you that let us down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was the weather. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It wasn't your fault. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - (laughing) Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just fight through it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Don't just walk back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's walkable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause we've been through
Hakaido few times before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I swear to God, every
time you go to Hakaido, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're playing Gacha with
the planes then. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause a lot of planes get
canceled very frequently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously not in this kind of state </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where literally the entire
airport was shut down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you're normally playing Gacha </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you go to Hera </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because one or two planes
will normally get canceled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or scheduled all heavily, heavily delayed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then that's when you
discovered why airport, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the airport in
Hokkaido is so well equipped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. It is actually should I say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Airports is one of the best airports </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been to in the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think really just, just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean just with how many restaurants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and how many resources are there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's basically a shopping
mall inside the airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause the airports that
stick out to me are airports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Singapore airport which is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that's an amazing airport. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The Hakaido airport is mall </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with an airport attached to it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where most of the stuff you see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is before you go into the departure zone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whereas most airports
it's the departure zone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which really has all of the restaurants, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all of the shops and all
the everything, but yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> In Jato, I mean there's
even a cinema there as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which there was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did you watch something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't, the only film were playing was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Kyon movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do this, just go watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Just go watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I am actually gonna go
watch it this weekend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the only reason why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't watch it when I was in Hakaido. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah it wasn't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> too bad because of the airport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then luckily I was able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get a hotel at the airport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just more annoying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because obviously I wanted to be back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted to be working, but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean there's not really
much to say about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean I'm sure this is
every other day for a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Canadian, I remember there's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Gonna be a million people
in the comments being whoa. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Imagine living with sort of
that every day of the week. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because I remember bring. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your own slate dogs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How responsible you had gone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. It was just weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just because I'm just used to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no matter what happens, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's always kind of a plan B </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can fall back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> on a possible plan B, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the roads were closed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Airports were closed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Trains were closed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was literally stranded. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You basically experienced quarantine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah basically I was basically
stranded at the airport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was no plan B. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was no services I could
call to get myself out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there to a place where I could
get some public transport to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you go around getting
the shopping carts to get some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money together so you could buy a burger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Collecting plastic cans. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. So yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I basically just lived
the terminal except sorry. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Unfortunately I wasn't Tom hack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause I think one of the
craziest weather phenomena </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been caught up in was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I was in Vegas and
they have dust storms there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dust storms. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. So basically just
think of a sandstorm, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but instead of the sand coming in from a. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never even been in the sandstorm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I haven't been in a sandstorm, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I've been in a dust storm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it happens pretty frequently in Vegas. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's the difference between sand dust? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I thought it was a sandal at first. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then everyone, all my friends were oh, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a dust storm coming. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's a different vernacular. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe or it's maybe it's not just sand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe it's sand, another
crap, mixed into it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> But basically I was driving
around in Vegas, just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a bunch of friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then on the radio, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause he had the radio on
it just suddenly switches on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it is oh there's a
dust storming coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So please evacuate kind of thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was my pants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was what the is a dust storm? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, but everyone else there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the locals just oh yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it happens pretty frequently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's just go to a
restaurant gets on to eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we go into this and then
the dust storm hits. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just, yeah,
just think of a typhoon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. So it's just really insane winds, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can't see outside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The whole windows are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just all sand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just it's a blizzard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but instead of white, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just grayish brown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a survival game. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But what's more terrifying
in my opinion than a blizzard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the fact that in a dust storm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it can cause static electricity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So basically you have thunder
strikes at ground level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because of all the particles
rubbing together. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So every now and then it'll
just be blowing and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll just hear this
boom sound from outside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm the is happening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's oh that's just the electricity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was why are you saying it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's my friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so saying it so casually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. So </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's really interesting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So that entire time
I was my pants while, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we were in this ramen shop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Of course they were oh Joe's Japanese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's just go to a restaurant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm here all the way in Vegas to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat some subpar Japanese food I bet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we were so basically I was stuck inside </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a Roman shop called Narato. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not even fronting
it's it was called Narato. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean they did their best, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> The walls had Narato, did they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And some of you could have been named </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after the location. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was and the ramen, it was very obvious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They tried to replicate the Narato </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> amen as best as they could, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - To not that great levels immediately, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it was the most three outta </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 10 RO I've ever had. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm stuck inside this restaurant called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Narrato eating us. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - All this poor restaurant
getting destroyed. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think it exists anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Isn't the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm and if it does
exist, sorry, you're that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is the most perfect moment of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> LO's going this guy's
Japanese, you side me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The perfect place that
the episode Simpsons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they go to America town in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude I mean the first thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing I ate
when I went to America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was the first ex I ever went to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my friends took me a little Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every yeah, every time you I've got ax, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone to get a little Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just came from big Tokyo. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't need to go.
- A smaller variant of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I had, again, some subpar Ram </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in little Tokyo, I was yeah, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The fan, this is the
LA experience I wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only time I've ever seen a natural </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> phenomenon of is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw sun in the UK One time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You were oh I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen fire tornado in Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the is a fire tornado. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have breezes in the UK gust of wind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you have tornadoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you have Bush fires. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what happens when a
tornado enters a Bush fire, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> You basically get this
spiraling, pillar of fire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's terrifying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's awesome to look at from a distance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - These, settlers must
have been so confused </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when all this was happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're what the is happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - British that's what the British saw the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> first time in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're what the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The first time they
found the swamp in Florida, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they're what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bit humid in here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Australia is just a real
life island in one piece, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - A fire in Ireland. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's an island on the
grand line at this point. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because the survival instincts
you need in this island, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that that's taken out most the pirates </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in one piece at this point. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Imagine being the
Geris to write the guide. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They Chan back to people
who are gonna come again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So by the way, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're not gonna believe this, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how it suns sometimes, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - All the time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And sometimes I don't
know how this happened. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There was just fire tornado. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know what a tornado is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> We never even seen one of them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's a tornado. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It says, but it's such
a weird thing as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's not I kind of described it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's a Bush fire and
then a tornado comes long </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and eats up the fire. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's also the fire is so
strong that it basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> creates an up current that starts to spin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it just creates
this pillar of fire that just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> crashes through just, just sounds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really cool to see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just sounds a anime
attack at this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Where, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is there a Pokemon battle
happening over there? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And someone did fire spin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's two jujitsu being
combined together in Narato. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This stomach after having
that narrower Ram. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cut on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did see actually there recently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the UK or at least London went through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a pretty bad storm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Bad storm, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which I dunno how bad it was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause when I see, when I see UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It looked really bad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked really.
- Bad cause when I see, but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when you see UK headlines yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh UK go through a bad storm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the strongest wind scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously it's going to be bad for the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but how bad is it on a global scale? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There, is videos about picking up people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and throwing them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Seriously. Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Cause when I saw the headline, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was just the
British over exaggerating as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no dude, as you guys, usually there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my friend's too pay fell off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's an absolute travesty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so strong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw severe people get thrown around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I was oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rip, if you're trying to
open that car door, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're trying to get that close. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Never have. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So this just shows how unused we are to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these kind of weather systems
and whether phenomena. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause we're me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Connor are ina group chat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the our friends in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And sometimes, they're still meeting up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're still planning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> meetups and everything that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I saw in this group chat that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they had planned a meetup
or to hang out on this day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember right up
to the last moment people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were just oh yeah, I'll
see you guys in an hour. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll see you guys an hour. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're still meeting in an hour and people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll see you in an hour. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I, and then you just
see you just see this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the replies going, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's maybe not meet up today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe that's not the best idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But the thing is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if this was one of the worst storms that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> UK has gone has gone through, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I am also really used to the
idea that no matter what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can still go out and have a pipe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you can still go out and have a pipe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The pub has been canceled. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that's how I knew that
this storm was the real deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If my mates were not going
to the pub to meet up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of this storm, gone down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The pub isn't closed, then
that means I can still go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. No matter what. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is basically that, Oh God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That is another third
of UK people severely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unprepared for, weather systems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
Because I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I first met my first British person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the UK who exist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They exist I was oh my
God, you guys exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But second of all, they're always oh yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have nothing going on in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No bad weather, no dangerous animals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Know nothing I'm Don really real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I found that hard to believe as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> someone who came from the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> polar opposite of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just call it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I came from doom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I came from hell basically the under one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's do you guys really not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is the most dangerous
thing that floods flood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was about to say floods.
- We got a lot of rivers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So obviously when it rains a
lot, it can flood back. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Depending on where you are in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> UK there aren't floods. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. what if you're
nowhere near the rivers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Then you don't get anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Occasionally you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Guys get a lucky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. We've had hurricane scares before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> at least in my lifetime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but nothing that actually
manifests anything felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A hurricane. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just a bit of strong wind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Gust. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's that was pretty much it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I mean, we don't have
a lot to fear in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is why whenever I travel
abroad, whenever I, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry, I lost my train of thought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whenever I travel a abroad, bored. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - A abroad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever I travel abroad, I got it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I got it this line, there you go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes it just surprises
me about some of the things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to be careful of
just because in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we don't have to be careful
of anything with camping, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to be careful about bears or, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starting a forest fire, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which to me starting a forest fire was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so outside a perception of what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of disasters that could
happen from just one person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if you think about it yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course it makes sense. you see, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you look at Australia
being on fire California, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half the year being on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fire. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Our country was on fire
for nine months straight </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because of one guy starting a fire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. To me that's just so outside </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of my perception of what could </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> possibly go wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Of one stupid person doing a stupid thing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. I mean, all the
trees are wet in the UK. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It was very hard to get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even I remember when we were camping, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was even hard to get
trees that weren't too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> D really to burn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jeez. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you could come in with a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flame thrower and it would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably be put out by the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The flame will run out gas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very rough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think we've ever
seen anywhere, in nature, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on fire in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, fire's just not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard to get it
started. Yeah. It's very. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hard to get nature fires. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Aren't a thing that we have
to be careful about in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And yet one of the biggest
UK hits was fire starter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, that's bit ironic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's cause they, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had so much time while </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were making the fire starter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - They, part, I make a song about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God, you do the fire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll make I'm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why it's an achievement. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause it's easy to be a fire
starter anywhere else in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the world, in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a medal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm a Fire starter it's You manage that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - On some forest fires natural, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's that needs to happen
sometimes to clear a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the dead trees and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then see a lot of
them recently are not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. So we have controlled Bush fires </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Australia that happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty frequently because we also have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know the details about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we have this specific </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it breed I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the word for it is of tree or sapling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where breed it's a type of eucalyptus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think where the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeds from the tree, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Need to be put into a fire in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Order for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It to open up.
- So to keep the forest alive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they actually have to burn these seeds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and basically start a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bush fire for that area of
the bushland to grow in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the most backwards thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that nature has ever done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I imagine if the dead trees pile up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it's as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hot as it is in Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It'll naturally catch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - On. Oh, fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We get natural bush fires all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just cause of how hot
and powerful the sun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Australia literally is
the last dungeon area. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even nature is high level
in Australia what the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Randomly just start up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally the desert level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Andres of the rather
the breath of the wild. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Breath of time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's literally the desert level </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and breath of the wild where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't have the right equipment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are forever just gaining damage from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Song. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think in Israel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think as well, I can't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I might have been on one of those generic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> videos where you learn about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You didn't know, you
wanted to learn about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you learn about
it and you're eh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I YouTube you mean every YouTube? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Mainly videos if always that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the US for so
long was actively stopping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the fires. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It turned out that a lot of
the branches needed to just be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> set ABL so that they
could get rid of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it could go back in the system, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it turns into Ash. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they had a buildup
of a lot of dead trees </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff that. So when
the fire, I did start, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it went crazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it should be nearly as big as it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean yeah, we.
- I think I could be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wrong on that. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have so many controlled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bush fires just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we do have just at least in my area, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have a lot of wildlife
and nature reserves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But sometimes, unfortunately they're not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of those fires aren't controlled 100% </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's what causes
Bush fire scares and right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're up bush fires sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think that's why we have
a lot of that just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're trying to maintain the nature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then sometimes nature's what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a go ham a little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they go ham. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And controlled fire
in the UK is from trying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to boil your water. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's oh God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - As an Australian, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what is your guess fear
over there in terms of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nature wise, what'd, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to be careful
about the most emotion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, the people scam me the most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's such a video game, movie thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not the emotion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Worry about kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> humans are the scariest of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> All the humans were
the monsters all along. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can predict a black
widow can't predict. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A human guns don't kill people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> People kill people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In terms of wildlife. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm usually pretty okay with insects </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and snakes and spiders. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> If I know it's not going to kill me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever had a
big scare yourself of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've encountered something you're oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this could actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've the health bar comes
on the bottom of the screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Many times I remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was actually this close to
basically dying at one point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I was this close to
being by bitten by one of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> most venomous ants in
the world, venomous ants. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> So we not only so Australia, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so people outside of Australia </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think that Australia's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> venomous spiders and snakes
that's but we have fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We have a lot of venomous insects </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and we have this one ant species </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> called the bulldog ant and
it is supposedly the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> venomous ant in the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I almost got bitten by
one when I was 10 years old. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think dark dark horse
is way more balanced than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Australia. At least it has a hip box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically I was camping, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's where most of the accidents happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So you got. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The campfire, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That makes sense. Yeah.
No, I was camping the bonfire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was sitting on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I lit the bonfire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought I was in the
safe zone and I wasn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The one enemy before
I could teleport. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> So I was kind of sitting
around the fire with, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my family and my mates. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was maybe 10, 11 years old. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And we were ina really, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really deep rainforest area. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. So it was basically
we just found a flat, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it wasn't even a registered
campsite basically. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just oh, we found
a flat piece of ground. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's just, start a fire here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as long as it's control, it's what. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The way he just said, you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't say let's make this all campsite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's not a fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean a responsible firefighter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. A small fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's start a fire here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Let's hunker down here
for the night, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's so we set up the camp there and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my dad started of the fire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and we were getting all cozy up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was sitting on the
it's giant slab of rock. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. It was very smooth. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And asa 10 year old, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just wanna climb. Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I found lots of little rocks to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and big rocks to kind of climb around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was sitting and
I was kind of sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with my mate as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my hand was rested back this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And I kind of legs out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Kind of thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was just chilling and every </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then I felt something
crawl onto my hand. Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And I looked down and it was an ant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a big ant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But how big are we talking that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's quite big. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's pretty funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, that's still an ant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah still an ant's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This pitch black T just kind
of rolling onto my finger. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I kind of put my hand up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and was looking at it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then my friend who
was next to me just gased </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then immediately swatted my hand away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and swatted this ant off me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was what the? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was looking at this cool ant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, why.
- Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> And he was dude, would've died. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you do know what that thing is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he told me and
he showed me what it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was well, thank
you for slapping my hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Glad I didn't die young. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Does it, does it
definitely kill you? Or is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean it can kill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They say the venom is
powerful enough to kill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an adult in 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So as a 10 year old, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably would've been instant kill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes what's the coyote
Peterson video of him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sting test. (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kill me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The next level of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's in the OG YouTube days, it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will it blend 20, 30 YouTube? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Will I die? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Will I die? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's find out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm for this I'm about
to enter the death zone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the dudu guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. So yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So my friend saved my life </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and now I know that we have these ants. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause when you're a kid in Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you are always, told be
careful of the snakes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be careful of the spiders because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we do have a lot of non venomous kinds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's not the ones you
have to walk out for obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been bitten by a snake once, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it wasn't venous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just really hurt. So
that, I mean, that's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just a little nip on the finger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's whatever, what, doesn't kill you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They must have sent
the craziest from the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If I was there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the first people in Australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all my friends just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's bitten by an end and
we're laughing jovial. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he just dies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like we're leaving, this place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get back on the boat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We're leaving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh little cute little lamp Boom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just I get back, pack the back up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pack it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why they send the prisoners that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's it's literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the dark continents in hunt. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's when you play
the ground is LA it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> everybody off the ground. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - History is the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I'd have the
courage to do anything in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Australia cause they're no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I read the more I'm just I just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess I just won't go
outside cause it's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The beaches sound great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why I read about stone fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? And then I'm just oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A stone fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just don't step on the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So a stone fish is a fish
that looks exactly a stone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's very ugly fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a very a bottom dweller fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's fins have razor sharp needles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that if you step on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's apparently one of the
most painful experiences, you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can have your from an animal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Any of your friends stepped on one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've had a friend step on one] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he, I mean he obviously
went to the hospital for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He didn't die, but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well that's the plus, but I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Didn't die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it venomous or is it painful? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just extremely voice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, if you, it could
cause anaphylactic shock </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and kill you if you're unlucky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the most venous fish known. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. It's the most venous
fish known on earth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so even if I don't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if you don't die, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going to have
a very, very bad time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just gonna
experience a lot of pain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you're experiencing enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pain cause of the pain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it sharp or is it got some poison? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's Probably got some toxins
in it or something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It can kill you by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It can kill you if you're. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just pull up the Glock
shoot your own foot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just stop it from going
through the cut it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Off John Wicked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but things stone fish and all that are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are they super common
or is it super rare? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's very, very rare. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> - Back to the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One thing you mostly have to worry about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you go to the beach in
Australia is the jellyfish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was gonna say the second
thing that terrifies me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well we have a ton of
those in the jellyfish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not to take jellyfish though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, but the ones that
areextremely painful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, because we, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you are probably seeing
your box jellyfish, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. I've never seen that in the waters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never heard of anyone
getting stung by that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but that's the one that can kill you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And people have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Where it puts you in
so much pain that you drown. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause you have zero control over your. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. It basically
paralyzes you immediately. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have people survived. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - People have survived. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I mean it's a very uncommon way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sorry it's a very rare
way for anyone to die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think only maybe two or
three people die a year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from it or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's very rare considering
the amount of people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who go into the ocean in Australia, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's you gotta be really unlucky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Jellyfish just scare me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I mean I've been stung by a, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the other kind of jellyfish
that's way more common is they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> call blue bottle jellyfish. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're not toxic or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they won't kill you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it hurts a lot when you get stung by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - My friend got stung by
one where we were swimming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in some ocean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> In the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the trick in the
Australia is if you have a mate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's been stung by a blue bottle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You pee on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The, I think this is one of
those rumors though. Isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is just right by Jojo fans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think it actually does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the actual way to do it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you gotta pull vinegar or something on it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but may some having your
mate on you feels relieving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. It's some kinda
alkaline that you actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have to put it on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you say it out loud, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it does feel like a scene from Jojo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Doesn't it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've been stung by a stand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> The only thing Go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To the fact the treatment
is hot water apparently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> P just hot water from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The body scold my leg, poor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Boiling that's 36 degrees right there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Dark like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's warm as fuck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is why this isn't
a problem in the UK. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Everyone's always got a hot
firmness ready for the teeth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> They voting to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get the teeth firm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Put on could make it worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually. Oh really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Depending on how I see Wells of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry for peeing on your leg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I remember we were swimming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and a bunch of the jellyfishes washed up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's normal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh yeah. I've seen that in the UK as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Clashed them bunch of them washed up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and this little 10 year old didn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know what they were. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I was 12 dived. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Into it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just picked one up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and well you can pick them up by the head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. No.
- He picked it up by. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. That's probably
immediately started crying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and screaming and. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There was, I remember
there was loads of them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember I got really freaked out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what the is that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> This is not how they were in finding Nemo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I didn't think there was any
fish fighting. The weird fish. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was, yeah, that was jellyfish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and find what's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fish? What fish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Freaked me out so much
more than animals do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is fish, not animals. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No fish, fish or fish right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Animals are animals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jelly, fish isn't an animal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it's an animal, but what. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Off? what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The is going on with fish? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it, another brain and doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have jellyfish is just God's spunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just what it, they are it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fights back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean that's the closest way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I, the ocean sperm cell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is the ocean sperm cell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You look at that Mr. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Incredible meme where he is smiling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and GRE you getting more sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's you look at dogs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're yes. And then you get outta horses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. Then you get so rats. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you start
getting these weird fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Then you're what the geeky fish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then you start getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the real weird fish

<SPEAKER_01> and just all teeth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you what the is I putting down there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like some creature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The what's going on with fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, who's what is an episode of Feld? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who's in charge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is that with fish? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who's in charge the
evolution down there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's out of control. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You guys heard about
the immortal jellyfish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I listening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So there is a species of jelly fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that scientists believe are immortal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they cannot be killed by time by old age. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So obviously they can still
be cured by external forces, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> meat and whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's brilliant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's believed by scientists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they are in a sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Immortal okay and that
scares the outta me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just because
nothing should be immortal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing alive should be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immortal that's just a survivor
stand from past season. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh they just have no age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is literally just the stand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Can't die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Apparently they reckon
that aging is process it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cells and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's on purpose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not bullshitting right, Ashley? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There isn't something
called immortal jellyfish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Apparently it just
regresses into a pollen form </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it go comes back against. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. So it's literally
just a single cell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> organism kind of deal where it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forever just recreating itself basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So a car accident. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just turn back into a
baby and group back old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Again, that's a Benjamin button. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stadium that is actually
just a superpower. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That's pretty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That's cool dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But could you imagine though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if humans were able to
somehow study that enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And be we're. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Trying, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And being all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this might actually be
the key to immortality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the point of being
immortal if you get to 60 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're useless at 60 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're what are you gonna
do for another 100 years? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's why they come
progress in age as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause they just Get to
a point where they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't do sports anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Time to go back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's just say we can keep you alive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Till 200 but after 50 you start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you start degrading </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then 70 you're kind of useless, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Well I'm saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not saying all people
are useless by the way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you personally can't do what you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is the point of you
being another 130 years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now the 100 years? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's are you gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just catch up with the
rest of Game of Thrones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in future drama episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they have all those old
celebrities from centuries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that go just as heads in Europe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember one of
my friends was oh man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wouldn't it be cool if
we humanity got to that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that point in technology. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm no, what do you want? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That would be horrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You'd just be sitting on a
shelf for the rest of human. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the rest of yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Time, rest of time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rest of time, just doing what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How do you have fun? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How'd just, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You just head in a jar, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll don't know. Perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Beatboxing or something
that's that's all you can do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as a head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just there's that trick right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With the cherry stem where you can tie up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what else you gonna do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow this perfect a Jojo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Learn languages, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - For the rest of time, learn
every language in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. Probably or just, or
just watch out, think about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There is a few things you can do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> or just watch Pokemon in your mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The ultimate life back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just watching the
6,003 run of Pokemon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess it's a really
philosophical question of if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be immortal would
you want to be immortal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't want to be
maybe I wouldn't want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> die at say 80 or 90 or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's a point where
I would my body to keep up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With what I want to
do. Right. Okay. Well on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well then different question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How old, if you could choose, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how old would you want to be when you die? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I, to me, it depends
on how functional I am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Cause I, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've met 90 years old, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 90 year olds who are
still in tip top shape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And I've also met, 60 year olds </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who have trouble doing things that I would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> want to do do as well.
- My fifties Man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah it depends on
how lucky you get rid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, some of my friends, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're some of their
dads 55 already getting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dementia and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's scary. I would hate to get there, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> especially if my kids are young, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want them to feel yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they gotta help me out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the cool dancer was my granddad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently in his twenties, , </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from his twenties, he was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna die at age 80. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just no cap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna die at age 80. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And for the longest time I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> why would you say that from a young age? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's because it gives me a time limit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to do all the things I want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to do before I die. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so it's self the motivating. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And this is how much of
a Chad, my granddad was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He died exactly at a 80. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he was literally I'm, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm good, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm good to go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I allowed ask how. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, you died from lung cancer but. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was gonna say that this man, well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> how did it go there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, the thing is though, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds did everything
in one of the, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was literally on
his 80th birthday, he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can go now with no regrets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just waiting for the clock to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ready to pull, ready to pull the plug. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - So but I thought that was so cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because there's that
very common philosophy of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you became immortal
you would do nothing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> because you'd have no rush.
- You'd have no drive to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have no drive to do
the things you wanna do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you can do it whenever you want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> So I, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's my reasoning for
why I wouldn't wanna be. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Immortal also I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't wanna see everyone around me die. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That should be so funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, if you live in a
society where everyone can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choose how, when they. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So if we were living
in an immortal society, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is that what. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're saying in society? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We if we lived in a society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Then I think we just
regress to the stone age </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at that point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause no one would wanna do anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean for me, personally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I find the badass people
are the people who live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> till the late, their late ages </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they they seem fit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They seem able, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then one day they just
decide to their body just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> decides all right, peace out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. that's the way I would want to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want the 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think everyone wants to go that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But life is brutal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is I think it's the teal Osama, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy who basically popularized manga, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he died while drawing
manga in the hospital then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm that's so badass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The fact that this man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally till the
moment he died was doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what he wanted to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God's gonna be doing that final 10 pole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need one more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just he gets 10 SRSS and he's Connor's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gonna be on jump king 20. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - On the final jump. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It gets to the top credits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause my grandma right
now is still alive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And she's in her late nineties right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember when I
introduced her to Sydney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember I was telling Sydney, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's in the nineties. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you've
definitely told this story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I told this Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think you have okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe I don't know, have I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't unfortunate Do a cliff notes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. So yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My grandma squeezed took
Sydney's hand and squeezed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She squeezed it so hard
that Sydney was rith in pain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a good hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause of how hard she squeezed it Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah that was a cliff
notes with the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I think maybe I have
told this on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically your
grandma's a gig get shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you not heard the story? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Seem familiar, I can't see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you can't tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I've told you this
at a bar or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've on the podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unfortunately we talk a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unfortunately we do talk a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw a recent comment on
one of the Trash Taste episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being it's so impressive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How the boys still to find topics that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've never talked. I don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even know I'm yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And sometimes we get caught out for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Definitely been talking
about up fish in the ocean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know that. Have we? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> No, we haven't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh we haven't. No haven't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's so many up little fishes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the animal that
scares you the most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Man. No, Jerry mars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, those tea lists of animals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I could take in a fight.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just think a deer would just me up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean they could. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I'd have more chance
of being able to outwit a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bear or something or being able to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Know about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would rather take on the deer than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the bear much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's not deer's the one with the ma. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Barky has taught me anything
don't fuck with bears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which are the ones
with the massives there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the deers they all deers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Deer moose I don't know.
- I know, maybe moose, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's some of them
caribou I've seen some of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them that are insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They well, I mean, moose are insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> how big, people imagine moose and they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh yeah that's just a big deal. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Right, I'm no, they're. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're huge Insanely huge it's scary. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I even though I think I
there's a 0.1% chance that I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> could live with a bad encounter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I at least think that Ia idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd have zero if it wanted to kill me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel it would just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Chase what. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What logic are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The way it looks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you the way it looks at me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll be talking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're talking about
the deer from princess Mo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay they gotta look
in their eyes dears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> They gotta look in their eye
that says I'm out for blood </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm not gonna be happy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Deer's the cutest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All the times. Have you never been in a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can feed the deers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Those are wimp, deers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chad. Chad deers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you seen those deer? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is when they're wrestling
each other formating purposes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do they let's just say
if one of these deers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought I was gonna
steal its GF, I'm done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's I'm dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Think you can say that
about most animals though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you were if you tried
to steal a,(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> If you wanna go to a frat party, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure you'd feel the same
way this guy's gonna me up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember there's there's stories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What logic are you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This there's absolutly zero logic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just the way it looks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So are you saying that you
can't take on a male deer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you could take on say a male elephant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or a male giraffe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What would we say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Take on an elephant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you saying beating it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, you were
saying tear a list of animals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could beat in a fight, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let in the fight or survive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I reckon I could get away maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - For a bear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And let's say you're a cave man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you need to take on one
of these animals, survive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm trying to kill it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Am I trying to run away? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're trying to survive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I, yeah. Okay. I
think, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I just fell a deer could
chase me to the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The, I fell a bear might get most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Animals. No, a bear will
get bored after a while, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll get bored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel a deer clearly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Never encountered a bear in his life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Let's say I climb a 20 foot tree. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know bears and climb trees, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I reckon the deer
somehow would just jump up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> me up Naruto style something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just scared of these deers, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> These big deers that are tigers liars. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you have a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even I'll take a tiger wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you have a childhood
trauma grab deer or. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this just the British in you talking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do we even have deers? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course we have deers in England. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't look at me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do we have deer? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No the big deers with the analysts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the difference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ones with the horns that are not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're all kind of spiky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you talking about caribou? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know what
they're called. Regular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Deal of spike handle. I know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Spike handles the ones with weird shape. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm talking about Bambi, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The ones with no horns aren't scary. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why would they be scary? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They have no horns gone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Horns are scary. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - But they also do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not scared of rhinos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be terrified of a rhino. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just ride it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Don't on country. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It I get on the back of a rhino, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's it gonna do fall the gram. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just jump off it in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What about a Ram? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A Ram I've been with a Ram. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I befriended the Rams. We will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you don't find Rams scary? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No they just kinda little Ram. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They just kinda drama Queens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can talk to them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - You can talk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You can't, you can't really can't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Can't with the deer these one? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - This just regular whitetail gear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a deer, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Those would you up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a male. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously you pale bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'll be in the tree that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not get up the not
saying they won't you up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'd rather take on that than a bear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why as well, because when
you see you think it's cute, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right? You think, oh, it's cute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it stabs you. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A bear you're not getting
anywhere near that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're cautious, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's about the perception. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm not going anywhere near a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing that has horns that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, they taste good though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'd understand why you might. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go near it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if bears tasted good, would you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe we'd have to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fell a, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This is, why is a sense of danger? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dictate how good the animal tastes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Listen, this is one of
those things where it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna make me look
stupid, this argument, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's just pure, gut. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is no logic whatsoever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is just my gut for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So wait is dear, T for you STI scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - STI will you up and
you didn't expect it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Bear is at, cause I know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know it's gonna me up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but also it might not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It might get bored. It
might just leave me alone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What but way are you getting this idea? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That deers are so aggressive? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've seen videos, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Videos of bears
being aggressive probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because some dumb is
provoking a deer, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, of course gonna get off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just think that bears are, friendly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause my experience with most deers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> even ones that is that you goin a 50 again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in a 50 meter radius. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Immediately not I am not
trying to make any sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is all just gut. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not, you're. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not making sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it doesn't I know
this doesn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why we're trying to glean
some senses out of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but time guess is scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also the tiger king seemed
he had a good hand of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> he slapped them with his
stick and theyover him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So maybe if I just give him
a little, get off, stop that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stop that was the problem with all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the pre that you said
weren't they weren't oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll use the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Slap message. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You didn't have a big enough stick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously everyone most dangerous bear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it the red one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The red bear is that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Black grizzly bear. Isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The black one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Black one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Polar bears. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. Polar bear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was story from that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Brian blessed, Don Brian blessed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a very famous British guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's this really famous
British guy who has yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the most booming voice this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes and apparently he
was in the Arctic filming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something and a polar bear came up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think that he either punched the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> polar bear in the face or he
screamed at the polar bear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it ran away skit this story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'd to think that I could, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it is true that you could
scare a polar bear from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shouting at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'll be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right Well, I mean, Bucky has 50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bucky has taught me that
the best way to beat a bear is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to punch it in the nose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I heard that you
could punch it in Theon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the grizzly bear point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Well, if you're
fast enough, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, not fast enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, at that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You, like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could just, at that point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're kind of playing GA with your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same thing with sharks, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you punch a shark in the nose, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it'll just be is that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that true? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would try. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna try it, but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nature's the wall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Slows punch the water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Punch literally giving
them a weak point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I punch the shark for massive punch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where are you gonna punch a deer? Huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can't punch it anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's got big spikey things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dodge at the last moment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can devil back that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, the bear is too big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> The bear is too slow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can Dodge the bear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you talking
about bears are fastest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> What have you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Seen the bear? Huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the most dumb
conversation we've ever had back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm at the corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're so if you see your bear, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a grizzly bear, you are
not running away from that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't outrun a bear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the best tactic is that
you can now run your mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe I can shout at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ask it kindly to talk it's nah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Let's have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why don't we ask
survivors of bears, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What they did to survive the bear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd like to ask how
many bears survivors do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's gotta be a few out there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Survivor dear survivors. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There are zero. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because no one talks about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause everyone becomes dear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause they know if they talk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> The deer's gonna come back for some. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The deer comes back with his family. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You'd Beni, you'd be snitching. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Talking up it's how many
horror movies are there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with deers as the main monster. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - People are too scared to
talk about deers open the next, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when's the next deer coming
out in the Godzilla trilogy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - DI's also dear king Kong converse, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> king Kong and Godzilla versus deer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They need to tag team the
ultimate monster deer, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It can go run super fast launch
itself in with those hooks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're done Gigi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So would you say the deer
is the most powerful animal? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is the most powerful animal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Spiritually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If we were to animal battle Royal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would you pick deer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who would you pick for an animal battle? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Royal animal kingdom. Battle royal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm definitely polar bear for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sure. I feel you are
going for low hanging crew. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel there's probably
something stronger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I'm trying to win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel there's probably better animals. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I maybe if you asked TSSU guy I'm Boris. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, the only reason
I say this is because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I literally saw a video where a polar bear </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tried was starving. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Had to eaten for a while. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> So he was trying to hunt
and he comes across these, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this group of wares. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno what the proper word is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The a herd Ori Sai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And he literally tried
totried to take a bite out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of any wars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the hides were so thick that he, that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he couldn't grab on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the wars just shook him off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he tried with several war wars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he just failed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So maybe it's wars that are at
the top of the figure chain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we just never thought about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The honey badger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That one's a scary one that one's like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the polar bear would
destroy the honey badger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man, honey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean human versus honey badger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The honey badger is probably gonna win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But cause I don't wanna
with a honey badger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is a honey badger? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a Badger that eats honey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No it's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes it is primarily honey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it it yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because isn't the whole, that crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Isn't the whole thing of
it with a honey badger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that its height is
so thick that a beasting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally can't penetrate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno. That's why
they're so that crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember I read something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - About man shrimp, Manti shrimp. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know Manti. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - About it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. My God that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what nature's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - See fish, it's always fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Man, shrimp is the bulky of the sea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why does this fish
have a cannon for an arm? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on with that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's not big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just gonna throw a fist
and create a Sonic. Boom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What happened with evolution? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's go I'm telling you
man evolution in the sea is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> When is the next stage above that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's oh I throw a punch
and a nuclear fusion happen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> With my fist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I mean, if you
sliced up a Manti strip, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it could possibly create a vacuum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That Sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The air and sucks his opponents in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what Bucky should
have done instead of imagining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a human size praying Manti. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He should imagined a
human size Manti shrimp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had a real challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Human size Manti shirt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bear's dead one shot oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's gonna be the one punch man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why we talk to you about this again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - One punch man of the sea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> One thing that I always there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think this is YouTube videos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where people kind of go
to nature and they're save </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the animals that are
being hunted or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I other animals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. And then they ask
David borough questions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you ever feel you should
help the animal that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being hunted and stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's no, it's literally nature. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would I interfere? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't understand why people
always make these videos being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> today we're gonna save
the fish from being eaten. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's that's literally the point fish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's literally called a food chain. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're just sympathetic cause </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> we're at the top. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly, if we're in the middle of that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> see you dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm trying to save my own life now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think caveman
really worried about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what nature was doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause we were trying our best to survive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - As well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a Seagul being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what I'm gonna save these fish today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I feel bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's no, they don't give a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're gonna eat. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> - Not that I would. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No a big if we're not counting humans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a big dog is probably the max I can go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause even then it's scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A big dog would beat you up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually I mean a big dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really big dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It could really hurt me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stick on a Wolf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it'll be hard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel if you are fighting to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - The movie, for sure. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, I feel you could take on a Wolf. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Not it's not a guaranteed win. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's on the edge of
what I imagine if I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fighting for my life is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is 100% success rate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, but could I possibly get
a WARF into a choke hold or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> something go UFC on his then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe if I had the right techniques, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all I'm saying human war
versus war in the Oxycon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> learn some BJJ, learn some B Jay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe you might have a
more fighting chance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think your dad got. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I think your dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause how small do you think a Wolf is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could take on a sheep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe you're gonna beat up a sheep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Beat up a sheep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not that I would want to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think the
sheep would even fight. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No I think she would just be just take me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Just take me away right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What about you con what about you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is the absolute
max that you would think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, I could survive this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Catfish could take a catfish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A cat up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The actually big one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people getting knocked out by catfish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> They jump out of the boat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never really think at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think about this either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe a very, there's some tiny monkeys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very small monkey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Very small monkey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe they probably gimme a good fight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. Definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It'd be three rounds at least of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Course con says monkey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It'd be monkey versus monkey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wouldn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course some of the
weaker gene of monkeys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On the weaker ones, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Species of monkeys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Could you take on a Chimp? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nerve chimps, chip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Well chip or murdery. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Why are birds so sassy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean by sassy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - They just have attitude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What so many I've seen, they. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fly I mean, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would be SASY to, if I would. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Be an, if. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally looking
down at you. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's, but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you the birds are prey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Aren't the sassy ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the domesticated, the
small, the small, the bird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The parrots, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The parrots it's powers
are sass as my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Well, so they freak me the cow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause their voices. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> How do they do such an
accurate representation </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of pretty much every sound. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Our family used to own a
couple of different species of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> a cockatiel anda Laura KES and stuff that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah. Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Something Keer recommended yesterday. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That was par was key. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Witness it murder trial as woman </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is convicted of killing husband. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's 11 Million views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what is the Paris? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just she did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Talking to par helped finger a killer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You heard right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Over five year old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mark Durham. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was found shot to death at his home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's crazy.
His wife was also found. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shirt with a gunshot with this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Par was they were both victims. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, that's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean yeah cuzmy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my parrot used to replicate sounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we would teach him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But he would also just pick
up sounds through osmosis. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've told this story how smash? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, you haven't told this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay. So we used to own this te, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is do what a Cockatiel is? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's sassy as. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, sassy mother. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, cause they're parrots. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sothey replicate a lot of things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sowe taught it to whistle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the Adams family theme song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> So every, we'd wake up in the morning </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it'd just be, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whistling the Adams fan and everyone was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh that's so cute. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then other times the sassiness </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would pull through on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this and he would replicate Sam on that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Confused the out of us. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So he perfected the
sound of the microwave. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Not just he would replicate
the buttons, presses perfectly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So he'd be beep beep </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Beep but then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when it's finished and it goes beep. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Beep it would replicate that perfectly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So many times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be in the living room
and I would hear that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would walk into the living into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the kitchen thinking that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone was there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one's there. I'm oh
my God, it's a ghost. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I realized it's
my it's my sassy bird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also it would
replicate the phone ringing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and show that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're really smart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it would also replicate
my mom saying good morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So it'd be it'd just be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd love it to go. Yeah. Can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's what I should have taught it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> If I ever get another
Laura kid, I'm gonna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna teach it to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Just to see how well it
could replicate that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I remember there's some
YouTube video where people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mix it badly and they put
beeps in it for some reason. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And when I'm in the other
room and It he videos playing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I hear a beep, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm what's happening in my kitchen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's I hate people who
do use beeps really loud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beeps in their YouTube video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just shouldn't do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno I was gonna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought you were gonna go a
different direction with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conversation cause I was
gonna talk about base boosted, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> monster zinc memes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - How are you going to transition to that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna hear how this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Happened because you were
talking about people putting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds in YouTube videos and stuff that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just yeah, I get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Ion a tangent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I still think the funniest thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the funniest videos
is just people who take the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bass boosted monster zinc theme. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You love. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It and throw it into
someone sleeping or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to me that is just peak comedy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno. I just wanted to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bring back the monster
zinc bass boosted memes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thats all I literally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Had nothing to do with the conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your mind is just here about
bass music, monster thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was playing fived chess, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying tolerate these two things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You were playing fived chess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We were playing checkers over here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So not even the same game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway enough about animals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What have you guys been
up to in the past week? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I built a PC and it didn't work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah I saw you a
Twitter thread on that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> That was pretty sad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So what happened with that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I was building it live, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which was more stressful than less time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think less time because we, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> did it three times rip Gar he went first. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Joey went first. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I went first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So doing it live was really
annoying cause I was actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reading chat when I just
shouldn't have read chat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because chat kept saying yes or no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd be is this the right thing to do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Half says yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Half says no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well shouldn't you
already know you've built. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It used to be the PC master, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah you've already
built a PC live one camera. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I pretty just done it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I just kept getting confused </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then when I get confused, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I get nervous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I'm live and I'm what
if I do something wrong? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then everyone sees that I did wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause people are laughing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I wasn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That the whole point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - On, but I wasn't really worried </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when it was my turn doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> live cause I'd already
seen two people build it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it was really easy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Right.
- Last she'd been more stress. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There was a speed run as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. And but it was okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I still some things up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I had the MDOT two. I
had trouble with a guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That MDOT two man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You flock with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I built this whole thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I spent five hours doing it cause I, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I up and was wasting a lot of time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and doing much of other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff and I was preoccupied. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I finally built it to
five hours. Eh, turn on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you find out why or why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's working now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the next day I gave up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was1:00 AM and I tried to boot it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it wasn't working. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was all right, fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give it a go tomorrow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll have a clear head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll try all the problems. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I basically took it all apart
and rebuilt it all again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going very carefully through it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the same era kept happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I even took the CPU
out, put it all back in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made sure I did all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, I just could not
figure out what was happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause it wouldn't go to the boot screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just black screen. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But everything, everything
was whizzing and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> glowing and all that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was oh. So then
I'm talking to gigabyte </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm Hey, what's happening? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why isn't it working? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Everything is working. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - And so essentially, because
I got a new specification, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was a motherboard that is
a DDR five Ram motherboard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right now to those who don't
know anything about PCs, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically every now and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they upgrade it and they're Hey, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> why don't we just change the
connectivity to with everyone? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it does make it faster as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but they change the specifications. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You have to buy specific things. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now this Ram slot that
was called DDR five. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll go on Amazon and buy DDR five Ram. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Well, apparently that's not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what you're allowed to do with DDR </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> five because it's new. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, motherboards have a
set list of specific DDR, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> five Ram that works with it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So not all Ram. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So previously I think DDR four, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all Ram basically worked
with all DDR four, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think kind of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never mostly, nearly all of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was ubiquitous you'd have
to try real hard not to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> So then I was oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Is that the issue? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It must be. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I ordered this new Ram
plugged it in, worked perfectly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I wasted two days. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was a hold extra day
trying to fix this thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for no reason. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the thing about
building PCs sucks to me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm never building. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Another one. To me I feel to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the hardest to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> the hardest part is actually
selecting the parts. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Because building a PC, we said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's frustrating, but you can it's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can get through it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's Lego. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - PC picker as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you actually to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Check for compatibility issues? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And it also wasn't compatible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's all good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> So it's all good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Go ahead. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Go ahead. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You got your, I. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, it's things that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That scare me cause I
remember the first PC I built, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the biggest thing that went
wrong was that I had bought a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> motherboard that was not
compatible with the CPU because I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bought a, I bought an Intel CPU. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I was just okay, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this me being a PC building Virgin. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was, I got, I bought the motherboard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I saw it was Intel compatible. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Not knowing at the time that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there are different types of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> CPUs and different types of chips. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That happened to me as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I had the motherboard as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The cooler doesn't fit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I just kind of shoved it in place </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it now it's working. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's that's scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's working. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was, this the first
PC you built in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or just the first one ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Third in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I built four PCs in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How did 20 mine? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, five. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - And you still somehow
found a way to it up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Again I went to PC park
picker and it said it was okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I had faith in PC park picker
cause in the previous four </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> times I've never had an issue. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But what happened was is that
the cooler they sent me was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one that was a bit older. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So it didn't include </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the adapter bracket to Mount the CPU. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But this thing had sliders. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I kind of slid them in the middle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which they were, they, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could tell that
things didn't wanna be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I screwed it on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But it works it all feels good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It all feels secure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you call Chris? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could have done in 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Helped you everyone was call Chris. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So he can tell me how
his McDonald's takes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can he talk about his Mac? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's pretty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I sure he did a live stream yesterday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was just eating McDonald. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw that and I was Chris, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is not what I
normally eat for breakfast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was what live? </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> a while now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause here's what happens. Right. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> I go back to the diet after I'm back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's this sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A healthy lifestyle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think it's a diet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think you should eating healthy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not a diet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am eating healthy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but I am definitely taking
in less calories than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it would take to maintain weight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm not this isn't a speed run, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's a slow lose weight gain a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a slow run. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a slow run. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, the reason is when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went back to then literally in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> September or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I gained a ton of weight because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I ate and I drank every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thin kit was the
first time that I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> physically feel my body had gained weight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much that I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw a few comments
of the before and after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Trash Taste recording after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I came back Trash Taste recording. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you can see that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I definitely, I definitely did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't say Overweight
or anything close to that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you could definitely see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did gain a little bit of weight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I've been working to,
since that won holiday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working to lose that weight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now that I'm taking in
lower calories every day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm doing things that
I wouldn't normally do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> having breakfast because normally I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally I, what are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You off functioning member of society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now? I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. I never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Eat breakfast getting on his
high horse. I eat breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So because I'm
taking less calories, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been getting hungry in the mornings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I'm oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe, it's time to start
being a normal person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone else in society
and start having breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people people to talk about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You been enjoying it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yeah, cause. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That doesn't sound you're enjoying it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's not so much I'm enjoying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it so much as I'm eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because my body craves something
inside my stomach because. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's usually what hunger is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is what hunger is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't get hungry at all when. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wake out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No I mean, either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never used to how
I start having salads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and low calorie meals every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I started getting
hungry in the morning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I only feel hungry in the
morning when I'm on a trip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But when I'm at home, I don't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually no on a trip, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even on a trip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Except if it's McDonald's
breakfast that's the only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> breakfast I always got time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No one of them vacation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm four meals a day sounds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - About right. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's just eat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's should eat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Exactly, why stop? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wake up at7:00 AM in a hotel room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm why am I so hungry? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's not normal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So me and Sydney have
been starting to eat cereal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember as I've
added cereal to my diet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you've been following my Twitter, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you'd know what I'm about to say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I remember eating the cereal one day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just oh no, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm about to have a food take. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And brace yourselves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I'm about to
have an opinion guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And I realize, I think cereal
is better without milk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh God he said it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, he said it and. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm 50 50 on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He said it. I like it with and without. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I remember just eating one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just said it casually to Sydney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she looked at me I
just murdered someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> She just dropped the spoon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - She dropped the spoon in the milk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is that really that bad of a take? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, apparently it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - weer bits in the UK as a kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to just eat those dry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think, because. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can understand that because
when you put that in milk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it just turns into wet cardboard. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I think it's better without milk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that that's what angers people's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's my mood, some days I want cause </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a challenge having to
eat cereal without milk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like you're eating Scooby snacks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well your dental workout is insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well I hate it when
you pour the milk in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the timer starts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just pour less than you
need. Just pour less milk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I just pour less than I need. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How much milk are you putting in? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm putting in the
normal amount of milk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's well clearly or not.
- You're not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's getting wet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, it's getting soggy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I hate soggy cereal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You should put a little
bit in and then mix it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> force it through the milk technique. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I also think that
waters it down as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're having cinnamon
crunch or something and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you I want the cinnamon crunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I want the crunch and
the cinnamon together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you put the milk in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You wouldn't putting
more milk water down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Wouldn't putting more milk water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out there no that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want any milk in
there cause It's the taste of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cereal as it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you just put a little
bit of milk, we just a we. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bit it, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It brings out the flavor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally put the bare
minimum milk if I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I just keep rinsing
it through the milk. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's exactly what I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that by the time you finish it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you only have a tiny pool of milk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you think it tastes better
with the milk in it though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just cause most of the
time when it's in no milk, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm tired by the end of eating. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, not that I, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not that I really eat cereal
a lot of cereal anymore, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but yeah, every time I do fell a cereal, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I just it's it's milk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just is cereal that good for you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just feel cereal is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't need it that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh it depends on the cereal. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It depends on the cereal. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A bowl of fruit loops. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Isn't gonna be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Brand is pretty good. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I brand flakes. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Brand flakes good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> But then I bought this brand
flakes in Japan and it had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fruit in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I was oh, okay, this sounds nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's got dried. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I look at the
back of the package, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like a normal serving
contains 50 grams of sugar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are they putting in this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's why I
stopped eating cereal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not just because I started
to not get hungry in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mornings as I got older. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so bad for you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of it is depends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The cereal you, it depends
on the cereal that you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Buy. I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure, if you're
eating a bowl of weetbix, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weetbix, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Then yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously that's got a
lot of, health benefits, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but also I don't wanna start
my morning with wet cardboard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just don't wanna start a morning that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sorry maybe you
just hate weebix joking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do I hate it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel maybe there's just no saving, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even with milk or without milk, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just tastes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To you I'm going to
be so non Australian. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When I say this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I hate weetabix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's it's and people are yeah, just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can just add sugar or yogurt or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other things into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I then that kind of takes
away from the health benefit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just gimme the yogurt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just I try. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll just eat a top of yogurt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> That's fine see, for me,
cereal has always been, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even now as I see it's always, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've always felt that it
feels like a snack. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause to me people have told
me that they can't get full </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> having cereal without milk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm just well, to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not even that hungry in breakfast, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to me cereal's just a quick
snack before we get to lunch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's your chat in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In my lifetime. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I've eaten more cereal
past 1:00 AM than I actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is the most perfect midnight snack to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really don't like eating
cereal in the evenings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well what about later night? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> As a midnight snack? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I always is actually really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - At midnight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I wish Id it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cause then I feel that opens
a lot of possibilities to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my midnight snacking options. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Unfortunately I. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dunno well, you snack
at midnight then what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's your go to midnight snack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I try to avoid it. Obviously
it all costs crisps crisp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean what wrong
with that? Which one with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just the most British
thing you've ever said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love Chris. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I should've seen this one coming up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like searching
through the recesses of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my mind to think I know Connor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What would he say? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm of course it would be.
- Chris. I can love Chris. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You eat that as a meal though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No sometimes For. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now seen, I've seen sweet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen you eat Doritos as a meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't lie to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no other choice doritos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's always a choice that choice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Doritos I don't feel good about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I do it. Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're good but I couldn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no matter how full I get
from eating just a burritos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't in my head. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't process that as this is my meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I do it and it doesn't feel a meal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm just so full that it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this will last till morning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I mean I'm sure it will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then in a lot of pain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've been there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Don't worry I've been there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I'm not a big cereal guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've don't eve neat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you eat it as a kid?
Cause I can't remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause I used to eat it a lot
as a kid and I don't remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the exact point that I
stopped eating cereal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I swapped to toast
when I was a kid halfway </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> through school, I must have
decided that I preferred toast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'd eat four pieces of toast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I had a very brief period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from to toast and then it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just very quickly went
from toast to nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like toast and
cereal are in the same category </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of not very good nutritional value, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's not the worst thing in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not bad, but it's also not great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually the moment I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually know the moment
I switched from toast to no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breakfast was when I started
having coffees in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No tea for me tea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just having a piece of
toast with a hot drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't beat it. Not even
that for me, it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just replace the toast
with a cup of coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do that now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do that now as well.
But from I'd say for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe 17, 18, I was just yep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Coffee that's all I need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I Woody toast in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the bread sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the other place you get
good bread from is bakeries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they're stupidly expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's 50 bucks for a slice of bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What irks me about a lot
about the normal Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bread that they sell supermarkets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just how thick it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It could barely fit my toaster. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think this is gonna make
me sound privileged as. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, I don't wanna cut the bread. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I wanna just Chuck that in the toaster. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've just woken up. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't wanna have to get the bread board </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out the bread knife out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, it's too thick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, I've caught it badly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want the perfect slide. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is not a privilege thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is just a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Absolutely a privilege thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is why they say the best invention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> since slice spread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally a human revolution. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't you just want to
just, do you really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Want what slice spread
really? That revolutionary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I want that the, well the yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna know why I've
never thought about the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually the history of that saying it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally takes 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To, but it's not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not the act of cutting it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the cleaning up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to clean up a
breadboard, a bread knife. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now just for one slice of bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just have the slice bread, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I Chuck that in have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What about if you just buy
the loaf of bread, for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the unco loaf of bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, on that day you
slice it up preemptively. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You put it back in the bag
and now you've got sliced. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's I did that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that's up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't really relate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You speed run it going bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, cause I. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't think
I've ever bought breads. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not been pre sliced now
that I about it in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> See, at least wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Privilege is showing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They call me privilege
for slice of my bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least I've done the
legwork I've been there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I've been in the trenches
slice of my own bread. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've lived that life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've lived a life of I've.
- On that now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - it's aside, baguettes or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never actually sliced my own wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Loaf of bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Call me privilege. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ed it's upper classes, season writing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the opposite of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people from England
have never cooked their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> own rice or something me and Asian. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never sliced my own bread before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there is a bakery
near me that I really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the loaf of bread
is six bucks I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - How big half is standard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sizes only that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Half a standard size. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just don't wanna pay six bucks for half, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've had. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because my, and I have to cut it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ron. Oh, me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For six bucks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not cutting that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For, I mean, I thought that as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then at my previous
place we lived right next to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this really high end
bakery anda full loaf, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this big was nine bucks or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is ode, still. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Still expensive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And I thought it was just
a scam being oh, just, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just Japanese people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - People it's this is
just Japanese people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Not knowing good bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But then and I bought it and I had it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to slice it myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God forbid I had to
slice it myself and yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I made toast with it and I'm okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can see why this is nine bucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was very good brand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it was not no, amount. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't pay nine bucks for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Outside of Japan is what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why would you pay for inside Japan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because every other
bread in Japan sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fair enough. And it's
look, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not buying this every day
for me, this loaf of bread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would this $9 loaf of bread </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would buy was maybe once
every couple of months. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How good was that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> In terms of bread in general, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this $9 bread compared to if you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were, it was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was better than any super get bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would buy in Australia or anywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was oh.
- I've had the same bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I bought it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was really, really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I was okay, this actually tastes here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> This is actually some top tier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is some a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How does it compare to
say the bread in Europe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think the bread that I had in France </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in Germany was better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Obviously that's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm asking how much better was
it than this top tier bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> top tier $9 bread that we have brought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In the know, marginally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it got to that taste
where it was just good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was very good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then that the one in
Germany or France will cost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one Euro 50 or two Euro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not even, I mean, opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So with rice, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you're having rice in Europe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then obviously the one in
Japan's gonna taste better just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - cause you know, in
the UK it was what we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> pound for Warton? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Was it Warton is the toast
bread. I love that toast bread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is very good bread.
Oh that I would know it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And even in the UK, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you buy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The animals when you buy the loaf bread </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the supermarket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one that isn't cut, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> can you cut it for me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll put it in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> You can buy uncut bread
at the supermarket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have bakery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We have bakeries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And where bakeries in the supermarkets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gone do what a bakeries? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's a bakery. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then when you get your pastries, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever, they all sell loafs of bread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ive pastries I've never
seen a loaf of bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. They have it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you want the loaf of
bread, uncut, you can buy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Who does that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who ask for that?
- A lot of people do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause a lot of people if
they're making their own stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then it's not a big deal
that they're cutting it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause they want it fresh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause the moment you cut it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the time is ticking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's already going bad, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why you don't want
to cut the whole bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then put it back in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause then those slices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that might have tasted a bit fresher. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Two, three days are gonna be rock solid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you never put your
bread in the freezer? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No cause that's the way to make bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Long lasting that's what
we used to in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure if you cryogenic
it last longer as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, this is not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the did you just say Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's an American thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We don't do that in Europe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's up. We do it in Australia as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We do it in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we do it in south. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Gets to preserve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. It's the 1000 degrees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's to make the bread last longer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's putting ice in beer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You, the you just don't do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And You gotta understand the
loaf for bread in the UK and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Europe it's bought on the day intended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to all be used on that day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not supposed to be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously you can have it a day over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not a big deal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you don't freeze the bread's because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because the Australian loves the bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's 20 slices. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So even a family, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't go through it ina day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> How big is this bread this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But just buy a small. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - This a lover bread's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's this big or 20 slices in it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So obviously 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Slices does it taste as. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good I want an image of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I image exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need an image of Australian bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - But yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What you, I don't believe this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's the big foot of
bread. This can't be real. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So just to make the
bread last little bit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> little bit longer because you don't wanna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have loafs of bread every day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Especially if you're
living in my household, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which was kind of half rice, half bread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This I'm not even the bread guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's the size of the UK one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they're way thinner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, they're needier.
- Yeah. But anyway, so yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> To make the bread last longer, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we would use the slices </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we needed to use on the day we buy it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then we, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it would immediately go to
the freezer because the last, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an extra two, three weeks, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and if you wanna a slice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and if you wanna a slice
of bread, you grab it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously it's frozen because
it's been in the freezer, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you throw it into the toaster
instantly defrosted taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just, I'm not even the bread guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I would never put myself
down to such savagery as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> putting a bread in the freezer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well I'm sorry you hire privileged. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People could buy bread
whenever you wanted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My family was saving money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your family had a
financial advisor show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> What you talking about? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - And our financial advisor
was freeze your bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We gotta change somethings around here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You want, do you want that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you want that new apartment? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You better freeze your God bread boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Asian mentality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Put everything in the
freezer last longer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Save money, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I think this is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Just your excuses for living like savages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're Australian. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If it was something oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we don't want the spiders to get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well that too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No because you get a bread bin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, because the bread bin would be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> annihilated by the ants. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> What? Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause we are in Australia. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You can't escape from the wildlife. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> You leave the door open
for one second too long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Your house is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Over rid by ants in summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one thing that makes me
not proud to be Thai is one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing that they do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just said it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they put ice in their beer disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I see the logic because obviously it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 30, 35 degree weather. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Beer's gonna get warm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Beer's gonna get warm a lot faster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But even me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just no, no ice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My beer please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No we're not gonna go down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is that an option you
can get at any restaurant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They normally or is
that a backyard thing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> By default in Thailand
in a lot of restaurants, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if it's open air, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You order a beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They take a cartel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They give you the beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they give you a glass and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put ice in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they pour the beer
in the glass for the ice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you have you specifically
ask in a lot of places for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them not to do that. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably trying to hide the beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is there anything
worse than watered down? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Thai beer water. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nightmare I mean, you see, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you do that with a charm beer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like this beer
was already watered down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're watering it down even more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Beer flavored water at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Point. Sorry you oven washing this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - German's had a heart
attack listening to that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the Fu but I've never, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> put bread in the freezer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll say that we've never
put bread in the freezer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey man, you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not saying you should. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just saying that's what we did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I thought it was normal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you have to put eggs in the fridge? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't remember where
I heard it from where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you have to put some
things in the fridge or some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> things are fine being left. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It depends on the country
and how it's cleaned. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I believe in some places in Europe, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they recommend you not to fridge the eggs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Can you Google this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If I'm recall correctly, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think we didn't keep
our eggs in the fridge </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> when I was growing up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think we did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think we did either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Japan you're
supposed to keep the eggs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the fridge or I don't think it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you have to, or yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to keep it in the fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - European countries say you do not have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To keep that's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's right really that's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I don't, we had it in a cupboard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, that's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And in America I think
they put it in the fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, I dunno about Japan.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> As someone who's was just born of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time I went shopping with my mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we'd buy eggs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The moment she'd open the front door, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she'd be like eggs in the fridge now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Apparently it's illegal to what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eggs in Europe so got stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Illegal so you're putting
the fridge actually gonna grow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Back to your, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The egg police are gonna
rock up to my door, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you're ah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Police I think it means for that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> transporting it and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Not that you go home. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, we don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> We kept them in the cupboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember that. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah bread. We've never
put in the fridge eggs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've never put in the fridge potatoes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think we've ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No potatoes were in the pantry for. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I think if
you put in the fridge, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it grows sprouts right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or some thing that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know potatoes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're not supposed to put
in the fridge and onions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I feel rules different
with a different country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I go to cause in Thailand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just 90% of everything
goes in the fridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's so much hotter there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously it's hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It goes in the fridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah hot and humid is not the best in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well that's the best, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> best temperature and
conditions for bacteria. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But other things you
shouldn't chocolate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're not supposed to put in the fridge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know I putting
chocolate in the fridge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Wait, why do you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, I think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you put
chocolate in the fridge, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it turns white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that just means that it's gone bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I've never seen I
chocolate in the fridge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This sounds some I love have
my chocolate hard into yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - White stuff is not that
the chocolate done out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just some other. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Stuff, what is that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Some other stuff I'm worried. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I always heard chocolate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I always heard you shouldn't
put chocolate in the fridge for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too long or you could, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't let it in the fridge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe that's just me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's either sugar or
fat, but it's not that the. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Chocolates. Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I definitely prefer
my chocolate in the fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's two states of chocolate that are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my favorite one is just
in the fridge it's hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You get a nice, nice crunchy bite of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the second stage would
where it's a cheaper chocolate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When it's perfectly room temperature, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but not melted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - When you put in your
mouth, it easily melt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - You put it in your
mouth and it doesn't melt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it just dissolves in your mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's that's my second favorite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't of chocolate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not that. It's it
gets all over your gums. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're when it's, you don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even need to chew at that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You put it, melt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just disintegrate.
- I don't want it to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a, don't it sit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I when it's cold, you can chew into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And its naps apart and breaks into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nice chocolate bites. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I that I don't that too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I've had some instances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'm what's gonna break first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the chocolate or my teeth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna find out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are some chocolates
that are way too hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For that there are some, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean the caramel bars I've
never put in the fridge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you put hard caramel on the fridge, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> goodbye teeth, your teeth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just literally
jaw break is just eating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rocks at that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. What about ice cream? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you do you like your ice
cream? hard or soft serve? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you like biting into your ice cream? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hard yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lollies, do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's on ice cream then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's an ice block. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Your ice cream hard or soft? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you've had feasts right where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an ice cream on, feast where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got a chocolate in the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's ice cream around it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you mean oh, that's more of a, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not so much ice cream though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's more of ice cream bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd say it's more of a cause
it's got a layer around it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I know a lot of
people they cannot take. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they cannot chew on hold things or really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cool things At all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. Can you not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, I love it too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where if I start chewing ice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I always hear you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll be talking to someone you'll hear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just look at it's ground. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not guy it's gone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It's God's not even looking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just staring off to the distance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing it crunching. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love crunching on ice God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's the best texture. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I love it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno why I just, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not good for my teeth at all no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been told by my dentist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and pretty much everyone around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me to not do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but there will be times where, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally have to
consciously not put ices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my drinks now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I do it so much
that everyone's advised </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me to not do it.
- Is that the real reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> why you don't put ice in your beer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't wanna ice, man the beer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you been in the social situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> or you're drinking your
drink and then you're right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna, I'm going to take this ice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna put it in my mouth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But the cubes a little too big </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and your mouth's really cold, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's in your mouth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's in there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's in one of your cheeks and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> your thing is freezing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And you have that moment where you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if I you're talking to someone, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't wanna look weirdo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You're if I bite into this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gonna look weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if I swallow this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I might choke and look weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what do I do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to reply in 10 seconds
and they stop speaking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do I spit the ice back in the
drink and looks like weirdo? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause if I go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so you were safe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you been in that situation? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, many times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm like my go-to option is normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just pray that you can
swallow this without dying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just pray. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No, my option is to just
start crunching on that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, that's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - The least weird one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The least weird one. I've
never had an issue because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm constantly crunching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anyway, I can't crunch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm always definitely worried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're just gonna think I'm a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weirdo when I spit it
back in, but I can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Cause if you spit it back in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're what the? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Spitting it back in
biggest is the worst. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not, but my teeth can't bite into. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It, but I also don't wanna be that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Who's so I've been in situation before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Keep throwing an ice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where I'm all right, boys, here we go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This might be it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I might be dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - But how many ice cubes have
you swallowed in your life? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uncountable, uncountable. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Moments, over 10. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - That a lot normally I would just try and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kind of what's your. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We kind of try and
move it around to get it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a swallowable size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or maybe not as. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fast as you can or maybe just get it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so that it doesn't have harsh edges. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You swallowed ice cubes with hard edges. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where they're full, cute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would be so terrified to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Normally the technique, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the problem is that this
is where the technique fails is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I'm normally doing
this after I've drank it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So now I can't use water
to assist it flowing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I swallow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I have to just swallow a dry ice cube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was saying that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you just take a swig of
water or something that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> will help that would help melt it a bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just swallow it and yeah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one time I think I had a
really big scare one time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause got stuck, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I remember I had to play it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I was I don't wanna make
them do a, he maneuver on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I would just kind of keep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Keep trying to swallow
it before I take a breath </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then eventually it
went down and oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my esophagus was in so much pain. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And by the way, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> never risk your life for a bit of social </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or witness just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I should have just spatted out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, it was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was terrifying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just chewing it a. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Real, I could feel it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it was so big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I could feel it going down
and then getting stuck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a little bit sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then waiting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And then obviously it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cause obviously my body's really warm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it would slowly dissolve. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So You just gave you
esophagus freeze burn or. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It hurt so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The lengths that British person
will go to not be awkward in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the social circumstance, just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spit it out at appointment just. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just spit it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I was playing the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will say if I didn't
love chewing on ice so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would probably do the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't wanna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I would rather potentially risk
having a choking incident as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opposed to having 10 seconds
of social awkward interaction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I really, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the British and me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we just can't we can't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's it's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Can't yeah, it's gonna be weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Speeding your ice back
your drink or whatever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> But I don't know how many
situations can you think of where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've say been to dinner
with some other person, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or what's the first date. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> First date with someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - First day, for example. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? If you're on a first
day with someone, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How many times have you gone
to a restaurant with say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another, a lady. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. And she's gone anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. And then that, at that point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your head's no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, I, part of me partly would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - When is, when is spitting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ice back in your glass? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The game changer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one of probably the least
attractive things you can do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks very unattractive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't you think? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So someone should. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think something that's less attractive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You choking on an ice? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You go no on a date. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's good show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I wouldn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I've actually been in the
situation four actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Not and I haven't swallowed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've just, I just remembered.
- It's on a date you want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they wanna know that you
swallow and your wellness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Show I wanna. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God are you.
- They didn't even notice it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They didn't even know
that you just swallowed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - And they probably would've. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> They can see my Adams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> apple and marching times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm I do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> My chest is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's the tissue technique. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the tissue technique. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because not for a big ice cube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're gonna see your
tissue on the table. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No, it's gonna be a. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't put it back on the table. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You go for the tissue. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You pretend you're just
wiping your mouth or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're just you salt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The I'm gonna, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've gotta be salt because
now they're gonna think, oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy just choked out a massive Louie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - In front of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This ice cube, this, this ice cube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you talking when you,
when you exude an exude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you take out on ice cube
out your mouth, you don't go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> God, this was, this was maybe a what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - How big of the ice cube were we talking? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is a four centimeter cubes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A four by four by four
by four centimeters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's say that's a big. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ice cube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I'm talking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No if it's that size, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never take the risk of putting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It in my mouth. I'm not
putting it in my mouth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was dumb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why I. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did cause caus eat that point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right at that point you
probably would've hardly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even drank your drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Huh? I'm the speed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's gone let say it's a bang in cocktail. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's an absolute winner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I love the cocktail so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or maybe, I wanna order a bunch more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna try for more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I drink it all and the ice cubes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are still fully formed because. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At that point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ice cube just doesn't feel nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Three if. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can feel the
edges on the ice cube it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't feel nice in your mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought when you say,
when you swallow ice cubes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought you were talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you buy a drink at
McDonald's or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you swallowing whiskey rocks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. No. It was I can't
remember which one it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally swallowing, whiskey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ice cube. It, it was a
Fullon formed ice cube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a nice ice cube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I wanted to put
it in my mouth because I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember, I honestly, I was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I can get this down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was, yeah. I'd been
training for a while. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I was I was 19. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I was, thinking I was fancy probably. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what I
remember the exact scenario. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember this specific scenario. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> The reason why I was so
committed to potentially dying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to avoid social awkwardness. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It was because I was a first
date and I was very nervous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she was very attractive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I really wanted this to go well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so you were I'm a eat this ice cube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so some reason I
think the 19 year old, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was tapping into the fit 15, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 12 year old to me that was
that ice cube looks real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because sometimes you see an ice cube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just put it in your mouth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause you are of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause you're dumb when
you're a kid and you want, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of course I, now I have no desire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It really depends. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It really depends as someone
who has eaten a lot of ice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> cubes in my life, an ice cube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As the ice cube cone I saw here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> so many different factors. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because sometimes, sometimes it's big, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but for some reason it's hollow inside. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you can take a good, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can Sometimes its
just completely solid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just a solid block
of solid block of ice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And there is not here is no
biting down on that unless </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's at least a little bit melted. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> At all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And at that point it's gonna
take at least one or two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> minutes, regardless of the social, social. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Situ I started doing the
grinding technique awful. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's awful for my teeth, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I take one bite and I'm oh okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This isn't a hollow one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Switch to space. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Two grinding technique. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember it was quite a hefty boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a waity boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hence why again? I wanted
to put it in my mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It looks, it looked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I want all the Trash Taste saids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of this taken outta context. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It looked too good not
to allow it to go to waste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So I had to of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Course, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me it's the opposite
for me. If it's perfectly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the edges are perfectly rounded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's peak ice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's peak ice to put in your
mouth that is peak ice to put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your mouth and it cause it all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Straight away with the giant balls, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the whiskey car's. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_06> It was all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also clear ice, superior ice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> superior ice to the
frosted ice that you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's clear outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and frosted in the middle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's trashed here, ice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Get that out. This is
just level one bartending. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> - Don't have a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I know a lot of
people who hate crush dice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yes. Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Actually. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I do hate crush. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I really crush. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I crushed dice. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why did you it's a slushy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You get okay so you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone knows my soda take right where I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the wrong one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just, I it where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you take a little bit of the fizz out and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me crushed dice has
more of a surface area to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to just make soda, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the perfect texture, the perfect flavor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> If you drink it with out a straw, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it is great because
if you drink it with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without a straw, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you get a lot of crushed
dice and you can chew it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get the best of both worlds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just this is you're yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't they bring extra, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> extra colors in the crown
package, which can eat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - One of them To draw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> This wants to eat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is I don't want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to taste the ice slush in my mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to taste the drink being cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is why when we go
to Denny's in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate their Iceman machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> The ice is always the the shaved ice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. And you drink it and you just get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a mouth full of shaved ice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> When you gotta do that
technique where you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I won putting it in my mouth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like it when it's at
the bottom of the glass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you do this and then just, oh my. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's the last
little bit where you get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Flavor it's basically
just shaved ice it bit more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The bottom it stay at the top. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean you go gotta drink it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go I mean it depends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because have you've hung out with me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you've seen how much shave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hung out with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've seen how much
shaved dice I put into there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Minimum the minimum amount of shaved ice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I put into a cup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I have the choice is half the cup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the minimum for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is right. When Gar
goes to the moody theater, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's wow, look how much value I'm going? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've drank four drinks today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's no, can't you've drank. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Buy this man buys chips and goes can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me the saddest sight
I've I ever see in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is when you go to a shaved
ice machine and people put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bit in a tiny bit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 5% of the cup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do 1% most I put any. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fill up with the soda, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd rather people put no in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you fill out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the soda, the saddest sight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just seeing one
or two bits of ice just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> floating around in the
soda that's doing nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally do nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why would you put ice in? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If it's all the ice you're gonna put in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not even in a cap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never given a. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never been seething
rage me God damn it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I have cause you can't
even chew on the ice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's why next. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause it's gonna probably gonna melt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm the point I'm gonna
predict God's next take. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He thinks that soup should be
exclusively eaten with straws. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, I don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's a drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Super a drink quick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So less rusty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Less rusty Curry is a drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I want clown take you
to come out with next. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm collecting them right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Just gimme more food to infinity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stones of Taste Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Taste can be whatever I want them to be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's only a
Southeast Asian thing. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you buy a soda at a stand or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno if I've told this story before, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you buy a soda at stand or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they will </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> serve it to you in a plastic bag. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that Southeast? Is that so yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes can they. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So can they not afford
plastic containers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or is this an artistic choice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know why it is right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember the first time, like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's as weird as a Bag.
Then I remember the first time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I thought this was a normal thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd go to a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Thailand every year and one of especially </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hot day you'd you'd go
to a stand you'd order, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a soft drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And what happens is they
will have a glass bottle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they will. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That, but that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So what happens is they
will have a glass bottle, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever soda you order, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll uncap it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they'll take a plastic bag out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just put in that ton of vice
in the bag and just pour </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the soda into the bag. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll give it to you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Doesn't sound that bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually. That's actually quite cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Give you a Comly large straw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They just give you a straw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - They give you a TWI straw with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So what happens? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's say you're well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is a lot of soda. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how much we talking? Is it
a normal can doing 30 mil? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Normal can, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's say you are halfway
through the can. You're oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna just put it down for a second. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can put it down when
you hang up, my drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do have to find a hanger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do I put. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It down? Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So a lot of restaurants
will have these little, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little hangers on the table or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kind of cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could.
- Just hang below the table. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could just hang the soda on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So if you wanna be excuse me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And Laurie drivers in
Singapore would have hope. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I complete for got about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they got the hooks as. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Question then cause we were
talking about chewing on ice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> How the do you chew the
ice from a plastic back? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, he shovels it with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - His hands you just
grab it with your hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you can't you
can't do this. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you're after you've done drinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you take the plastic, you get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you can actually just
take one by one and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and or you take the straw and you just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> so you scoop a little bit up also. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - These brand new plastic
bags or these reuse from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the guys, grocery shopping. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - You combine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got the Al bag bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm using little bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never really thought
about that until yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna knowhow clean that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I'd be very concerned
if he just whips outsome </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crushed one from somewhere I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Found a part of Southeast Asian culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we don't normally talk about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I realize cause. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's is a good drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's I surely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know this is complete
nostalgia talking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I like the way that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Amount of plastic in a bag
is enough to make one cup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No. What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> surely you can make a cup from one bag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's thinner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's thinner, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah but plastic bags are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I wanna know is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why do they not just give you the bottle? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Why that, because
you're on the ice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why do they have to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to grab the bottle and
empty it into a bow? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why can't they just give you the bottle? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I believe because they
just recycle the bottles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. So they send them back off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I believe that's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's you can get a lot
of drinks in south Asia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They come a tub. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So they scoop it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Into, but surely the plastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> The plastic use on all those plastic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You could just convert into one cup. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a lot of plastic
in one plastic bag. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> As, as the turtles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Well know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh no. I don't I think, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think a lot of
Southeast Asian countries at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moment have much awareness
about plastic and trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reduce the amount of plastic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I'm just generally curious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How, why it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sized back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just genuinely think that
that's just how it's been. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some dude was just one day was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what if we put it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I dunno, plastic back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That still be hilarious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a spread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could be show ignorance with that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm just surely there's a better way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure there is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But there is obviously
we are very wasteful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> with our cups and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We line Starbucks cups, wax </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and maybe they just, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno, maybe they just don't give a. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> They're just I just want my drink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't care what it's in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess, I would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, maybe they, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> are thinking in a recycling manner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where after they finish the drink, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll be right after the supermarket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Fold it inside out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Brand new there we go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All my groceries. So right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So you have a car, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The just cup holders is useless. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> You just or is it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't use car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you just hanging it up
on the what's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro God forbid you
get a bump in that car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> You go is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Coke all over. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You just go over a patchy bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Your coke is coming out sake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I should have tied it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - She a double, no, that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just ordered your
triple latte from Starbucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're going up the mountain road. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's oh, just Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Well no, what's the
worst is what if you are, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just walking along and then you happen to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Nick onto something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then the there's a tear in the bag </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you and you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Are spilling out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Then you're just. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You got a shotgun that has
happened before you just. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's something about a cup. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think we got it right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> A few thousand years ago. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we got it right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Comfort invented for a reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the cup is pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna sound an. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not trying to be your culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not saying it's the next
best thing after slice bread </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything, but it's pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure the cup came before the wheel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that was we had made it good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right then man, the
cylindrical can, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That, was the best invention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, I've seen that YouTube video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think everyone I've seen that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 13 Million views. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That guy going that's a pretty
neat invention actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the pressure is designed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. We, again.
- We get it. You watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - YouTube. Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Speak of YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Show, British. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Speak of YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been watching a few
more YouTube shorts recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even I know every time I go on a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube shorts binge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's bad for my health. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's it's to me
watching YouTube shorts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So watching Tik Tok is the
equivalent of eating McDonald's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or eating fast food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know I shouldn't do, but sometimes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes just lying in bed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just scroll
through and you're you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Want that quick meal? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you're 30 minutes have pass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've consumed nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I've fallen down to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fell down into this hole of life advice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube or hack YouTube shots. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh no, I've been there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. And it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember before where we went through </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that life hack phase </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of Buzzfeed videos. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Well the hack, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> isn't actually a hack. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I thought that died out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But apparently that just
went to TikTok. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. Cause I remember I saw, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw a few career hacks
of things you can do in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to help you increase
your chances of getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a job interview. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I saw that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there's this to of this is how, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is how it goes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The job interviewer offers
you a glass of drop of water. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw same thing yesterday ago. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> What is it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The white guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Little yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So the job interviewer
offers you a glass of water </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you take the water </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's the hack because the hack is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you take the glass of water, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when it's offered to you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they ask you a difficult
question and you just go, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, you see the thing is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the hack was because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have a glass of water, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it gives you more time to
think about the answer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was the hack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just losing my mind that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could call this career advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or 3000s and I'm who? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This feels the only
time I ever see people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take a sip of water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> road for the question
is the criminal trials. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when mark Zuckerberg was
being questioned on the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by the it, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every single question it'd be asked to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was using live hack, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He was thinking about those answers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I'm saying you don't
wanna look a criminal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when ask you a question
you don't wanna be going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel a more logical thing would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can I just take a bit of time
to think about this answer? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because you gotta seem confident. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd be that is a fantastic question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Think the way to appropriately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Answer that no, you, what
if you combine it right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You gotta combine it with the water. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a fantastic, what. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What if the water doesn't
give you enough time? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are, you just Downing
an entire Jack of water? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You're sitting there have
10 minutes just going. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're gone what's
your favorite food is, oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, what if or what if you are just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get offed the water. Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And you're just really thirsty. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then you get to that
really difficult question. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're just what do I do now? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> The TikTok never told. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Me, sir, you've gone
through three liters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of water during this interview. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I are you feeling okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would just say 99% of
life hacks or some I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately forget and never
remember and will never, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever practically use. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah absolutely so many of them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially when it comes to survival, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these kinds of hacks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or advice you see on TikTok. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno if we've ever talked
about this on a podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we've only talked
about it in private, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the SHA financial advice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is an entire genre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My favorite which is an entire, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think an entire genre of
video on TikTok and YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shorts now where it's
justShaq, motivational, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life advice and half
it is just taking your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paycheck and apparently ripping and hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So Shaq, what's the difference between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> being rich and being wealthy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's when you're rich, you do this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but the wealth you do this 1 millions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Thank you, Shaq. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I am no longer poor now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Shaqs I will. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Poverty Shaq is a very
nice, guy's very generous. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> He I'm sure the financial advice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the problem is with a lot of
these financial advices on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> TikTok and YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And again, I think Shaq is
somewhat guilty of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It assumes you are even
making enough money to save. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> most people don't, aren't
able to save money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Exactly cause we're right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah most people spend all their paycheck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How do you then go to them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just not saving enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just not saving enough that rent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe you can get rid of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Who's living on minimum
wage and being oh, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I didn't are there people
who spend irresponsibly? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Hell yeah, there are. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that the reason is
why everyone isn't rich. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> No and no, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just so weird falling
into this hole of just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the, you see these TikTok
with made up scenarios where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the perfect life hack for
that scenario will pop up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's always the same. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's one guy is in this part of the frame </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he's so you want this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then another guy, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the other frame probably with glasses. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's not how you do it. It's
literally, always like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And with the worst acting
and the worst script, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it's 20 million views and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm quitting my job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Terrible at my job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just an entire genre
that just takes place in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the damn universe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just the extended
Darman universe where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything just works
up and cause of these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I drank water in
my job interview, the DCU. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The tar cinematic universe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh wait, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the one that also just that
I've been getting a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recently off YouTube shorts
is the ones where the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ones where they take, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's five minute
crowd off to life hacks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then there's always some dude, who's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna find out if this is
actually legitimate or not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they try themselves and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, what's legitimate for more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So many of those, so
many times where it's oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> if you get a black marker, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you draw it on your hand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you take a
picture of it on flash. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Then it apparently zaps you some that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's always some guy being no, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's not factor or cap. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All right, let's try it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Let's try and figure cap. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - My let's try and figure it out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - My new favorite shorts or to
category is the tos that need </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> way more explanation
as to what's going on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But the person doing
the video does not offer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> any explanation as to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> why they're doing the thing they're doing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was one time I watched
this TikTok and it was a guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was so here's how I made
a case to carry my iPad farm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he makes the case </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and me and all the other comments were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why do you have an iPad farm? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I've seen that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - With the long case. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he made this video just
explaining how he made a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> case for his iPad farm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was the whole time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why did you have an iPad farm? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He makes this iPad farm to test out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If he could make enough
passive income, that's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It? Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - To justify making an iPad farm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there are so many
layers to this TikTok </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I just want answers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To. I'm question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How are you making this money? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - First of all. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what passive income revenue, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What new are you doing? What
is this app you are using? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know there's some
people who run Spotify farms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and have tons and tons of phones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And you play the same
song on Luke Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> And then they get revenue from it. Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But obviously you've used
a lot of electricity, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's kind of, there's
some things that, but yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, it's, again, there's
so many of these where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we are gonna do this thing or that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or you felt you just came
into the 90th episode of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a show and you're what is happening? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the people making the
videos don't think that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anyone might need context or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just one line, let know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I know exactly what you mean though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause they'll always start off the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've just last time I made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> DDO that could fly or something that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you guys have been
asking me to make this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm going to make it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just what missed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Got so many comments saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you should make it Harvard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm what have I missed
in the law of this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how far back do I go? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the thing is it's impossible to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> try to triangulate this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you click on their
channel or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not always in
chronological order either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube shorts is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's so many different holes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can slip down into
YouTube shorts and TikTok. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's insane as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Because especially with
the YouTube shorts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause I don't really use
TikTok, but with YouTube shorts, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it knows exactly what to recommend you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> next because it's oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you spent one extra second on
this one shack motivational </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Tik Tok that must mean you one 20 more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's why some to I'm if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I watch a video that for too long I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now the algorithm thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now the algorithm thinks I this video </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and the next 10 videos will
be something to do with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish there was some
way to just tell YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't like the video that they sent me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but unfortunately they
removed the dislike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know there's a lot of
talks of YouTube shorts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that watch and I'm I hated this video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna let them know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hated it without being an, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I can't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I just have to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've already given them my watch time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I've for all YouTube notes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was the best experience in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one that made me fall
down the Arabic hole for YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shorts for me is I saw this one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube short of the founder of two Chan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause live streaming thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he he's called hi Yuki. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bu he's very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause he is the creator of two Chan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's a bit based in his opinions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Gamer very controversial opinions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Using based in a negative. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And based in a negative term. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I just watched one because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't believe the answer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And now my YouTube shorts are
just this Japanese dude saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of racist and controversial. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was I don't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't watch this because Id it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I was trying to
process what the this guy was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Talking about well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's been a lot of criticism of YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Facebook and all these platforms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> They push you to the more
fringes of the content and yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean that's one of the parts that's not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I think one of the weirdest ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've the, one of the weirdest genres </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen that's popped up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recently is we've gotten to
the point where YouTube shorts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are now commentating on YouTubers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where you'll beLu wig
just did this last week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You won't believe what he did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm this why Sao doesn't take spar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Right I was right, cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess it's Mr. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Be just sent chocolate
bar to every influencer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's new slash. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno, it's just so weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So weird it's just so weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Seeing all these new genres
and new types of content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pop up on, I guess a new, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a new type of platform
and everything that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I don't understand it at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you think YouTube
shows gonna stick around? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you think it's gonna
get to a point where. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's going to be stuck around? So yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's gonna stick around
it's it's what it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the long form content
is still very valuable. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yes and that's what makes the money. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Of course yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Until TikTok find a way to
properly monetize that platform </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> without paying their
creators way less than </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> what they deserve than. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think long to long form
contents will be king for now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's show's we have
zero bias whatsoever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Absolutely zero bias. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Upload ridiculously long video to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You. We only upload six
hours of content a week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But Hey, that's just a theory. </SPEAKER_03>
