<SPEAKER_02> milk and what is what is so good about </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> it's like the breed of cow i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man it's just rich it's real rich </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like full cream right yeah and i </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> milk ice cream but it was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> intense milk hit you yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i saw you posted a picture of like beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ice cream as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah yeah yeah just just to prove </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that japan does every flavor of soft </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> serve i don't know why you'd ever want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beer ice cream yeah there was like ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cream that was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beer and i was like i mean sure i'll try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it i like both these things individually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even alcoholics are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't imagine a beer flavored anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's aside from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> beer and it tastes like a ski ice cream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah what's that what's the weirdest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> flavor of ice cream you've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> rum rate i'm sure i don't know how dare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they do that [ __ ] here with food they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't care about the boundaries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i like both these things let's make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into food that's that's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> equivalent of [ __ ] what's what some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> americans do which like buying of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mcflurry and then just dipping it with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fries okay which just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> blows my mind okay but actually i kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of like that no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no no what it's pretty good i went to i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> did [ __ ] aki took me to a steak and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shake once which is where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the optimal place of where you do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i just saw like six americans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dipping their fries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into their shakes i'm just like i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't be here i have to leave we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living in a first world country dude why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why why are you eating like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly like i don't do it often but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes pretty good when i've done it you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't get it it's like oh it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nice it's it's the synergy of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> saltiness i see the fries and i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand why it works it just does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it doesn't also steak and shakes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the most depressing place in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> america </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i i went to one at like midnight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i was like yeah maybe it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you went at midnight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a dollar fifty burgers yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah jesus christ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know you've never you've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been to a white castle before that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have never been to a white castle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before is is it does it meet the hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> white color what the hype of what what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know because i i i only know white </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> castles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that one movie right uh what was it how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> would harold kunma or something oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and so white castle doesn't sell burgers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they sell sliders </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> okay right so it's like the tiny yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's what's the difference between a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> burger and a slice like a mini burger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slider is just like a mini burger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently right i don't know where it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> comes from but basically they sell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sliders instead of burgers right but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like normally right like when you buy a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slider it's like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to some american restaurants and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i like me like you know like like my uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken parmesan sliders like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> shit's bomb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't say it like that parmesan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh what do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that hurts me hearing that all right go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ahead anyway that chicken like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> favorites are like chicken parmesan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sliders all right so it's like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chicken parmesan then you put like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some lettuce in it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's [ __ ] nice but white castle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sliders is literally just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two soggy buns and like the thinnest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> patty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in existence it's like paper thin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> patties and it's like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like you can get like a pat like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a six pack of six packs of slime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a six it is it's like they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they box it like a six pack of sliders </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like four dollars or something i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this is true depression all i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know is that everyone i know who goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there has like the shits afterwards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah yeah just like like to me that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how on earth we've got to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where that's just an acceptable outcome </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how is it how is it that like americans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have gauged like the the tastiness of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a fast food joint by how much this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stomach is just destroyed the next day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what people are like oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not a good chili's meal unless i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] myself constantly the next day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel the same with indian though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i i i have to destroy the toilets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sure after a good indian soil </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but at the same time i can only do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like at most once everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a burger shouldn't do that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> indian i've always accepted that indian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does that yeah because of the spices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like bread and meat what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> happening like what what what when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the oil yeah okay you know also the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> most egregious thing that i hate they do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that they put the grease on top of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the burgers yeah that's disgusting yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah who did this and who who likes it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember going to steak and shake and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they did this to my burger and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like well i don't want this anymore why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you do this it's like you took the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worst part of the meat which is the part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes you feel sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have you put it on top why i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i was staying at uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney's like family's house in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wisconsin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they got like a takeaway pizza joint </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one day yeah and one of the big selling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> points of this like takeaway pizza joint </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is they had like garlic bread </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the selling point was that if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put like a wet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a paper towel on the garlic bread it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would literally soak it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in oil and they were hyping this up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yo if you put the if there's so much oil </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this that if you put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the wet paper down it will soak it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll become completely wet and i'm i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how is this a selling point why why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would i want to eat this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like that simpsons episode when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like homer's trying to get like so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fat that he gets like the disability </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and dr nick's like grab the burger rub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it against the piece of paper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if it goes see-through you can eat it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i thought it was like a joke i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought it was satire no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they literally like marketed it as this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> garlic bread is so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oily that you can literally soak up an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire paper towel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and i just think about it and i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i hold it in my hands and it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> literally dripping and i took one part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and one bite was enough for me that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the pure survival food because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sheer amount of oil could like power a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lamp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have you ever heard of this american bow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> joint called the heart yeah yeah of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> course of course yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah they're [ __ ] i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching a video yesterday of this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who ate the the biggest one there which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is called the quadruple bypass burger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and it's literally think of a big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mac but snapchat i've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> big macs on top of one another yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like i already thought that it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like 20 000 calories as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy like demolishes it in five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes i don't know how the [ __ ] he did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but the part that got me was he was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right we're getting to the bun now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh the bun by the way is soaked in lard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like you oh you shouldn't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> shouldn't so no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a piece of bread should not be soaked in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no nothing should be soaked in pure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] fat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah oh yeah also the the fries were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oiled in pure lard as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's disgusting like i i just get a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shake on top of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't understand the appeal of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just ridiculous it just sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gross it looked gross it looked like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something out of the alien movies like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't want to put that in my stomach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> why do people hate their bodies like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's only like some let's say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cuisines you can only enjoy when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> want to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> destroy your body and that's probably at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 3 a.m </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah after like out of five guys yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> out of five guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like i i can never eat a kebab sober </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like something has got something has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gone wrong with me like something has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gone wrong with my life if i'm eating a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kebab i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm completely sorry no you know i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hella depressed when i'm eating a kebab </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for lunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all right i love a lot like a great like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> burger with a bit of grease on it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and not even drunk me would pass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right and the heart attack grill to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me is just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there is no reason why i would want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> come here other than to feel healthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like like and just look yeah because any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meal you have after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to the heart of that group you see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the other patrons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like oh i'm doing pretty good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for myself hey like damn okay maybe i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't changed yeah because i think the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the selling point of the heart attack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> girl is that oh first of all like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you walk in they put on like a hospital </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gown on you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they sit you in a wheelchair to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wheel you in and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the kicker if you weigh over 300 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pounds you get the meal for free </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like it should be the opposite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you should be like if it's like taxing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the bridge right if you're already fat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well you should be you should be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> charging at least yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to force you to maintain this egregious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> weight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i feel like the concept of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heart attack grill is just kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you you hear it and you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like fiction right this is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is from like some dystopian society this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is from like some george orwell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know right like this is how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this is this this is how they fatten you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> up before they dispose of yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> watch these like 500 pound like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> live videos oh 600 pounds yeah whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you watch it and you realize like most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of these people just have like trauma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like at what point do we like start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like okay maybe it's not trauma if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he's walking into the heart attack grill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe that's a maybe like that's on him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i mean like i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a beyond a point of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comfort food and there's gotta be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all right this is just his fault like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is you know what i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because because these shows these videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like these 600 pound people do a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] good job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and making you feel sorry for them and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be like yo man okay yeah like his parent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> died at like five yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah eating disorder for some reason for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> some reason at the age of five his mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was taking him to the heart attack grill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's the only way that she can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember him and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay i get it i get it i sympathize with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but should you yeah it's like what if my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parents were like well they've just left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me crack it's all i've had since the age </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of ten would they be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would i be like doing crack but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just comfort it's comfort food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food to me it's like there's a clear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> limit to the point where you've got to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> be like all right well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i should stop feeling sorry for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you yeah that that's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh no i i never watched those shows to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like feel sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i've noticed i i watch them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they they do a really good job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making you think damn like i guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they set up me that's the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they set up the they set it up as a sob </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story yeah but what you're seeing and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what you're hearing is like the complete </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> two different things because i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> somebody was a little chubbier not not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nowhere near that level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i get it i get how you can gain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> weight but there's like a limit of where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think that it would go beyond anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause some of these they're eating like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know like [ __ ] 15 hot dogs in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with like cheese and chili on it i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah i think i would draw the line </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think that's right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well that's the thing right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the thing that surprises me more is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is not the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this you know they like complaining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about having all this weight problems </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> proceed to eat a whole [ __ ] box of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chilis right yeah but it's also just the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> egregious amount of food that they can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somehow stomach i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's just looking at it makes my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stomach just doesn't make sense to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i feel like you must like you must </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have just grown up with this and because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time i go to america i always like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the food portions in there we've talked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about this before i'm massive man yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like i'm forced to like have to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these massive food portions and like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] great yeah after after a week of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> staying in america </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like is there a salad and i asked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the salad and what comes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and what comes out it's a [ __ ] forest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like they're saying a [ __ ] salad it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like six heads of lettuce </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the amount of dressing is like the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as the meal because it's like 1600 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> calories one of my [ __ ] rabbits i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like did you deforest the entire amazon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rainforest just to put on my plate like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this this is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like food portions we're talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about here it sucks man because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so unfair because we like if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get fat in japan i feel like that's on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you yeah yeah like but if you get fat in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> america it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well everything was set up against yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like welcome to the system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everything was set up to make you fat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah so it's like how the [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's not fair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why i like because like my my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> diet in america is awful obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of the food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like also like i get to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have something but something but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something not greasy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and especially like in the midwest where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like you know where it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> countryside there's a lot less choice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> healthy choices up as well so you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of forced to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like hey you can have you you kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to cook for yourself and if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't cook for yourself then you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you know that's why it's so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> harder to eat healthier over there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than it is say say in like japan yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but but even then in america i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i went to the uh to walmart and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay let's get some healthy food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was really hard to find like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff yeah the actual healthy like stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i i go to the next aisle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a whole aisle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this blew my mind of hot dogs a whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isle of hot dogs not sausages </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hot dogs and i was like this is insane i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought there was only one type of hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't realize that hot dogs were any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different from each other because they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all taste the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hot dogs never taste any different do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you ever notice it when you go to your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friend's barbecue or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they give you a hot dog have you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever been like wow this tastes different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from my hot dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no no it's always like i put mustard on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it but yeah that's how you differentiate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it they all taste a [ __ ] sense i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all the different like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brands yeah and somehow they had like 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a whole aisle of hot dogs i was i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> blown away i was like this is insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i think like like there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> difference in like sometimes it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> filled with cheese and sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't do that i don't like that really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no i like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no no no because because this is i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it because this is because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because this is american cheese we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about yeah that's not real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cheese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it was if it was filled with actual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like real cheese then yeah i'd be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> little more i'm pissed off that they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> managed to infiltrate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan somehow this is whenever you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything with cheese on top of it here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's such a gamble whether it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> americans like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] [ __ ] americans see this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the advantage of not putting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> condiments in everything i can actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can actually taste the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difference between a normal hot dog and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a cheese hot dog and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes because that is an important life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> skill isn't it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yes i i know i can't differentiate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> between 10 different brands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why if you just put condiments on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it all the time then it just tastes like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the condiments right you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't get to taste the sausages in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> different way do you think we're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] drowning out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hot dogs and sauce honestly it looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of looks like it a lot of the times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is christ i just if i gave you five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brands of generic hot dogs would you be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> able to tell the difference between any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of them because i wouldn't be able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh that just sounds like a trash chase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> special anime i mean i'm not that big of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a fan of hot dogs but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i can what is like a food that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could like if we gave you like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different types of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you'd be able to differentiate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not tap water i can i can differentiate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> between tap water and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal water but not like everyone can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not say like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voss water i i don't understand why what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never heard of [ __ ] water it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like the really really posh water that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> comes in a glass bottle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um you can see it on screen now and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only like the really high class hotels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i've like i've sampled one before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember because it was like i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really really thirsty and it was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was it was the only water available </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and um it just tastes like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there is no difference between the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bottled water brands i'm convinced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then when you watch how they half of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them [ __ ] get their water half of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comes from the same [ __ ] place which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the normal taps that all the people are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> using in the area oh dude you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the one type of person that i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never be friends with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when someone will take a sip of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like oh this is hard water can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i get some soft water please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i knew people like that i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people like that in california </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hate you i knew someone who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could only drink uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a brand of humber which brand it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> made with avionics they literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> refused to use any other water and if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they used </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> boiled water like in like cup noodles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> had to be boiled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> evion can you believe this yo but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't i don't know man i i i don't like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> i i have gone through a phase where i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting laundry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on youtube and then this is what happens </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> because like if i can taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the sink in tap water then then it's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> when you're hungover </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when i'm hungover there are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely different levels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel different levels of hydration </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i'm hungover because i need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i when you're feeling like [ __ ] and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just want to feel hydrated again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's when like i i i will stick by the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bottled water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time over tap water i mean i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> take tap water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just drink a liter a liter of whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is near me oh dude like if if i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if depending on how hungover i am </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll [ __ ] drink a liter of toilet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> water like any anything to just get yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah no that's what i'm saying that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what i'm saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's like it's like you ever like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turn your bidet on and go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i have seen a japanese youtuber do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> god and the world wasn't it didn't go it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't go out well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah i don't know i guess maybe it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because at least in sydney like out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like bottled water is almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> non-existent in sydney because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> legitimately the tap water is just as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good as the bottled water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and also bottled water in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> australia is [ __ ] expensive it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you a bottle like that big is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> four dollars i only buy bottled water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm out and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't just find a tap to drink well i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mean here right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah no here like because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bottled water is cheap right it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hundred yen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so that it's a little bit more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> affordable but in australia it's if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone was like yeah i'm just gonna go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the woolies and buy a four-door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bottle of water what about water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fountains do you drink from water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fountains </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i drink from water fountains when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like a lot of this has come up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from my upbringing because in thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> tap water so i've i've just gotten used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to being like always blind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but like i i do genuinely think the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste of tap water tastes like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i am </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like i can taste the chalk where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no in brighton in brighton i'm in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just tastes metallic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it tastes really metallic and i'm not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fan of the metallic taste i i mean i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was nice in wales and it was kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> meh in london and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here i felt it but in london it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sucks yeah london i don't know but then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like london are you getting that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cholera [ __ ] dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't trust the water in london </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean wales is nice the quarry was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right next to me as well no i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i don't know how it is in other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> countries but everywhere i've been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like a big city </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally i don't tap water tastes like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] countryside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like if okay if you're in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hotel right and you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're really thirsty do you go for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the bathroom water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or do you go for the do you go for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fridge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mini bar water well you pay for it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no [ __ ] way am i paying for that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no no i'm not paying for that no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm going straight to the tower no way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the worst tasting water the hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bathroom water is like the worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now dude that's where i draw the line </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's where i draw the [ __ ] line i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never paying for water in a hotel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are you [ __ ] kidding me that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ridiculous it's like yeah i feel like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hotel is the one place that should not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> be allowed to charge for walls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i mean you're already charging up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the ass to stay in though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm paying for a basic necessity which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like being somewhere and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna charge me for water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] off yeah in a way i mean for me i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely can't taste the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> difference anyway so if i'm like shout </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out to the hotels that give you bottled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> water for free </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah shout out to the you are the real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> g's yeah so i don't have to [ __ ] go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> through your voss water and not like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just one bottle they give you like four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like go ham man like we fill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> them all every day the best is like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you come back from a day out and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bottles are like bad yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's the good [ __ ] on the topic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of food so with it being christmas right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now and everyone's just had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their christmas meals and everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that what uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what are your what are your preferences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your christmas meals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i i'll be honest like so so last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> year we all celebrated christmas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and we had a hot pot and yeah about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> traditional </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was it was a great [ __ ] hot pot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but i ain't gonna lie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just it just just felt like something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was missing yeah it's not that's not the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] turkey and whatever chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> okay i i will say this i think turvie's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> turkey's overrated as [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't i don't understand the hype </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> behind turkey turkey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i think turkey is just like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> inferior chicken it is it is right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like imagine chicken but just drier with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> less taste that's just turkey like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why all the holidays you know what it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's someone who just got a turkey and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just went into photoshop and did this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like everything is thinner it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just bigger i think if you have like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> real nice turkey like that's been like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seasoned well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you it's i think it could be no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the problem with turkey is that if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if it's seasoned well right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get you get the outer part and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's nice and seasoned but then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get to the inner [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> triangle that's why you gotta cook it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're going to cut it in a way where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get like the skin and the meat in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the same bite but you can do that with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but with less price yeah yeah but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like you can make a turkey like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> skin taste better than chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know it depends welling agrees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know maybe yeah but melanie's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> american </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay so if you don't like turkey then do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you like any other meats because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes my family used to do like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> duck or ham oh my my dad would make like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a roast ham yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought rice pork right i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> genuinely like pork is the best for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas i know it's turkey's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> traditional and chickens like the backup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i think we never did turkey at home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really i think a good [ __ ] ham is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't beat that [ __ ] yeah wait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> define what you mean by ham do you mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like roast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pork or like we we did like uh we did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lego hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you could do either like because i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really like ham </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like like roast ham because i don't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anything this is [ __ ] meant like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i know like what's wrong with that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like a gammon steak </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like that yeah it could be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like not a fan of gammon that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the inferior part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's amazing it's literally it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> literally the opposite it is literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more expensive bacon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's literally what gammon is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've never heard what is a gammon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> gammon's like a way more like a meatiest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh cut of the the pig oh that's normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more expensive than because bacon is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cheapest part of the pizza right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and it's [ __ ] and gammon's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the actual bacon's the best part of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pig </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thank you very much you've been [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brainwashed gone like you think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bacon stuff that's how are you gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> argue argue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that bacon is not the best part of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pit it's the most overrated part of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pig </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bacon bacon used to be like the [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i literally know vegetarians who have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been converted to meat eaters because of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bacon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's just it's the meme right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone says bacon is like the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> food right it's because americans put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bacon with everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because the smell of bacon there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is nothing that can like match </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just think bacon is like it's it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that great like it just kind of tastes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay just give me like a nice piece of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> pork especially the american bacon [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about american bacon is american </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bacon is the best bacon it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> awful it's the best bacon like stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> clapping man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> british back bacon is like the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bacon it's the best way to have bacon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like no i just don't have bacon because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right normal bacon is like 50 to 70 like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the american one like fat it's more fat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> than yeah that i'm not saying it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> healthy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but i'm saying it tastes [ __ ] bad it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't taste good like fat inherently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just tastes like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the meat is the best part no no no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no reason why it's more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> expensive one thing the one thing i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't like about bacon is that it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way too overpowering especially when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put it with other things like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you have like a if you have like say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you put bacon on a burger for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of people love that [ __ ] right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but for me when bacon is on a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> burger all i taste is the [ __ ] bacon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'd rather just ha i rather just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> replace everything with bacon it'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> taste the same it's like it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nicest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i like making my burger because i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need any ketchup or mayo or [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever my burger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know sauce whatsoever on your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> burger no you're [ __ ] clown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like that's probably why he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> likes turkeys as well because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the driest [ __ ] bird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is like water this water that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want my bacon to be all fat just give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me the [ __ ] give me the driest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] burger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and non tap literally streaky bacon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is like more and beyond the better bacon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is street </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> streaky bacon is the american bacon so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i didn't know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like because whenever americans british </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bacon is similar to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a canadian that's the way they say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's it yeah to america </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> british bacon is just like half so so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> british bacon is more like it's like 80 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to 90 percent bacon right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like 10 fat on the edge yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a thicker right yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and like as a kid i i would hate british </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bacon because i would just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i would just like eat the bacon pass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> first and then like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> save all the fatty part for later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that was the best tasting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fat on its own and you're actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> disgusting because it wasn't even safe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't the fat part it was the fat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like the little piece of meat in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there and then i realized that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> american bacon is just all that see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> american bacon is just like the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part of the bacon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because actually like we actually had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> podcast where you were arguing about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food and then you sit here and tell me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you just want to eat fat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like you just want fat and i should give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and this man doesn't eat the crust on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pizza right it's like it's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fatty part of a bacon is literally the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equivalent of how you've labeled a crust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on a pizza no it's the [ __ ] opposite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the crust and the pizza tastes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the the most tastiest part of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bacon is the fatty part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why americans have figured out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the best tasting part of the bacon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they've just taken the streaky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bacon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the the most tastiest part and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they put it all in one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> put it all in one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because if it's just if it's just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bacon part like i've talked about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bacon part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just to me like pork is just vanilla </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> vanilla beef we've talked about this and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the only part that's better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fatty part of the pores like pork </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> belly pork belly tastes [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's mostly fat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you got to eat okay okay i admit pork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> belly's [ __ ] bomb yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is cooked differently yeah yeah and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also not a very like cheap part yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bacon is enhanced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's an expensive part of the pork </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's no it's because of the fat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's because it's because of the fatty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> content that's what gives it the flavor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but if you just eat the pork </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but pork by itself i think it's a shelly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> flavor with more meat added yeah so you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get chunks where you get a bit like half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and half fat right but that's like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actual like richness to it because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> chunky it's like an actual like black i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't [ __ ] with the taste of bacon </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> okay there's there's like a perfect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> noodle right because if it's too jelly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's basically like a solid it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> should be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing more depressing than watery </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gravy you know right you when you pour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that [ __ ] in if it splashes it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's too yeah like it needs to like mold </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> advent calendars i've seen is like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a wooden thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you open this like wooden door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to like open the chocolate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my mom like refused to pay more than </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> i see what you're doing here i i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know if it's like a mental thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for some reason to me advent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> calendar chocolate just tasted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better and i don't know why like it's i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have exactly the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> opinions about easter egg chocolates i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have no idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why you know why it's because it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same cadburys chocolate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as soon as you put it in egg format it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tastes ten times better to me i don't i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i used to i'm not the only one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i used to agree because i had an advent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> calendar like three years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i was like oh fantastic i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be a kid again because i had one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like three years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i ate it and i'm like wow this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just [ __ ] like this is [ __ ] and so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just ate it all in one go i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i put them all out on like december 5th </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i grabbed them all out put them in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys have the ones where you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you kind of like it like cracks out like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a medicine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting back to easter chocolate right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's cause you're a kid because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i you know when you're a kid right did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have these in australia where they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so in the uk they have the standard like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one dollar two dollar yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eggs right maybe you get a chocolate bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well yeah right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but when you're a kid you'd always see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the big egg right i'm talking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 30 40 egg that was like giant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and i feel like the magic is lost when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you can buy it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i my parents my parents were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never gonna buy me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thirty dollar they would never buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> me more than one x i'm like yeah you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't need more than that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's ridiculous like and so when i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like two years ago i bought the big egg </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right but it was reduced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for like 10 bucks yeah and i had i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was going to be [ __ ] like god tier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> came with its own shitty mug and two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chocolate bars it was just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shitty chocolate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just it was awful i was like wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm the opposite and then i realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when i put all this chocolate down it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like 300 grams of chocolate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i could have bought like inside hole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> alright </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for them to put it in a [ __ ] mold and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just [ __ ] sear it together you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kidding me because the thing is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> logically my mind knows this but every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> easter like even as an adult like now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i am an </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> i go for another easter egg i can do it </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> they were like all sold out in the uk </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> christmas day yeah couldn't [ __ ] plug </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it in because he had the german </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> block and then because like my dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously just forgot to buy one right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember booting it up and it being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing like controller warning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or something i'm like what is this dad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> dad that helped me and my dad can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] speak german so he was like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know son what are we doing i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i [ __ ] had wii sports but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's some other sports i had some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game and the title was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> german i remember i was like so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> confused as a kid i was like what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is this i think i got the wii for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas as well actually now i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about it [ __ ] was born man yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know what ended up happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was when we sports was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the the the day we got up working which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was next day we we sport i couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] play it because all my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like older relatives are playing like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> bowling drunk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when am i gonna play zelda what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my gift what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah god god no because i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my like one of my best memories of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> n64 was just the first time i boost up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goldeneye with my cousins and it was i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that was my first proper like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> multiplayer experience because like whoa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> four people can play at the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we can play together and at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time like that was [ __ ] mind-blowing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the best four-player game back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then was probably like [ __ ] bomberman </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that mario party maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no because mario party wasn't out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was it no yeah because the first one was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on n64 yeah yeah it's just one's on your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> phone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i remember we stayed up till like 4 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 00 a.m which back when i was a kid was </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> pint of cocaine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like seeing the ps like seeing the ps5 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like i know if i get it i'll play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like demon souls and be like yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure like yeah yeah because the jump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't that significant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ps4 games can load twenty percent faster </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> of me and my brothers in sunday school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my older brother he never complains </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> it's like a church school right so yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like i mean it's in america as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's more popular in america but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uk as well it's normally like christian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff or catholic or whatever what'd you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> learn in sunday school i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because i've never been to san diego </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> jesus i i just know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about sunday school so i think i was too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> young to do like the super religious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so 90 of the time they just spoke about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like religious they would tell stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm being like who the [ __ ] cares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also i remember coloring in so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pictures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many [ __ ] pictures and i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when did you have like a jesus coloring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> book yeah we had like a jesus coloring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> page and i [ __ ] hated it because i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> time and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i'd watch tv shows you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> american cartoons and they had like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> paddling balls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i have this very very vivid memory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah one time one of the kids bringing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the paddling balls and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the coolest [ __ ] thing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and they immediately took it away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from him and i was like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i want to play with the paddling ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why did i take away from him i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know because it's jesus time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no one interrupts jesus and they made us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> do like a play at christmas when i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like eight or nine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh well of like the birth of jesus yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and i remember being like mom you're one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the wise men yeah i was one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wiser </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh man you got you got a you got a big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> role i was the snowman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but i think it was because that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> literally what i did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i literally just did this on stage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my mom still has pictures being like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> great performance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great performance i think i was one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the wise men only because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i there wasn't enough kids to fill the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there wasn't enough kids in this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school i i hated it i remember and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> also i was like why do i have to have my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's got gold i want gold that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] and i didn't know how to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> murr at the time when i was a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gold i know gold mother come on give me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i remember we had to do this shitty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play and i was like i hate this so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i hit it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so for one christmas i asked my mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like she was like what do you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for christmas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i did i slipped her in the eyes and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like i don't care about gifts just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> please don't make me go to sunday school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i want my sundays back mom i'm going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to school five days a week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then another day after turn up and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] color pictures of jesus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> are you kidding me i hate this [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think honestly that's the reason why i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just care for like zero religion now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right because they pushed it so heavily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> on me and i'm like this is [ __ ] it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bunch of nonsense yeah yeah yeah we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> reading book stories about this dude who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't give a [ __ ] about like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no concept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you went to you went to a catholic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> school as well no it wasn't it wasn't a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> catholic school but they did make us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pray </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three times a day wait so what what so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in wales like a lot of schools should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make you pray </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh because it's just like a religious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> culture even if it's like an atheist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no atheist school it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a school and a lot of them have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's just a school yeah in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh secondary school and my primary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school i think you pray three times a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh wow but the thing is right that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe like in high school you're like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they can't they won't they don't tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't pray because they can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because it's a religious thing but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's still like a school rule well no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a school suggestion it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a cult right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you get in this thing right you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to school and then everyone suddenly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bows their head and starts [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> speaking in tongues right they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh [ __ ] okay i should probably join in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> left out but then you realize after all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're not going to do anything if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't pray and just stand there and look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around and be like what's going on you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> all the other kids and so i would i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> would just refuse to do it eventually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because i'm like i'm not praying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even this nonsense all right i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> understand why they made us do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because we weren't a religious that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing it's like i i find that a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird because it would make sense if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to like a christian school or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> catholic school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it might have been like i it wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> officially a christian school but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think a lot of the schools in wales were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> christian or something i i think just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of schools in england are like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah anyway because uh i like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think i went to a catholic or religious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we still had to like we still did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> religious things around christmas time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and i know i had no idea what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was going on yeah [ __ ] because like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> come from a buddhist family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so like we'd have events in the church </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like what this is this isn't the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> temple what is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> god we've just like sing like welsh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hymns and they're like the [ __ ] worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing i i had to sing hymns as well i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no idea what they were what they were no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there was one and like it was called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like dwarven men </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so every time they would like because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a sheet of twelve hymns and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would never do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> draw never men because everyone would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> always like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look at each other and giggle and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like the chorus was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shouting like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like loudly daughter men like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they would never pick it because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone would just start screaming [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on my head </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in welsh because they found it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're all [ __ ] kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and every time they'd pick it it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a [ __ ] event because every all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the kids it was the one time where all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the kids who didn't really sing and go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> would start would proudly say like boys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in queue right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's weird because like i went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my high school was like a catholic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though i'm not catholic personally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like we didn't even have to do like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole like praying thing like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> would have to do you know maybe like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a like an end of uh end of term </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mass or like a beginning of term masses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bring on the new year but yeah we never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> had to do anything i i did it was one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those things that when you left you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was weird wasn't it that was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was weird that they made us pray </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we would like pray before every meal and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like that yeah like that's a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it is weird what's up with that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whales man come on and eventually my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parents did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grab my christmas wish and oh really oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really got you out of there because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at what age at what age [ __ ] it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> before i started secondary school so it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> must have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how long were you in there for uh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think like two or three years please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] sound like a prison </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know what you're in there how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are you in oh i literally readjusted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this society now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the amount of times i was like mom i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cannot i know you think that's just me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being a [ __ ] kid but i [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> please please take me out of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like anything religious was just the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most boring thing for me like i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever my mom would take me to temples </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything to go like pray and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk to the monk and everything and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i i just wanted to go home and play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in 64. honestly yeah yeah like i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's fun to do here there is literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing fun to do here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this religious place this is why like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you see like those uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> families who like their kids just get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like indoctrinated into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> indoctrination of something like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> raised into the i think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> indoctrinated in doctor i think so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like they call like they're super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> religious people right because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remember even when i was like eight and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i would hear these things like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he turned wine into water and i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like it's all like diddy though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never seen anyone do that um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same thing with santa claus like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parents would try and tell me at like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> age 10 that santa was real i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not having any of that come on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> come on reindeers i can fly come on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the question at what age did you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure out that spoilers alert uh santa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh dude i i've like went on like a like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> operation at like midnight to like find </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the stealth music to prove to them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that i knew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what they were doing and i found out i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> found out accidentally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because i think i was maybe like 10 or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 11 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was christmas night and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like [ __ ] i really need to pee i drank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever and i got up in the middle of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the night my dad was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this next to the tree and he just caught </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me right handed and he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all right son it's time you found out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's time it's time it's time you knew </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the truth you got me kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i think i i know where because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i did like a thorough sweep of the house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know a few days before i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there'll be presents here if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah my theory is correct my hypothesis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't find any presence in the house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they must be hidden in the garage so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like all right i'll wait i'll wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> till </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> till midnight and on christmas until </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they bring them in and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a i slept right it was like covert </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> ops just pretending to sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my parents came in to check while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sleeping yeah and i i wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right so i don't remember the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> age i found out like santa wasn't real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i remember as a kid i was like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smartest dumb kid in existence because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i was i would like be figuring out all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these like logistics of how santa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could be able to send these presents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around because there would be there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you know i wouldn't be at home so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how's santa gonna figure out i ain't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hungry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so so so so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we'd be saying at my cousin's house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and the presents would still be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there even though we were staying at my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cousin's house no matter where we were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and for some reason it just didn't click </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me as a kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that santa wasn't real but but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realizing that santa wasn't real i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my head i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like yo so this is how santa knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was staying here so we went to our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't see i was there saw like the note </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that i left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere or saw like the phone call </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i had with my cousin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we were coming around to his house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so that's how santa knew that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was staying around my cousin's house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i explained this to my parents at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the time my parents were just like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> like i i i believed that it wasn't real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i also was like maybe a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a chance that someone's drinking </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> used uh used to have uh you know you'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> open presents first thing which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always the best part yeah pretty much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> goes downhill from there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> um do you remember the age where you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just couldn't sleep before christmas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then as a teenager you're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dude like i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> well but i don't care about this you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you realize uh when you were like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did you always used to pick a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things and you would get some of them or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did you get everything that you picked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would get some of them because my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> parents would also be like listen connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> santa's got a budget and i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so then i had to like look for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> product within the budget right right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i never connected the dots you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know from age like eight or whatever but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i would i would go through like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we had a thing called like argos yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> argos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's that it's like a they had like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> giant like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gigantic booklet imagine the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depressing store you can think of you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go into this store right yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a store it's just a store of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> catalogues </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so imagine like amazon imagine if amazon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine the amazon warehouse but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> would have like an amazon irl yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you would go and you could book it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> online or back then you had to go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> store and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> take off the boxes you wanted yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> according to like the catalogue that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> depressing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was but you know because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cats as a kid though this [ __ ] was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magical because it had like everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in it yeah so you would go through and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know adult now you realize this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just [ __ ] overpriced </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know back then there was no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazon so you're like fitting it in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> budget </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because how you go through it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because back back in the day you didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you didn't really have the internet so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'd have to order off this catalog so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> arg or store and there was this catalog </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like as thick as a brick you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could [ __ ] murder someone with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with this catalog right so your phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd go in and you'd flip to like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> index </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so you could go usually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah yeah and and so you flip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through the index and go through like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the game sections and the toy sections </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which was like which which was the only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sections you really looked at all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then you it was just like free </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pickings basically i never i never had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything and then basically like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know when i turned up christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> morning there would be a few surprises </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but most of the stuff that i wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> would be there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> except that one time like i said in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cow said [ __ ] dad bought me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> qriket tickets clearly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> clearly expressed my disdain for cricket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i thought i thought this is going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> change </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely like other than the game boy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> advance i genuinely don't remember what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else i got as a as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like from santa one christmas i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> got like all yu-gi-oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like i got like a [ __ ] jewel arm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing and i got like oh you got one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i got one all my friends have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> got one as well jealous we would turn up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to school and we would play yukio but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then they just stopped playing after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess santa didn't have the budget for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like i asked for one year but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just didn't get it i mean i feel like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] this look she doesn't need that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's like i think he just got me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a bunch of booster packs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's the graveyard and the fold-out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing in the back of the booster pack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he'll be all right i remember for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me it was always video games i never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> asked for anything but video games and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was because </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> games right </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> pounds yeah yeah yeah pushing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so i mean that's that's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why i will always remember the n64 </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> mode yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i had never gotten a bigger present </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in my life at that moment yeah now that </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> that i'm good at and they'll keep buying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me things </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> snowboarding my family was like a chore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i was a kid right because they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] slow right i i would have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like go on a ski thing and i would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would wait at the time come on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> peasants yeah i would i would wait at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the top and i'm like just go ahead i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll i'll follow you and i would wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five minutes on my phone and then when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been five minutes time to go like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> full speed down and yeah and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> overtake them yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then i have to wait and then you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know also when you're a kid and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't have money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm [ __ ] hungry as [ __ ] and in these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> results because like we would go on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> packages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right so they were pretty cheap like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bashed my pants i'm very grateful but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like the cheapest possible way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that you could go to like italy and ski </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right right which is fair enough i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i applaud the effort but when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had to eat out at these places they like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> charge a lot for like food and drinks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah so like we're getting one meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between us all we're all going to split </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it and i'm like [ __ ] mom i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starving like i would i would nut for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more than one-sixth of the pizza right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right right please but going now as an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> adult i have my own money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like i'll waste all my money on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> food there i don't give a [ __ ] i want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be full no because like these activities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i i've realized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason we enjoy them so much as an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> adult do you do with your friends yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> no no not just that but because we can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> get alcohol involved yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know what i mean like it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just like going on trips and everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just it's just funner with a pint </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh like oh no i guess yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what you do after you have your fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> activity you just want to wind down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a kid you have [ __ ] nothing to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but as an adult you can just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get drunk with the boys and that's yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i enjoy spending more time with my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> family now that i'm an adult than i did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when i was a kid yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i've i've worked at i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had three white christmases and all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three of them have been because i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working at a ski resort in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd say having a white christmas in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia oh no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's the difference that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming that's a different type of white </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> christmas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah like the like i had the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whitest christmases in like ski resorts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just [ __ ] white </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> everywhere but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only difference between the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> christmas night at a ski resort and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every other night is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just more white people outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really that's the only difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because what do you do at a ski resort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other than skiing and snowboarding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you get shit-faced yeah that's the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sauna sauna's normally a good champ yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or like onsen right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like other than that it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only other thing if you if you wake up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the morning you're like oh man my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> body's feeling a bit sore i don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go skiing or snowboarding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's nothing to do during the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other than to go to the one bar that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> open 24 7 and just get [ __ ] first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and also because like [ __ ] skiing and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> snowboarding is so [ __ ] exhausting oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you're like all right that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pint is like amazing you even been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> skiing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> never been skiing i mean like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the reason i've never been is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i mean every every holiday </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we went to thailand yeah it's also one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of those things where i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know why my family just were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like let's just go skiing for the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time yeah i feel like normally you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who's been yeah so they can be like i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll help you out yeah i'll you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like skiing yeah also you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when i was growing up i wasn't in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most privileged position where my family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could kind of afford that because i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> going skiing is like an expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> holiday or it can be yeah it is i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially if you're in the country that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't have like resorts nearby exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right you know what i realized this when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i started flying for like conventions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was i always thought that airports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> were even worse than they actually are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because right if you get one of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> package deals the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> company that does the package deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> charters the plane right right so you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all have to like wait in this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> horrible line these planes are like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> worst yeah and the people are the worst </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as well it's like the worst kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> british tourist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah which i'm sure you've all seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> videos of you watch like airport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meltdowns </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's always british people right always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude these these [ __ ] flights are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> awful man it's the most oh god you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> been on them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've i've been on okay so the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> depressing place i've been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on earth i think is luton airport oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or in uk in the uk yeah okay so we we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stayed okay so this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know back back back before back when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] poor and all that stuff we uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we we booked this holiday um it was it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was me it was me and sydney at the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we booked this holiday on this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> budget airline that flew out of luton um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i remember to save costs we needed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to stay near luton </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was actually cheaper to stay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> near luton than to like get there in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> morning in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like rush hour right right and so we we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> picked the cheapest hotel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which happened to be easy hotel which i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that already sounds soft okay so so in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like europe there's this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's this budget airline called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easyjet it's the one right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's the worst it's one of the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> airlines i wouldn't say it's the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the worst ryan i'd say right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> orion is there both there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> two sides of this anything that flies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out luton is automatically like horrible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for me but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um so we stay we're staying easy it's an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> easy hotel and i've never felt like i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paid to stay in a prison cell before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until i until i stayed there so it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we go in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's literally like no windows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's just it's just a white room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah no it's yeah i was just ours it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just a black room and like the walls are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paper thin and they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i could hear at least like three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different people [ __ ] in different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> places you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i go into the shower right that's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shared shower right or is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no you you had your own private </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> shower but it was like it was wow that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one step </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like but like there wasn't even like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a door to like separate the shower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like the bed okay so you so it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just like curtains </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you open up these curtains and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a toilet seat and then there is a shower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right next to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just it was the like definition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of how i imagine a prison shower to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because the only thing said that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's nothing separating the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the shower right so so you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just showering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yes and and so while you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> showering the toilet's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting [ __ ] soaked yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything like that and it's it's got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the gray </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like kind of like floor as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it felt like i was in a prison cell yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i had to pay good money how much was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it for like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> is completely empty they won't let you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> choose seats and they on purpose scatter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that you fought they force you to pay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to sit next to each other right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i'm like [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah no i'm not doing that [ __ ] i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> give a [ __ ] i'll see them when i land </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who [ __ ] cares </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not desperate that i need to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> within a two meter radius of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jesus christ we have something like we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have something similar in australia it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> called jet star </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and every every [ __ ] like continent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> has that ah that's so bad i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] flew jetstar once from sydney to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brisbane and it was like an hour and a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> half flight but it's the worst [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> flight i've ever been on god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like delayed three hours for no reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you get there and then it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 60 million years for the luggage to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come out on the other side i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where where is his luggage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's like uh you've been on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> norwegian you've been on norwegian i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> been i've been on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like compared to other budget airlines </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> norwegian is like the rolls royce of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> budget airlines man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no it's because it's the only budget </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> airline there's like long haul i sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can do you can have a 12 hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flight and they will give you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no food really yeah on noise you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for this oh yeah yeah but like and any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any budget airline that has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movies that has a movie choice it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like better than percent of the fight i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think it only has movies because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't make those planes the ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that do long haul without them built in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i don't think they do that anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like so i don't think it's possible i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sure if they could have removed the tvs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and made you pay for them i'm sure they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like the fact that they can they can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go 12 hours and not give you food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like blows my mind i've never been on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> norwegian nail and don't that long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i i'd say i've i've been on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> worse and and also it's a 12-hour flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ride and they try and they charge you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a carry-on where we where the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] were you flying to la to uk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uk and it's always norwegian because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were by far the cheapest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys didn't have like american or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> united are there's america yeah okay but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they were they were more like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> double the price also broke as [ __ ] so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like either norwegian which was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty consistently always like 400 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah return yeah jesus from uh london to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> l.a and then the next stop was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> united which is like 500. but back then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like 100 bucks i was like that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a big deal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's like a slightly better hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it wasn't 400 to 500 it was like 400 to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 600 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 600 700. yeah i i think you got what you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paid for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um i i i think that norwegian is good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the price </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and if you're like if you're like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone broke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's trying to go to like ax or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something or trying to go to la for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four years it was super serious it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was just like everything you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> run the risk of you know dying of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> starvation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> every single time i was on the plane i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was [ __ ] hungry just eat a [ __ ] ton </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> before you get on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bring a [ __ ] ton of snacks and you'll be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> good you just have to fast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time i didn't know i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know that because i saw that you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pay for a meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i was like oh they'll give you like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a snack or something yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing you'll get anything you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing would you like would you like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this granola bar for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> six dollars these chairs are the i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like they've engineered these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chairs to be [ __ ] god-awful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like at least other airlines have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> semi-competent chairs but for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason on norwegian airlines they'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> handcrafted this [ __ ] to be disgusting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and painful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you get in the middle row of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four it's like just just give up on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being happy in life for the next 12 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one time i went on it and there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a i was on the i was in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the end the aisle seat of the three okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well it's not the middle of the four so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm happy and this couple were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making out next to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm like i swear they were fingering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each other because i was like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disgusting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i wanna i wanna i wanna die please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please and no amount of like don't look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the side could like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> focus me on game of thrones season four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the [ __ ] i was watching i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> please please yeah because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the one time you curse that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have a periphery right yeah because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one every time i would take my headphone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> off you for a second i could hear like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh i'm like oh god oh why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell you what if you're gonna go on at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> budget airlines just pay 300 bucks for a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good pair of noise-canceling headphones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly like that's the best advice i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can give you don't cheap out on them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> jesus christ </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't know what it is about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> airplane design of seats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are just like ergonomically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> designed to be the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uncomfortable thing you've ever sat on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did you see those standing seats they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were trying to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like to fit more people in they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to make standing seats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for airlines so that like they can fit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> more people it's basically like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at this at this point what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> difference between that and just being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cattle you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like would just be literally being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> herded in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously was the budget airline just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to do this it's like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sardines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah they were like we could fit 20 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> more passengers in the economy if we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we yeah but but no one wants that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because no passengers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because their argument was something was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that if it's a two-hour flight you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stand for two hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not but no i don't want to no no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no it's terrible it's [ __ ] what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't mind a one-hour flight i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever but like when it's 12 hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes having a bad season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even a prison transport system has seats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys come on they do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the prison bus you can sit down yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah come on now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's yeah it's sad man yeah but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point was is that yeah now that i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> older i'm grateful that my parents took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> vacation but when i was a kid now i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> older i'm glad i have disposable income </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah back to the thinking back to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> broke uni student days you know what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going back to christmas did you ever </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> get a [ __ ] away from i had really i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> relationships where they would want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] around that time they would just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be obsessed with watching the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] movies and i'm like i don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> like it's always it's always they always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like the same kind of titles it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always the same theme of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's a romantic comedy kinda but it's </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> the yipikaya one that is a christmas man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there there are two things that i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i will probably not get on with a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that if they if they say like if they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> love disney movies more than like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a healthy amount or if they own a horse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those are the two reasons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's the two ways i know i'm probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna get on with them some slightly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is it what is it about horse speed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone knows [ __ ] skills are crazy </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> relationship with one they're gonna love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the horse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> more than they ever love you yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just like that's a fact that is </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> but i do like the feeling of just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting together and watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a movie like it doesn't necessarily have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be a christmas right that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like watching like family movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> especially on christmas my parents just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have [ __ ] taste in movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wait what's the definition of a family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movie like a rom-com or </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> know for years to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i would be like yeah yeah you you don't </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> the biggest holiday you got of the year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know it was just like it i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i got programmed into thinking that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just a special holiday and even if even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if i wasn't with family you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like watching watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> christmas anime for me like watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of my favorite christmas anime like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the disappearance of haruhi </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> chopped up i i never thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ah i could watch it i could watch anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i suppose it's weird for you because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grew up in a country where it's sunny in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> christmas you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every christmas movie there's no concept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> grabbing a blanket and cuddling up on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the couch to watch yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because you'd be sweating it's just </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah for us it's like merry christmas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's turn on the cricket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that was it for us right i mean i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that as i get older i think i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciate the idea of it more which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just spending time with family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i you know my little brother lives with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my parents and my older brother doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> live too far away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah so it's not hard for them to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> go visit him but for me it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i haven't seen them in over like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a year i guess when i moved to japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and originally they were like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna come back for christmas connor </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> in some of these scenes he's like given </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so little [ __ ] about trying that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a dubbed over actor really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's so lazy it's just like let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take two edgy words and smash them </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> willis is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna say he's [ __ ] terrible because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the last bruce willis film i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch was looper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and even then it was like i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> one always turns up and it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bruce willis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he turns up to the set and apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like all the things he does is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he agrees to do like three days of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shooting right and that's it like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no retakes really and heart anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that physically doesn't require him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a body double so even if it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> getting on his knees yeah like don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get a bodybuilder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he's too lazy to do it oh my god </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> recent but uh wyatt did like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bruce willis answers like most googled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> questions he doesn't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was one of the most boring wide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> videos i'd ever seen because he he just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> monotone the entire thing is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> harrison ford when you when you can tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that he respects the movie and a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> director he [ __ ] tries like in blade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> runner the new one he was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing yeah but when he when he's in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> interviews he's like i don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> give a [ __ ] yeah but bruce willis is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> always like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like nothing makes bruce willis care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like he he literally is like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> angriest oldest [ __ ] in all of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interviews like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> like all right bruce willis [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> guys could you imagine if youtubers get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to that point </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> i didn't want to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know some some of us uh some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> us are already there </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> like that especially if you've already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made your like [ __ ] fortunate name </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> stay relevant yeah right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtubers again yeah yeah well like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the thing right you don't have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stay relevant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're like at the point of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bruce wills like everyone knows your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] name and what you look like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why like no okay and like no one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watches action movies and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that has like a big name to it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why they get him because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they can he just makes up a lot of bank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> his name has a lot of pull for action </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> movies and he just doesn't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's true that's true i mean our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> action movie is even like a big thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> nowadays yeah because john wick is i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean like no i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i was gonna say like aside from john </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wick but that's the thing right if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can bring it back and you can do it well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the right actors like it'll be huge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're talking about like you know ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that aren't falling under like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> notable ip right yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but john wick like hard kills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like john wick wasn't a notable ip until </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know keanu reeves made it notable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when did i week one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hard kill to me sounds like one of those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> seven years ago i don't know hard kills </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me sounds like one of those titles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so when i when i was in thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right that i would i would always have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i i would always go to like in in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like southeast asia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's always these stores that you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buy like pirated pirated dvds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah and you'd go through like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd flick through the covers and you'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd see these like the most random </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movies of these like a-list actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but you'd never heard of the film before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's hardcore that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but that is also all of bruce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> willis his recent filmography </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all movies like how is this man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> doing eight movies a year how does it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> happen how do you have time for that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i kind of want to just like go through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his imdb now just to see like have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> look at this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's insane and it's like you know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think that's the reason why and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine at the time people probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't give a [ __ ] about action movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until like terminator came out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably at that time you're like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this is crazy what the [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because i mean that's not james cameron </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> directing it which i don't know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 80s was like a [ __ ] golden period for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> action movies right right right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was like the schwarzenegger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right claude van damme yeah i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i could i could re easily re-watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like so many of their action </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> movies and that's also when like martial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arts movies also were starting to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because i feel like i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before john wick there was this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> huge period where action movies were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just not pulling in the numbers anymore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just reading these [ __ ] titles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've never heard of any of these yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're all straight to dvd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we have so 2017 first kill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> acts of violence death wish air strike </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ten minutes gone trauma center survive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know any of that by the way all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of those are direct to dvd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah this sounds like all of them they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sound like a satire of themselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at that point no one wants to hire him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because why would you he's just gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turn up and [ __ ] be lazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's five movies right now that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has been announced with ximena that is </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next time why why my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah do you boys have any plans this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean uh i i'm curious to see what this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas will be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the current world situation true this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is probably going to be the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> depressing christmas of all time because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like it's it's a bit weird because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah do you want to explain what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> christmas in japan is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so essentially by kfc yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> basically yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah christmas in japan is sponsored by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kfc basically it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kfc is the go-to place how did that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how did that start okay it's because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did a video on this a few years ago but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the theory is that colonel sanders right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks like santa that's the theory </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because think about it right think about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it christmas colors what are the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas colors red </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right yeah yeah what does colonel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sanders dressed up in red </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right does it yeah it's a white suit i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thought yeah but the kfc color has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then colonel sanders is an old guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a white beard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of looks like santa right and i bet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you trace that back it's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> five-head kfc employee like working in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the marketing team it's basically it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's it was a marketing ploy by kfc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be oh it was amazing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like basically yeah basically like they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like well uh you know the christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dinner overseas in in in the west </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is uh they have chicken yeah they have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> roast chicken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fried chicken is kind of the same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's like you know it's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah why don't we try this let's try one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas that's pretty cool we're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna try and sell this hello and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it just [ __ ] exploded because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't get a roast chicken in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and also other than kfc out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> outside of some kombini's i saw this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there'd be a an employee dressed in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> santa outfit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah with a fried chicken like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> selling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fried chicken yeah yeah sell fried </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> chicken well they sell like cakes right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is so [ __ ] weird what am i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking at it's it's bizarre </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> looking at an asian man dressed in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> santa costume sami fried chicken in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> name of christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like what the [ __ ] but it's also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird as well because like normally like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everywhere else in the west right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> christmas is like a family thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you gather like mom and dad grab </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself japan it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a beta valentine's yeah it's a reality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like you go on dates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you go you watch you go to the prom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's uh christmas here but that but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that part i understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because literally a week later is uh new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> year's eve right and new year's eve is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a super like buddhist family thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so it makes sense that the opposite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of what it is in western yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like in western cultures like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new year's eve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah let's go see you next to your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parents yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i just i personally have i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this year i plan to go up uh north to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see uh chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> um and uh we're gonna we're gonna go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> natsuki's place and have kfc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for christmas yeah that's the plan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the plan and i'm like man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first time ever i've been living here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five years first year i'm gonna have the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese christmas experience of eating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kfc i'll i'll let you boys know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depressing it actually is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but uh having because it's not like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> remember before coming to japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd heard so many rumors about japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kfc being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the best kfc in the world you you ain't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> tried kfc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until you had japanese kfc and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> came here and then i ate it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it was just kfc yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> generally think the uk one was better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought the uk one of the better menu </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it is the most meat kfc i've ever had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man i love the burgers the chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sandwiches that you get in kfc they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] amazing oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the uk they're so good as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly i don't know what it is about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uk or kfc's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's good i mean i i feel that you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have kind of perfected like fast food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken with nandos right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean that's like south african though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah originally right but we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think every single fast food chain in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the uk has like fried chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> options but as a not on its own right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like mcdonald's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i think some of the most popular stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they sell in the uk is like just like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken select stuff like that chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken select and also like the wrap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah oh okay that's the best thing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i get yeah that stuff is good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and every like every like dirty kebab </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still has like the fried chicken option </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so there's just fried chicken everywhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know like because yeah british </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is the best kfc japan is like summer in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then america's america is just like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> correctly case in point chick-fil-a yeah </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> i don't know why i spent new year's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year in the worst [ __ ] way possible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i was like 16 um and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working up at a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ski falls the first time i was working </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up at a ski field and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're in the middle of hokkaido in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mountains it's like [ __ ] minus 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> degrees in a [ __ ] blizzard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and of course i'm working that day i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in the [ __ ] blizzard shoveling snow </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> one of the hotels had a blocked sewage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i had to get in there with a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shovel so imagine a 16 year old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right right in the middle of a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blizzard in the mountains </SPEAKER_04>
