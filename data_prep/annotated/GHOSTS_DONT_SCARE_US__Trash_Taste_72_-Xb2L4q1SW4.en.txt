<SPEAKER_08> and it's it's different and the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> etiquette is slightly different so it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of threw me off wait did you sign </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up by yourself </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> uh yeah yeah it's impossible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't believe you i was trying to i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't believe you i shouldn't remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how i did it and it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> confusing because it was all blur </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he was asking dave and i was like yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> well that's just every interaction i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have with a japanese person in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> they ask me something and i just say yes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> here's how good my japanese has gotten </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to this point now yeah i can it's kind </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of like i'm i'm kind of filling in the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> blanks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it kind of feels like you're doing one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of those mario party mini games where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you you see a part of the sequence and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're like i think i know where the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> sequence is going it's like going into a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mario party game without looking at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> controls right it's like 100 percent i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> think i think this is out so now now i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm getting to the point where i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm i'm accustomed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the normal flow of signing up to things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i kind of understand what they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and i understood most of what was told </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of me and a lot of it was just like hey </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> read this and i'm like oh sorry it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> just really weird when they pulled the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knife out and made me science selling my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> blood you know it's like oh that's you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know i guess that's true the rectal exam </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was a bit weird </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> i don't know we fact check that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> come in fact listen when i went in there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it looked american yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they all do because all the gyms used </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> white people to uh advertise yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> advertise their gym </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at the front of our old gym there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was like five banners of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like really attractive white guys and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> girls like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've never seen a japanese person be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> advertised on a gym before it is weird </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> having japanese just white people is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the standard it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it's my i think it might just be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like going to the gym in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> country is like a [ __ ] luxury because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of how expensive that was no it's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just that who the [ __ ] what japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> person has time to go to a gym that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> true also most of it don't mostly happen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> these people are in shape right and the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> people that aren't in shape i don't </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> think they care about being in charge no </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> seven levels like why are you working </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> that that's not [ __ ] american yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds japanese that sounds like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> going on they took my picture i got the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> key thing i signed my life away they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> asked me my card yeah it worked out so i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i believe i'm signed up so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that's good i i walked in yesterday and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> nobody stopped me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one thing i've noticed uh about moving </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like you know having to cancel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> memberships and having to cancel stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like ten times easier than signing up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to something yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the opposite in the west right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah cause like i i was dreading </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> having to cancel my gym membership </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because i remember when we signed up to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a gym membership it took like 45 minutes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to an hour of just reading forms so i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was just like so me and cindy had to go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cancel gym membership and we said one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> word which was just like we would like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to cancel our membership and we had to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> find one piece of paper yeah it took </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> five minutes take five why can't signing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> up be that easy yeah why would you like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> no leaving fees just like yeah use the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> gym until like the end of the month it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> like it's like everything you're not </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> supposed to do as a business right it's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like why it's like i love how how </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> hesitant they are to sign you up to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like are you sure you want to give </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> us money every month yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> why i'm [ __ ] here just let me get in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for christ's sake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> exactly the moment you leave they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh thank god all right here you go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> take it get the [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like i had to change over my internet as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> well and that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> surprisingly painless because they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like no worries did you want to cancel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your internet or did you want to move to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a new place and i'm just like it's is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> which one's easier not like it's both </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the same it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> exactly it's just like yeah where's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> catch where's the camera but then why is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it like such pulling teeth when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like signing up for like water or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gasoline </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you sure you want water in your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> place it's like yes please thank you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i only just okay so i moved to our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> current place like what five almost six </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> months ago right and i only just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> finished finalizing my water stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really yeah because like for some reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i got like a new bank account </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and wither came a new card and for some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> reason they didn't allow me to use my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> new bank account </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's not under the same name or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some kind of well you said you said the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> b word bank </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah so i was like but but i've done it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> before at my previous place and it was </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty painless right so i was like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean you know it's just changing a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> bank account how hard could it be famous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last question how hard could it be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing with the word bank in japan is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ever easy but what i don't understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> right is that okay so i signed up and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> i'm like okay i want to change to my new </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> bank because like you know my money </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> situation has changed in this new place </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like sure no worries we'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> send you a form you can fill out all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your information and then mail it back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to us i'm like all right email is also a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> thing but anyway so they so so i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about a month after that phone call </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finally the form comes in i was like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right i don't know why this took a month </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to stand out but sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fill it in in five minutes send it off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two months later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i get a phone call and they say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh so your bank is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> able to be used oh my god i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ciao tomate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could have told me that on the phone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three months ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why is it now after all this like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> waiting and sending out a form that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're finally like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> jk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they're gonna call you up and be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah by the way the rate of inflation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> has changed so significantly in the past </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two months that yeah details all over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again yeah right have you been paying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for water since then so before it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> used to be like a bank transfer like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every month automatically but since then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i've had to like get the form they mail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you the form that says the amount and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then i have to go to the uh family mart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and do it by cash yeah which just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] me up because sometimes i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> check my mail every day and then there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was one month where i almost like got my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> water stopped oh my god because they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just straight up didn't send me my form </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i'm like and then they called me and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like uh so you haven't paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for your thing i'm like they haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> given me the [ __ ] form what am i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> supposed to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> am i supposed to be like am i supposed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go and go to my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> am i supposed to go to the company being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like uh sorry i don't have the form but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like trust me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i owe you guys this i i have to pay i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to give you this money i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realized right that when i first moved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here i thought oh my god i can pay my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> bills at the the local companies yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is amazing this is great yeah now i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realize it's just to avoid banks yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like this whole car this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> country has set up a system where the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> banks just don't need to do anything but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> they still have to have all your money </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and they give you like what is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 0.001 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> interest or something like that the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> interest gets wiped out by every every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> time you want to take out money that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> true </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you you basically there's less </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> interest than the p the the fees you pay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for like any service yeah japan is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only country where like hiding your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money under your mattress might be a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better investment than putting it into a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> bank honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it's probably safer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> don't spend money in the country like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people just don't no they don't yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like why would we give you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> interest if people are going to keep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> money in their bank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weirdly is like a weird like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money-saving mentality in this country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even for people who have the money to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> spend so yeah apparently the one of the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> reasons uh why they didn't want to give </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> more money out of people during the the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> peak pandemic is because uh people just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> don't spend the money so they would just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> be giving money that wouldn't help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stimulate the economy yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people wouldn't go out even if you gave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> them a thousand bucks most people just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would just gonna keep it right right i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> not gonna like i would that's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> surprising because like domestic tourism </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is massive here it's just a massive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> issue but it's from here but it is right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like 90 of the economy yeah exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> right but like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> from what i understand of the domestic </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> tourism here it is like a massive luxury </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah if you will can't afford to go from </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> what i understand and also don't have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> the time yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think the biggest resource for any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> japanese person especially working is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> time yeah i don't have time to do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> anything if you ever go to a ryokan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right if you stay there for two nights i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> guarantee you're probably like one out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of 100 people who are staying there for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more than one night oh yeah everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leaves the next day always i've noticed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that like if i go and park my car it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> full next day empty the car park yeah at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like two o'clock because no one's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> checking in until like four yeah and i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only [ __ ] who apparently stayed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though it makes more sense to have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> a hotel room for at least two days </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because you at least get one full day of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> the room yeah that never made sense to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> me because how can you enjoy the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> because that means you spend </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> most ryokan you can't check into check </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> in until three or four and they won't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> let you check in early as well yeah even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> if there's space even if they're spaced </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> with japanese hotels and it's not just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> ryokans it's hotels as well even if they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have space in the hotel you still can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> check in until the check in time i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the problem though is that like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the main demographic that goes to your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cons for one night is usually like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> retirees yeah right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> itself is the exploring right but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> know what sucks like is the fact that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't even get like a full 24 hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you buy one knife yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> that's why i like in my head i'm like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this is so inefficient and it's true </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this is why like you should never ever </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> like even if you stay in like let's say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're staying in kyoto right yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should never change hotel every night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're just wasting yeah wasting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> time wasting uh wasting time that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> could have in the hotel room yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> get the breakfast as well or whatever i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> don't know you you know carrying your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> bags around pain in the ass yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> plus plus like when i'm on a holiday </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i'm staying in a hotel or ryokan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i want to relax </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't want to think about what time i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need to wake up the morning after that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> true right i want at least one day when </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> i'm just like if i want to lie in i can </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> lie in you i want to crack some beers </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> open with the boys i want to know maybe </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> lie until like 10 o'clock you know </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> whatever yeah but in ryokans like you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> have to wake up at eight because most </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> people are only staying there for one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> night and you know they they have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> wake up early to check out yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on japan's side of things like having to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sleep or getting to sleep in is like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> privileged way of enjoying it it's like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> is this privilege or i don't know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is my privilege i've never seen </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_08> cleaning for so long </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> well not surely this cannot take that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> long </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the one thing that i love about like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> american hotels is that whenever i've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> always asked for late checkout they've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> always given it to me like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if it's like an hour extra like they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> always chill about it like sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they maybe they've charged me like 20 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bucks extra but japanese hotel i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember one time i said in the hotel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> room um in nigata yeah and the hotel </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> room itself was 90 dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> for an extra hour right with seventy </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> dollars </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just for one extra hour what to stay in </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> the room past eleven right and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did i hear that correct can you can you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say that again like watch it or please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> seventy the room was ninety how does </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> that make any sense </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_04> because because i think to them anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> past that time limit is an extra day no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's to them they're offering late </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> check out without offering late check </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out you know what i mean like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like we got late check out but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> not really late check out what it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> late check it out it's not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing's late about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's empty as well it was like like pete </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> corona there was nobody staying here why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> were you trying to swindle me well yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> they're fighting for their life man they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> need that extra money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because no one's staying there they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> like oh let's charge this guy 70 bucks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'll give you i'll i know i know it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> not culture i'll tip you man just leave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me alone don't charge me 70 bucks for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> this [ __ ] what do i need to do who do i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> need to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's weird though because like most like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> high-end yokans especially they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> usually quite lenient with uh you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> late checkouts and stuff like we just uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> myself and aki and a few others just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> came back from this yokan and yamanashi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and like they said the checkout was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like 9 30. yeah we were there till like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 11. and they were like yeah you're good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like okay then why are you kicking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> us out at 9 30 if that's the case </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> did you ask them for late check out or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did were they just like no they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like they said the night before they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were like oh yeah so it's 9 30 check out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that okay and we were like uh we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might be here for longer is that okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and then we're like okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like then why did you tell me that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was the checkout time like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe just most japanese people just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> don't ask yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> most japanese people like those are the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> rules we must follow same rules i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just wrong they're like really anal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about getting their if it says 12 they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are so paranoid about checking out after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> like one minute after twelve years yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel that's just like japanese culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> in general though like we're very strict </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> on time like yeah every time because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> nobody has it here but hotels it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't want to be like fighting for my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life 10 minutes before check out like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just i'll i'll i'll come i'll come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 minutes after no one's gonna care no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one knows give your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no one has ever cared man i'm trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> enjoy this bathtub you gave me you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what i mean like come on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like how can you enjoy it when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you're stressed about time and and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> guess that's why i'm so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like confused as to why people stay in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ryokans for like one night because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like you need a minimum of two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nights to enjoy the experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> three nights if you really just want a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> relaxing weekend or whatever that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's real privilege in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like i've never heard of anyone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> like a japanese person staying at a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> dylcon for more than one night because </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to them it's like because to them that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> one night is probably the equivalent to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like a week to something yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's like oh my god finally like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> night where i'm not working and just get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to like do whatever the [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> another thing about ryokans is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like they really pressure you to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> go to breakfast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm already a breakfast guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> especially not a ryokan breakfast guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like i don't need a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> three-course meal for breakfast which is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> basically what those breakfasts are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> american breakfasts think they're big oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> no no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> breakfast makes american breakfast look </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] tiny yeah death by a thousand </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> bites bro like they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they keep giving you tiny pieces and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> they keep coming and they keep and they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> won't stop </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know you know it's over when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they finally ask like do you want some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> tea or coffee but by that point you're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> already dead yeah they've already </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> stuffed you yeah you've stuffed it i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually felt bad when everyone got mad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at you about the breakfast tweet in your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh and your hotel because it was it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like one of the few times i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i agree with connor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm just like yeah yeah i you don't need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> that much food for breakfast you really </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> i just you know i i'm a simple man for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> breakfast i don't really eat it i tend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to eat it if i've got something big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about to happen yeah like yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know the cycling special all right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll have some breakfast because that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just a wise choice yeah you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exercise but if i'm not exercising i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not eating breakfast yeah give me a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> cereal bar at most right i'm i'm not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really big on it i'd rather have a nicer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> lunch yeah i'm not hungry when i wake up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> no no i don't know how people can just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> wake up and go like yeah i feel like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> buffet yeah no because like if i have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> big breakfast uh which i'm i've rarely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enjoyed the big breakfast because i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not hungry for breakfast yeah like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> means i'm just not gonna eat lunch or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that means i'm just gonna get hungry for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dinner at this really weird time yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like a bit early for dinner but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like too late for lunch right it like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] up my eating schedule the worst is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> being you know when you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're kind of hungry when you wake up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you maybe didn't eat too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the night before yeah and then like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> really you really start to get hungry at </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> like 11. that's the worst time because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> you're like [ __ ] it's too early for </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> lunch but yeah i'm holding out but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want breakfast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for breakfast i'm holding out here for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> my goddamn life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god i just i think i think what it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> is is that i i hate the feeling of like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> having a food coma before 12 p.m yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like because you you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> tired </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> a lot of people say breakfast is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most important meal of the day um i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> don't know how accurate that is no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's the [ __ ] cereal companies </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> the cereal companies have tricked us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> making us think that these [ __ ] carb </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> monstrosities are necessary i do not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> need corn flakes and i wake up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] the most i'll eat for </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> like i'll have this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> important chemicals in the cornflakes to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> turn you gay </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> to convince me to freak out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> big big fruit companies farming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> corporations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well no because it's like the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] uh the whole uh you know the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whole the whole chart [ __ ] came from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the the pyramid of what you should eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> in your day and you should eat this much </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> better oh yeah it's just complete </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> nonsense the food pyramid scheme well </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_08> need to eat these uh corn flakes which </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> offers no nutritional value in the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> morning and stuff like that like wheat </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> unfortunately but he always had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> chocolate spread sandwiches okay i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> actually that sounds so [ __ ] cool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah this man had literal chocolate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> bread man i'm out here eating my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>

<SPEAKER_07> getting chocolate spread with his </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> chocolate yogurt bro oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> his parents unfortunately set him up to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fail </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i tried it i thought oh this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't taste good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> does it not no chocolate spread doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and like chocolate mousse and all that i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't really like that yeah and uh i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think chocolate mousse tastes good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe just because it wasn't normalized </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> for me i i hardly had it so every time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did have it i'm just like oh i'm having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chocolate for a meal this is uh this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a life hack right here this is exciting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh i love cheese strings cheese straight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cheeseburgers awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> even now i enjoy eating the chicken yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> she's peeling it off yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing i i definitely enjoyed this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> process like trying to get it as thin as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> possible as well just like like trying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get like that perfect like it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like oh yeah </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_04> southeast asia strings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> they don't think they do it's just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this like it's it's it's it's all cheese </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah it's it's it's in all the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> imports it's like supermarkets it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> not real cheese i don't know how they do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know it's not real cheese but it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tastes better than real cheese in a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> sense but then it doesn't but like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like cheese flavored plastic it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like playing a mini game to eat cheese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and for some reason that just adds to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the flavor i don't know why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> we've never had it yeah i used to i used </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> to do this thing when i was little i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know if i'm the only one but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i would i wouldn't like rip it and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediately eat it yeah i would kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> rip it and try and like create a perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> pile of like perfectly strung up jesus </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like that's like hannibal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then i like put it in a row and i'm </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> the flavor is [ __ ] but yeah i feel i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> feel if you're an adult and you've never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> had string cheese as a kid it's a kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of a tall hurdle to like get it there </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> major amount of rice is actually not bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because if you think about it it's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> same thing as putting it on top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like the japanese in you but you you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> was like all right well if the guy on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the internet said it was good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously it must be true they must be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> true if a japanese guy said on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> internet it must be even if the week </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_04> wow exactly so i tried it and i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay you know what not as good as on </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> along with gym experience is this the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> only time you watch anime man you've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> been talking about watching anime a lot </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> recently twice twice </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> that that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of course and i watched it and like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> god if you haven't started watching </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> becky like you need to get i haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seen this new season yet is it like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> this is probably the greatest season of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> television i've ever seen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this [ __ ] was so goddamn funny yeah i i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> cuz because part three bucky which is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the new season is my favorite pokemon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> honestly i've i was like trying to work </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> out but i just couldn't stop laughing </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just some of the plot points yeah it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> honestly puts jojo to shame at times </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah stupid the show part three is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it really starts to get [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> know what becky is i don't even know how </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to explain it it's men with muscles </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fighting and it's just so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> basically a kid who's like i want to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> the strongest creature on the planet and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then he does everything he can to be the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> strongest there's there's no way we can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> describe in words what back he is kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like it's kind of like jojo you kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> of just have to experience the reason </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> why it doesn't do as as as well as joe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> jokes i think it doesn't have like an </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> aesthetic that is quite as appealing as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> future jojo has so much joints has so </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> much style and stuff to go around with </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it yeah uh but but i think becky is </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> always more [ __ ] stupid </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> as one of those like illustrators where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like are you really good at drawing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or are you really [ __ ] so like like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are some scenes where i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damn that's an amazing shot and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other scenes i'm like i don't think this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> man has ever seen a human being in his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because that is not how anatomy works </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like you take a character and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like let's make this a muscly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> character and you're like what what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> proportions do you think is reasonable </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reasonable for a muscly character and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then the author just went all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> multiply that by ten and then that's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that's like the every character every </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> single character even the weak </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> characters are like built like bricks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah right it's insane and like i could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tell you some plot points and i will and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they won't even spoil it for you because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it won't make any [ __ ] sense right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at one point during the show the main </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> protagonist becky uh starts shadow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> boxing right that's my favorite [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> scene is it the mantis so yeah that as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well but so he starts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is it's like a 10 year old kid and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> he's like look i'm going to show you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that i'm going to fight an opponent and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> so he starts fighting the air and then </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> he starts fighting um mike tyson yeah oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this one this one mike tyson appears out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of thin air and mike tyson isn't there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but mike tyson is landing blows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he's fighting him back and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the kid can see the spirit of mike tyson </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then this just happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and then he's like and then the main </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> character is like oh yeah mike tyson's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> weak and then he just summons a praying </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mantis that beats the [ __ ] out of it but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then he starts fighting the praying </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> mantis that's imaginary yeah yeah in in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> a room right like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like some military guys like hey come </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fight and then he's like no and then he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> just kidnaps george bush and it's like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> what's going on what is what is going on </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> what is going on he's talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biscuit oliver right yeah then he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> kidnaps in this plot he kidnaps george </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> bush yeah so he can go to prison yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah but like so then he can beat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> up all the prisoners why would george </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> bush help you go to prison if if if you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> kidnap him they would just what does it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make any sense i love how bucky just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like is so with the times like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> exactly when part three was so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> watching becky right is like if you only </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> learned about america through trash </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> taste yeah yeah it's literally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> sure the [ __ ] they they say about it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's this one [ __ ] uh they i i had </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to pause it because i just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> laughed my ass off </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and uh this is one point where this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> american prison guard is about to die </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and uh the two japanese guys one of them </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> saves the japanese guy saves the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> american and the other japanese goes why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would you save an american he's never </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> going to care about you he's american </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just paused it and it was like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> what does that mean what is this just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> like casual like what is this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> in my country and why would you save an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> american they wouldn't care about you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my fa my favorite barkies and though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll never [ __ ] figure and i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wait for them to adapt this i think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> part four uh and it's when uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> barack obama comes out yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he gets so in the manga he's like newly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> elected right so he's like you know the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> era of when this was written and uh like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> hama yujirah like the main like the dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy who's like the most powerful guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like he goes to talk to obama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of course he can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> sit down with any president he wants </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the main antagonist could just sit </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> down with anyone yeah just because he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so busy because he's so built it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's safe but like but like obama </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> at first is like i've heard of that man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't trust him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't trust him at all but like i need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to see is he the real deal i need to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if he's the real deal so then he comes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into the room and he's like show me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you're the real deal and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and use your and eugero goes all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bet and he grabs like a handful of sand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and he crushes it in his hand and turns </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> it into a diamond moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't even i didn't even know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's gonna do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then obama's like you are the real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shakes hands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> so there's like like this show big </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> muscle if you if you if you haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> watched mackie you like you're honestly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> doing yourself at this point it's so fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like get past the start it can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> be a little jank but like the anime is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> really good it's really funny because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i'm surprised that meme culture </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just hasn't picked up on bucky memes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> right because so much of this is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> meme i know right like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that's one of the things </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's so [ __ ] funny so apparently </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> right because these there's these three </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> characters becky uh the the uh yuji </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> rohan yeah and and oliver biscuit the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> other guy yeah this is three guys that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are so dangerous and so powerful because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're muscles right yeah that half of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the gps in the world is is on it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the air </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> solely to track down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> it's only the track them in this world </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> right and so whenever they run above two </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> kilometers an hour the gps has to all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the gps in the world has to stop working </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah just to track these tracks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so and there's a whole section where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they explain that when people are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> driving or using their phone the gps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just doesn't work correctly because some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> of these characters decided to go for a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> light jog </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can't make this [ __ ] up who thought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> of this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> i'm telling you man </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like that's the thing if people if you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> thought jojo was ridiculous yeah judges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> witches it could be as ridiculous as </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> barking at times and you combine that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with then also another part in another </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> season where yucha rohana again the main </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> antagonist meets muhammad ali and he and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's he's like you could you can't beat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> me because you took off to do important </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_08> they start beating the [ __ ] out of each </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> other it's just like it is insane like i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm sure if you don't know anything </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> about becky that probably sound made no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sense and it doesn't make it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make any sense don't mean context </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i still don't quite understand what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> story is and i've watched three seasons </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i don't get the point of course </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> because i'm like you watch the netflix </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> season yeah and that's like seasons </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't even the beginning of the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the netflix seasons are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starting season two yeah it's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sequel to an anime or like the manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that came out like decades ago and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it's been going longer yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mgi has gotten a lot better as well in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> the season the cgi is kind of jank in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> the first season i think but still watch </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it it is really fun i mean i would say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like the animation especially compared </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to jojo isn't as good but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like you don't watch it for the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> animation you watch it from like the bat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] crazy scenes it's just like it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just insane how they decide fights and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like imagine if a world was decided </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> purely by muscle </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like muscles can solve every world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> issue in the world guns in this world </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> are meaningless compared to muscles like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> guns don't do anything guns are a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> suggestion </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> guns are for normal human beings and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> they don't operate in the same world </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that the characters do like it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like every single character is an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> avengers level threat that's just that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> just what it is right and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> every single time you think you've met </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> the strongest character no they he they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> introduce some new character that is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> even stronger who's the main one in uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the part three again is it the the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> prehistoric guy is it the first human uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> no no no so so i believe they've done </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> what they did with the first uh season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well it's certainly one season split </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into two oh i think that's what they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> done here so the first arc is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through the prison yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the next arc is the prehistoric yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pickle right but this this arc opens up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> with um </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> a press conference from like a safari </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like all these people died to this giant </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> mammoth elephant which killed hundreds </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> of people and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and uh animals yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> and in this press conference he's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one man killed this this 500 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> meter tall man well that's what i know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like and then like the press conference </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> is like no no no it didn't and then it's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> like what is this what is this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's so dumb </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what i love about bucky is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> every character has such as this batshit </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> crazy backstory yeah that the way they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> get introduced with this like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> crazy backstory and you have like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> speedwagon like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> basically a narrator just going over </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> their entire background doing all these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like batshit crazy things and you think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it can't get crazier until it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> does every time i've like almost caught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up to the manga and i'm like how how did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they top the first human ever who ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lived who beat a [ __ ] tyrannosaurus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rex with his bare hands i i i even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though i know sort of what the next arcs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are about yeah this is an arc about them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> fighting prehistoric creatures right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah we're just like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just bring them back to life and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like let's see if they stand up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the humans today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like like like jurassic park instead if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they turned in to test the humans </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> instead of like test seeing what the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> dinosaurs could do it's like let's see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what the humans can do against the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dinosaurs because humans are humans are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> too boring in this world yeah apparently </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's just like every you know </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> that are like across the world and even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though you have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> certain countries in certain regions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that are stronger than others </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's it still feels like a global </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> event where you see fans from all over </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the world especially when we had a crowd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know just like cheering for even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like teams that are not so well known </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that are like up-and-coming regions and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i really like i love that in sporting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> events when it's when it's not just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one kind of country but it's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> global kind of event well but that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what i mean right it's like i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> league for me would be like any other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sport that i just don't know the rules </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like i feel like once you teach me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the rules of like what's going on like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> how you know what's a good play what's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that problem is you need to learn how to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> play league yeah yeah right but i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to do that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's like you know it's like again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like learning any sport right it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> once you know the rules i think you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have a really fun time of just watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it because watching and playing is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> totally different yeah because that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the reason i got into league as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an esport as opposed to like maybe like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i remember trying to get into the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> overwatch esports scene [ __ ] me and oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my god like the game aside which i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> think is as good of a spectator sport as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> say league or something like i remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh i went to an event with uh with our </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mates and i found out that you know they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> had teams from like different cities </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from across the world right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's really upset yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they were like oh my god they have a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> team from london i can't remember what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the exact name was spitfire london </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> spitfire they had a team from london </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> spitfire i was like great we've got some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> representation for the uk and london and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i remember the team walks out and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone is korean and i'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> why would you lie to me like this why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would you lie to me i'm really confused </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't understand it but it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> franchise model </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know like football teams where yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you sell the slot to whoever does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> it but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they have so i guess there was no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> londoner who was good that wasn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> not a single londoner to my knowledge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the way that overwatch had done it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that they had these team names decided </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that you could buy in and you would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give i don't know if you could choose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah it kind of ruined it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know as much as you know i'm you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> know league of legends has so many </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're allowed to bring in foreign </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> imports yeah um but there's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maximum cap to how many people you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> import from other countries that's right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know if you're rooting for europe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you would like to see european </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> people yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a japanese rugby team at one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point where there were less japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plays than there were actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a japanese team that qualified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the main event and that's the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time the first time i ever happened in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> history because no one in japan gives a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] about league of legends so this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really small [ __ ] team qualified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> for the main event and i'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] it this is the anime plot line </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> right here what the [ __ ] why am i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> watching anime i think it's got a strong </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> niche here but it just struggles because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there's not a big pc culture here no no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> unfortunately and i i don't really see a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> pc culture taking off anytime it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's i don't think it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> dedicated to games like lee yeah i think </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just mobile gaming is just too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> massive here it is yeah um for like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> people because as we said people don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> have time but like stuff like apex is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> blowing up so i think that's been a real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> big push for pc i think apex is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> v-tubers so yeah that's like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah apex is doing very well and v-tube </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is only just especially at least in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> japan very much pushed it yeah i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> because i think before that like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> biggest pc game we had here was like pub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> g [ __ ] oh yeah yeah but and like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like the best in the dirt and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that was like the biggest it had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ever gotten in japan in terms of like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> pc game </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> pc like bangs are popping up a bit in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> japan they are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pc cafe gaming cafes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because we had them in london but there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was one um and it was so goddamn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive yeah yeah it was like 15 an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hour what yeah and it was it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's i understand that you you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're a business you've got to make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> money and london real estate isn't cheap </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but also you know that it has to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> come up maybe a reasonable amount i've </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> got a pc at home </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> come on like five bucks an hour i'll buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> food i promise i'll buy food you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i i don't yeah yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> seems like a bit of a rip it's a bit too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much because yeah if i want to have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> full gaming session with the boys in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cafe yeah i spent like a hundred bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right yeah and bro i can but if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> want to play like what about the entire </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> steam library for that yeah what if i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> want to play like a game of like civ 2 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like 12 hours </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of rip then yeah it's like 300 dollars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> for a game it's like what the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> i think in countries like korea it's a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> lot more affordable because they rely </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> more on like you buying food and drinks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> and stuff which i would prefer i'll buy </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> food and drink if yeah exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> because i feel like in the uk it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's it's it's a strange concept you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> know it is yeah in korea it's just a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> normal way to socialize yeah well yeah i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> noticed that in korea it was at north </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> korea in the uk uh it was either uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chinese students who were there all day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah where it was kind of like uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> british people who would be like oh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we'll play pc for an hour </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> gaming outside the house </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> what's all this switch is it like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> switch on mario </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you're a rich foreign student i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know you should be there all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a shame really because i would i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would love to game in a pcb that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that's why that's why we want to go to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> korea yeah i mean we don't really want </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to go we've been saying this before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> but we've always just wanted to spend </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like 12 hours a day gaming in a that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> my idea of a vacation sounds great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> sounds like an amazing vacation to me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> turn off my phone just game yeah look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me just game just game should get some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> toxic gaming in there yeah because i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> realized how like small </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like how unpopular pc gaming was in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japan when i actually joined the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese league of legend servers and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just like great join a japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> league of legend servers perfect way to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> practice my japanese and game at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same time yeah a little did i realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> until like about like 50 games in no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the japanese league of legend server </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speaks japanese no it's all chinese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone speaks chinese or english right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because no one japanese is playing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> japanese service ever it's just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> chinese chinese people smurfing on the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> chinese people just go to like have fun </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and what i realized is that it's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> most toxic server in the world that i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been to that's because no one japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is playing yeah it's so it's all smurfs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from other countries just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like being toxic on the server </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so yeah i can see why japanese like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> especially with league at least why it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't so popular in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> apex is a different deal but uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically the secret to getting a game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> popular in japan i guess is just to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> appeal to vcu right just put some gotcha </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> put some gotcha in league and you're all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> good you've got the japanese market oh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah it's a good social game as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well it's very easy to hop in and play a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> few games </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you ever guys want to yeah one day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one i saw you playing minecraft the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> other day yeah exactly yeah i'm i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> so disappointed you started without me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> what do you mean i was invited you guys </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't ask me come on self boys i saw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you dying in the lava like five times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> listen we don't talk about it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah we'll play minecraft yeah i've got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to get myself situated first because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i've recently just moved as well it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a new place was good it was an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting uh moving experience mostly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all the [ __ ] that uh sydney has built </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> up over the years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so we hired the same moving company </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh so there's this main guy and he knows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we're youtubers because he moved uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he moved all the trash all the trash day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff right um i don't think he was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> prepared like he knew that we were anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fans right but i don't think he was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> prepared for some of the stuff that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney had like just within her closet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember so poor man yeah before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so before before they do the move they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also have to like scout the place just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see what they have to move and how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many trucks they have to rent out and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney sydney was just like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i know the stuff i know my room's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of a bit of a nuclear like wasteland </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now you know i'm gonna clean it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bit right so what she does is she uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> takes off all like the lewd posters off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the wall right she's like i'm gonna i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cleaning up my room right now she's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna notice cleaning up clear cleaning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up my room so she takes off all the loot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> posters thinking she's got a job done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've got nothing to worry about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what she forgets </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right is there's no posters on the wall </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but there's just a massive pile of sex </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> toys in the corner </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that she just somehow forgot about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> you really know how numb she is to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of [ __ ] now right where it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah there's nothing wrong with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> right there and it's the 10 kilogram </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> boobs that are just uh lying on the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> floor so she forgets to hide that but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> she takes soft the slightly lewd posters </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> off the wall </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> this is distasteful </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so the guy opens the door and is greeted </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> by just the 10 kilogram boobs that is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just sitting on her desk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that she somehow just forgot about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> absolutely </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he probably wanted to like get out of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah and uh yeah so </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> i'll figure after we get everything </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> packed up obviously he like they they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> hired different people uh so he he's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> seen all this before but obviously his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> employees haven't seen this right oh no </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> boxes in front of you and you realize </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that oh this this one thing is in one of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> these boxes i guess how does that happen </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> how much stuff they have every move </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> items just like go into like some donny </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> darko [ __ ] happens where it just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> disappears into a void on the way it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like because like you you you look at it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i had that as well where i was </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> then somehow you add another three hours </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of packing on top of that because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's so just so much [ __ ] that's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> accumulated </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> japanese forest worth of cardboard in my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> apartment at one point luckily the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> service we ordered they took all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cardboard with them because they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unpacked it all for us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> but doesn't that doesn't that service </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_04> yourself out of it </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_08> they've got the whole dark goddamn </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> japanese workforce here doing their </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they really they really are like i don't </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> of their company or something but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they love plastering their logo all over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> the [ __ ] i mean it works it seemed </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> like a [ __ ] yeah it seemed like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> military operation yeah it's like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like that scene from the anime where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they called the sdf they're like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_08> man if you've got a family you got kids </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and [ __ ] and you're doing pretty well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> for yourself i get it i [ __ ] trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> move with my kids like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i would like i would not want to be in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my situation that i was in plus kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah i understand that it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah just bring in the [ __ ] sas bring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in the marines yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> bring in john cena to do it like i i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do not want or especially if you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you know like you know in your 60s 70s </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 80s oh god yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as you get older you know you won't be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> moving nearly as often you know i still </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know if i'm going to move in two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> years four years you know but once i'm </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> like 40. i'm probably going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> staying there for a good amount of time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> wow that is a late time to settle down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah brian's setting anytime soon are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you kidding me i know i i i get you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> unless i become a billionaire hedge fund </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man then i'll just buy 15 properties and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> live in whichever wherever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sweet i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe fly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one day these stocks are gonna turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> green and i tell you man i tell you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't settle down if you're settled </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in five different countries at the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> the grain big brain </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> because i i'm still going through that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> phase where i'm like i'm in my 30s now i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> should probably think about where i want </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> to settle down but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that just like that just like terrifies </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> me i feel like settling down is when </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know you know when you're stopped </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're working in a place that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like it's gonna be your end home i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't think i'm gonna live in japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> forever no um i can't speak the goddamn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> language </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and even if i did i'm like would i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> to raise a kid here probably not yeah um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> so i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah there's like a lot of there's a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of different factors that go into like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my long-term settlement like where i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would want to settle down like i i do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like asian culture and you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i do like live in japan but a big thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about asia is that i don't want my kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to go to school here because my god they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put so much pressure on exams and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> schooling here that i'm just like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> is this is too much this is too much i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> remember i saw a post that was on </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> facebook you know japan per capita has </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> like the least exams of any country and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like before high school yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like i was like oh that's great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah so just let them be happy until age </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> 12 and then just [ __ ] them together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're really happy and it's like give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them heaven for about 12 years and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give them hell for the next three that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> make that makes so much sense because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> japanese kids are like so [ __ ] cute </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like whenever you see school kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> they're so nice say hello you know they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they just they're just so inquisitive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything and then like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> suddenly it's like it's before they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> learn right now it's just like a flip </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but i swear like every japanese teenager </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes to the same moody teenager face oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like it's it's like there is no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> exception </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm telling you kids get cocky when they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> learn racism </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> as it is right it's like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's just like because i can tell like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because you know sometimes with japanese </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> kids right just from looking at them you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> don't know how old these some of these </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> kids are like there are some like 10 </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> year olds that look 30 and there are </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> some 30 year olds that look 10. yeah you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> know so and but like you can always tell </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> though when it's like a middle school </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> japanese kid and a high school japanese </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> kid not from their looks but from their </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> attitude how happy they are yeah how </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> happy they are </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and just from their attitude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> towards how i guess they like talk to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> foreigners i guess in a sense like high </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> school students are very scared of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> talking yeah they are but middle school </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> and like elementary school japanese kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love talking to people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to coach children in the street </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah i'm not going around going </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like hello to every child but yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in my older shoes in my old apartment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the only people who would ever like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> converse with me are like the little </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kids yeah whenever i get stuck in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> lift and i'm like oh what do you want to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> go to where did you come from where did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you go i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is going on they love talking to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then i don't know what happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something in high school happens where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just suddenly become paranoid of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> foreign </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they ruin their life yeah i guess yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then with the expectations but you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> also know but you also know which high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> school student dropped out because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're very happy yeah yeah they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh yeah hello how are you yes i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not in school anymore doing really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for myself thank you very much don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> have to go through 17 exams a year i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just wouldn't want my kid going through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the system yeah yeah same yeah also if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese banks are like this god knows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god knows what the rules are like were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese schools </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my lord i think it depends like being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> a parent having to deal with it it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like i think i think though it depends </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> heavily on the school that you go to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like obviously like i think public </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> schools definitely have it the worst i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think that's the same with any country </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> out there uh but you know if you go to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like if you take your kids like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> private school or even an international </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> school like i think it gets a little bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> better yeah probably </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> i don't plan on having kids anytime soon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> no i mean either that's that's that's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> problem for like future me to figure out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah that's a trash taste episode 5000 i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> think yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> episode five thousand terry's kids [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> himself in school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> am i right </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> can you relate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> uh so i went fishing this weekend i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i know we were talking about a trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> chase fishing special i'm sorry guys i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> can't believe you'd do that too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where the [ __ ] was my invite ask me lynn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> maylin was one who invited me mainly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] i play i blame </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i trusted you maylene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah melin just uh invited us uh me and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cindy if uh we wanted to have like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of kind of like a double date where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh we go fishing together and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i've really [ __ ] enjoyed it i look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like you're enjoying it like you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about to shoot yourself on the boat oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah so like okay so this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like so this is the first time where i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> went sea fishing so it wasn't like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't uh fishing in a river or a lake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which i've done before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> before uh so </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> so it is it is an entirely different </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> experience right mostly because </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> i've never been seasick in my life right </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were talking about this so on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> journey up there everyone's like oh does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone here get seasick which is if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get seasick and you're about to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fishing on the sea probably a bad idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah but none of us had ever been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seasick before so we're like great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fishing on a c easy um what we didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize is what i didn't realize is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're actively doing doing things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and having to concentrate things on top </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of being on the sea and being on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> edge of a boat it like amps up your sea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sickness to 10 so this is the first time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd ever felt queasy on a boat right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i mean the uh the entire thing was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> like aside from having to deal with the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> seasickness it was it was pretty damn </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> fun so what happened is we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> uh we went down to yokohama and we went </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to the port there </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and so we are they we have they have </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> this package where you basically go out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to sea for about four hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it was like yeah about about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four years yeah decent amount of time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and basically whatever you catch you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keep and you can do whatever you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the fish so back when i went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in wisconsin we have whatever we call we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could only keep a certain amount but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> here you can like keep whatever you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you can cook them afterwards as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and so yeah so we went out to see um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i remember at the beginning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it was me sydney maylin and marky </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so obviously it was our first time so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the fishman was trying to teach us how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was done yeah right and within the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first hour malin catches two immediately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and she's she's just she's just on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fire right now she's like i'm a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> natural i'm a [ __ ] natural imagine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> how smart yeah she was so [ __ ] smug </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> uh didn't catch anything for the rest of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the trip </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like karma compilation yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and like and like on the opposite side </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> of things which was sydney and while </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> melin was like catching her first two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with him now sydney was like struggling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get like the real down right like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the the fisherman was like next to her </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like a full-on hour like explaining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to her then explaining her to her again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and like like here he was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eagle-eyed on her just trying trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> make sure that she was doing everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> correctly because she was not getting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> any catches </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and then somehow like after an hour </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in she just starts [ __ ] reeling and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fish like it's no business she starts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> catching like four or five fish at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> end of it learns the controls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> can finally play the game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and then there's maki uh which uh poga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who's maiden's husband mackie a poor guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> caught i uh i think i think he caught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like one fish at the end and so did i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually no actually i caught like three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or four but most of them were two well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's very different to one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> i caught one fish that i could keep and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the rest were just like too small to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> even like to even be worth right now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> right kills babies because stabs them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> throughout because because maki </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately was like way too seasick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to be able to function for most of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trip yeah which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is the thing where melin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh melin also was seasick and so was i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be fair uh but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mainland being male in was didn't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to admit it because uh she she uh she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> was like really silent after about an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hour and she was just sitting down and i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like man you're right and she was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like yep yep i'm cool i'm just i'm just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh just a little bit tired a little bit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> tired uh she told me afterwards that she </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just didn't want to admit she was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> seasick in case like me or cindy would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> be like oh no little baby </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> your medicine for seasickness yeah you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> can you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> which we totally would have done anyway </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but as soon as soon as maki mentioned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that he was feeling seasick she turns to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> me and sydney was like maki seasick </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> she's seasick i'm taking care of maki </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he's stay sick </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm like wow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> what an awesome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that's a brother and i'm just like i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seasick as well you know obviously i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm not you know it's it's normal to get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> seasoned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the blinking like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what hey you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it was so funny because uh maki did uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the marquis first catch right uh he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um he reeled in two little like super </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> small fish they were like baby fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right they were like this big you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't you can't really do anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> with them so it's like at this point you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> just catch and release it yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> it was the first like baby fish we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> caught on the day and this was about two </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> hours in and so he caught them and i was </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like oh look at the little baby fish </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> though you know we should probably </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> probably release them so we uh he takes </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> the hook out and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> he starts like he puts them back in the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> ocean and they start swimming off and i </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> swear to god this thing's like this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a scene from the simpsons right you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can see them swimming off and sydney in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> her little in her little you know you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know when sydney is just like talks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about a dog or talks about any animal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she's like go swim little baby swim swim </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then as soon as she finishes saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that out of nowhere a seagull appears </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and just dive bombs the fish out of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> water </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and eats it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the four of us are just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> we're just standing there looking at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> this [ __ ] atrocity in silence </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we're just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> the circle of life yeah it's it's the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> circle of life seagull annihilates tiny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> faces nature has been restored </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my god oh but it was actually like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was actually like a really fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> experience how much was it to go out on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the boat it was like about a hundred </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dollars so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> per person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you can catch as much fish as you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and afterwards so you you go catch the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fish and um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> afterwards you uh they have different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> services </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so off so you can go to an uh izakaya </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they can cook the fish or you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go to an onsen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh so there's this onsen that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to which is perfect for like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're fishing for four hours it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> surprisingly tight yeah it's like way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> more fishing on the sea is way more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> active than doing lake fishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or river fishing right because you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're basting against the current and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're constantly like it's way more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's way more active because uh i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know what they call it but uh they they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gave you like this little cage right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you got the bait which is on the hook </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then next to the bait is this little </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cage where you basically stuff in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um stuff in like fish like dead fishes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chunks oh is that what it's called yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay okay so oh that oh that's why it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> called a chum bucket </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> oh my god it makes so much sense now is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> mashed up fish yeah so they gave us a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chum bucket i guess i i was i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> struggling to find the worst describe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this [ __ ] thing it's a chum bucket </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man discovers spongebob for the first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had a chum bucket and so we had to fill </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up this cage full of chum and the the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cage itself </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> would uh attract the fish school with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the smell right and the bait itself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would like attract the fish uh to bite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on it yeah unfortunately like the chum </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would like disintegrate within like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know within like a good five five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> minutes so like every every every five </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> minutes you'd have to like put it down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> pick it back up put it down pick it back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fill it up fill it up again fill up the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh chamber uh fill up the chum cage with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more chum from your chum buckets and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was actually like way more of an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> activity that's what god's new favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> word is now we're gonna be feeling like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're gonna be hearing this a lot </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> and so it was a way more active </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh it was made way more active than </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the other kind of fishing i experienced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i was actually pretty tired um i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was i worked up a good sweat and my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> god the onsen afterwards </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_08> just because of how annoying it is to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> maintain oh yeah and like that that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> breaks so easily also like when you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like super serious there's like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> i'm if i'm 50 and i haven't decided the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> hobby yet i think as a white person that </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_09> cancel </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> he still streams right i'm pretty sure i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> think so [ __ ] yeah so you know there's a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> future man i i mean maybe i'm already </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like low on energy now there's lots of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> people who want me to be i'm sure you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> say that but you stream more than me and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> joey combined yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i feel like i'm really low on energy but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then you guys always don't stream much </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> so i don't know maybe i think there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difference between low and energy and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't you know not being [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah right it's like i'm not low on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> energy i just can't be [ __ ] yeah maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe yeah yeah i mean i i can't tell if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like i am low on energy a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> times because i have to like who am i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kidding who am i kidding i have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conserve my energy for trash taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people think i talk a lot and then no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like i can serve all my all my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like social energy for [ __ ] trash </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chase every week and then i like i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reset every week </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> takes a lot of time it's hard work in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> this in this show honestly though if i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> stream then that's my work done for the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> day because i can do it in the night </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> how do i have energy after i've been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> working all day to also stream which is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> to me work </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sometimes you start streaming and then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you just kind of get energy as you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> streaming it's kind of i get that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes it happens like sometimes i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> really dreading it's called being an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> extrovert </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> like literally it's like you're getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you're gaining the energy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah you know that you're stifling the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> energy from social interaction right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me it's the opposite like i have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> certain amount of energy and i have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> expel that during the day basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> spell expel i'll be [ __ ] it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't bring [ __ ] out we have to [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> my energy </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> no more [ __ ] we promise no more [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like god goes to the toilet and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sydney's like are you expelling your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> energy honey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> during my energy exploration period </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> how else is the moving stuff going are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you kind of getting settled in is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dreading yeah it's uh because this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a bit different now because i lived </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> in an apartment and this one's a house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh bougie i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] at this point i was actually i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> actually really lucky to get this house </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because the previous owner has gotten a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> job abroad </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and so he was very desperate to find a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> tenant so we got it at like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> amazing price because we were like when </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we were looking for other places we were </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> we were we didn't even know if we were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to move because i remember talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to you guys because you both were moving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you wanted bigger places and i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm actually really happy with my place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was a good size though yeah it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good size and i was just like i'm only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to move if i can find like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> decent enough upgrade and we saw other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> places which for the budget that was set </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and nothing was really like nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really standing out i was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever maybe i'll just stay for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another year and then this was like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last house that uh we looked at because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the stage and was like yeah we have we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have one more on offer um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's uh that you might enjoy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah we saved the best for last and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh so we looked at this house and it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like twice the size of any other place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd shown us for the same price yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and we're like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um there is there is a catch though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is i don't know what the exact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> contract was called but we only have it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for a maximum of two years so that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> the cash you have to get out so after </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> two years we have to get switches if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're like get really settled in you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> really like well remember when we were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looking for places for the trash taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> office that we one of the places we were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> considering i don't know if we talked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about us on camera but one of the places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were considering was exactly the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah the first place we found it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was like this like three-story house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like oh yeah this is like looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like a perfect space but then we found </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> out that oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like it was owned by an expat who </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> was overseas now but he was like i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming back in two years so you better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> get the [ __ ] out yeah oh yeah yeah i do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think this one's actually better in the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> end i think the studio is definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely better in the end but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> initially when we were looking at new </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> studios that was one that we were like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> really happy with good price good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> location </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> so in in the end what what made you move </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there was just because the like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> house the house is from the house the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> location was amazing the house is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] amazing um and i was just like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i move on average every two years anyway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so like i i'm i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's do it as we just discussed i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> one to settle down so i just i like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> mixing it up you know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i like getting changed yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> and as annoying as it is like i do like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it but also like two years is a long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> time if you think about it it is very </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> long so to me at least two years is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> a [ __ ] long time especially for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> youtube something exciting about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> upgrading a little bit as well you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know i've been working hard i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just have a little bit of an upgrade you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know yeah i'm giving myself a pound on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the back i mean my new place like three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> times more expensive than my old one but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's because i didn't know how i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> do financially when i moved here yeah i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't wanna i didn't i mean yeah when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> first moved here i had [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> choice yeah you had to you know i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> want the bedroom i had a one bedroom </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah same here because when i moved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> here sydney just didn't have a career </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yet so it was like it was i remember </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that yeah yeah you're paying everything </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of it was on a lot of it was on me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like well she she you know she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously paid for it as well but uh a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of it was if it rested on you yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if like if sydney falls through and her </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube career doesn't take off then all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this is gonna fall on me yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> that's why i was like that's what i was </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> thinking about but now it's a lot more </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> comfortable we can both share the cost </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> so we were able to have like a bigger </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> budget but still not stupidly large </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> um and yeah we just found a nice pretty </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> nice house and then sydney's crew took </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> off and we went stupidly lost </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in my mind i was like because we were </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> living so far away well to say where we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> live now kind of like are we allowed to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it was very far away not very far away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it kind of was kind of wasn't i also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> lived really far away from the station </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> so i felt like double damage yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like for me i lived literally three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> minutes away from this super close so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> like i was like five minutes like i just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> had like a nice distance yeah and then i </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> lived like ridiculously far away yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like i didn't you were like halfway </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> between two stations i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> basically yeah yeah and so i had the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> really annoying case of just like i'm 50 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minute walk to one station 20 minutes to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other yeah yeah which like doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seem like a big deal but when you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some days when you have to go back and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forth multiple times it really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt dreadful yeah and i just got to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point where i'm like okay i'm doing well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> for myself i'm just going to spend the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> extra money just to get somewhere that's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> super close and that i can focus more on </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> work don't have to worry about traveling </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> now i don't have to worry too much about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and before i always had a plan precisely </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when i was leaving the house yeah yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because i had to get i had to look what </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> the train was i had to make sure i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting the express train because where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were was so far away that you could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get an express train that saved you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quite a significant amount of time and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so normally commutes are about an hour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me yeah which is quite a long time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you do have to really like think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> okay why am i leaving the house but now </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> now i can just kind of be like i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> generally know what time i need to leave </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i kind of like the commute though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> me currently i'm also like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just like travel distance for me like to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> the office for example is like pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much the same as it was yeah right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not that much different time wise it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> just in a different way i always </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> complained about it because for me i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> definitely valued distance </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> from like where i was going right a lot </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like i really liked the commute though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because it puts my mind off of work for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> even i like it i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i liked it until a certain point because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> commuting here was fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> commuting back is a [ __ ] nightmare </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> because like that's i would always dread </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it right because commuting i don't mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> staying on the train but when it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're going back after we finish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> filming trash taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally like in london it's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rush hour is from let's say five o'clock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> till seven o'clock right where like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the [ __ ] tube is packed you're not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> getting a seat and you're like a sardine </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for some reason the [ __ ] rush hour in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> tokyo starts from like four till like 9 </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 30 at night right no no it doesn't it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> doesn't end it's just it just goes it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> goes until midnight yeah yeah so so like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so it's like the commute back was just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like a nightmare i would like dread it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> so i would dread the commute back every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time so it's it was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normally if i was in london i would just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wait out the rush hour but in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there is no waiting out the rush out you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> just you just got to deal with it yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> it depends right because like some like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you said you don't mind the commute </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that's good i mean very op for you you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> can get a much bigger place you have a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> much bigger place than me uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's it's kind of like i don't know i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just i hated commuting yeah and to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i felt like i could spend my time better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i did want to spend my time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> differently like like streaming right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like an extra hour of streaming is a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difference oh yeah yeah so that would go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like a long way so yeah i think for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as well it's because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an hour commute for me now is so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better than what i first had when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first moved here because when i first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moved here i lived in a place that was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> 25 minute walk to the closest station </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know and it was like way out of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> tokyo kind of thing so like you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> commuting into tokyo would be like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hour and a half two hours which is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walk don't get me wrong it's fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walking is not the problem it's walking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in the summer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah sometimes you know you can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> always be what you'd like you sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you have to carry a bunch of [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's where it really [ __ ] sucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm so glad that finally i'm able to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] wear a sweater right right it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> so nice now like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> speaking of weather though like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where did autumn go yeah it's just it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> just was like here for two days and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like all right see it just turned </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> into winter it's it's always like that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm so glad though because i can finally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> wear some drip right right without </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> dripping myself yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's [ __ ] disgusting for like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> middle of september it was so gross yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean like i just like how japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> decided that it was going to be hot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> until it wasn't one day and then it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> decided it was it literally was it it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> went from 25 to 14 in one day yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> and it doesn't look like it's going back </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> how does that happen </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> weather japan has four seasons everybody </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what they tell you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> no they don't it has pain for six months </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> then mild discomfort for two and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the rest are okay i guess yeah it's kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of correct </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's kind of right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> one biggest thing going back to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> house one biggest thing that i've had to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> go to get used to uh living in the house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is uh living on the ground floor now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right oh yeah i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> only lived i've only lived in japan i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean it's like i've only lived in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apartments in japan before and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> like quite high up in my old apartment </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> so you know what you know i could stand </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> next to the window and uh be pretty </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> confident that no one was going to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> me you know you know yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> when you sleep you sometimes you just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> sleep in boxes as a as as </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> as you do and sometimes sometimes you're </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> just out of the shower and you don't get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> dressed yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly you didn't get dressed straight </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> away you put on your boxes or whatever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just walk around the apartment um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and uh i i kind of realized that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can't do that in houses </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so our house has like pretty big [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> windows right yeah and so i have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shower put on my boxes and uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the bathroom uh or my shower room and my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wardrobe is on different floors right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> finishing the shower go up to the go up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to my living room and just you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chilling you know before i put on some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> clothes um go up to go up to my window </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to like admire the view </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as you do sometimes just admire the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> sunshine on the ground floor </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> admire the pavement </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on on the first floor on the first wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a little elevation a little bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> across me direction yeah so it changes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything yeah because you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes when i was on when i was on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the when i was on like the eighth floor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> back in my old apartment sometimes you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just like to look down breathe in the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> sunshine and i thought i'd do the same </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> routine uh so i was just standing in my </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> window um and then </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> uh someone opens their uh </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> someone goes out to the balcony to put </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> out some clothes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh me and them need eye contact and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um i i'm totally not used to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back in when you're an apartment i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> used to just being by the window and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nobody could see you because you're too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> high up to be seen yeah um and then so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we make eye contact and then they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediately just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> close the closed sliding door again and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then i realize i'm just standing next to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> my window with my boxes out and people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> can very visibly see me and i'm like 20 </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> meters away it was this person they were </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> like across the road so like 10 meters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> away yeah it's like 10 meters away so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> they had 4k definitions </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> literally caught in 4k my god if it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> mailing and she would like be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she would have seen my nipples and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything [ __ ] scarred for life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> there my god fallen right off the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> balcony yeah i'm not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> in shock </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> are you liking a new playstore so far </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah really liking it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> also another thing uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i had to go back to my house by myself </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> to pick up some stuff uh pretty late at </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> night and uh </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's uh it's it's pretty scary to go </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> back it's it's creepy as [ __ ] to go in </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> the house and i didn't i didn't realize </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that until i went in </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> because when you're in apartment there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like lights </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> outside of your building yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there there are lights and there are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people living next to you yeah you go in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this house um and it's just pitch black </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're just by yourself and you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know what i wasn't afraid of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the dark until i experienced this and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm so creepy about an empty apartment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> pitch black there was something really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> weird about it yeah an apartment's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i can handle an apartment because the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worst thing if you if something happens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if like a [ __ ] murderer is there or a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] burglar is there you can scream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and people are people around you i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> know yeah you have too much confidence </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> in people yeah i think i think i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you like your neighbors a little too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know maybe it's probably just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a placebo but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels murderous in japan i'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apartments yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's placebo but it feels safer it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it i don't know it's like having a night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> light you know it feels like it feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's not too far away from your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> front door whereas in the house you're </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> kind of just there by yourself and uh we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we have a detached house as well so </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> um so it feels like you're just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> completely there </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> isolated whereas in an apartment </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you know there there's the apartment </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> block where there's people outside </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> sometimes going in and out there's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> lights even at night time um so just i </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> don't know right it just it just feels </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like you're a bit more isolated it feels </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> scarier uh i could see why people can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get scared of ghosts now in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's [ __ ] creepy as [ __ ] oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> i don't want to talk about ghosts yeah i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> got rinsed from the comments last time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you actually wait what did you say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh when i talked about ghosts people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> were very angry that i spoke about i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't believe him yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then it was one of those that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> another one of those times i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> damn i wish i could like go write a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] script on why i don't believe in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> ghosts and why they're stupid new videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why i don't believe in ghosts 50 yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> there was a there's a guy who made like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he made a follow-up video about us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about ghosts basically oh really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> yes basically </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> saying my point but eloquent and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> actually and actually explaining </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> what is this video called is bob with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> his name dark viper a u i think he </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> watches trash tastes a lot </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> he's a speed runner and while he was </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> speed running games he was just giving </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this amazingly amazingly eloquent </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> explanation as to why people believe in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ghosts and why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> generally like a coping thing and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatnot yeah you know it's stuff that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally agree with but it's one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> those things that you can never change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if someone believes in ghosts you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never going to change their mind yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but but it's like but for me to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't believe in it sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> people get offended by that they're like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> never experienced it even if i did i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> wouldn't care but the thing is i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> never experienced it but i still believe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> in it yeah yeah because it's i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> know it's it's cool </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i understand that it's nice to believe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> in but it's just one of those things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i'm just like maybe i'm just too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> boring i don't know to me it just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't make sense i mean to me i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> believe it yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> but that's i didn't believe it until i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> experienced something and then i did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> believe it so yeah but again i always </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> think there's a logical explanation for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything oh no of course of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think there's there's always a an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> explanation that might be boring might </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> not be immediately obvious uh that can </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> explain it well i mean yeah like every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every mystery ever in history you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's ever been solved has turned out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to be not magic right it's like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> there's always there's always something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> behind it yeah yeah there's there's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> always there's always some like we just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> don't have the capability to understand </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> certain things and yeah i guess the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> people use that argument for you that's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> that could mean that we don't ghosts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could be real we don't understand that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're like yeah but everything else in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> our world thus far has proven to be the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> case that stuff like that doesn't tend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be yeah i believe in like the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> supernatural or like the paranormal but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't believe in 99 of the media that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> comes out this is like i guess </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that i really despise and this is one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thing that i absolutely hate about and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which really leads me to feel strongly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> against it is the whole industry that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> propped up around yeah no no exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ghosts uh you know i don't agree with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> fortune tellers spirit mediums that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff it's so predatory at times yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it makes me just want to like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get rid of it all just yeah no no one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't believe in ghosts because if one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person believes in ghosts then there has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to be someone who then gets into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> believing into ghosts and then falls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down this whole rabbit hole uh their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> husband dies someone comes to them tells </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> me i'll let you speak to husband for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> fifty dollars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that is predatory and that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's kind of different that's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> people taking advantage of people who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are like very vulnerable and very just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> looking for answers and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> but i believe there are people out there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> who i wouldn't class as vulnerable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe gullible more so oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> there's nothing bad happen to them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> they're maybe more likely to believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this kind of stuff and i suppose you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> can't argue that they're not getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what they want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're paying for some [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but that's kind of what in my eyes it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] but that's me by paying well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe they'll ask for oh so i have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> friends very good friends who go to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fortune tellers and stuff and i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> flat out just do not believe fortune </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> challenges </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i just you know i think there is um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there are a lot of questions that would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> be a raise oh so you know how to read </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fortunes then uh why don't why are you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> not very fortunate why are you not using </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> this to your ability why do you not own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> about 10 portions a fortune's able to be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> changed is this something you know and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and if if not why why is god just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> bespoke uh bestowed you with this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knowledge yeah the old people and why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you not using it to your owner yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just find that there are so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> questionable actions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and ultimately it all comes down to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> fact that you're charging money yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you're getting paid well um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're free to believe in whatever the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you want as long as you're not like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> extorting people yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> when you when you add when you add money </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> into the mix of course it's going to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] messy especially especially if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you try to like monetize this and i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think i think yeah if you want to give </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> away a fortune for free go ahead no yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> but like i you know to like claim that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you have some kind of special power or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something well there's no way to prove </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that and yes right now whether you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> believe in ghosts or not there is no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> tangible proof </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> for or against for me like i believe i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe in the supernatural i believe in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> supernatural things because to me i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the moment there is so much about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> universe and the world that even science </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> consciousness yeah i believe that i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> believe i'm i'm near certain that alien </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> species out there exist that we have not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been able to you know come across </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the universe is too big but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> the whole concept of modern ghosts and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the way that we understand them i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> is completely incorrect but what is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> concept what is the concept of modern </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> ghosts like the idea that someone would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> die and they're just going to hang </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> around a place haunting it like what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like are you serious no no that's not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna i believe in it no no god no well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> but it's also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but it's also because like a lot of like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> shintoist belief revolutions right on </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that i understand that and i kind of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> come up with it that's why i you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> it's one of the it's very tough for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to argue uh again like i'm not prepared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> i think we're going to talk about it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah no i'm not eloquent enough </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> don't watch this video this time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's great i don't know like i i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> generally am of a scientific mindset uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just absolutely appreciated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the time i am generally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> favorable towards the sciences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't believe in like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like people who can read like star signs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and meridian lines yeah i'm sure if you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you presented some kind of paranormal </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> activity that we had and we really sat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down and we really went through it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we really started poking holes in it we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> could probably you know debunk most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> things oh yeah i'm sure and any of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff that is generally when you say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's unsolvable or nothing to explain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's generally a massive lack of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> information or not enough stuff </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's what i mean right it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's a lot like like ufo footage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like yeah i believe in ufos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but i don't believe in 99 percent of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> photos or videos </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly like a lot of the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scandalous stuff yeah yeah same with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> ghosts but ufos for sure because we know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they exist but there's there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tons of unidentified objects we don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but there are also a lot of like you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know haunted videos and like paranormal </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> activity like videos and photos that are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just like it's no matter how you look at </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it it's unexplainable it's become such a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and yeah i think i feel like you just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> hate the culture around it right i do i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really do i don't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i never talk about this because i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah i believe in ghosts and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hardly mention it because it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i believe in it because i've seen it i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't really like like to talk about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just it's my experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's just you can't force someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to believe in her i don't know i i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> want other people to believe what like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> experience what i experienced that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just my experience i think it's done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> personally but i will never be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're a stupid person for believing in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it yeah and i'm and i'm not going to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like how dare you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you guys you guys have some form of some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> belief in it i would never be like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think you guys are stupid because you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> believe in it i personally to me it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> feels dumb yeah the idea of it yeah but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't care if anyone else no and and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i i'm completely fine with people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who don't believe in it because you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it can't be helped right it's like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't experienced it of course you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> not gonna believe in it yeah because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like to me it's like the opposite sense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where yes i i completely agree the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> culture is very messy it's very very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sensationalized which i hate psychics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's yeah so many like people who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have debunked people who have monetized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this that how can you not know that a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of people are just predatory but at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the same time i do believe there is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of things that have not been able to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> explain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with current science and i think it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even i think i think it's naive to not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think that there is not something more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out there that hasn't been explained yet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's so many there's so much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about you know there's so much we don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand we we take for granted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because science says science has evolved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and progressed so much that we forget </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how much we still do not [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about just the united </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we don't understand stand situation and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we don't have the tools to be able to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> explain it i i don't think that a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> paranormal explanation is the correct </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one because you know we didn't know we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know what caused like cholera for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a long time yeah you know i'm sure at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some point they thought it was it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the devil right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> one of those things where it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> generally when we've come to at least my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> belief is that when we we just don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have the tools or the knowledge of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subsequent fields or physics or math to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> understand certain things but also most </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of the time it's so [ __ ] minuscule </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what happened it doesn't [ __ ] matter </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like if your door closed one night and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was real spooky it's like why would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> anyone delve deep into trying to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> disprove you your door uncomfortably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> closed it's called a draft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like there are so many things that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not worth explaining oh yeah generally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> most of the [ __ ] that is spooky is so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not worth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wasting time on trying to figure out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's so little information </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we have yeah that's not worth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> explaining anyway well that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> one more thing </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> i also do want to acknowledge that there </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> is you know the whole psychic stuff and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and all that i do understand that there </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> is a market that is pure entertainment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right i could go to a fortune </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teller they could tell me a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nonsense i don't believe a word they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said but it was fun to hear the funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> words that they did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i understand that's an angle and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fine with that i like your funny words </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> magical things magic man thank you for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> telling me that i'm going to be wealthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> i appreciate that but i'm i'm also like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> going to hear when i've i've i've gone </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> to a fortune teller before because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i i like to experience what kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> generic way they're going to tell me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about my future yeah i love to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand the way that they're trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do it yeah but that's not of a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me genuinely believing it but i do think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are a lot of people out there who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> really believe in this stuff yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i i almost my mom's one of those people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and i'm like i'm like some sometimes my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> mom like takes me to a fortune teller </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm like mom again my mom again you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get the same [ __ ] spiel every time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> proven that you know they say generic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> things it can apply to anything it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> called reading code cold reading is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> technique it's a psychological technique </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's the thing i have i almost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have an appreciation for these psychics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not so much in the supernatural sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but more on the psychological sense of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> being like darren brown is more along </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm not he always says he's not psychic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but like just using the faults of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> human yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> psychology </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and that's like more interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anyone who's good at that would never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> claim to be psychic or yeah nothing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they understand that it's a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> more than that because psychic really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> undervalues what you're doing yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> magic brain thing yeah like do i do i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe in like psychics and people who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can cold read and stuff like that no do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i believe there are people out there who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can maybe sense some supernatural things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yes i do i died really yeah i don't care </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> enough i mean i mean i think it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because again like god and i have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> personal experience of either ourselves </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or someone we know this comes from just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> my understanding the the brain is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so flawed in many ways and that of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> course yeah you know there's been like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh i know someone gave an argument this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i saw a comment that was arguing about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> this and it was just like if you can't </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> prove it what's the what's that really </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> horrible argument method where it's like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> if you can't prove it's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> not real </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> then it then it is real yeah and it's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> like no no no no no you need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the burden is proving that it's real not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it isn't well that's that's that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is what i i find the most annoying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about arguing the subject is that for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> some reason it's on the burden to me to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> prove that you don't have magical sixth </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sense no prove to me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> concretely that you do that's the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> people who say like oh yes proof is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> synonym for true it's like no it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> really not well that's that's the thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's no way to prove it right now and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that's why it's we call believing it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's there's so many things right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have you watched naruto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's that he doesn't just say that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> shut the [ __ ] up i'm about to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> leave right now okay so like believe it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> there's so many like you know i'm trying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to argue a point here joey don't argue a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] point here there's just so many </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> goddamn clips of people you know where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> they they go to people who are like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can talk to the dead or i can feel the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dead and then they show them pictures of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who aren't dead they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey they're not dead they're like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well you know it's like this happens so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many goddamn times so it's like at what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> point are we just gonna be like come on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is just [ __ ] literally everyone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who claims they can do this somewhere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> another when they put the test they fail </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like rarely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> no one ever passes these tests why but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like most of the time like most most of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the people i've met who have stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> around this it's got nothing to do with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this the sensationalized [ __ ] you see on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> tv that's true </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> but that's that's what also makes it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very difficult to have this discussion </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah people have their beliefs they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so strong in their beliefs that they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> don't consider that they could have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe experienced something that wasn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> there yeah more often than not they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> never </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> like arguing about someone with their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> religion right which is right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> you never like it's it's just it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a lose-lose argument because either you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe in religion or you don't and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like neither according to the other side </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> neither is right or wrong terrible at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> admitting our own faults as human beings </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> right there's so many like you know you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to criminal cases there's so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like uh trials and stuff where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eyewitness testimony has been given and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they swear 100 they have nothing to lose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by lying about this that they saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something happened that turned out it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't happen and that their memory </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because memory is so unreliable and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feelings are so unreliable and what you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> see is never exactly what you remember </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it to be these things we are so terribly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> inconsistent as humans that i find it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hard to believe that one person who </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> experienced sang so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so wildly kind of outer worldly and that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> we don't is it out of worldly though i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> there are big there are there are bigger </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] mysteries out there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's case by case sometimes i've heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff where i'm like no and there's some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things i'm like you know that just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds like you had an experience that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't describe as um like that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a ghost thing it's like you just had an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience yeah that isn't like a ghost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or haunted i think you felt something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and i thought that was a you thing i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't think that was the world that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know what i mean i feel like that's you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i was in the same room with you at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> exact same time i would not have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced the same thing as you right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it is entirely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a thing that that is happening to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's it's a mental thing that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on i don't think it's a thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's in this like physical world or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this material world or whatever i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something that if you put two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people in the same room and one of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is having that kind of experience and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're feeling things yeah like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you when you went on that tour or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever you know there's like if you go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a tour and you know haunted house and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why one person feel things and one on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't i don't think it's a ghost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> choosing oh spooky on the god you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i think it's you are setting your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your mind is capable you believe that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could happen you are a person who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> is susceptible to feeling that you could </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> be haunted so you go into a place </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> expecting maybe i could be haunted i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> open to this idea something happens you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> feel something and then you your mind is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> like haunted or well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i could argue the i could argue the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> complete opposite right because i would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> never yeah yeah i totally agree no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> because like you you arguing the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mentality that they're susceptible to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believing in this thing but right on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> opposite of on the opposite side of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> fence you are someone who is so adverse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to this idea that you would you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> where in your head it's just like oh </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> that just happened that was a bit weird </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all right anyway brush it off possibly i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think that it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really tough because like you said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it did happen i i would probably just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would probably think of a logical </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conclusion as to why that happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly and more often than not i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i can adequately explain what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> happened where other people around me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whether that was a noise or something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that happened i can normally be like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> well that's what i find this whole like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess culture to be interesting about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> right is that like we don't know like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> both sides don't know and yeah it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> conversation of the believer versus the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> non-believer who is right who the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> knows but it's fun to talk about yeah i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think unfortunately there's people who </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> argue my side more often than not argue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the point that people who believe the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] are dumb yeah and so it kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> makes this really horrible </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> but of course like that that like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whole sensationalized side of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just that's just an image problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it is it is so much of an image problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because so much of the the media around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the supernatural is like sensationalized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially especially like [ __ ] with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> like halloween you like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like [ __ ] tv is unfucking watchable </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> no i agree in halloween because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> everything is like ghost specials yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that's all the [ __ ] that's why like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> even though i wasn't i wasn't saying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like you're [ __ ] stupid if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> believe this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the last time we spoke about this i got </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> like the comments people like were </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> saying to me they were some of them were </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like really [ __ ] rude about it they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> were like connor's just he just thinks </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> everyone's stupid if they don't believe </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> him like no they didn't say that it's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> like i personally i think that stuff to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> me yeah is is dumb yeah but i would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> never be like you're a dumb person i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> believe well i i think the important </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> thing is that you like people recognize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it is a belief and people have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> experienced it sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> people can believe different things but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you never want to make them feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they've been discredited for feeling the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> way they do i think that's why we have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> such a tough political climate right </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> because because for a long time all </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> these really uh </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> extreme beliefs were like oh you're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> stupid they're the most i think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the problem as well is that there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really a difference between people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have a belief of like this could be true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> and then the people who swear that is </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> true yeah and like like i'm one of those </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people together yeah and they get mixed </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> together and it's like and that's where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the bad image comes like i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely one of those people who is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the former where it's like i believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this could be a possibility and i find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it more fun personally to think of it in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that sense but i'm not going to come out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and say like ghosts are real 100 no cap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no no i mean all right like i'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> going to say that like we just discussed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't prove ghosts are not real but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't prove ghosts of [ __ ] views </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly but like i have more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> enjoyment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i hate the argument of you can't prove </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not really i personally have the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoyment of thinking you know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there is a possibility we just don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know and that's what i find exciting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about believing in this thing yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> feel great for me for me it's like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's less of just it's less of just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is a fun thing for me to believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's more of just like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone's had different experience i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had like my own experience as well and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> couldn't i guess like i couldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> logically explain it and so what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> happened was well </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> at this moment with my experiences and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> what i've seen it's more likely for me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that it exists and it doesn't exist and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> am i open to the fact that maybe what i </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> experienced wasn't real you know i'm </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> open either way but right now based on </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> my experience i'm just like yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believe it and that's what i think i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> it's all about whether you're </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> no cat facts no printer it's all about i </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> guess like whether you're just like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> naturally susceptible to i guess like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> believing in things like spirituality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i think that kind of definitely is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> uh if you didn't grow up with that side </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i feel it's a little harder yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it definitely comes i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone around me was quite religious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christian or catholic etc </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um i just i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> my problem probably uh where i started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to grow a disdain towards that stuff is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just didn't enjoy it when i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> younger like i hated church i hated all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that stuff right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you know when you get older and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you discover the internet you're like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> wow i can do my own research and then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you start like googling stuff and yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then uh i don't know i think i was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> very and then the four chance scientists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> come out shadows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> um yeah i i think is entirely reflective </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of how i view the world like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you know i guess what like what's the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] meaning of life bro boy what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> rogers bro you're gonna bring that out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> man what is this [ __ ] trash chase </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> right now okay like why why what are we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what is it what is our purpose man what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> are we doing rick and morty it's too </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> deep down the stand rig </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know man it's just like oh you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> know the same reason why when i look at </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a i look at a fish what's the what's the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fish doing what's the fish's purpose </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get in my stomach that's right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> exactly perfect just be [ __ ] eaten by </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> someone else right yeah so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like you said he's sitting around being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> like so what is the purpose of this so i </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> sit here and i look at like all these </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> animals that just there to be eaten or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to survive and i think that in some </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> senses we're just the same we're not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not we don't have some grand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> purpose to have some spiritual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience it's just we're just here to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] eat and get on with our [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if i want to play some goddamn league of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> legends for 12 hours a day that the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> universe has allowed me because i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> done my duty which is survive and now i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> can mentally destroy my life be a league </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but you know i think once you've done </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> once you've survived that's it i believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i believe they call that a nihilist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> the problem is is that now we just have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> now now survival is just the rules have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> changed man you're used to being a sigma </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_01> for me personally it's like again </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> nice to people like when i was a kid you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know my grandma would tell me like uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know like don't throw the rubbish in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the river not because it's bad for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pollution but because the river god is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going to get angry at you and i'll come </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back to bite you in the ass i'm like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] well i don't want to anger them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'll do that right right it might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be a little bit of an ass backwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> logic but you know as a kid like that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i think a healthy way to like look at it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a logical explanation get behind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything but it's generally just be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nice person yeah exactly just give back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's like because i feel like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i want to do that just myself i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need some um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of uh belief system for me to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> that yeah i just want to be a good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> person and do that right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not walking around as a 27 year old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going oh [ __ ] i better not anger this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> right but like at the back of my mind </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> there is a part where it's you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it builds like not only respect for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> surroundings around you but also just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> becoming a better person and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> you do what you have to believe in as </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> long as you're not hurting anyone else </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> believe what you have to believe in to </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> be a better person no because uh like my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> experience was you know obviously i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> raised up to be a buddhist and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything like that in my life yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean okay so i was so his here's a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more behind that backstory right so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a monk when i was like a kid yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> write it down write it down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh so as i said before i was among two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> times my life one time as a kid one time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as an adult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so the kid thing was basically doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i could like you know give good karma </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to my family because that's just how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that's just how i was great you know i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was too gently i thought you're on about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> reddit then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> finally enough karma was the concept </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that existed before ready </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [Applause] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um so so then i you know so then after </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i went to university grew up and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything and then i had this i i had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this you know uh spiritual experience uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> with with uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with with some people and then after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having that experience i kind of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know what the right word or the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right term to like coin this as but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just kind of realized that i didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] i believed right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right because because because i had this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> experience that i couldn't explain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> logically and i was like an engineer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> before so i'm just like everything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> scientifically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> scientific everything can be explained </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> logically had this experience and then i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of realized </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] what do i believe right and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> then and then at that point i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> realized everything that i believed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't because i actually believed it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was just because that was what i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> was raised to believe so yeah that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> that's one thing that's really difficult </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because i mean you have to be raised </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so it's kind of hard to get an unbiased </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> view of like a a religion or a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spirituality because you often have so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> much like baggage or kind of backstory </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> with that kind of thing so it's often </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> hard to look at it critically yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that that was like actually a huge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> turning point in my life that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically put my clean uh put me like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put me on a clean slate and i was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay i'm going to become a monk now and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was like that was like the actual </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> point when i'm like damn i'm going to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> become a monk not because my parents </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> told me to but because i need to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> figure this [ __ ] out yeah myself and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> figure out is this what i actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe or is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or is it something that was instilled to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me as a kid and so that was like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like the big decision maker to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i'm gonna start something new in my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life i'm going to like try to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> experience this lifestyle not because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not because anyone told me to but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i chose this i chose to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience this and whatever comes out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of this experience and what whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes out of these beliefs are my own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's why right now i you know so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> became a monk when you were [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alone by yourself with your thoughts for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four uh for four weeks or a month two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> months uh you have a you have a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time to think about [ __ ] right yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so in these in these like two months you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be i basically just like had time to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rewind my entire life and basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> break down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i believe the things i do and why i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the person i am yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like after becoming a monk and after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having that time to myself and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> studying you know i already knew about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know buddhist the british religion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and the buddhist beliefs and the and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i after that i knew what i believed out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of let's say what the traditional </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> religion teaches you yeah but i also had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my own beliefs and my own views on top </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> of that i think that's why it should be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> though i think that's you should take </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the cause of something you like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> structure that you and like a of a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spirit or whatever that you like and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> then just kind of add your own like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things that you really want to i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> japan is pretty notorious for that right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like yeah this is what we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> believe i don't know like the whole </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thing with that karma as well like i i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> almost in like a scientific way i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that if you know if if generally if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a good uh you know your positive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> impact on on people i think just it just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> comes back like yeah every reaction is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> do i believe there's this cosmic system </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> well like like god's keeping track </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> of someone's keeping dragging like oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're all naughty </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> i'd like to think so yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> i mean i could just go and do whatever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] i wanted yeah yeah yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's going to soup kitchen soup kitchen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but do i believe in like in general if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a good person that it will come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> back 100 yeah of course of course i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> truly believe that and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that i guess is the biggest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the biggest change before like before me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just being told what to believe and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually like deciding what i believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like once you decided it or once i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> decided it nothing can change my opinion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was like i'm so like set in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> beliefs because this is basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything that i've built from my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> entire experience of life and the only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing that can change this is new things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i experience because like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that and to me that's why i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guess </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing really phases me when it comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like arguing about my beliefs like my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> core beliefs because i'm i'm sorry i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> very set in it i don't i don't really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like i have anything controversial </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either i just kind of like yeah man just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> be good i mean like you say like you had </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> all this whole experience but i mean </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> ultimately we came to the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conclusion right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through our own means right i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what it's about i don't know i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> don't have a problem with how however </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you want to do your life just don't yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> don't be a negative impact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again you're free to believe whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] you believe just don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> hurt or inconvenience others yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like what pisses me off is when people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> try to put their beliefs on other people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> like yeah i have my core beliefs and i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> firmly believe them but i would never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> try to say hey this is my experience and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you should experience and believe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly the same thing as me because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> because to me to me you can't you can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> force that on someone you know you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you can raise a kid but i hope my kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goes to the exact same thing that i went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through when they realized [ __ ] i i need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like decide this [ __ ] for myself yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure there's a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching this i've never thought about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this deeply and you know for that that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not exactly a bad thing because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's something that i never had to think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about until i had some experience that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> forced me to like put myself put me in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> this position to think about it there's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> not there's no you can just go your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whole life and you've been you've been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> raised to believe a certain thing yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just never questioned it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what i always found quite like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> odds because i was always questioning </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> everything from like the get-go like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> anything they told me i was like no yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> i wanna i don't believe that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> you know which is strange because i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess that's why i'm so adverse to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff like that because ever since a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> young age i can remember i was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> annoying kid who was like no i don't i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't think that's right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know but that's just because i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> don't know how i i don't know where i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> got that mindset from but i've always </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> been like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i guess just some people just don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> really question things because they just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think oh if i just follow what everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> else believes and if i just follow the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> crowd then nothing can go wrong right so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're telling me i'm a sigma manager </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm saying that you're a leader </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're a leader in your own mind i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i just think some people just have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> never thought that deeply about it and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> that's fine well there's there's a lot </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> of people i've met in your life dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> there's a lot of people i've met who are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just happy yeah you know they're just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kids </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they've they've never like they've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> honestly i wish i was more like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> because my god like some people out here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> an existential crisis in the bathtub </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> meanwhile members of the church of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> flying spaghetti monster are like we're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] happy dude we got there we got a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] spaghetti monster on our side </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah for me for me i just think just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't try to put your beliefs on other </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people try to accept what anyone else </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believes even if it's like different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from yours you can believe what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you want you can like if people want to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> hear about your experiences and give you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that opportunity then go ahead tell your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experiences tell your beliefs but if if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they're not interested which a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people are not going to be interested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> then just give them that don't get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> offended don't don't get offended and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> don't get offended when they believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something different as well definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> understood that whole aspect of it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> getting really angry about other </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> well like being like how dear you don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> believe the same thing i believe that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> [ __ ] yeah i never got that either </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> it just seems very like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know it's like you're very like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> like self-concerned about like yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> weird feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and [ __ ] like that it's like she's gonna </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> be able to be comfortable somewhere yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i guess uh if you have a a dietary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> requirement yeah it's not a big deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like one meal of my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that we won't be able to eat pork like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm i think i think i'll be all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i'm not offended yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fine i'm good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> you know and even then it's like it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's uh it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> strange i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's deep it's deep so we're going a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of a lighter topic </SPEAKER_02>
