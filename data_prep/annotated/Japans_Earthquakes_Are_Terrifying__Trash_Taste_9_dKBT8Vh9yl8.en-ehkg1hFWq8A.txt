<SPEAKER_02> - I love Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, wow, the noise sounds nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I like the noise,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that weird?
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, it is weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Am I weird?
- It is very weird, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know I think you just
basically described music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in the most like, bare
bones monkey brain terms. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a bunch of noises put together. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do your parents like,
watch "Trash Taste"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they comment on every
little thing you do now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - My mum told me that
like, to stop putting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my hand near my face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and for the past like
five episodes I've tried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to avoid putting my hands
anywhere near my mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, my mum's like, "Oh
you wore shorts this episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The entire world knows you're
wearing shorts this episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the way, why are you wearing shorts?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How does she know that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Your legs don't show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't know either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but apparently on camera they showed it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when I sat on this side, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's like, "Enhance, enhance." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> My mum gave me shit whenever I was saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that British food is awful, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was neglected growing up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I was fed beans on toast often. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's true though, mum. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But anyway, welcome to this
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm your boy, Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot what I'm supposed to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm your boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm your boy because I couldn't figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the rest of the words. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's your boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm with the boy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the other boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And together we are "The Boys". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "The Boys". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was, had to be
one of the best intros. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just, you know, when you're
like auto-piloting the intro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you just realize halfway through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're auto-piloting the intro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you're like taking it over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, oh wait, I
should have just auto-piloted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like, being on a podcast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normally if I'm having a
normal conversation sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I know like, sometimes I
know when I start a sentence, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know how I'm gonna end the sentence </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but when you're on a podcast, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you always have to finish the sentence </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> even if you kind of
realize halfway through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're not making any sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I'm just like, okay,
I'm gonna have to say something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've been silent
for the past two minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't know how to
start it or how to end it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where this is going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you're right, you're right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So gentlemen, I thought, considering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I believe we all watched
"Japan Sinks" recently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a nice little coinkydink there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we all watched it separately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know you guys were watching it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We didn't make an
effort to all watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We all just like, oh,
we all just watched... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all just turned on Netflix </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and was like, "Oh, okay it's on, cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it came out recently
at the time of recording </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but so by the time you are
seeing this might not be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it was only like,
three or four days ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Something like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah for us but-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So to explain what "Japan Sinks" is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> since we're gonna be doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some kind of discussion around it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the new Masaaki Yuasa anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was released on Netflix </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's basically
about a giant earthquake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that happens in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and after that earthquake happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan starts sinking I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so for people living in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is anxiety the anime, essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, okay, first of all
before we get into talking it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the very first episode
they play the actual-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The sound they played. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The earthquake sound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (alarm blares) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This sound that you're hearing here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did we like, I don't
know if it's just me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I checked my phone immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I checked my phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, where's my phone?
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I turned that shit
down 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck, what if my neighbors hear? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And start freaking out
like, they're gonna think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's an actual earthquake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're elderly you know, below me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that made me shit myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That gave me so much anxiety. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The first episode of them portraying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the earthquake happening, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was really impressed
at how realistic it felt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I probably would have
reacted the exact same way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as all the characters, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know when you hear that
earthquake notification now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you just kind of block it out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh whatever, it's probably
a small earthquake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause once you've been through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> about 10 earthquakes in Japan-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which you will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, which you will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You just hear this notification </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like another day of the-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unfortunately though, every
time at least I have heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that notification, it's never been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the case of, whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's probably just a small earthquake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it always happens
at like five in the morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's the thing I wake up to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Imagine just having, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just having a nice
sleep wherever you are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like 4:30 in the morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then suddenly you hear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this absolutely anxiety-inducing alarm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you just hear the siren </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they don't say like, if it's strong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or if it's weak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just says brace yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just basically brace yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor imitates alarm) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hold on to your bike, it might be strong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I already hate waking
up to the sound of an alarm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but when it's an alarm where
it's like, oh I might die, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's the worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had, I was enjoying
the first episode so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because again, there was
this, you know, as you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a really realistic portrayal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the moment I hear that
sound, I just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't get anxiety often but-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I went like the Caveman SpongeBob meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they do it like three times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, stop doing this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Please use a like, parody
noise or something like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could you imagine though like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in that
first episode, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when that second big wave hits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you think something
like that is going to happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, in the, it's like a lot of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again, I should have done
research for this episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I swear there's been a
few scientific predictions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that are like, there's gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a mega quake within like 30 or 50 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there has to be, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I mean the fucking
planets, not planets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the countries all Pangaead away, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That doesn't just happen.
- [Garnt] Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There has to be stuff
that's moving constantly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So inevitably something
big is gonna happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Inevitably, whether it's in our lifetime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like, our children's lifetime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or fucking great, great, great
grandchildren's lifetime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna happen some way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a mega quake, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a mega quake, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's an interesting idea to explore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's probably gonna be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> some massive kind of
event that's gonna happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some time in the-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because is there like,
I don't know about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure Thailand has earthquakes, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not really.
- [Joey] Oh really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, Japan is
literally on the fault line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, the whole country's
on the fault line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, do you guys remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> your very first earthquake experience? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that was okay, we're from the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it is literally the
safest place on earth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about to say, you guys
don't get earthquakes, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, we're like the furthest away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from any fault line of like any country... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We were like, natural
disasters in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is like, non existent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like running out of tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like in England, England
is so fucking safe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to try really
hard to get yourself killed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in England by nature. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you really do have
to go out of your way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because Australia, we
don't have earthquakes at all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - But everything else will just kill you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but we have you know, bush fires </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like that and
of course our animals </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> are just out for blood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but you guys don't even have
dangerous animals, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, we don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I'm convinced
there's so many like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> famous British explorers because they must </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have been so fucking bored of the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Oh, it's another fucking squirrel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who'd have thought?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, "It's a bigger squirrel." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Talking to Americans and
Canadians who go camping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and they have to worry about
bears and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember going camping in England </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, oh
yeah, I guess we have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to worry about deers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, deers can be dangerous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like the biggest worry in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is how much alcohol do I bring? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like how much alcohol is
the right amount of alcohol? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much alcohol and
toilet paper do I bring? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's always the worry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's like, I've got
to carry two liters of water, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 liters of alcohol. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we gotta like try and
balance this out somehow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I remember
my very first earthquake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> experience, wasn't in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was actually in America during AX28. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Oh yeah.
- Oh, last year? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - AX 28, well not last year now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh no, it is last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Last year, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah last year's AX, so 2019 AX </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and I remember, I remember-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was your first one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that was my very first one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that was my first one as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, to explain, when
we were at AX last year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we went through a magnitude,
is it seven earthquake? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was six or seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it was far away, so it wasn't awful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was still, I mean, we were... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It still is the strongest
earthquake I've been in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> even after moving Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember I was on like
the 64th floor or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we all were. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was like, such
a humbling experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because at first I didn't
know what was going on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I remember standing
up and I felt a bit dizzy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, what the fuck's going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am I just like really fatigued, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> am I hung over, what's going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I go up to the window, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Just imagine you're going up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the window on the 64th
floor of a skyscraper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you look down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you see the fucking
building just shift like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was just like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I immediately, I've
never felt vertical so fast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I immediately just pinned
myself against the wall, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just being like, shit,
shit, this is an earthquake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised you had the
balls to go towards the window. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I didn't know
it was an earthquake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I just thought I was just
dizzy or drunk or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, the first one
'cause there was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three that weekend, was there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, there was two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was two in the, it was
in the same day, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, so the first one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was in the elevator
while it was happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the elevator was shaking
a lot more than I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it should have been shaking
and I'm pretty sure there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a Japanese woman in there who
was from one of the stands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she looked fucking
terrified and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we're nearly near the bottom,
I'm sure it will be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're like 10 floors, I'm sure we got this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but then the second one was I
was with you. That was so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wanna tell that story? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should tell it, you should. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay, so the second
earthquake that happened, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was only maybe a couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of hours after, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I think it was like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we just rushed
to your hotel room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was busy.
- That's right, that's right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was like, that night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was you, me,
Arcy and our friend, Navi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were just chilling in a hotel room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we were just talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what were we gonna do that night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I think it was the-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - We were going to go to a party. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We were gonna go to a party </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so we were just chilling
before the party started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know, the second
earthquake comes through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was, I think it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stronger than the first one, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something like that but
either way, very strongly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least magnitude six
from what I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was the 7.1 that earthquake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think that was
the seven, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and of course it was
an earthquake, I'm used to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously everybody else wasn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we quickly ran out and we were at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> very, very top of it, I
think it was like the 68th </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> or 69th floor or something
of that hotel and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and even amidst all the panic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor and my friend Navi,
they were eating a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was eating Chick-fil-A. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chick-fil-A like,
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Chick-fil-A nuggets and Connor
and Navi just kind of looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at each other and went,
well, if I'm gonna die, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> might as well finish off these nuggets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like everyone was panicking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember there was literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like stereotypical American family, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was one like, white
guy with three daughters, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like, "Get down to the floor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get down to the bottom floor daughters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna direct you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm there with like,
my nuggets walking past him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slowly like, I mean, it's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I got about, yeah, go on, go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I'm gonna die, at least I'm gonna die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with nugs in my hands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were like, rushing down the stairs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got like 20 floors down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, I'm not, you know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to do any
more physical exercise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, I think I've done enough, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did a move, which is
probably not a pro gamer move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, you know what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the shaking stopped like two minutes ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna get the elevator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There is 50 more floors and
I would rather die literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than get these stairs and
I went to the elevator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but the weird configuration of this hotel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you had to go back to the top. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, to go down again, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that means then
I was like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well the elevators are still working. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They should have been stopped,
they were still working. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I go back from the 50th
floor, which I just walked out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> from the 70th to the 50th,
I walked all the way down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, okay,
I'm going to go back up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the 70th floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I go to get the elevator
to go all the way down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're blocking it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, you can't go until it's safe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile our other friend
was just like, fuck it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna walk all the way down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He sprinted all the way down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's just waiting at the bottom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and he calls me, he's
like, "Are you guys alive?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I convinced them, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> listen guys, you guys can keep walking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm getting the elevator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they were like,
"Okay, well we'll come." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I came with you, I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, well, great, we're back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we ran down 20
floors for no reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so scary though 'cause
I remember I was a little, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't worried because you
know, the doors were closing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and opening on their own. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought that's okay,
I can deal with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What I didn't like, anticipate was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I looked out the building, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I could literally see
the building opposite us, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were going like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were like parallaxing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, oh that's not right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's not good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like buildings shouldn't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, 'cause I remember it was like, to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was a really humbling experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just at that moment, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my life is not in my own hands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, if this building collapses, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there is literally nothing I can do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you know when you feel
like something bad happens, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you feel like you have
some, some kind of control. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you might see a car
coming and you think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe I can jump out of the way of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was like, if the
building was just not designed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like logically I knew this building was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> designed to withstand earthquakes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but in my heart I was
like, okay at this moment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just putting my faith in the engineers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the builders that they've done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their job fucking correctly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause if they haven't, I'm dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's literally
nothing I can do about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I guess that was like
a first for me, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd never been in that kind
of situation where I had just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my life was in the hands of
like completely something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some other external-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, I've experienced </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of earthquakes in my life but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> being on the 69th, 70th floor
was different at first for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I've been on,
you know, apart, I've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in apartment buildings that
are like 10, 20 floors high </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was still scary because again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole thing is shaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to keep telling myself
it's good that it's shaking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's good that it's shaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my first I think
the scariest earthquake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> experience I had was it
was in Japan obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was up North
where my grandma lives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was where, you
know the giant earthquake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of 2011 hit essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that is, that plays like a hotspot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of massive earthquakes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, and I was there, I
was in some kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> DVD rental place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like a really old DVD rental place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> near there with my sister </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and suddenly I think it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a magnitude seven and a half. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Something like that, really, really big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so big in fact that all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the DVDs and books on
the shelves just flew out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And me and I had to
like grab my sister's hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just fucking get
the hell out of there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, but we couldn't go all the way out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the shop assistant was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Don't go out into the street." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because if a sheet
falls, then you're dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So we had to kind of stand
in the doorframe of the shop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and just kind of wait
for it to settle down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, that was definitely
a little scary because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it being on the, I thought
being on a building was scary, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> being on the ground
for like on the street, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in something that big is really scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause people are running out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I thought that's kind of dumb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the building's really safe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And running out you
don't know what could like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could fall on you.
- Exactly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if a traffic light or a,
you know a street light </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> falls on you, then, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's just, it's
that sense of control. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, they think you have, even though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> statistically you, you are
actually safer in the building. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the buildings are
designed at least the newer ones, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like, I mean
that a really big hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's mainly designed for
like 13 magnitude earthquake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're pretty steady. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speaking of sense of control though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the characters in "Japan Sinks" have none. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God, can we go back to that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, are we gonna spoil things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this gonna be the first spoiler
warning that we need to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have had a spoiler warning before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, well there'll be a
spoiler warning on screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're gonna spoil things, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's only 10 episodes, it's on Netflix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go watch it, it's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you don't care about being
spoiled, feel free to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate the main girl so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could not stand her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't mind her at first
but then when she started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get a bit wingy later on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can I, can I just to get my to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my opinions out of the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what'd you guys think
of the series overall? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad that we finally have some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good propaganda for YouTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like is I'm glad that we
need more YouTube propaganda. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> YouTube is a good guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - We need more YouTube, characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm so glad and I was like, wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> he's a YouTuber and he's not
an asshole, this is amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no 'cause, cause.
- This is amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so there's a character in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in "Japan Sinks" that is just a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's a YouTuber who's
a fucking superhuman </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause he can do everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's mad...
- Why did he get a tank from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) Where did the tank come from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> We're just not gonna explain
where he got a tank from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love how, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even that but
like the way that he enters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in that fan propelled. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And he's just like, yeah, this is mine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I bought it with my YouTube ad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, what
videos are you uploading? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really telling me, you're going to film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a video of Okinawa sinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that shit's gonna be monetized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Come on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> millions of people died,
monetized, fuck off, no way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can we just appreciate
that the character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is basically Felix, beautify
for he just have like a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like wide head Felix. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the time when Felix had
the really, really blonde hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, I remember when I met Felix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and when he came in on his. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the idealized
vision of PewDiePie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this is his final form, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is rock scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How we see PewDiePie.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if he changes his profile
picture to that character next </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was really from. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- For the longest time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's real, it's real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's real, it looks like real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, but I guess when I
saw that and as you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was probably one of the first times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that a YouTube has been kind of viewed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot more of a positive life.
- Any form of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a positive fashion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it really goes
to show me that I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> most like Yuasa's fan of YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it just, it just disappointed me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that in his final scene, he didn't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he didn't send them off by going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't forget to like and subscribe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, very unrealistic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was never a pull, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> there was not one sponsorship
in the whole thing, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> No raid shutters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna imagine, him flying away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him flying away like
freezing half to death </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> through the stratosphere and he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> splits marriage... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Very unrealistic YouTuber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, I'm gonna, what, out of 10, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was it, was it good or bad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What are you guys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I'm not going
to say that it was a 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna give it like a solid seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought it was like a four or five. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really, you didn't like it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I didn't like it
either, okay here's my... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't stop watching it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't, I had so have
so many things I hated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, here's the thing this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the way, this is like a
proper mixed bag for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - The way I would describe it is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a four out of 10 series
with some 10 out of 10 scenes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Okay, that's fair, that's fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was really weird 'cause some scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - First two episodes, absolute bangers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, exactly, and like some of the scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like the last episodes,
absolute bangers as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, like the sea in the
scenes where the YouTuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like some, some of the death scenes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh the scene where the
guy's running on the thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I don't know
why Yuasa has about making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emotional running scenes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the father's death
completely caught me off guard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, too.
- And that ruined me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, oh
cool, the one character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I liked is dead, in episode to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I looked for
thought like, wow, this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like after I finished
episode two, I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this could be a 10 out of 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they keep off with like
how good this is, and then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then we went into the cult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then we go to the cult, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, oh no, this is awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is actually awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the cult arc for
me was so bittersweet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because as a massive fan of Yuasa's stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, oh this is so Yuasa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a scene when. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck was the cult, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the fuck was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, you gotta meet the 360... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That wasn't the part where I loved most, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the part I loved most was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When the kid die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just watching a dead series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and the kid just gets fucking
destroyed by this rock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I literally just let
out, like a (laughs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He was just like, he was
so perfect comedic timing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was just, he turns around, he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like slap stick...what was that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - He was, 'cause I remember
I was like properly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was properly invested in the series. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My first few episodes
I'd properly invested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then like some things
just fell off like as, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as the, as the series went on, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like I remember their father dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was, he died in a
really horrific fucking way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then nobody really
just acknowledged that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They had like, they had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just cuts, doesn't it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they had like
one conversation, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're a forgetting dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they just like, next even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and like happy go lucky,
shopping in a supermarket. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, like if that was real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't be able to say anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like the next five days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let alone even think about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And yet, for some reason,
every other character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that dies off of that, they have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a full on emotional scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That just drags out
like crazy, right, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, something just felt
off about the character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what it was about
how they were written but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just didn't like
sometimes they acted the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I would imagine people
would act and sometimes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they just acted in a
completely random way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then the cult arc
happened and I was like, okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, now, now we've gone
from something feels off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to this is just stupid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So much needed explaining
about that, like whole thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where were they getting
all of this food from? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where they getting all of the weed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So much weed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just fields of weed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like in Japan, you just
gonna grow fields of weed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also they never explained
that fact that like the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the grounds where the
cult stood wasn't affected </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the tilting continental shift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's just so much,
there's so much stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when it got to the cult
arc where I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is too much, too many
holes for me to just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like, this is okay 'cause... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At the end of it all
I think the only reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was trying to figure out, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What was the point of this cult arc? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, like what were they trying to build </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I think the only thing
that came out of this cult arc </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was just the fact that they got that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Morse code talking professor
out of there, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But why was he there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> None of this was explained. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was just a slapstick comedy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, like I remember
watching the co-talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and you know that points
when you like really invested </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the show and then, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you go from being
invested to just laughing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at how bad it's become. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was the co-talk for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and I couldn't get invested
back into the show after that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it hurt too much
after the cult arc happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the fact that they just realize, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, if the old man is
addicted to morphine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm fine with that but
they didn't even build up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to that at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They could have showed
some kind of, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like they could've maybe
showed him taking some pills. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fact that the old man shot that kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of episode four, three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then they were like, and then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he was like oh,
I'm sorry and whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't mean to show you,
let me fix your game boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude you just fucking shot my kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with the intent to kill him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like, if he didn't
have his fucking DS, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like he would be dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So you're just gonna let him hang around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was actually the last PS Vita. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And to be fair though,
at the end of episode four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when the kid got shot, I was
like, oh, thank God, he's dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> My God, that kid was fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, did you watch "The Dubbed"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I watch both. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I watch some. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lik I literally, I
was like I watched dub, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something fell off I watched the sub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and full of first time on my fucking life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could not stand like
the voice siting in the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it was really, like I get it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they're supposed to
be like native and both </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I feel like
they should've got people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are native and both, it's doable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because when they whenever he said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's go, it's just like that's not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it sounds really off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or they could have even have just gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> some with a similar voice
type who speaks english, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is it about, you also did this in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Devilman Crybaby" as
well, where Rio's English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was just so awkward.
- Stop doing this shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stop doing this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And yet somehow they
can't get, I made this joke </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> on Twitter, but I think it was the second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to last episode when they were in Russia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they got those like three nurses </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who could speak perfect
Russian and yet they can't get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a single English speaking voice actor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Russian was flawless. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How is it so hard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause in the dub, how do they deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the bilingual ness? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They, they didn't really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the boy just always spoke
English, so that's why... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did they mentioned it at
all that he could speak both? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean like they kind of did, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanted them to just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I wanna meet my (in foreign language). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it like a huge plot point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause then later on when they
all like the barrage comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the Japanese only. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, the Japanese KKK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, the whole you know,
the, the dynamics of that boat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just the engineering
standards were all horrific. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How did that boat which
couldn't handle waves, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like waves could just come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally burst into
flames, for no reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just got, yeah, it was engineering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The more we discussing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I'm regretting giving it a seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The emotions it gave me we're a 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, like let's, let's not
forget that they also added </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a woman who could speak to the dead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was just never explained. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was up with that,
what was up with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why did they show us the sex scene? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like there was several
points in the cult arc. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did they show her sex scene? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't need to see that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was two points
I bust out laughing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One, one was the kid dying
and the second one was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like the fucking Mexican standoff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where she's just brings a samurai sword. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like is this "Kill Bill", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this a "Kill Bill" scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was such a Quentin
Tarantino scene where it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a guy with a bag
full of gold bars and a gun, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and she just rocks off
with a samurai sword </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and the guides walks
up the stairs is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm just like, what am I watching, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought I was watching
like a disaster movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's turned into "Kill Bill". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't stop taking sick, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't stop laughing at that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did you guys think
of the last episode? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a really...
- I really fucking hated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the last episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the last, the last episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of dragged out
for a little bit too long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The last episode was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> remember when the Olympics
was meant to happen right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> This is, this is awkward. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't forget the
Paralympics just got too, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just gotta make sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure it would have hit harder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because the Olympics would
be happening right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If this was released
right now, I'd be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, that's, that's a pro
game of move there Yuasa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I, I see, I see you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but now, but now that the
Olympics isn't happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just one giant ad for the Olympics. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't wanna say that
but like, it definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like felt little, little ad like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Look how amazing the
Olympics are and it's like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we we know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We know how good the Olympics are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or how good it should have been. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I didn't like maybe I, it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't paying attention to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I saw a lot of
people commenting saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that the show is like
very political at times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was thinking like, I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it was that political people
trying to put that on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I didn't get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Did you get that vibe? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, not really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe they we're talking
about the rap scene? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I liked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I liked the rap scene.
- I like the rap scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a, this doesn't,
this is a really random scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm all for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a good scene,
it was random though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I don't know what this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we can keep doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's also Yuasa move where, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was just like, okay, I
really want to tell people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much I love Japan,
but how much Japan sucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but not make a super political. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Freestyle rap, baby let's do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So originally was the rap in Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and the Japanese stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like, I didn't notice because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at that point I was just
purely watching the English dub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was all in English
and it was really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really done well so I
didn't know if it was a case </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where they just like had that
one specific scene in English, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but not like I really enjoyed that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really enjoyed the last two episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not the last two episodes,
like episode nine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the one before that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, those are two
really strong episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they had like, like I said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't invested in the
characters at that point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there were some scenes that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I felt something, even
though I had zero investment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the story and the characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but just because of like the
sheer brilliance of some, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some of the ways these scenes
were directed, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man, I'm, I'm feeling something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> even though I really
shouldn't be right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did the mom have to die?
- Like I was thinking, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, did she have to
enter life here for this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause they kind of went
like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They probably went
further, but there was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one minute on the boat,
oop, it's out of fuel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was implied
though that, because her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like device hadn't run out of battery, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that she was officially going to die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But didn't shift then,
like a solar panel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, because like that
thing hadn't become busted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So the implication was that
she was going to die anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I didn't pick that
up 'cause I thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is she just killing herself
for like the (murmurs) here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, she's drowning of like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean at this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's like aI have to feel in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one death per episode quota. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, at this point it was just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just killing characters off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what it felt like.
It felt like they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> every character was going to die now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were just having to sit through it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it didn't feel like it was needed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the one character
that should have died </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a million years ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is the cripple doctor, survived. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How? Somehow, I don't know how. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, like, yeah that was
my biggest problem with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because it wasn't the fact
that people were dying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was the fact that you just knew </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that we're gonna die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it was just, okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the scene where
this person's gonna die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, there's no tension or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just, okay, well
they're going to die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're dead and
everyone's moving on now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's sad and you should be sad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and Japan sinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But YouTuber good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, YouTuber good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's really weird though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I was having this conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with Garnt earlier though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think we can, we can end
the spoiler discussion now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No more spoilers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Unless, unless there's anything else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys want to discuss
about the series specifically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why pro games did he become (murmurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And totally unrealistic, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's not a little shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean she kind of was there
actually, maybe he was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe he was a league player that dies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why are you (laughs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Why are you, sorry, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but so yeah, it
was, it was really weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because even though it was
like, I would give like a four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or five hours at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still ended having like good
time watching your Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't look away, like it was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't why we're it's, I find it so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> easy to watch anime on Netflix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as opposed to watching anime
on like any other platform. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been saying this since early 2018 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever since "Devilman Crybaby" and other, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it as around the time when
Netflix had just started </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to get their hands on a
lot of anime, IPS that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> with at least with stuff
that comes out on Netflix, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know Castlevania did it really well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Castlevania was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I think the reason
why Netflix can kill it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so hard with animates
because they know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> most enemy view is including
probably all three of us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'd like to watch shows
just in one big chunk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God Castlevania so fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Castlevania is
fucking amazing, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think what it is is that because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever they really
something new, they just go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We know you can't wait an entire week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we're just gonna give you
the whole thing all in one go." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's perfect because
Netflix is designed to binged. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes to be binged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it also feels like
there's no seasonal pressure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as well if there's just
one big show that drops, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go and watch it right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not, it's not under
any kind of like scheduling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's not sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause I've had plenty of shows where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna binge them and I wait
like they're on Crunchy Roll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or Funimation or whatever platform. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, okay, I'm
going to wait for this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for this to be over and
then I'm gonna binge it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it's over, and
then I don't binge it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just don't watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because by the time
it ends there's another whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new batch that you're interested in, now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you never have time to go back to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and then I've watched so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like mediocre anime on Netflix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have no idea why, but like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can download it,
it's super easy, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember watching, I think
"B: The Beginning" as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like severely disappointed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in how that turned out but I watched it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it all in one night and I still, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are still many shows
on every other platform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just still have not watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, oh
my plan to watch this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah I don't know
what it is about watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shows on Netflix, it's just makes it so... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just painless, like
it's so easy to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like make it way too easy for you to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoy it the way you wanna enjoy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, they just know how
the viewing habits of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people of our demographic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the app works so well on your phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's easy to just chuck that shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the Chrome cast, or download
in the phone, like, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> saves where you want, it's just so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not sponsored by Netflix
but just letting you now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But if they wanna hit us up.
- But if they wanna hit us up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, how'd you feel about
the skip opening button though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love the skip opening button. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I like the option. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like, I like having the option. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but like, but I
don't like how the default </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that they skip it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's default though, it's default. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't like how the
default is skipping because... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait they don't skip it straight away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first time you watch
it, you don't have the option. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, you do have the option to skip it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but plays it for you, it's masculine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but every time after that then... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They just assume that
you're going to skip it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Which sucks because when I was watching, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Beastars" on Netflix, I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to skip this comedy... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Beastars" you watch, because yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't have to do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] So I had to keep going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to touch it Garnt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's there in case you
don't want it. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like, touch me, touch me, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speaking of Masaaki Yuasa though like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much Yuasa stuff have
you guys watched in the past? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've watched most of this
stuff except for probably Kyber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Devilman" is that his? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's the one.
- Yeah, "Devilman" is his. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What else has he done? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, "Eizouken" as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's it's fun, it's funny
that's how I still haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watched "Eizouken" even though I've, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've watched "Japan Sinks" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which I feel like is gonna be worse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and "Eizouken" and "Eizouken"
is been out for a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that "Eizouken" the
"Ping Pong The Animation"? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh, I love
"Ping Pong The Animation". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's done "Kyber". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Mindgame". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Mindgame", he's done
"Kick-heart" as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which was the kick start to one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's done a lot of indie films as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, "Your Wave". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I haven't seen, I
haven't seen "Ride Your Wave". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I still haven't seen that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really wanna watch that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's about the, it's like a
girlfriend, boyfriend dies, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they both love the ocean and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boyfriend reincarnates as a wave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the only way
to describe it, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the easiest way to describe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sounds like a Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Boyfriend resurrects as
a water beast essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I think my favorite
Yuasa work will like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is at the moment
"Ping-Pong" the animation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's, it hit me on like
a really fucking deep level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It hit different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really want to stop saying that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like every time we're on is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, this show just hits the different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It do be hitting different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess 'cause it sounds
like relatable in some way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you've probably been good
at something without trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you've also probably not
been good at something... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We had a lot of comments last week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was, yeah Connor's
chest stories, basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ping Pong The Animation" just with chess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the way you just portrayed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because to me it's not a
sports anime, you know, it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me "Ping Pong The
Animation" is a life anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that happens to follow characters around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one single one, single sports. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's, it's such a good
metaphor for life in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> When it, when it comes to
the discussion of talent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> versus hard work and just basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> how crushingly depressing
life can be sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Life isn't fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, life, life is not fair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And no one's entitled to
anything, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's the whole
reason why I fucking loved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "March Comes in Like a Lion" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that's essentially the exact scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Haven't seen that yet,
I really wanna see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not a show that show you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'll get into (in foreign
language) after watching it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it much like "Ping
Pong The Animation", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a story about how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter how
good you are at something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're still gonna be depressed as fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the reason I've
been putting it off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I don't want to be depressed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It gets pretty upsetting.
- I know it does, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it does everyone who's watched it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like, yeah I loved
it, I was just ruined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you think "Japan
Sinks" is his worst work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you've seen so far then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of like the three I've
seen, yeah, it's probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I haven't seen everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Masaaki Yuasa has to offer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen a lot, but
I I'd probably say it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, it's probably his weakness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think definitely for
me it was weakest and... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally just remove the cult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- That's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So many problems will
be solved if he just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> had removed the cult episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I wanna say not
every problem would be solved </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but a lot of it, it would
be like a lot better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause they still had problems with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how the characters were written. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And how the story played out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but removing, removing the middle arch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> would have made it like an
easy seven to eight or 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there were still, like I said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there was still some amazing scenes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yes, there was some
plenty of amazing scenes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he was like (murmurs)
if I was actually invested, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I would think that the show had some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty amazing moments in it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I feel like
just it got bogged down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by stories so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whereas his other works, I feel it was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was a like a nice combination between </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this Yuasa style of
directing because he has a, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know some of his scenes the way, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the way he portrays and directs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially like the emotional scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they just, they can hit really hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't know what he does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're so close to saying that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're so close to saying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I said it in my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I'll fall for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It like hits the source for a different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I agree I
definitely think that Yuasa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> regardless of how strange it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that the way that he portrays you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> character designs and
just movement in general. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] And just animation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I'm one of those enemy viewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who does not care who the director is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or any of that stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just watch the show and
that's how I watch an anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I do that with everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I mean, I could tell
it was from the same guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who did "Devilman" within like 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just tell, that's how. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because Yuasa's films and series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have this really weird thing where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you look at a character design </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you think, oh wow.
- They're ugly as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That looks pretty cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the next scene, it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's written by like
the intern, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It changes, I think there
was like a few frames in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was like the
characters just talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like, bro, like pain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can take a screenshot of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just be... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will say out of like all his works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like "Japan
Sinks" was his most like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> normal looking work in
terms of visual style. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Big unquotes for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no you know you like
you compare "Ping-Pong" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the animation and then you
go to "Devilman Crybaby" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then "Japan Sinks". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would, I would say
he's progressively gotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of his big series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - More, more like normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Ping Pong" is one ugly looking show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but in great way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In a great way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like he had a very unique art style </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and some of the scenes were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they had a very unique
animation style and some, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I would still say sometimes it works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes it doesn't work so well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was definitely a very Yuasa style. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least you know it's him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many fucking of
those generic (murmurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you like, are these all animated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> by the same fucking people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They all look the same, I can't tell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You ask any (murmurs)
and they'll probably know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like this was directed by... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I just, I see an ECI protagonists now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's literally a
carbon copy of Kirito. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember doing like a copy and paste of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> seven different like ECI, protagonists </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and they all look exactly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was all that generic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably because they roll A1. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the exact same art style, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the exact same animation all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, it's such a breath </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of fresh air to even
get anything different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no definitely.
- That's what I love about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Masaaki Yuasa, because he's just so weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he's just instantly
recognizable, especially, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you know "Japan Sinks", as you were saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even though it looks the most normal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably to the general
anime viewing audience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they will look at those
characters and be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh that looks fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then you go back to
Masaaki Yuasa's catalog. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You watch something like "Kyber"? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like that thing that
doesn't even look like anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That thing looks like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some kind of like Disney demo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was locked away in
the Disney vault for a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But let me say this
about "Jojo" as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the art styles are weird, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't get into that, like you'll know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll appreciate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's an acquired taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Once you, once you acquire that taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is never going back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Taste acquired.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I like "Jojo" now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna say I completely
forgot about the one show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're also getting
one show when we're talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about Masaaki Yuasa, "Tatami Galaxy". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Tatami Galaxy" was fucking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you watched, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's "Monogatari" but on crack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is "Monogatari"... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like this, this will test
your reading ability to the max. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The monologue is so fast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that Japanese people
struggle to keep up with it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they are like hold on, hold on, hold on, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hold on, pause, pause, pause. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck did he just say, go back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it's the, I've
never heard of monologue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just talking scenes that
go by so goddamn quickly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is, it is "Monogatari"
on crack essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's basically like if
you take "Monogatari" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but try to speed run
the dialogue and that's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's an episode of "Tatami Galaxy" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's on top of the fucking crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Masaaki Yuasa visual, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's just like, I don't know if this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like a dream scape
or if it's just weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but it's great, it's fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - One thing I wanted to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one thing that we kind of
like glossed over in terms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of "Japan Sinks", I wanna talk
about though, is the music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought the music was fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was phenomenal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think that's definitely
some of it made some it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was what helped make
some of the scenes for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That main track, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it played most
of the first episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when the main character was running back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a family that kind of
slow piano, I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd love that track because
it's really positive sounding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and get putting it next </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to the absolutely devastating visuals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just become such a creepy song, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, oh everything
and everyone is dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like, I think like what sold me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the first two episodes
was just seeing some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of these like horrific
scenes, horrific landscapes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and hearing this beautiful piano track </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that just gave this like
juxtaposition that just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was really unnerving but
beautiful at the same time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I, the way I described
it to Sydney was it felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I was watching some, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something that was horrifically beautiful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I, that was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was like a beautiful destruction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and I don't know who the composer was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It sounded very similar to
"Devilman Crybaby" soundtrack </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in some scenes as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if it's the same composer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I probably should have done my research </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before talking about "Japan
Sinks" on this podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I'm sure, it
was done by Science SARU. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who did you know, "Devilman Crybaby". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I assume it's the same
guy, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure someone in the comments
can tell us about that but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I love that piano track because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, I'm not gonna
lie the first time I heard it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It kind of reminded me of
the "Minecraft" soundtrack, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a little bit.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like if this play
during "Minecraft", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I would not be phased in any way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Can someone in the subreddit
take that piece of music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and put it over "Minecraft", let's play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and see if you can spot it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, God, this
was such horrific beauty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The juxtaposition was
amazing, Garnt "Minecraft". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - He says like "Minecraft" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's what I, I was like "Minecraft" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if I'm just dumb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I cannot remember any of the music. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really can't? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I will sing them when sitting there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we all did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you watch in one sitting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I don't remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We just have a bigger brain.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Clearly, I think I was preoccupied. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How do they get a tank? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, a question to you then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what kind of OSTs do you remember, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what sticks out for you then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Anything where like the music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like a huge selling point, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I mean, I don't want to be that guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like the one that sticks
out immediately is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you remember "Cowboy Bebop",
like the super jazzy thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like but I wouldn't
listen to jazz on its own. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like something like this
just sounds like a mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I've come to understand
that when it comes to music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you're a little bit brain dead, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you don't, you
don't really listen to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know, Garnt and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can have a conversation of,
oh, this band is awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or this artist is awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And yet I remember I asked Connor once. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, well, who's
your favorite band? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was just like I don't
really have one, I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like, I like Daft Punk you know why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's just noise, most of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I, I hate like I
never listen to lyrics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I love like listen to,
like, I think I listened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to like pumped up kicks
like a thousand times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So someone was like, it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about school shooting and
I actually listened to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They are like, oh yeah yes it is, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what's wrong with me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are monkey brain? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a monkey brain coming back, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have like half monkey
brain, half giant brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on like what a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you have a single composer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kevin Penkin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was about to say
aside from Kevin Penkin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause he's our fucking mate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, he's, he's
not composing our minds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He's just some better... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know what he composed
of the "Made in Abyss"? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he did... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And all of them "Tower of God"? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Shield Hero". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shield hero is pretty,
the boys is not completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> branded, that's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess, because I focus more on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> voice acting than anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's like taking up all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> noise input I can take, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I don't really give
a shit about the music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> To me, the music is just like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does the music not enhance
your viewing experience? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The music to me is so fucking important. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, if, if there's a
series with a good soundtrack </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm still gonna remember that soundtrack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I absolutely agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - To this day, like I will
never forget "Guilty Crown" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> despite how shit "Guilty
Crown" turned into. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sawano fucking killed
it with that sound. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is a fucking thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There some songs that
like will invoke an emotion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in me from like, if they've
been a soundtrack bus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As far as it goes, it's like no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever listened
to a Sawano soundtrack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and just gotten pumped up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Not at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like maybe at the gym </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'll put anime
soundtrack to get hyped to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe, you know, a song, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a song will come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But say for example, "Promare". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You fucking love that movie, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a great movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you remember the soundtrack? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - How? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What how, how is it that
the most in your face composer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that has ever existed
in anime, Connor's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "No.", no impression. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you were like, if you
were like, if you were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> describe a song to me
from, from happy life... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no fucking idea, no clue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you watch "Promare",
you watch "Attack on Titan" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what other, what other sound. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, "Attack on
Titan" the one that goes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember wanting from "Attack on Titan", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Kill to Kill", you
remember "Kill to Kill"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, "Kill to Kill". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's all, Sawano, that's all, Sawano. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I remember like individual songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you ask me to like describe them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or what I like about them, I'd be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like crayon colors to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I don't know, for all
I care you could put like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking Kevin MaCleod
music, whatever he's called. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Kevin MaCleod? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - MaCleod, that's what is called. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you put Kevin MaCleod background. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The creative...composer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You can put those fucking
songs, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, some of the
best shows I've listened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have sounded like some
Kevin MaCleod music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no there's like,
there's definitely been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some generic sounding soundtracks that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they're normally like
for generic shows, right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't know a soundtrack
can easily sell me a series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish I could give
a fuck, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's with music as well, I love Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The, the noise sounds nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I like the noise,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that weird?
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, it is weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Am I weird?
- It is very weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know I think you just
basically described music in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in the most like I think bare
bones monkey brains terms. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a bunch of noises put together. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Think I actually am like
a caveman when it comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to music, I'm like, ooh, beeps
and boops are very pleasing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Music goes, boop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah music goes boop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean that's a huge
reason why when it comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to soundtracks that's a huge
reason why I love anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> made by Key Studios, right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because Maeda Jun is a
fucking amazing composer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he's like just subtle piano tracks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> or any of the openings
and everything's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it builds on the scene so fucking nicely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it adds like a whole, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Totally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least to me, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I'm the only one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I could just listen to say any track </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from "Clannad" or "Air"
or "Little busters". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, and it could be a specific song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that can evoke a specific scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I could easily shed a tear
just from listening to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like his work is basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you wanna hit the emotional G-spot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you, you hear it and
you're like, oh, oh shit no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How does a single piano put
this much emotion behind it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have no fucking idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like the Mike Wazowski meme where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's just standing there, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Just listening to this conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He goes...I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are the first
person to ever describe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Daft Punk as noise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like.
- I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pleasant noise is the way I like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pleasant, you mean music? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Interstellar Three",
whatever it's called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it, Interstellar? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "5555" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "5555" that's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I love that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's great I love that.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Has a track never evoked
emotions from you though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you never listened too... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like actual, actual emotion? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, what's your
favorite Daft Punk track? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to run. I really
like "Face to Face". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, why is it your favorite track? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it because it evokes an emotion or? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can see in his face
he's never thought about this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this deeply before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this, my favorite song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I like all the sampling in it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it gets like crazy how
creative they were sampling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, so you're looking at them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So is there like a think
about the one Daft Punk song, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't have to be Daft Punk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just think about the
one song that has evoked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like any kind of emotion in you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What song would that be and
what emotion would that be? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't think there is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think there was a song
that evoked emotions in me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What does it mean, what does
that mean about me as a person? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm talking to a
fucking brick wall here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like trying to explain to, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Peppa the android, what music is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like, it says not compute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I'm alien right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is emotion? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I guess like for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe that's why like I focus
or I feel like I'm really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> strong in being able to
really break down voice acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and shares and really like get into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think that's cause I'm
completely fucking ignoring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What like brings emotions to you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The story and the
characters and performances. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, but does not,
but does voice acting not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> give you emotion?
- Yeah, the voice acting does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so how come music can't do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I guess I
can't like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't connect, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you know a medium
where you can feel emotion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just by a story and characters? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Books. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Books, I wish we was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna read the book. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I want someone to read it for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> The music for me is something
that like ties it together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's something that if
it's done well, I don't notice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and if it's done badly, I will notice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, no I agree with that.
- Which is the way I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that most people view like voice acting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no I agree with how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if music is done well,
if it's done so well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then sometimes you can't notice it but, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but then there's a level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I don't, I don't look out for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I don't seek that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no when I say, when I say good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like just like satisfactory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like satisfactory music
you don't notice it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you will definitely hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when a soundtrack is really funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is attracted
that using amazing ways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll notice that track and I'll like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have like a little... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but does that
not give you emotion or? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like you've definitely heard the Sawano? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I'm like,
yeah, I get a little hype, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Unlike, I'm excited from this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I, (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go protagonist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever watched like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> My favorite soundtrack of all time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is probably (murmurs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember enjoying that show a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember the music was
sad. I don't know about... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, this hurts me so a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The music was sad, yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The music was sad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like saying peppers are hot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The way I see it like when you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you talk about music to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you need to filter it through like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the YouTube audio, library tags </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like genre and mood, that's the only thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand about music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tell me the genre of music
and the mood it wants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, you watched (murmurs)? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, it had the whole Icelandic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like kind of post rock drums... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The, the motorbike scene where they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like the motor and
it's nothing but just no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no dialogue, it's just
them riding on a motorbike </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with beautiful visual and beautiful music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you remember that scene?
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember them being terrorists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, this is I'm feeling
so fucking frustrated now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just remember them
being like terrorists, right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was fun anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You remember them being terrorists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember them blowing up shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like saying at "Attack on Titan", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember the big Titans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's time, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah... dude I remember
enjoying that show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like when I finished it's gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, then let's steer
away, let's go down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go down to the most
like rudimentary level here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's let's go to, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What is your favorite anime opening? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I really liked the (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hype as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, but what makes it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, like what emotions do
you feel when listening to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is it excitement? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so how come you can
put emotion into that song but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, what makes, what
makes that memorable? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what makes that memorable? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the opening part is pretty hype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just a meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love it though, it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What else do I like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, the "Jojo", the "Jojo"
opening is hype as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (murmurs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no, no Jawani Steve </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why does that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why do you, why do
you like Jawani Steve? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - When did that stand up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - As I said, I think I tweeted it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, it's the "Bohemian Rhapsody". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What does that mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What does that mean?
- What does that mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause there's so much going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a five minute
song and it's just like so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> many things happening and I'm
like, wow, this is amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know if it's the
coffee or this conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm actually getting a headache. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm getting like a brain
aneurism right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I imagine the viewers at home were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what is wrong with this kid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like dying inside
just listening to this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How have I never had this
conversation with you before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess cause every
time you bring a music, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I just go like, yeah okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If we went to school together you'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one kid who would
wear a cocoa bean T-shirt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not knowing who Navon was,
you know what I mean. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And be like be like,
yeah, I like his face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I like that team spirit song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, team spirit, what is, it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Looks like team spirit... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So, okay what else do you value </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> anything else in the anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> aside from like stories
and characters then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean the visuals are
really important, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I feel that it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not so much that I
don't appreciate music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's again, like I said,
like, if it's done well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it blends in and I don't really
pay much attention to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, but you remember the
"Cowboy Bebop" sound track? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, why do you remember that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember it went like really
well with all the carrier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what, all the movements </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in that show like blended so well music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember it like
made them both stand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out more than anything at the
time when I was watching it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the carrier... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So your argument is that because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the feeling of the soundtrack is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is not an argument.
- Is so completely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just saying, like I'm not
trying to argue or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying that's
what I remember is cause... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no because, because you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because your logic, from
what I'm understanding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your logic is that I don't
think about this too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you're logic
is that "Cowboy Bepop" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> soundtrack you remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the feeling and vibe you got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from the musical so different
to the visuals, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, because I can't put the visuals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without the music there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so how come you
don't remember (murmurs)? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it does the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember like, maybe like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two scenes from (murmurs), literally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And do they involve any music? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I remember seeing
the building explode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was about to say, I was about to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The only scene you remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I remember someone getting sniped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember being sad by the snipped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was expecting to say
that you were very impressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with the nose... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who this man's aim in a helicopter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> very impressed you know,
must have some very... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, like, when I
watch a show that was good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but not like, life-changing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it kind of just goes in the back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my head and I remember like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Apparently if you
watch life-changing shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't remember the music anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember "Bokurano" theme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember a book around a theme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone knows that song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's who I remember
from "Bokurano" the music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See you don't remember the soundtrack? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, not at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember the soundtrack
being pretty good to "Bokurano". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No clue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually, I don't remember that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I just remember the opening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man doesn't remember
one single soundtrack, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> how dare? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because after the last episode or sorry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a couple of episodes back, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I went and re watched a couple
of episodes of "Bokurano" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because I haven't
seen it in such a long time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and the sound, I remember the soundtrack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, wow, this soundtrack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is really fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like for some reason
I cannot, for the life of me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember character names
after the end of the show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm just like, it's the blue head one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he does something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even monkey bar this is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I genuinely like, it's so weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'll remember so many
things vividly in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but when it comes to entertainment
and stuff that I consume </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, already goes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I guess that's
good because you probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just infinite rematch ability, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I can rematch shows
on that, getting driven out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I forget because
I forget half the shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what are they re
watched something recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I remember being like very impressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I forgot all, I
re watched "Breaking Bad" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, I forgot
how all of this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Through seasons one through
five, I don't remember anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's a long
show so that makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that weird I'm sure
that people in the comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who are the same but like
don't remember any characters, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't remember the soundtracks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've I've met, I've met someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are you watching... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I love the experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like leave me alone.
I get what I get out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you enjoy the experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but you don't remember after it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you remember everything
that you consumed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've legitimately never
had this conversation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like this, this compensation
is a first to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never, I've never had to explain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to someone why music is like a good thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - In terms of entertainment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not arguing that
it's not a good thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just don't remember it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I am convinced
right that people lie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like when you have
discussions with them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like, yeah you
remember the soundtrack? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just convinced that, just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, it was totally great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean like the sound... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Definitely people would
do that all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but like to say this
not a single soundtrack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from like some of your favorite
series that you remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't remember anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you hear it, you'll... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I hear it I will recognize, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll be able to pull out that memory from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the dusty old cabinet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, but then you'll pull it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and what you'll pull out a
file that's just as good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like nice.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like, okay, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I can remember voice
performances quite well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but that's because I an active interest in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> really learning those
and really studying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what do you sell makes
a good voice performance then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and is it something that
has to be in English </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or does it how can you recognize it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like Japanese as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Japanese too but I think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just from watching a
lot of Japanese media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's something that you can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because the way you deliver
a line, anything, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The way I vision, the align, there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you deliver a singular line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like a visualization to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you imagine the pacing
and the pitch like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head with a good line, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a set way it
should be delivered, right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's the way the
director wants it to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I imagined like
someone like Quentin Tarantino </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> has the same idea where it's
like the line is delivered </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the way I see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so it's like, I just visualize </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my head the way it should go, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like if you should raise your voice, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how you should raise your pitch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then what when you
should take it down, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you should slow it
down, when you start a pause </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's really
interesting seeing how like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the actors will
deliver a certain line </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and where they'll choose a...pauses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or how those choose to slow it down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's really interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I'm just saying like you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't done as much voicing as you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I definitely take a keen
eye to voice acting as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because I also wanna get better at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I totally get what you
mean with the cult casting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a way I wish that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I figured out a way
where I could definitively </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> show people what I mean in
my head about that because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you put the line on like
an axis of Y on the like X, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, would, it would
go like that, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It'd be like, you need to pause here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You need to take a break
here, slow down this word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this words in italics. So
please put emphasis on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but not too much emphasis, let it be bold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like really loads of
nuances that we don't see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> as the audience that
I'm trying to in my head </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when I'm listening to something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm imagining how they saw the script. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm trying to think back
to what they were thinking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like, depending on
what medium we're in now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like and also ever since I
got way too into voice acting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I see so much ADL and it puts
me the fuck off in films. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you can hear one line
that's delivered in the room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and one line, whether you did it in post, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so grating, when you
hear just like so many sitcoms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> do this where they like
have the line done in post. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't realize how many
movies have done in post as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I know they've done so well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've definitely
noticed it recently when. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so grating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like when you notice it once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't stop noticing it, I noticed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's the problem I have with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> watching shows that are
dubbed in languages like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, Italian or whatever or Dutch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normally they're, they'd
have to dub so many shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're just pumping this out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's not really much
given to the sound of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it sounds like everyone's in a studio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every single TV show they're
in no matter where they go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I hear this Italian
or this Dutch guy speak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it always sounds like they're in a studio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> when they're outside,
it's like, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I hate that so much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's the reason
why when people are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, I watch I had a
German friend who watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Game of Thrones" in Dutch
or a German, sorry, dubbed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, why? It sounds
like everyone's in a studio, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> they want a battlefield. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's exactly, it's
exactly the same as Ty dubs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was talking about sharing Ty dubs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they just don't know audio mixing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's sort of like making it sound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they're in the environment they're in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's always in the same studio </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and instead of like mixing in the voices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they just like quiet every other voice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and every other sound, every other sound. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the voices are just
like 10 times louder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than every sound effect
every time someone talks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the sound
effects get louder again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the worst
kind of audio mixing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's lazy as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I mean, now I'm not sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they did it back then,
but now commonly the Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> studios will just give basically a track </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is the voice is taken out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they are like, "Here's everything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> we've done it all for
you just add the voices." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Normally quite easy, but
yeah in terms of dubbing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or voice performances and anime cartoons, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a whole different like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like, I feel like
one unsung hero in terms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like voice acting and
dubbing is the voice director </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel like obviously,
you know, actors get a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the credits but I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They also got all the shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - They also got all the shit though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like the voice director
has so much control </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over how good this voice
performance is gonna be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause I've, I've definitely
worked with voice actors </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and actresses in my own, a bridge series </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they've they've
done a great fucking job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I see them voice
in like other projects and. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It's terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's bad, it hurts me
'cause I know the potential </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that these voice actors
have and I know that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably just bad voice
direction, you know and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of people don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about that or don't know
that because they just think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, it's a voice actor,
you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's a real shame. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's difficult because
unless you've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> in an environment where
you've worked with a director </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or had someone directing you in any way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really hard to understand
the role of a director. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't quite get it until
I'd worked in that space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's kind of the person who like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause when you're doing it
for yourself and you're acting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you're in your own head
you're your worst enemy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause you're like, fuck I
should've done it this way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause when I recorded for one
of my own videos, 20 takes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I record for someone else with a director, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one or two takes because
they tell me what they want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they help me get there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of people like
there's 10% of voice actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who can deliver lines
amazingly without a director. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then there's like
50% who need a director </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's like 30, 40% let's be honest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're never gonna get any where with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's hard to say that but
it's one of those things where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you do need like a good
ear somewhat skill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a skill, absolutely.
- It's definitely a skill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I, I personally
think I'm a much better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> voice director than I am a voice actor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though I've done both. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I tried to like insert
my own voice as little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as possible whenever I'm doing kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of any kind of voice work
that I've done before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I really enjoyed
directing because it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's definitely a unique skill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've seen how
other people direct their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their work as well and it's
everyone has a different style. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Some are just not effective at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Some, some, voice
directors, you know, they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they have no idea what
they want, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's just on the voice actor to save, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to save the performance somehow, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even though the director
has no idea what they wants. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you ever get that moment though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're directing someone and you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they've not delivered the line
exactly the way you want it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so you have to explain it to them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you get to the third point, the third </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the third time, the
third time you've tried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they still haven't done
it the way you wanted to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you, do you continue? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like do, do, do you continue
trying to explain it to them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or do you just go with one of the takes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Normally I will do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would try my best to explain it to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Worst case scenario, I'll do a line read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> which a line read is you
don't normally do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kind of, it's not unprofessional </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it wastes a lot of time
which is where the director </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> will deliver the line and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just copy what I just did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's what I'll do
on the worst case scenario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if they can't do that,
then it's like, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is going to be bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if they, if they can't
hear one, like what I just did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they can't replicate it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that means that they have
no idea what I just did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In my head I'm like, okay.
They don't even see what I did, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't know what they are doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's the worst beginning
in the world, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Today video is sponsored by Xenon Zod </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is a unique AI based animated card game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the mobile that's just
been recently released. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So do you guys know what
the AI card game entitled? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have no idea what an AI card is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So basically the AI card game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so in the game you get an AI
buddy that you can choose from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the choice of the AI buddy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think there's 16 different AI characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can choose from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's based off of this interview </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you do at the beginning of the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that dictates your personality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You pick the AI that best
suits your personality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but basically you have an
AI buddy that plays along </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and helps you strategize to play Xenon Zod </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is this card game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the AI buddy like
gives you legitimate advice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the games, like how
you can beat the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like different strategies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you don't have to
follow the AI but you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the AI's are acute goals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and sometimes they're just
like really cool characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, okay, you
know what you're, you're an AI. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll listen to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll listen to you, I'll listen to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So as I understand it,
there's also 500 different cards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with seven different categories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've also seen a few clips of the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the visuals look pretty damn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> impressive for a mobile game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] So the actual game
play involves three phases. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have the monument
phase, the flash phase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the main phase and the
unique feature about Xenon Zod </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the modern movement
system where you can move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> summoned minions to and
from mana in kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a really interesting recycling mechanism. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So as you play against an
AI opponent, you can easily </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take breaks whenever you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you can also play against PVP as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So if you download the game right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you can actually get your
hands on 240 of the 500 cards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> available in the game,
just off of ongoing events </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you use the hashtags and are ACI </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Facebook and Twitter,
you can use that to connect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with other players in the
game or to just battle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and flex your hot AI... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if that sounds
interesting to you go down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the description down
below and download Xenon Zod </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> today and you could get up to 240 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the exclusive 500 cards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you to Xenon Zod for
sponsoring today's episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and back to the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did a video series
where I like fixed games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hentai anime I redid all
the, the voice acting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the ground up and
the only rule was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't allowed to change. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was, I was not change
anything about the voice acting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The whole point of that was to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> prove to the viewers that like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> listen, you could you can
fix the bad voice acting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but more often than not it's
not the bad voice acting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that is terrible about this
series or thing that you watch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it's normally just cause like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything else is terrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the one thing that
stands out is this dude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> who's delivering a line, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's normally as a
result of everything else being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause voice actors are the
last priority for most things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because then normally the
thing that you do at the end, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at some games and stuff like
games are normally the worst, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worst culprit of terrible voice acting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Especially Japanese
games that get translated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> into English normally have God
fucking awful voice acting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, definitely.
- Yeah, A lot of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> games as well just have
absolutely horrible localization. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just the dialogue, clearly the
person who was translating it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does not have the firmest
grasp of both languages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and 'cause normally
they're not given like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an amazing budget to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> These games are long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They get pretty underpaid,
unfortunately, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they're just like, whatever
I'll just do the bare minimum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> run it through Google
translate if need be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, fuck it no one's
gonna notice the voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> actors are shit anyway who cares. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Japanese wording with
like, (in foreign language), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, (in foreign language)
means mum in Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All according to (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Speaking about voice
actors and voice acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like the only person who's actually been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in an anime here is you Garnt.
- Yeah, I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or like an actual Japanese anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what, what was the
experience like for you then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was really cool because. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt explain like you
were on "Pop Team Epic" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what you have to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, so just purely by coincidence, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got to voice in "Pop Team Epic" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> even though all my lines
I did were in English. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was technically, it
was technically Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were in the sub.
- I'm in the sub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know because Funimation
dubbed "Pop Team Epic" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and they didn't use me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think they're
allowed to though, legally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No they weren't but you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Funimation you could hit me up bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My DMs were open.
- My DMs were open, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we follow each other on Twitter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you could have DM me anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I voiced this it
was this entire episode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that was voiced in English
because "Pop Team Epic" just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no rules, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was really cool
because I got to voice act </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with the guy who voiced
Rio in "Devilman Crybaby". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, wow.
- Awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because he's also fluent in English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> He's pretty good at English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so he and he delivered obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the English part as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was really cool
because it, you know, it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the portrayals is
all voice acting is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know one person goes into the booth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they do their lines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Next person comes in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's normally how it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't know if this is
only in the Japanese industry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at least with the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they put all the voice actors
that are in the one episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all into the same room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there are four or
five microphones lined up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I saw, I saw that with some like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> behind the scenes documentary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think how I understand the dubbing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the English speaking world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is that you get one
booth or one voice actor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's one after the other.
- One after the other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But in anime it's you,
they do it all in one go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So if there's a current
scene where there are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> four voice actors, then
all four voice actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will go up to the mics and
basically while holding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the script in the hand take it in turns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to deliver their line and when
they're not doing their line, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they pull away from the microphone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think all cartoons used
to be that way in the West </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think recently it's changed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think one series you'd
definitely see that effect in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in is Connor Seba. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Where you can, you can tell
that all of the characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are just like bouncing off each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That helps so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unlike the dub, the dub for Connor Seba </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is actually great and I
commend them for being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> able to like recreate this energy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> while not being in the same room because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you can definitely the energy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Japanese dub I mean, Connor Seba. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what makes one events that... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why it's so good
because you can tell that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> these aren't just
characters that are fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around with one another but voice actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that are just having
a great time together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you need that
dynamic in a show like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and, but it was really cool
because with "Pop Team Epic" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, we would all
come onto one scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, there was me, you
know, the main voice actor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there was like
three or four voice actors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who were doing the, you
know just side characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was really cool because
once a scene would finish, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then if one of us needed to retake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or it was really cool because
all of the voice actors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> would come together and basically critique </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what we all just did in that one set. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So that we would all come together </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would get professional
advice from the voice actor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you feel being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay that line delivered was really cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but maybe if you deliver
this next line like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then I could respond in this kind of way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And while all of this
conversation is happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the voice director is also listening in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So he can put in the input
of his writing if need be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I mean, I didn't have
to do too many retakes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with "Pop Team Epic" because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the voice actor was just
like, "Yeah, that's good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just did not give a shit, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was just like, yeah, good
enough. Fucking what ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean like you, you
were speaking in English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he was like, yeah, this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this probably sounds better
than most of the English... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only time that the
voice actor asked me to do so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the voice director asks me to
do something super specific </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was when I had to do the narrator voice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for the "Guilty Gear" parody scene where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to say heaven or
hell like in "Guilty Gear" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and he was like, no
cause the voice director </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> was like a massive fan of "Guilty Gear" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he was like, "No, no,
that's not how you say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to say it like this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And you just broom it over the PR system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All of us just sitting there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, I'll do it like that I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's always such a fan experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, it was super fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were you nervous doing it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because literally everybody
else around me are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> professional Japanese voice
actors, but it was really cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because all of the voice actors were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> wow how long have you
been doing voice acting? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, this is my... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is my first Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Technically speaking
this is my first Joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like, "You're
really fucking good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, well, call your boy back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then everyone cheered. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone lifted Garnt up, yay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, subscribe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn dude, oh I've had
some terrible fucking clients </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when I did a lot of commercials </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause they would bring in
like a business executive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to come in and critique and
they don't know anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They would, I remember
one time there was a guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I did this whole take,
I thought I killed it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like, yeah,
something's like off with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This wasn't the director. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was just the guy who
was paying for it to be made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like, yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could you just try something different? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did the exact same
thing again, no different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was like that was perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, I was
like, I fucking knew it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like, I know I might head I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know I can get away
with doing the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one more time but like
maybe not a second time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, I'll just try once to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if he notices, he had no idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At that point on with any
time he said anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would just look at the
voice director over there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like I would look at him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, should I listen to this, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause he was the engineer
and the director of the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Right.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So he normally does the delivery, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the way, the way it was set up for me was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> he normally directed me and the client </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would just stand there
and go like, "Yes, yes.". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I was always doing business stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, it was like perseverance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> inspiration, shit like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you do like a
Gillette commercial, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Or like a, like a
shaving cream commercial, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Something else ages ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was doing like boats for like a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You did boats?
- You did boats? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did like, there was some, oh, I can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the corporation is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I also don't know if I should say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if I'm allowed.
I don't know what I signed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Once a week I would go in for three hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would talk about boats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, how old were you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This was like last year? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every week I went in and talked about... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is in London, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got paid like, like
fuck how much was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were paying me 250 pounds an hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is like 300 something bucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just talking about boats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is probably like a lot better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than what voice actors
get paid to voice anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, anime rates aren't that great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I don't know
if you know I'm gonna, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just say like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean definitely didn't get paid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have heard things and
you know, you get paid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on Funimation from what I've been told. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if this is true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if I'm allowed
to say this, but it's not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not great, it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Less than what I was getting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I it's
like, I think it's always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just been known that the
voice acting industry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and anime specifically just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get paid the least. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you get paid the
least out of any commercial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why you see a
lot of dub voice actors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> going on to do gaming
now and other industries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The, the way it goes is like, it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally commercials pay the most because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> commercials you get
paid normally a premium </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you also get
what's called a buyout fee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if your ad is going to be
played over X amount of places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with radios, TV, that gets
calculated in the cost of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and you could get like one commercial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that takes you 20 minutes,
which it often did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> These commercials are 30
seconds long, honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I would never be there
for more than 30 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but they would maybe pay you
like 15 grand for the biopsy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So your session fee was
like 250 pounds and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you might get 15 grand or 10
depending on why they play it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how much, because I know
the guy who did McDonald's ads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK, that was his whole
career just doing McDonald's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you know you
get paid so fucking much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is McDonald's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then used to get like
six figures, every commercial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know that's
luckily how the industry was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that you got paid if your
voice is being shared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you imagine when you're paid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> six figures by going, (gibberish). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish man, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was like imagine, how much, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how much money McDonald's made off of... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, because the, normally
how it is with commercials </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that if your, normally with voices, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if a corporation gets one voice actor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's normally always that one voice actor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who does everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So in the industry where,
when I was in London </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was mainly commercial stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it came up a lot and
it was always like people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were competing to get
that one commercial Joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that kept coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah,
- And so I got this boat Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't think anything of
it 'cause I didn't audition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They like requested me. So I
went in, I did a read of it.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was talking about,
I had to explain a ton </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of different things about large ships. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For a corporation thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I had to go in every week
and do something ballasting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That was what, I did like four weeks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of thing called ballasting, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Ballasting is a thing and I know this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I did four scripts on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, tell us then,
what is ballasting, sir? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like, it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> God, I wish I remembered the words </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I remember every time
I would go into deliver it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause my accent is English, right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's not a received pronunciation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is the typical accent, which is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I say grass, but it's grass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So every time I would
do anything, he's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "You didn't, you didn't say
the receive presentation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do it again." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, oh yes of course ballasting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, is the, you know, like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was basically where water goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> in the ships and they dunk
it, dump it out later on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but there was like so many
scientific words and I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> he was the sodium hydrosis
collage oxide oxygenation thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And know, the hard
thing about that is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you could do a thing called line reading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're paying you to
get this right first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the first time I
see the script is when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I go in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm sure that was that the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for you with "Pop Team Epic"?
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You couldn't see the full hand? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - With "Pop Team Epic" I
got sent not only the script </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about three weeks before I went in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I also got a CD with.
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The actual visual. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I can practice this ahead of time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And apparently that's normally
in the anime industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's just like
the Japanese trust system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's like, we trust that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you will not leak this anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That just sounds like
a leak waiting to happen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in any other industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't sign a contract either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, they just got to
send this without an end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They just sent it to me hoping
that I wouldn't leave this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, I, I can maybe count on my hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The amount of time I received the script </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I got that, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like never. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and so I would get
the script in front of me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd maybe have two minutes
to quickly go over it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they immediately expected
me to like nail it first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and again, there's words
I've never even seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the English language
the company scripts, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what these words are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm expected to like nail it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whilst I'm also reading
it for the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's what they're paying
you an absurd amount for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I, I know people who've
run like official discourse, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like...something I have to sign NDAs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here you are to just actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get getting you the
entire script before hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's episode nine, six
months before it comes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, it was crazy like I got it in the mail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they didn't even tell me
then we're gonna send it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was also assuming
that I was going to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the script and everything
when I got there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that normally how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right that's what I heard as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dubbing do that as well.
- It's the same with dubbing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I heard but not only that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but when I, when I also...in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Grisaia Phantom Trigger" game, they also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> send me the script like two
weeks beforehand as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't send me the visuals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they sent me the script,
like the physical script </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I had to go in with
the physical script. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the difference is normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Western industries,
they're still editing the script. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the day off, like
said normally the script </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that you get might not
even be the final draft, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the one that you are recording. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also people don't
trust anyone in this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is, which is, of course, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is, this is the country
the way you can leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like your fucking laptop
in the middle of a diner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to the bathroom and then come back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just trust that
nobody's going to take it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanted to leak the poke stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even care, I just wanna leak it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don't tell anybody about
the sodium hydroxide. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that it's crazy
but I mean, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you get paid well
for the boat thing though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, I got paid really well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's like that's like
the voice actors dream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is I didn't, I didn't do
it for the money I shoot it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's same with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I feel like people
who go into especially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the anime industry too
who wants to be a voice actor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they do it for the passion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You get paid nothing for those sessions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean maybe unless
you're a sag actor in LA </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you get paid a decent amount. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's $250 minimum for
a session, two hour session. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah it's you get the notoriety, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which allows you to do a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Right, I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I feel like nowadays
there's less notoriety </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in like big voice sites names </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in dubbing at least
than, than they used to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, they used to be cons, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what you want It. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but now like if, even if
you get to voice a dub </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in like a huge, huge show, there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you still don't get as much notoriety </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like say back in like
the mid two thousands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we had voice sites like Steve Bloom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Johnny Yong Bosch, Crispin Freeman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just like those
those like the triple a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voice acting voice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everybody knew who they were, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's a lot harder in this climate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and industry just because
there's so many dubs now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything gets slammed with like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's on Funimation it's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be signed with dubbed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone watches anime
like very different ways now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like even, even going back
to "Japan Sinks" where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know who any of the voice actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who voiced in this anime
where, because I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was literally switching
between dub and sub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depending on which one
I like to listen to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I feel like the voice acting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for dubs in general has gotten
to like a passable quality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] That's great.
- And almost every show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there, there, there
are some shows that are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is, this is just a funny dub </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but for the most part if I
wanna just shut my brain off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and just listen to what
the language that I want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I speak then I just
I'll just put on dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I can, I can I have the trust </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it will be like a decent experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dub have definitely
gotten to that point, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's there's certainly no like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> '90s quality like hilarious dub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which is what I
feel like the whole argument </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of sub versus dub is kind
of like you to this place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like the
counterpoint to that is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are less dubs
that just stand out now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I think of some
of my favorite dubs, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Something like "Baccano"
and "Cowboy Bebop". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, these are dubs that stand out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like literally, like I remember
how good they were just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of how they quality but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nowadays I don't know, I can't think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't think of like many
dubs that literally just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, this everything's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything's decent quality
but I can't think of anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that like truly stands out
as this is a dub experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me the last, I think the
newest, newest quote unquote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime where the dub was like, wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was probably "Panty & Stocking". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but that was like 2008. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that why I'm saying
(laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> newest in quotations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's how the industry
was back then, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You had like two weeks
to just cast people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you had two weeks just for that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> let alone everything else but now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have two weeks to, not
even two weeks like one week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to cast translate and get
these actors in the booth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get a recording. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's you, you can't expect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that anything good come out of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can, we get the good products, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's decent but we're
not gonna get anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that blows us away from it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think the last, the last dub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that blew me away it was
probably "Stein's Gate" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's, it was one of
those shows where I actually, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I could appreciate the work
that went into translating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just scripting it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not just like the voice
acting but like everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was just really polished. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I believe that was scripted by. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (murmurs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the one... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is why he absolutely killed it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Came as well, so like, because I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with the era of dubbing, it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a lot harder to
recreate that same quality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and that same height
because they just don't have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as much time anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also think at least for Funimation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think when Sony took over, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think they restructured
a lot of it to make it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> less focused on giving a
writer's time and more giving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like getting the whole thing out sooner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which, you know, it's
understandable, I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also at the same time,
you kind of lose a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that magic that, you know,
maybe a double beep, whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually here's, here's
a question for you, Garnt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you, you, you could
probably judge us the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but ever since the beginning
of time, there's always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been this debate of subs
versus dubs, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The Japanese, Japanese voice
citing is always great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Has there been any show or
any anime from your experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's just bad voice acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from like a Japanese side of things? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man, that's hard to say because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least with voice, from my
understanding and my experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> at least Japanese voice acting in anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has just had an insanely
high bar to jump over now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> even ever since even you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I could obviously
go back to, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an enemy from the '70s. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And probably find some
bad voice acting there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's because it was a
medium that was still getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> refined since the '60s. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I think honestly,
every anime I've seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> since you know, the late '80s, early '90s, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think there's been a,
maybe there's been like one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or two bad voices or one or two maybe like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> under qualified voices
compared to everybody else </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in that same show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I wouldn't say there's an entire show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has like bad voice acting because. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The same way that there are bad dubs... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly but, and I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe that's like a cultural
thing, maybe it's just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's cause
they've set up a system here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that ensures they're
getting voice talent, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They have schools
specifically for voice acting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't really have that in the West. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's you go to acting school and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe stumbled into voiceover, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If that's what you like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There's not really a system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But their entire, you know
like four year universities... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No right, exactly it's
the same reason why like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (murmurs) amazing at e-sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they have the infrastructure
there to support </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like making this talent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know, in Japan,
obviously they've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having their schools for
awhile where the bar is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> getting pushed constantly and constantly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas it's not really
like that in the West. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you know the great thing
as well with the structure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of, at least with Japanese
voice acting and animate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is that if there is a new
voice actor or actress </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that comes into the industry, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they usually start them off
with very, very small roles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe like one line or
even just background noise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to kind of get them
used to that environment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and give them as much
experience as possible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then maybe after they
do it, you know, 10 rolls </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of playing, you know,
a person passing behind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the main character after the 10th time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then they can give them a role where... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the Japanese... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, here's two more lines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, the next one we'll
give you five lines, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the next one we'll give you 10 lines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it just builds
and builds from there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Unless if it's someone
that just has insane amount </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of talent from the get-go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're just confident
enough to put them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> into a show and then they
make a name for themselves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of the best performances
have been from actors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like they weren't acting
in any other animated shows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, no yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, I think, I
think Johnny Yong Bosch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like stumbled into his
first dub role by accident. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I think same would Steve Bloom as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - From what I probably remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's been a while since
I heard the stories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Both fantastic voice acts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - God, I think it was the guy who did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> light in (murmurs), </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> he did a lot of the ocean
dubs in Canada, he did like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause he did Rock from
"Black Lagoon" as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think he was doing
"My Little Pony" before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or he did after, I think he did after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but before that I think
he'd done anything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I knew the guy voices was
elaborate so and back in though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hadn't done any anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no I remember a
lot of like back then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the voice actors
he voiced in "Baccano" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was that, that was like the first roll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because everyone fucking
killed it, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really, there's a
lot of unknown voice actors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and actresses in that, in our show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Great show
- Yeah, questions to you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> questions to you guys then,
we've so we've the ridiculously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> high bar that Japanese voice acting has. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What, what are some shows that you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that even stand up for you with like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese voice talent
and the voice acting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll tell you the show that
stands out to me most recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's "Beastars". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Beastars" has absolutely
like insane voice acting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's a very different
because it doesn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it didn't sound like your typical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime kind of voice acting,
it sounded very grounded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know who the
voice actor for "Legacy" is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but his his acting was so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like "Legacy" and "Lewis". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Was like, they both had like
the voice acting performances </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of that year, in any anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, easily, easily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In my, in my opinion,
like even, even with shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like "Attack on Titan Three" coming out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that had some great voice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I still think "Beastars" was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just a cut above the rest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's just because
"Beastars" as a show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was just a cut above the rest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it was just such
a fucking amazing show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm trying to think
of any Japanese shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that really blew me
away with voice acting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Jojo"?
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, my man Dio kills
it...like that performance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I spoke about it before,
like his performance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this Dio, like I'm
not in memes a side like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah.
- He's fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everyone in part five, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I would argue as well
has fantastic voices. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the thing with
Japanese voice as well is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they can just do casting so well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like they understand how important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> casting is for our character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I'm working on a video right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I've watched the "Clannad" dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there is one scene
where a female teacher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just voiced by a dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs)
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like I'm it's I
obviously can't show this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'll show you guys later... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, this is why
I didn't watch a dog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just like a scene
and I watched it damn, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't remember this but I
watched someone sent me the clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, that's just a dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like, "Hi boys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Like that, how're you doing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll get this pass." all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean there's a lot of
weird things that happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with dubbing back in the day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're gonna talk about bad dubs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, we have to talk about, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like "Ghost Stories" and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Ghost Stories" is that a
bad dub or is that just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so bad that it's good dub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - People always act, 'cause
when I, when I tweet up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, hey I'm
gonna fix bad anime scenes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for a YouTube video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people always be like,
yeah, fixed "Ghost Stories". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, what is there to fix? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's nothing to fix.
- That thing is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it's just 'cause, from
what I've heard about how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ghost Stories" came to be
made, it was "Ghost Stories" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sold horribly in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when they'd licenses, licensing over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like do what you
need to do to make this sell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, dude you have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is some rules,
there is some rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Creative control, yeah,
there was some rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where you basically, you basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had full creative control
and from what I heard like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they were just, the voice
actors would just try to rush in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the booth first and they would
just like add live the scenes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and everyone else would have to like play </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> off what they said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like the first of bridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, essentially
- Essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah it's, it's
weird to think right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that dubs back in the '70s were done, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> there was no email. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like how did they do this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There was literally a
guy was given this DVD </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and they would just kind of made it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he just had the jacket.
- They just figure it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just hope they did it
well, like it's weird, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you think there was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even then, there was a trial system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's just so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know like I guess just take this DVD </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and go home, VHS, Betamax. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - DVD, what existed before DVD? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Take this cassette. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Laser disk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, laser disk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Laser disk never took off in the West </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but in Japan, they were like,
God, yeah, no, it's weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But even then I think
that's also why some dubs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now are a bit strange
'cause they were still done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> on that system where if
you go first, you dub it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the person who
comes next has to dub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but they get to hear just your character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's been before you, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was last, normally is easiest time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, and that because
they have to kind of go along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with oh, they perform this
character in this way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I kind of have to do it the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but if the first one sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a bit unfortunate 'cause
I think it makes this weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of feeling sometimes by accident </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this is again, why
a director should be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on top of that show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's, that's
what, that's why like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the director has control
over how this sounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause there are
definitely some dubs where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it definitely sounds like people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't having a conversation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A voice over, I think a
director's job is like 10% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get the best performance out of you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and like 90% to make sure everyone sounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like they're in the same world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's the hardest part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you're constantly thinking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> okay that was a great line
but does it fit with what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the other person just delivered? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I need to think about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's a really hard skill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's definitely hard 'cause
you have to be on top </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of what everyone is saying
and how everyone's sounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's, it's definitely like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can definitely see some of the nuances </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that people don't normally
think about but if you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if you play a conversation
and it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> man these people just sound
like they're reading lines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to each other and not actually
having a conversation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's really, it just
sounds it's the uncanny valley. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it sounds like they're kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> talking through dimensions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One's living in one
world and the other one's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living in the other world then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the rift just happened to open
up where it's like, oh hello. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello, hi Mark.
- Hi, Mark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - God, I could sit here
and talk all day about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dubbed anime and voice acting and all that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause obviously that's
what I'm cripplingly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> addicted to that and all that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably not music.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're gonna get this boy on some like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we gotta make him understand emotions use, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I never thought I'd say that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just, I wish like
I wish Kevin was here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wish Kevin was like
guessing in this one episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Kevin can convince
me but like this is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no I just wanna, I
just wanna see his reaction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you were just saying all this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff as a fucking composer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Kevin if you're watching this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want you to just like,
if if we ever get Kevin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the show and we will
get Kevin on the show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just, I want to just
hear the conversation... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll dead ass look him in the eye. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want you to dead
ass look him in the eye </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and just be like, "Made
in Abyss" soundtrack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made me feel good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just dead ass looking
at me and just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't remember any of your music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it made me feel good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I heard it, I heard the sounds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like I
have the opposite brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to like a composer though
in like every aspect, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like when I talked to Kevin, I feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I'm on like the complete
opposite mind in every way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's crazy, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I just have
that, that kind of mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that isn't, isn't like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if we can't even like relate to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not exactly composers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like you're, you're
very musical though, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah, but I'm no Kevin Penkin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No right, but you have
an appreciation for music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> something that I don't have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't make music, it
doesn't make sense to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand any of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I tried to learn drums as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, yes,
this just doesn't work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you follow along with like different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> animate directors and like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you say their names, maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if I said Hosoda Mamoru? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I said Shinkai Makoto? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your name.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I know that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, you don't know Hosoda Mamoru?? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you never seen "Wolf Children"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] "Summer Wars". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I've seen "Summer Wars". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The "Digimon Movie" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't watch that, who the fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watched the "Digimon Movie" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The "Digimon Movie" is fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm joking, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't kill me, "Summer Wars" and. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Boy and the Beast"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Boy and the Beast". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He also did a "One Piece" movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the jumping
through time or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what's that one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He also did you know, he also directed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "The Samurai Champloo Opening?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, he also directed a
"One Piece" movie as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "One Piece" movie, six, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was such good fucking movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, that was fucking great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I loved it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you watch the "Digimon Movie" movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you were a kid?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you remember the soundtrack for that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - The hard fucking bare naked ladies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and "Less Than Jake" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fatboy Slim, like
whoa is this soundtrack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was screaming '90s. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it ain't...do you remember
that scene was all star? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking all star in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'm totally serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking smash mouth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He had smash mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do they get these rights? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because he was back in the day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like back in the
day of like '90s movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It wasn't like they had a
completely different sound track </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the Japanese release. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So when they, when they
like dubbed it westernized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there they put all of
these like Western bands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I couldn't because I watched
the Japanese movie first, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously but then I
went to a friend's place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and he only had the dub for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I've never seen the dubs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I might as well, watch it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then when I heard
Smashmouth I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you was playing a prank on me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you overdub this was Shrek. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to now just watch this movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Gesture experience "Smash
Mouth" and Fatboy Slim, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hearing Fatboy slim
I was like, what was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so surreal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was cause I didn't
realize how special was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was watching as a
kid, but now growing up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think back and I realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man this was a really weird, sounds... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like turning up
to like kindergarten. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They've got Coke on the table. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, I would do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fatboy slim song, was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right here, right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was that or was it weapon of choice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was a weapon of choice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was weapon of choice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was weapon of choice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just hearing weapon of
choice in "Digimon Movie" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude just hearing Fatboy Slim, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like takes me back 10 years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fucking love fat boy slim dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fatboy slim is fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - From Brighton by the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a born and bred
Brightonian, yeah from my home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Any famous people from
where you're from Connor? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think there was a
Lost Profits, that band </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I think they
were like pedophiles, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We quickly, quickly abandoned that word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was a band called Leo,
it's called Lost Profits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think they were like
a fucking, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like kind of like
a knockoff of like some way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I remember the Lost Profits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Were like the rock band that like was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like British fallout boys sort of ish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like panic at the disco kind of vibe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - A little more Rocky I think of but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay I was actually,
I was watching a new anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recently have you guys heard
of "The Great Pretender"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have heard of it, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Song? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no the anime, the anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's there's an anime
called the "Great Pretender". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking, I've only seen
the first three episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a Netflix exclusive anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it seems like it's,
it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw a preview for
that, I wanna watch that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a heist show that sets in America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, exactly you're
like when you think of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> heist show in anime I think
of "Lupin The Third", right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like this I can't think
of many other heist shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they actually, the
ending for that song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> is the "Great Pretender"
by Freddie Mercury. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember watching it, I
was like, wow, who is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This kind of sounds like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I saw, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> See is the actual "Great
Pretender" by Freddie Mercury. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck how did the get that?
- I know, right, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I sometimes wonder that because there's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a few anime series where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they've gotten Western songs, right, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Paradise Kiss". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Franz Ferdinand, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did they?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Paradise Kiss"
- Do you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by Franz Ferdinand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and you know
like "Egre Proxy" ending, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was paranoid Andrew, by Radiohead and, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "Eden of the East", had "Oasis" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that was surreal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That had such a good
opening, the holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Eden of the East" opening as someone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a great show.
- That was a great show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a very good
show but the opening to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of everything stands of the most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's probably one of my favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> openings of all time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I mean, you
know, we're in a good mood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when either gone on, I put that on karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> were just like, oh, let's go baby. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's such a good song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's great because
these are like the songs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I could put on on the karaoke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and just pretend like I can sing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is an anime song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm a weep... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like when was the last time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that an anime had like
a Western song in it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like the whole "Great Pretender" was it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> was it a "Erge Proxy"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It might've been one of those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's been a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's gotta be some, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know if there's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't think of my head like
how many actual English songs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's, there's
been Japanese songs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or there's been Japanese
bands that have sunk English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In terms of actual pure
here is like a Western band </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who, who is just got to got a song... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was also that anime from like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> early 2000s I just remember that </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> - Dude do you skip opening... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - After one watch, after
one, one opening view </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, unless it was "Beastars", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched it every time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, actually
very specifically then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you ever, okay do you
ever notice that moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in any anime where it's
a really hype scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they play the opening song? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, good if you notice
that, then you're not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not completely brain dead. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not completely brain dead. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like saying the name
of the show to me. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, I loved
like, I don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it always works, right but. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] No, it's hype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's type, you, you
play the opening song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in any hype scene and it just brings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it from like a 10 to a 20. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs)
- It does, it does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's pretty fucking hype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're about to pop off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Or like, you know, you
know, shit's gone down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's the end of the
episode and like the end, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the ending song start playing.
- Before it's finished. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you're like, oh shit,
shit's about to go down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Shit's about to get real. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like PTSD of the "Anahata" song, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's always playing
and I'm like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had that with, I had that with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When the fucking, when the chorus starts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time it like, every
episode opens with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but then there are a few
episodes near the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that a bush name?
- Yeah, from the future world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It's 10 out of 10 coming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the opening that series
didn't have an opening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It just had like this
chorus of kids just going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was about to say like sarcastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I really liked the opening to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs)
- That's the opening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really love when I circulate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hey man, that's a great opening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No okay, I remember right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched 'cause I downloaded
all of "Bakemonogatari" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched them all and I
remember I listened to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I circulation, I thought,
wow, that's a fucking tune. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I went to find it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought, man, am I the
only guy who likes this song? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Found out like two hours later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally everyone loves this song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It made like the meme compilations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna give a hot take though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not my favorite one on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> guitar opening, platinum disco. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Platinum disco.
- Platinum disco. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, platinum disco. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Platinum disco is really fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That fucking dance is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like "Monogatari" has
like so many banger opening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and endings as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah even the first
opening of "Bakemonogatari". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah staples. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, staples.
- That was like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's was like the
great fucking song too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Dorohedoro" changed
the ending every time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then "Beastars" did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Beastars changed the ending, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think "Dorohedoro" did as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were really, really fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because we have them
on a "Monogatari" series. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was the first time when I noticed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they were actually Changing the endings, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to every all arc, every
arc in a different ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every arch had a
different opening, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought he was like a really nice touch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like little things like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That "Monogatari" policy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I know there
have been other series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that have done that but I think of any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a ton I'm sure but
I need to write shit down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's what I've
taken away from this episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How'd the music make me feel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I should write more than one word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would, I wouldn't
like a thousand word essay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> on how music in anime makes you feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> by the end of this episode. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> - Let me give a presentation
of why I like music in anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Seeing you process, like try to process, </SPEAKER_04>
