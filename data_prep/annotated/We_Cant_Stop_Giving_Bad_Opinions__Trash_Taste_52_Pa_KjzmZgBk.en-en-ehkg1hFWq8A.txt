<SPEAKER_05> - Every time I have a Kit
Kat, it's usually like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's usually in like, you know,
like two Kit Kats together, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you split it, and you eat it one at- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I literally just grab, and just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (snack crunching) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do this.
- Don't be, (sighs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh God.
(baby crying) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (relaxed music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello, and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am boy, and with me today are boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello, it's me.
(man laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The usual.
- Yay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How are you doing boys?
- I'm doing well, boy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I am tired.
- We're not doing this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are we?
(Gigguk laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm doing fine.
- You're doing fine? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm tired as all hell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you've just
been building a fuck ton </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of furniture, haven't you?
- I've just been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> building furniture for the past week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've just been going
through the entire Ikea catalog, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just been building that-
- Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like never, it's just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I in a respawn point
for Ikea furniture? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Because every time I build one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> another one just respawns the next day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "cool". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's been the most satisfying build? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wait, what is the most
annoying furniture to build </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in general?
- Ikea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Anything from Ikea.
- Sometimes it's good, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Well okay, what's the item
that is always most annoying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have my own thoughts on this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've already decided.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe, I mean I've built
desks, shelves, chairs, tables. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've built everything. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You name it, I've built it. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You name it-
- Well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what was your answer, Connor? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Since you seem to-
- All right, listen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, so-
- Shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh shit.
- It's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a little spill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Beds can be annoying, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Beds can be quite frustrating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you get the really
cheap beds, beds are shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're either like a 2x2 Rubik's Cube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or a 64x64 Gauntlet Cube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what you need
to get, what we got? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A Koala bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it a shout out, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you being sponsored
by Koala Beds right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no.
- Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because I will say, I did
sleep on Chris's couch- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, can we get some
tissue please? (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah, can we wipe this off? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right.
- Because Chris has like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A couch.
- A sofa bed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, by them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, and I was like, "Chris's
sofa is nicer than my bed". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey giggles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I remember
when we just moved here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just bought whatever
was the cheapest option </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Amazon.
- Biggest mistake. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And now I regret it,
because at that time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, whenever you
move into a new place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the most difficult part is just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the amount of upfront money you put down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You look at your bank
account, and you're just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (sighs) Oh, that's a really low number. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's a really big
number I'm giving away, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all at once, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, do I really need a microwave? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure I can just slap
my chicken hot, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, just rub
it across the ground. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Friction will warm it up.
- It's whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I'll survive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm finally getting
rid of my laundry machine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my washing machine.
- Yeah, we're getting rid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of ours as well.
- I got rid of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my cockroach infested one.
- (laughs) Oh yeah, that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, you still have that one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I still have that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He cleaned it up though,
he cleaned it up, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did clean it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But you know, I mean, I don't
know what's been in there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it is nice to get rid
of it, get a new one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get something nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can afford it.
- I'm taking the old one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from this studio. (laughs)
- Are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah! (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, what?
- Are you actually? (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because we have to get rid of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Well I'll take it". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's better than the one I have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, are you actually taking ours? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the first I'm hearing about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Well, wait, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what did you think was
gonna happen with it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought we were just
gonna get rid of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna get rid of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, why would you do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just take it.
- Well, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because if you go to like,
Big Camera or Yodobashi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if you buy a fridge from there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they have a free service where
if you have a fridge already, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll get rid of the old one for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but-
- So I was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna utilize that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To get rid of my fridge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, have you, so why do
you still have your old fridge? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought you bought a new one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, my washing
machine, washing machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, washing machine.
- Oh, washing machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay, okay, if you
buy a new fridge on Amazon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a service-
- That's what I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, they'll take the old one away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah-
- You can do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with your fridge as well.
- It's not my fridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait-
- How did it take you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so god damn long to get some tissues? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Why'd it take two of you? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughing) We literally asked
for this five minutes ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just saw a SWAT team sting operation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just watched a SWAT (laughs)- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What a chaotic start-
- I just saw Ashley </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> come in, doing like the John
Travolta, like, huh? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We have two staff,
and it took both of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five minutes to get some
tissues in the other room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait, wait, hold
on, hold on, can we go back- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We got very confused-
- Can we go back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to the whole fridge thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So wait-
- I got rid of my fridge, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by doing that service
where I bought a new one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I asked them to get rid of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But-
- Wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But did you say you were
gonna take our fridge? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I'm taking our washing machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- Oh, washing machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, okay so-
- Oh, I thought you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were gonna take my fridge from my house- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing)
- No. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> How would I do that, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, "When did we decide this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Explain to me the logistics. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Think Joey! (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Did this
man really just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'So yeah, I'm taking your fridge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I decided, I'm taking your fridge'". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm taking a page out
of my ancestors' books, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just taking things
from other people's houses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought you were taking
the fridge from the studio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I already have a, you guys
know I have a new fridge! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know you, that's why
I was so fucking confused- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would I get a new fridge? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to be specific. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally just got this fridge! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a great fridge, great
color, great everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ergonomics, fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I, this is the
first time I'm hearing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about you getting a new fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that's why-
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not getting a new fridge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- I already have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a new fridge, I'm, so-
- When did you buy the fridge? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like four months ago! (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait-
- You've been to my house! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The cockroach one?
- You've seen it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, but I also, okay remember- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just said you, I swear to God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> literally five minutes ago, you just said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "I still got the cockroach fridge". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have the laundry machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The cockroach laundry machine, I have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, but you had a
cockroach laundry machine- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Laundry machine?
- What the fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only story we heard-
- Wait, wait, I've only heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about the cockroach fridge machine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You have a cockroach
laundry machine as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay so, when I got my fridge,
it was a two for one deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, so.
- Yeah no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I know about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh okay, so they both
had cockroaches in them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Well, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But they were in the same building. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no, no, you
said your washing machine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also had cockroaches in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. (laughs)
- There might have been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one or two in there, I can't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mudon, rewind the clip right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I speak to someone on
Craigslist, I found a fridge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and a laundry machine,
what do you call that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A washing machine?
- Washing machine. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't fucking know.
- A laundry machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's what it is, right?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They both came here in the same truck, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they both came from the same place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Frankly, if your fridge had, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, there was a
good 15, 20 cockroaches </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in this fridge.
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not, you know, at that point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not giving you the
benefit of the doubt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with any of your other appliances. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, how can you live with
that many, this was vile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> This was actually vile.
- Yeah, I don't understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some people- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt stuttering) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How big were the cockroaches? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I've never seen
cockroaches in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cockroaches in Japan-
- Thus far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was like one or two
that were pretty big chonkers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But a lot of them were
the little baby ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, the worst part was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is very much a gross warning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never spoken about this before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but when I ripped off
all the felt and stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there was a hole in the felt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I put it in a fucking bleach, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that doesn't kill them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I just wanted to
bleach the fridge stuff- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you kill them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of them were already dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay.
- There were so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dead cockroaches inside of this fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yikes, it's pretty disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey groans)
And I paid for that! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I paid for that!
(Joey sighs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Can't believe that.
- That's what you get, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For using-
- Craigslist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Craigslist.
- Never again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, it was the one
time where I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'll give Craigslist a chance". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll give Craigslist a chance". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried it-
- Because have you ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dealt with cockroaches in the UK at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I remember for most of my life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had just never seen a cockroach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the UK's pretty
clean, in terms of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Imagine the privilege of
living in a sanitary home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Cockroaches, what is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw a fair amount
when I moved to London. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really?
- In Wales I didn't see many. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> my very first cockroach experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was actually not in the UK,
but it was in Thailand, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember, because my
house is not in the city center. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, right on the outskirts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're near a lot of, not a forest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but a lot of grassland, basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we're like, right out in
the outskirts of the city. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we're like, right
next to nature as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, some of the cockroaches
we'd find are pretty massive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Right, and at this point,
I was living in Thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Sydney, and it was just me and Sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the house, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, I was just
sitting in my living room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just chilling out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I hear this fucking guttural scream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming from Sydney, right? (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like, I had never
heard Sydney scream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like Sydney's already
a loud person as it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I, no, no, but I had never heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this kind of scream from Sydney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, I thought
she had just witnessed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking murder or something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the kind of scream-
- She's reading a dojin, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or it's murder. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so I come rushing over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking that something serious,
something bad has happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just see this
fucking massive cockroach, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just chilling in our kitchen floor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well yeah, how big are we talking? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so it was about that bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor shudders)
- Okay, yeah, yeah- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a chonky motherfucker- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much bigger does it need to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> before it starts fucking talking? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) That's the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Terraform machine-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the way the cockroaches get in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because our kitchen is pretty clean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but because we're right on the outskirts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right near the forest an everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So sometimes they can crawl up the drains, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and come out from under the drains- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no.
- I didn't know this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I only found out about this afterwards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because my first thought was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fuck, I thought our kitchen was clean! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking burn the entire house
down", and everything, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But this was my first time.
- It's like a stealth mission. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like Solid Snake.
- Dun, dun, dun, dun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like, I don't know
how you guys are with bugs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure you're fine, Joey,
because you're Australian. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> For me, I'm not a massive fan of bugs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't enjoy-
- I mean, I'm not a fan! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not a fan of
having to deal with them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But some people can just
like, fucking grab the bugs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever, I'm just like, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll do like, the cup method,
where you see a spider, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you cup it, and you put a piece of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Paper in it-
- Paper in it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and let it out, I don't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not like, scared, but
I don't enjoy doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not a fun process.
- It's not a fun process. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't really, when
there's people who like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking grab the spiders, and are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh what do you mean you're scared of it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna fucking grab the spider. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would I wanna grab the spider? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if I don't like, hate this thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why the fuck would I wanna
have it wriggling around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my hand?
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do you do this?
- That's the Aussie in you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What people do this shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, they think they're
motherfucking Bear Grylls, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because they manage to catch
a house spider in their hand- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean-
- I don't give a fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't wanna touch that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have I told you of the
method that my dad uses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to get rid of cockroaches?
- We'll do that afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, he just fucking
sucks it in his mouth? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs)
Oh, what do you mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't have a spider in
your mouth, son? (blows) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well yeah, because me
and Sydney are a couple. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Because she's, I feel like
when you're in a couple, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one who's least scared
is the one who deals with- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, of course.
- And of course, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was me, I wasn't happy about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was just like,
"Sydney, you look like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just witnessed a murder, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get out of the way, I guess, as the man"- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let the man handle-
- I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as the man of the house
here, I will take care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of the cockroach.
- I know how to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughs) And I was thinking,
this was going to be easy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right, the cockroach was big, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I didn't know that much
about cockroaches at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, how naive you were.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh how naive I was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I thought, this was gonna be an easy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we had literally,
we had a cockroach spray. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was thinking, all I
need to do is get the spray, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spray the cockroach, job done, it dies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I sweep it out the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Easy, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now, so I get the spray,
and there are two pieces </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of information that I didn't
know about cockroaches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I did this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Number one, cockroaches are
very, very hard to kill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) And I knew this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I thought, it's a spray
designed to kill cockroaches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Therefore, in my mind, instant death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that's how it's
worked my entire life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, number two, cockroaches can fly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did not know this either. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that some species, or all of them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think all of them can fly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never seen a cockroach fly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They have to be pretty
fucking, GTFO mode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to start flying around.
- So I did not know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they could fly either,
so it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crawling around on the floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're really terraformers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, it's literally terraformers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like literally, last
resort for those cockroaches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I'm just like,
"Sydney, get out of the way". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let the man of the house handle this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, I get the spray
out, get pretty close to it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just give it a nice
little love tap with the spray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (laughs) And what happens? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It starts freaking the fuck out, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Yo, yo, yo,
what the fuck is happening?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, and then I spray it even more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I just hear the,
(imitates wings buzzing). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know the sound where you
just hear the wings flapping? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it starts
flapping, and then it flies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and lands on my chest.
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then-
- It's like, counterattack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, (laughs) and then
I'm in fucking flight or, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fight or flight mode now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I fucking scream,
as loud as I've screamed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my life before, I think.
(Joey giggles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) I'm not ashamed to admit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how fucking loud I
screamed, five minutes after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've just told Sydney,
"You're a fucking pussy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let me handle this". (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I brush it off, like I fucking
leg it out of the kitchen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I just lock the kitchen, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I could hear the
cockroach is just freaking out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the kitchen, all I hear is just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (imitating buzzing wings). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like, "Sydney get
out, it's his house now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's his house, we gotta leave! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We gotta get our stuff!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And Sydney just turns around and goes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Did you do it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's going on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "Just
don't go in that kitchen". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, me and Sydney were just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in the living room, we could
just hear this cockroach </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the entire night, just freaking out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh God.
- And we were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh God, are we gonna have to
burn the entire house down?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It'll get bored eventually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it'll get bored eventually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cockroach spray is the biggest
fucking lie on the planet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Aren't cockroaches the only animals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that can survive a nuclear blast? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know-
- Something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's like, what is in these sprays </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that is supposedly stronger
than a nuclear blast? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I don't stop
until it stops moving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like "Apex" aim, 100%,
(imitating can spraying) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just following it around the room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I thought that
would be fine as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I said, I didn't know they could fly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the big, "Oh, they could fly". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The rules of the game have changed now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They can counterattack you now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Normally I spray them,
just so they're stunned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a second, so I can fucking smack 'em. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, well I mean, I
don't like doing that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because then it leaves a mark. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And also, it's not a guaranteed kill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Unless you're using a fucking heavy boot- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey, what's your KDA with cockroaches- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You grab a suit shoe, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the sole of the suit
shoes are very firm, very flat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can just like, fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (hand punches table)
clap 'em on the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I mean the way my dad- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is a weird conversation- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is even hardcore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He just fucking eats it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He's Australian, it's free food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, in our household, we already know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cockroach spray is a lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So just don't even use the spray. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cockroach sprays are a lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It never kills the cockroach in one go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, just smack 'em
with the spray. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or, you do what my dad
does, which is, in Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because we also have big fuck
off cockroaches like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right, and there was one
that appeared in the kitchen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What, it's always the kitchen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it appeared in the
kitchen, my mum screams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My dad walks in, he's like, "What is it?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She points to the wall, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's a big fuck
off cockroach like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "Son." (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Eat it, eat it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He calls me over, "Yes
father, what is it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Son, bring me two tissues". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "I beg your pardon?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, "Bring me two tissues". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One-ply, I wanna feel it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "Just two?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "Just two". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "All right". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I bring him two tissues, and he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Place it on my hand". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I place it flat on his
hand, one on top to the other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, he dead ass
looks at me, and he goes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Watch this". (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He goes up to the wall,
and I've never seen a man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> move this fast in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like, bap! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And just grabs him, and it's in his hand! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, in the blink of an eye. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He just fucking, bap! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He just grabs it in his hand,
and you can hear this thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just (imitating buzzing wings)
like, around in his hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did he do the obligatory anime crush? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, he walks up to my mom, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and goes right up to her
ear and goes, crunch! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no.
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then he looks me in
the eyes, and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "I love that sound". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "You are the most"-
- Your fucking house is like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "You are the most Australian
father I could ever have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I love it".
- It's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the weirdest fucking house on earth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I was like, eight
years old when he did that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "My dad is
the strongest in the world". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the moment where
I'm like, "Don't fuck with"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, that's how to assert dominance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in your family, right.
- You're introducing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime villain.
- Yeah, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're in the playground,
you're making fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of each other's dad's, or
you're trying to one up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> each other's dad's, don't say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh no, my dad's the
president of Nintendo". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> No, "My dad grabs cockroaches by hand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and crushes them to death". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - My dad could beat up your dad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, my dad fucking-
- Hand grabs cockroaches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, "All right, never mind". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Your dad's number one". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking like, some
kung fu, where it's just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never seen, because
I thought, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Is this guy really gonna
catch this cockroach by hand?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because we all know how fast cockroach- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're literally, you
would literally speed wagon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> watching, like commentating-
- It was, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It was actually amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm amazed by his
sheer agility. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like, my dad
is like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When it comes to insects for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he's weirdly really lucky, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or, I don't know what the right word- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lucky? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, he told me this story, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of one time he was out in the back yard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was with his brother, my uncle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And obviously, if you're barbecuing out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the summer or whatever, in Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a fuck load of
flies everywhere, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you just, you know,
fucking brush 'em off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And my dad, he was I don't
know, teenage or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he had a knife in his hand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just a regular steak knife, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he just had it in his hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he saw a fly on the table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he just went-
(hand slams table) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he cut the fly's head cleanly in half. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he just kind of
stood there and was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your dad's a psychopath.
- I can't believe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just did that. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like some fucking Nen shit, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like, what's the
anime move where you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely remove your presence, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - His dad just pulled that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He appeared right behind
me, and I didn't notice him! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like, I have
never successfully caught </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or swatted a housefly in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever successfully
smacked a mosquito </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in your hand? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mosquito, yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mosquitoes like, they're
annoying, but it's doable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fly, it's like they have
observation hacking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They know what's coming five seconds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before it comes, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like Goku versus Frieza. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, teleporting
all over. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can't they like, avoid
bullets or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because of the way that they like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Flies?
- Yeah, because when you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when something goes near
them, the air pressure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they use it to get away.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To like, dodge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it's really interesting.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never-
- I swear I saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a YouTube video of someone
shooting a fly with a gun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can you fucking shoot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fly isn't a massive target anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Best marksman versus best fly? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube series, I don't know.
- Marksman versus fly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess, I mean-
- Sounds like a scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from an anime, right-
- I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if this is like, a fucking fever dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like, did I actually see this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I've seen this-
- Remember that one episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of "Golgo 13", where he
snipes a fly? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. (laughs)
- I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 90% of the YouTube recommended, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Did I actually watch that?"
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like I 1/4th remember
a bunch of facts and stories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "This one time
where this guy did a thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't really know". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] (laughs) I don't really know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He did a thing, and was
impressive, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something about a cube,
like you know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - A cube? (laughs)
- Something about a cube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait so, wait, what is
the worst furniture? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I was saying beds are terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I know we're going way back-
- Yeah, we're going way back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You never finished it, but-
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Beds are terrible, but
I think coffee tables, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> somehow, these small things can sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be the worst fucking things on earth, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they're like,
"Let's make coffee tables </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the most secure thing ever in existence". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Out of all the things I've built, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so for the past week I've built chairs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've built coffee tables,
cabinets, all that kind of shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The worst one by far was the Ikea chairs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, it's like four pieces. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And they just over complicate
the fuck out of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for no reason.
- Yeah, actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the worst one I built were
my table and chair set. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's because when I built it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> followed the exact instructions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you think, you screw it tight, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll just work perfectly, it's a chair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, and literally every
chair fucking wobbled. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, it was just uneven. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I spent an entire day having to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perfectly unscrew these screws </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that the chairs will balance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "Why can't
you just balance it normally?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a chair! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally, it should
just be same length, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all four chairs, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It wasn't the case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why it was a
fucking nightmare for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just like, a dick
move on the designers though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Right, they were just like,
"I'm a fuck with this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> The next guy who buys my chair". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor gags)
But like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I also agree
with you about the bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't wanna build my bed so much, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I just never got a bed! (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, what are you sleeping on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I sleep on-
- Just a mattress? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just a mattress.
- What? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait, so you don't have
a bed frame at home? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually, because, I
actually like it, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can get those like, you can (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's so ghetto! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can get the fucking, the low frames. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The ones that are literally on the floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't it also really bad for your floor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to just have a mattress on it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it?
- Doesn't it get moldy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dear God-
- Isn't that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the whole reason-
- Have you looked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> underneath your mattress?
- Isn't that the whole reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for a bed frame, is to stop
the floor from molding, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something?
- Can one of you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Google this?
- We do have like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a bed frame, but it's
one of those literally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> floor bed frames, where it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a plank of wood on the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so it's basically
just a plank of wood </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on the floor.
- That's what I was saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can get the floor bed-
- Yeah, and the reason for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was because when we moved in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we slept on a futon at
Connor's for like a week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And at first, "Sydney was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why would we sleep on the floor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Peasants sleep on the floor". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And me, being the Asian, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time I go to Thailand,
I'd always sleep on the floor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at my Grandma's place, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's something comforting
about sleeping on the floor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what it is, but I sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just realized that
whenever we go to onsens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or ryokans or whatever, you'd
sleep on the futon floors, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's futon mattresses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you just get the best night of sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have in your life, and I don't know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it might be because the tatami, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the floor, whatever
it is you're sleeping on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the hard surface, it
flattens your back out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I guess that just naturally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gives you better sleep or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I agree, I get the
best sleep in a futon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so we just decided, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why not just fucking sleep on the floor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We just got a mattress-
- But then you miss out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on the, you know when you wake up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, "Oh fuck". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Then you just kind of sit on the bed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with your legs on the floor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're just like,
"Fuck, I gotta get up". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But you're not fully awake- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you love that feeling? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I kind of like that.
- I hate that feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I don't wanna
get out of bed right away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But I wanna kind of get
up, and I wanna put my, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I wanna try to get ready, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or hype myself up to-
- Oh, for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's only two states. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's lying in the bed on my phone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or just out of bed.
- What, you never sit there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the edge of the bed, being like, "Fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've gotta get up"-
- No, I kind of realized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that I wanna spend the
least time in my bed room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as physically possible, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like you get
a better night's sleep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if your bed room is just for sleeping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I remember at my old place, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially when I started YouTube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we were working literally
with my bed next to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I would get the worst
night's sleep, every time- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I 100% agree, yeah.
- I could not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could not go in my bed
room, and just go on my bed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just go into sleep mode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I've found that once I positioned it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I would spend the least
time in my bed as possible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would get much better sleeps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my place, two places ago now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was yeah, it was the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you guys have been there before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The tiny apartment I had?
- The fucking tiny apartment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The tiny apartment-
- With the Anime Man couch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with all the plushies.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, when I was like, 18,
I probably would have thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a cool ass apartment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, when I first moved in,
it was a cool ass apartment- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you get older, you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, small"-
- But then I very quickly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> realized that if your where you work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is in the same room, or
next to where you sleep, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get the worst sleep, and
you get the worst productive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, the worst productivity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You just can't do anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's just like,
"I could just turn over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and literally walk half a meter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just sleep if I wanted to". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, how can you concentrate
in a room like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like there's
parts where I enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the fact that I
can just turn my monitor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> towards my bed and just watch shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because sometimes
watching stuff on the TV, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's really a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like, you know, on the PC, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can just get the website up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you can throw it
on the monitor, it's easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> On a TV, you've gotta fuck
around with Chromecast shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You gotta figure, "Oh,
which apps work for my TV, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which don't", you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And a PC, it's like-
- I mean, it's not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not that much-
- It's like five more minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worth of work that I don't want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And also, I used to have a
setup that I really liked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where I had like a, next
to my bed I had a keyboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a track pad on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I would just fucking,
apply to shit in my bed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then change the-
- Pretty sure that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how people get bed ridden. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I was like, getting there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was trial running. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, if I was ever bed ridden, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at least I know the system.
- At least I can work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I had it all set up, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a good system-
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but like, I feel like,
especially when I get out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of bed, I'm just like, way more awake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The problem isn't-
- Typically, when I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of my bed, I'm awake.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The problem isn't that, the problem is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing)
Getting out of the bed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the first place.
- Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, having my legs
hang off or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not gonna help me. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes the foot out
of the bed, free hanging, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a pretty good feeling though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I still haven't figured out a way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get out of bed when
it's a cold winter's day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or a cold winter morning-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why like, I'm kind
of glad now, that I moved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's starting to get warm- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank God-
- It's a lot easier now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just immediately get out of bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the inside of your mattress, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and the outside of your mattress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is pretty much the same temperature. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's not a fucking struggle,
like it is in the winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, to this day, I've
been trying to figure out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how the fuck do I get
out of bed in winter? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How do I remove the 10 Gs
of force that is created </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the wintertime, in my bed? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because yeah, every
time, I always do the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The one thing I found out is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, one limb at a time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, stick one
arm out, get that like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to room temperature, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then get the next limb
out, and then it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a slow process, right,
it's like slow loading. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, you know, when you're going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the swimming pool for the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's a really cold pool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it like, do you jump in straightaway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or would you go one limb at a time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I jump in straightaway.
- Jump in straightaway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because that's how I feel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I need to get out of bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a cold winter's night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just gotta chug a fuck ton of water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when you wake up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That shit wakes you up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You tried that-
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just get a full bottle of water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> When you wake up, just down it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I can chug a full bottle
of water in bed. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is no way you can lie back down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after chugging a full bottle of water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I 100%-
- Wait, wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Why does that work? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] A few decades ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> private citizens used to
be largely that, private. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What changed? The internet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Think about everything you've browsed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> searched for, watched, or tweeted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now imagine all that data
being crawled through, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> collected, and aggregated by third-parties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into a permanent, public record. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Your record! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Having a private life,
exposed for others to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was once something only
celebrities worried about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But in the era where everyone is online, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone is a public figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To keep my data private, when I go online, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I turn to ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Did you know there are hundreds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of data brokers out
there whose sole business </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is to buy and sell your data? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The worst part is they
don't have to tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who they're selling it
to, or get your consent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No consent, in 2021? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of these data points
is your I.P. address. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Data harvesters use your
I.P. to uniquely identify you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and your location, but you know what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with ExpressVPN, my
connection gets rerouted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through an encrypted server,
and my I.P. is masked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Every time
I turn ExpressVPN on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm given a random I.P. address, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shared by other ExpressVPN customers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That makes it more
difficult for third-parties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to identify me and harvest my data. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the best part is, is how
easy ExpressVPN is to use. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No matter what device you're on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> phone, laptop, or smart
TV, all you have to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is have one button to get protected. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So if, like me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you believe that your
data is your business, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> secure yourself with
the number one rated VPN </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> - Back to the episode.
- Baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, I don't understand
the rules of hydration, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All I know is that semi
waterboarding your organs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> wakes you up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) It puts your
(mumbles), it's like, ah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It does! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, my organs are sleeping, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, "Oh God, we're drowning! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, Jesus", and wakes up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And, you're also hydrated,
so it's a win-win. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, I do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The first thing I do when I get out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is take a piss, and then
drink a shit load of water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I drink enough fucking water as it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate morning pees, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Morning pees suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's always really strong, too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you're dehydrated.
- It's always froth as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mine isn't frothy, but-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Morning pees just suck, I
hate peeing in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it also- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mine's the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also, it just hurts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Does-
- A little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because also, no wait, wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't make a face, yeah-
- Because it's thick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but-
- What, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, because you've
been holding it in all night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, you wake up, and you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, I really need to piss". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I'm also like, "I
really wanna stay in bed". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then, the only, most the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I don't chug the water,
the thing that gets me up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is the uncomfort of needing to piss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is stronger than my want
to stay in this bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, I think it hurts, because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's supply and demand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like doing your first
lift in the gym, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It always hurts.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Right, the bladder is like,
"I haven't done anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> all day"-
- You're stalling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a man who doesn't
go to the gym. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like the first-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, because your bladder
hasn't been moving all night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then suddenly, it has to move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like, "All
right, fuck, let's do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Ah!" (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I always like,
mine are always just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> comes out easily, but I
think that's just because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I drink a fuck ton of
water before I go to bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you not get up, do you not get up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the middle of the night to pee? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just find that the time it takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the water to get in, is
the perfect amount of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me to sleep-
- (laughs) It's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> optimized.
- It's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> natural, it's just a natural (mumbles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like in the past two years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before two years ago, I
never, ever woke up to pee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Ever, and then suddenly
now, it's like genuinely, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to like, fucking, like precise, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like precisely time
when I drink water now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise I'm gonna wake
up, at like 6 A.M. to pee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I almost, that's the thing,
I almost never drink water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> before I go to bed, or
never drink anything- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this like an old age thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this an aging thing?
- What the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You're 24-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you talking about?
- Am I showing early signs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of 40 year old life? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like why is this happening? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Am I right, fellow older gentlemen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I turned 24. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The clock ticked over,
and I was like, "Shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My body's falling apart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My life is going to shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Losing my hair, I'm pissing everywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My bladder hurts all the time". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, it's like, what's going on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't catch a fucking break. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> When did my body start doing this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This never happened before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I have this really vivid memory, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is totally on tangent,
about peeing though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where, for some reason, when
I watched "Wild Wild West" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the first time-
- (laughs) Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - At 12 years old, for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was so, so proud of myself (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as an eight year old kid,
that I'd managed to sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through a whole movie without peeing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean yeah-
- I would be proud as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still can't do that.
- When you're a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> would you just piss all the time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, I mean-
- I still piss all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So is this like, a curve-
- Me and Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> are like piss machine
2,000, we piss all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Piss machine... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this a thing that happens in life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you know, when you're
a kid you have to pee a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you pee less, and
then when you get to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mid-20s, it goes back-
- No, I pee just as much now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as I did when I was eight.
- I think you were just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> getting onto like, our level now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of like, how much you pee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not fond of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I drink a lot of water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean just, look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - God, look at this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a full glass, believe it or not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a full glass of water
that I just drank. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The amount-
- You could scarcely- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The amount-
- Before I started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the sentence, it was full. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The amount of like,
the amount of fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on or off camera moments on "Trash Taste", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I'm just like talking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then my glass is just empty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I have to like, I go through- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you talking about your weird like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> side mouth drinking shit that you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughing) I'm not talking about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can I hear an explanation about that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Why do you do that?
- I have, I did not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> even know I did that.
- I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes, drinking water's boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta spice it up a little. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, you've done
this, you've done this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you've just drank
water in a funny way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're like, you're bored- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, when I was like, 10.
- Nah, I still do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I still do that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I realized,
oh, I should probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just drink it how everyone else drinks it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you very much
for the refill, Meiling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes, I did need to stay hydrated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I don't know-
- Do you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you slurp excessively? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, to like, aerate the water? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And all the flavors come out? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually don't do that,
what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm kidding-
- Like a fine wine- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Swirl it around, like a fine wine- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you ever drink water like a dog? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like-
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I did, when I was 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That moment when. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well yeah, because
actually, when you're kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, "The dog's
doing it, clearly"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I watched my cat do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Whoa, I wanna do that". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, why doesn't the
stupid dog just drink it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just pick it up.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you try it, and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is wildly inefficient. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This really feels like
there could have been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a better way of the dog"- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No wonder those motherfuckers
have been at this bowl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like five minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you telling me over
thousands of years of evolution, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the dog couldn't slurp?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A little bit, it couldn't just figure out- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just pucker his lips, mm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - These dogs have like,
near fucking echolocation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're telling me they
couldn't develop a slurp? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I could learn that shit with
a YouTube guide in 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How to slurp.
- Wikihow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wikihow.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know-
- Don't be a dog. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - How did we get onto this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, point is,
stay hydrated, weebs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's healthy for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean yeah, it is, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always just drunk
a fuck ton of water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever since I was a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is why I think, while like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of my biggest habits that I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's allowed me to stay thin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that I just don't
really like soda that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just, I'd rather drink... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, here's the thing, I hate soda </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's at full fizziness. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right.
- What the fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you talking about?
- Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're going off tangent, I only thought- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Please, please, go on-
- Tangent, the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, this is tangent, the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I only thought about
this because I saw like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> another hot takes Sydney tweet last night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh that one.
- Which was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember exactly, but it was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Flat soda is better than fizzy soda". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I turned off my
computer after I saw that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "You can't be serious". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like just, "I
don't agree with that". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I half agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I cannot for the life of me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fully enjoy fully fizzy soda. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, for me, peak soda, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I cannot drink-
- Peak soda! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This happens when
you sleep on the floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just start fucking doing weird things- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to another gone hot food take. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, peak soda for me,
is soda with ice, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you have to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you pour it on the ice-
- It gets it down- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do like a little bit watered down soda. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like, for me, Coke out of a can, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so fizzy, that you just can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand how-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It is, it is!
- Is your throat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> made out of paper? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like-
- Oh, oh it hurts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh it hurts!
- It's just fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gassy as fuck, like soda, a drink, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is meant to be refreshing-
- You can't tell me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't tell me after you down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a fully fizzy soda,
doesn't have to be Coke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just any soda, because I don't
drink Coke anymore either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But after you just open
it, and you hear that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (imitates a can of soda
opening) like sound, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you drink it down, and then you do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> massive fucking burp.
- The burp is very nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is like, the best fucking
feeling on the planet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, normally, I'm
always willing to understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> your point, Garnt, but honestly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know where
this is coming from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This is weird.
- This is coming from- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I've never
drank soda, and been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Damn, I wish this was
less carbonated". (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think all of them, because to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a drink is meant to be refreshing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why we drink it-
- But the carbonation's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's meant to be refreshing-
- The carbonation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is supposed to be refreshing! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The carbonation is not refreshing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty refreshing.
- It's not refreshing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well like, it's either
sugared-out flat ass soda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is definitely not refreshing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, I don't like flat soda. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do not like flat soda. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Flat soda is awful, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, when it's like, on ice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a bit of the fizz out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's the perfect amount
of carbonation in a soda. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why, if I drink soda,
if I want it to be refreshing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it needs a little bit of ice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just to get a bit of that
carbonation out, perfect amount. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Too long.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's what it sounds like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Who taught you this?
- This man wants to hydrate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no matter what.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just, I mean like-
- It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> soda doesn't have water in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I mean like, a
fully carbonated soda, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I'm losing
hydration by drinking that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why.
- All right, to be fair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only, I don't drink
soda anymore either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't really drank soda
in like, maybe a couple years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, every now and then,
if there's a drink bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever-
- You haven't drank soda </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a couple years?
- Sometimes, okay no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't, dead ass, I haven't
bought a bottle of Coke, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or Sprite-
- Oh, I haven't done that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - In a couple years.
- You know, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when I order at McDonald's, I have to- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I always get tea at McDonald's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to get milk, but
then I just felt like a child. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Milk? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Milk, at McDonald's?
- When the milk carton </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> would turn off, I would
get Uber Eats, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like you have to order-
- I didn't even know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could get milk at McDonald's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can get milk in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And the carton would turn up, and the guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, the Uber Eats guy-
- The milk man, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - He'd look at me like,
"Seriously, seriously? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, okay". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, here's your little milk. (giggles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, because, I don't
know if this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a tactical thing, to get
us to drink more Coke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But the just start putting
water in the package deal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was really offended by that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's literally from a tap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So why were you offended? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just go to your tap.
- Well, just sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna get the value of
a meal, like the deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I-
- Sometimes I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to support a multi-billion
dollar corporation! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna feel like I got
'em back a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, I wanna save
a little bit of money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on this rip-off, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I really like
the McDonald's fries. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I want the fries with the burger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you have to get a drink, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't really know what I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want milk either, it
just sat there on my fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I would like, I
stabbed it in the carton, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> squeezed it into my tea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Really depressingly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can get milk at McDonald's? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) Yes! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you lagging, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just agreeing, and
then I was like, "Wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That doesn't compute in my mind". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, well it's kids,
kids wanna drink milk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the golden arches M for milk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have never seen milk at McDonald's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Milk. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like, I know you can get water- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not on the fucking front of shop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like "Look, check out
our milk", it's like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no-
- We have milk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know you can get like, juice boxes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I know you can get a bottle of water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never seen anyone get milk before- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's because no one fucking-
- Yeah, no one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking orders it-
- The expiration date </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this thing must have
been 10 years past. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure they fucking dusted it off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before they put it in my
fucking Uber Eats order. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just yogurt at that point.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Probably what they're
putting into the McFlurries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had to fucking carve it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like butter when I got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like fuck it, it was so bad- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's why the fucking milkshake machines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are never working, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they just don't have enough milk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This motherfucker keeps buying our milk! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We need it for the milkshake machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how I feel whenever I buy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> my fucking tea from Starbucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "I feel like I'm
doing something wrong". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aw, I didn't even
know you could do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course you can. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you can buy tea at Starbucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who buys tea at Starbucks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, some of them are okay, actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I used to feel like,
now it's a bit more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like tea's become more mainstream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like-
- Where? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a fashion statement now- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like 10 years ago,
coffee was like, the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, everyone just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a weird thing, but in Starbucks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was all about coffee, coffee, coffee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now it's all like, everyone's chilled out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can order a fucking tea,
if you want a fucking tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that a weird statement? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like, sometimes I make a point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I know this is gonna
be a really hard battle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to not look weird-
- It's not- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just went through
that five minutes ago- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's more like, I don't
go to Starbucks enough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like, "Oh, there's a
new trend coming in here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ladies and gentlemen, it's tea now". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I just remembered that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I got mocked
when I ordered tea one time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the Starbucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, by who? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - By my classmates. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I was like, 15, I ordered a tea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like (scoffs). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - At Starbucks.
- Men drink coffee, Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, yeah-
- Men drink coffee- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like, it's more, back then, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> why would you go to Starbucks
for anything but a coffee? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] A coffee, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like, that's
what it was back then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now everyone doesn't
really give a fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can get what you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel in England especially, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get a tea, you can get
a tea fucking anywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking England. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone there drinks tea-
- I think that's what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's more like, you
could get a tea anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So why did you get it at Starbucks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, back, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> back when I worked at the BBC Euro- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There it is-
- Roll credits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Roll credits, mark
it off your bingo card- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
- Bingo! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but yeah, back when
I worked in the office, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, every so
often, with the newbies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the interns, or the graduates, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were always on tea duty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like that one
person in my entire team </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, 20, I'm just like, "Actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can I get a coffee please?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, literally everyone
around me drank tea! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what everyone drinks in England. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And all the interns scoffed at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like (scoffs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Coffee?
- Coffee? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Coffee, what's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're in England.
- The UK's weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like, most British
people don't even drink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> any other type than English Breakfast tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I think most people from the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you ask them, "I want a cup of tea", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they would not ever even
consider anything else, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> other than-
- Like they don't specify </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the type of tea, right-
- Well that's the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in the UK, if you ask for a cup of tea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're getting English Breakfast- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just a, I didn't even know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was called English Breakfast, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I just knew it was a tea- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's why we have brands, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In the UK, when you say "I want a tea", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you get the same type of tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, unless you specify, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you sit there in someone's house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, "Oh, I want a tea". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, "Oh, do you have like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> green tea, or some chai",
they'd be like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, that's-
- This guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- It's weird- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So if I came into your house in the UK- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe-
- No, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you want a
different kind of tea, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to specify.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But even then, most houses,
I don't think most houses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have other types of tea.
- So if I went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> into a house and just said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can I have some chamomile tea?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They'd be like-
- They'd probably be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Whoa"-
- Whoa, whoa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Chamomile tea, what the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] What the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We just have tea.
- I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> those types of teas are
almost like luxury teas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in the UK-
- Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because they always
come in like, fancy packaging. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like, the British type is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it comes in like, 500 pack,
because that'll last you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one month in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) Like, if you've
got a family as well... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone in your family's drinking tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So this is like, when
Americans ask me that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what kind of tea are you drinking, Connor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, well, I have a tea, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I have an afternoon tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, where you try everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You try the Earl Greys,
you try the other types. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if I'm drinking tea,
I have English Breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In the morning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, all day-
- All day, all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's called English Breakfast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it's, people just drink it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like they drink coffee, it's like a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but don't they
call it morning coffee? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, it's like
Earl Grey, or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the type of-
- It's just part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of British culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just need to chill out with a cuppa- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I realized how strange
it was, when going to America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, that's not at all how it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No.
- It's like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you say-
- Americans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't drink tea anyway.
- Well, I think they, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (sighs) they kind of do.
- I think they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But again, if you order- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But other countries-
- If you order tea- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know how I know
Americans don't drink tea? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why?
- Because, have you seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> their fucking kettles?
- That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, no culture that drinks tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is built around the fucking kettles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the Americans use. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What kind of kettles do Americans use? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, they're just these terrible things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're these awful
things that can hold like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe 500 mills, not even
enough cups for two people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In the UK-
- And you've gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> put it on the stove, right.
- Oh, those ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You put it on the stove, and as a Brit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Fucking, the
heat efficiency of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is giving me clinical depression". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
"What the fuck is this?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like-
- Yeah, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I go to someone's house in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they start doing that shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "What are you
doing, what are you doing?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Come on.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll tell you the one thing that gave me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking brain aneurism,
as someone who doesn't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> drink tea, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So-
- You don't drink tea? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't drink tea at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm mostly a coffee drinker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm mostly a coffee drinker.
- Let me tell you about tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> This thing I don't drink-
- No, no, but anyway- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tell me about the thing you don't drink- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't drink English
Breakfast tea, a lot of times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I drink green tea-
- He's a fancy motherfucker, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right here-
- Wow, Garnt- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've-
- Think you're better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than us, you think you're
better than the working man? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would say that-
- Because he worked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at the BBC.
(men laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd say the amount of
tea selection in Asia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just fucking eclipses
whatever we have in England. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have that tea.
- You just don't order it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to go to the
store manager and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Can you unlock the safe?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs)
Can you show us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the other variations of tea? (chuckles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The tea you dug up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to like, move all
the other teas in the aisle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to the back, so you can grab these things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like, you
go to a fucking konbini, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like opening Pandora's boxes of tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You've got an entire fucking selection. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And in England, like what have you got? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Lipton iced tea? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's pretty, I don't even count that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as a fucking tea.
- Well to be fair, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the konbini, in Japan, it is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Here's the 59th version of green tea". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, you literally can't make, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even actually think
it's chemically possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for there to be 59
variations of green tea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How much molecular division are we doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to these bonds here?
- It's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> leaves they picked from
like the 59th field. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's absurd, and half of
them taste the fucking same, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it doesn't matter-
- I like this tea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, I don't even
know what the fuck this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you could live
in Japan for five years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and try a new tea different
day, it's fucking easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well I've tried most of them- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you've tried
every Japanese tea, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can confirm that half of them taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly the fucking same, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was also like, in Japan
they had low fat green teas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or healthy green teas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Green tea is
healthy, what do you mean?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey giggles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are the-
- Does green tea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have calories?
- No, it doesn't- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no it doesn't.
- But there's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> healthier versions-
- (laughs) Low calorie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> green tea, what the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was like-
- Negative calorie green tea- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like, good health green tea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Green tea
is, I actually think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the healthiest
teas of all the teas". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what have they
done to the other teas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Guys, I can do one better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got an idea, zero calorie water- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shut the fuck up.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - By drinking it, you lose calories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I just, going
back to the whole thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just get very amazed, that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because Americans are always asking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people from other countries
like, "What tea do you drink?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, "I drink
Earl Grey, I drink this", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, no, no, no, in the
UK, it's not like that at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, that's not how it works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you sure that's not
like, just your household? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, it's all of the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go anywhere, you want
a cup of tea, you get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, no matter where you go-
- Yeah, it's only in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where if you say tea, it
means one type of tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just always thought, that's tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Every other tea it's just
like the branded tea, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess it's the same in Japan as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you go to someone's household, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you ask for ocha, which is tea, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you usually get green
tea unless you specify. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the default skin in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's also weird, like the
lengths the British will go to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to bring tea with them, or
have a cup of tea available. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever you go camping, or
on an expedition or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember there was a
guy, from when we did like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Duke of Edinburgh, who, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he drove a car around to keep up with us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in this thing, there was this whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> massive hot water tank, just for tea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that we could all have tea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't think that was weird- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - On Duke of Edinburgh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, so we could
all have a cup of tea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when we were done at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because that's, the British people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how you signify the work is down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, work is done-
- Also, whenever we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> went paintballing in the
UK, or anything like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during the break, you get tea.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It'd be like, you'd be
like fucking warfare, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they'd be like, "Stop, chaps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Time for the tea break".
- Tea break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you'd go for a tea break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) And now that I
think about this out loud- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so weird.
- But I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, we go to like, no matter
what you're doing in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> someone is gonna try and
put a cup of tea available. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The stereotype is totally true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is totally true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, the best analogy I can think of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that to Britons, to Brits, a cup of tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like the equivalent to
a cigarette break, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just an excuse to put on the kettle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drink a bunch of tea and just
chill out for five minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we have those in Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't have tea breaks, we have smokos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Smokos.
- Yeah, smokos- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Two shots of vodka, and
send you back to work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are we allowed a smoko? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, let's go.
- Getting back to why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I know Americans don't drink tea, right- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kettles are shit.
- Yeah, one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kettles are shit, two, like okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I remember I was staying with Sydney, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she had a little bit of a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or someone had a sore throat, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we just needed some warm water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, and so, how would
you make warm water? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Boil it in a kettle-
- Boil it in a kettle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then put, you know,
put the hot water in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just fill it with cold water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, Sydney takes the mug,
and fills it up with water- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know what you're gonna say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Puts it in the microwave-
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I knew it was coming.
- Puts it in the microwave, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and puts on a counter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "What
are you doing, Sydney?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I'm getting a brain aneurism, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just watching this right now-
- That's horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's horrible.
- And I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "There's no way this is normal". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no way this is fucking normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, she says, "No,
it's a normal thing here". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "Bet". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I tweet, I'm just like, "Americans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is this a normal thing to do?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the amount of like, "What's wrong? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you heat up your water?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How is this?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How have we gone through
thousands of years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of civilization, to heat
up water in a microwave? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna do my
obligatory insult Americans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this podcast.
- Mark that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off the bingo-
- Mark off the bingo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Americans literally think the microwave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is the tool from God.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It can just-
- Do everything, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do everything, fuck. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Kitchen Nightmares" has taught me that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding, it's totally
reality obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, recently I
abandoned my kettle in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I got rid of it.
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it was, you know,
British kettles are intense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like-
- (snorts) How so? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, when we
boil kettles in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's done in what, like one minute? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Two minutes max. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a shit kettle, if
it's any longer than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You won't get, even the
shittiest of kettles don't take, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, the worst kettles
you find are in hotels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, you put the water on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you come back 40 minutes
later, shit's still boiling, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making the world's loudest sound somehow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men imitating bubbling water) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, how is this the shittiest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a chain, surely
you could have got a deal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the manufacture to
get a not shit kettle- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Half the water's evaporated by the time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally, it's gone
by the time you fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what, you've got fucking
200 milliliters of water? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, not even fills up the cup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's absolutely abysmal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like wasted half the fucking hotel's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> electricity as well,
it's fucking dreadful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But, in Japan as well,
they have the same thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and in America it's the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The kettles take so God damn long to boil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're so shit, I got so tired of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm streaming, between games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna be waiting
for like, five minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly.
- I'm streaming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't sit there and wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I found, Japan has
these things that I've, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again, I've never seen these before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But they're just like,
they have them in konbinis, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's a boiling water jug. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I know the ones- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, well you can fill the ramen up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yes, yes, yes-
- The ones where you like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can pour it, right?
- It's like a two liter jug, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever, you fill it up with water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it boils it,
or it doesn't boil it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You can choose the temperature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, and it's just always hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's always hot, and I
think it uses less electricity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> than constantly reboiling a kettle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I felt so big brain, because now- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just have hot water ready- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally, I can just go to the thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put the bag in, boom, hot water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Shit"-
- Because that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what every Asian uses for cup ramen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the cup ramen
machine, and tea machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like, "Shit,
maybe kettles are obsolete". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe this is the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goodbye, kettles.
- I was kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Shit, a kettle has been
the first appliance I buy- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd never thought about it like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I've seen that
all the time in Asia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Because that's just readily available, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever I come to Thailand, holy shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, that's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is more efficient than-
- It's so much more efficient. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And you literally have it ready. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But anything's better than
a fucking microwave, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Please don't do that, stop it, get help! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, you know, it's called
Sixth Form in the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I forgot what it's called in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There was a guy, and we like
a microwave and a kettle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in our dorm room, or chill
room, it was for like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your tea is there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this guy was like,
"You want a cup of tea?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I'll have a cup of tea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You won't believe this, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He puts water in the
cup, puts the tea bag in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then puts it in the microwave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) Oh my, I'm about to fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm about to fucking leave right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The entire tea bag?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, he pours the water, cold, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the cup with the tea bag, cold- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
- Lets it like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stew, and then puts it in the microwave, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and heats it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I've never seen anyone else do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Who taught you this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, someone had to teach you this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because no one else would ever do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "I bet his
fucking parents are freaks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What else do they do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do they like, fucking eat their toenails? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what else is going
on in this household". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you can't trust them
when they do that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the family was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Let's make some tea", and it's cold- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I-
- And then one day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they discovered, people drink tea hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I realized, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Shit, this is the most
British thing ever". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because he got shit for it,
for like a year and a half. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you could be an American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and get shit-
- He literally got bullied </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a year and a half
for making tea wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Isn't that the most British
thing you've ever heard? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well deserved, if you ask me- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And honestly, he had it coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus Christ.
- Honestly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know that fucking meme, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where if aliens ever invaded humanity, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and they have to blend in with the crowd? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the kind of shit
we would look out for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like, "Oh, you're a
fucking imposter, aren't ya"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I too make tea, human.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like the most alien move ever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Cup of tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, there's nothing more British </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than being like, very
possessive over our tea, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and being very protective over our tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did I tell you about
the shittiest cup of tea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> my brother ever made me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He made two of them,
he made two of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, and this is the problem, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you kind of do it half right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then fuck up one step,
is that it looks good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it smells good, it looks as it should. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So the first time he did it for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I asked him to make me a cup of tea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he reluctantly said yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can't remember how I convinced him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because he would never
do anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's a brother, he never
does anything nice for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Must have been in a good mood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I must have done something right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So he makes me a cup of
tea, and I'm drinking it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Mm", and I get to the end, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like, (spitting loudly). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He fucking ripped the bag open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (men cracking up) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He thought, because he'd never
made a cup of tea before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So assumed the bag was like-
- What's all this shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this bag? (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Rip.
- Because, I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think what happened was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that he'd had instant coffee before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right-
- And he thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he thought it looked like instant coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So he thought that you rip the bag open, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pour in the perfectly
portioned instant tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, (laughs) he stirred it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I get to the end of
this, and I'm fucking choking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on these shitty tea leaves! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I scolded him, I
never let him forget it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then again, like a year or two later, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he makes me another cup of tea, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How can you fuck up a
cup of tea more than once? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right, this is it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So this was actually at
the paintballing place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I remember this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Doing your tea break-
- Literally fucking freezing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right, we're covered in mud. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Oh, I just
want a good cup of tea". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, because my little brother, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> some of his friends are my friends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "You're on the tea duty". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he goes to make a cup
of tea for me and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> six other people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I swear, it must have been like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, it was like some kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cult poisoning-esque thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, we'd all drink our tea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and when we get to the bottom,
he fucking left the bag in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He put the milk in, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can't see the bag-
- You can't see the bag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, when you get to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it fucking tea fucking
bag hit me in the face! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You literally got tea bagged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got fucking, the tea bag
hit me in the god damn face! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, "What the fuck!"
- Ah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "You're British,
you're 15 years of age, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you have no excuse, this
should never have happened". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Literally, there should have
been things to stop this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Isn't this what school is for? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of all the different ways
you could have fucked up tea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he did all of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretty he could be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exiled from England for doing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right!
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure a lot of British people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would kick you out of their house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you made their tea like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably why Brexit happened, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "Fucking
Europeans can't make a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> cup of tea", out.
- Gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Boys, you look like you need a shave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thank God Harry's is
sponsoring us, am I right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] With Harry's,
you don't need to choose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between having a great
shave and a fair price. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn right.
- Neither should any guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in their life, especially Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And with Father's day
right around the corner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's never been a
better time to try or share </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the Harry's experience.
- Thank you dad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me tell you about the time
when I used Harry's (laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's okay, son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know we're no
strangers to memeing here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this is legitimately a good razor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I use it, and I keep asking them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to send me more, personally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's actually that good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I highly recommend it,
and it lasts a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just, no bull shit, no cap.
- No cap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you very much, son. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you father, back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am curious though, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, what's the one sign you look for, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to know that you're
talking to a true Aussie? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because for us Brits, it
all revolves around tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's Australia patriotic about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughs) That's a
good question, because- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many cockroaches have you eaten? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many, do you spray? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Not a true Aussie. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I'm not very patriotic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So-
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I was like,
England's not very patriotic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But when it comes to tea, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, we're fucking
patriotic as fuck over our- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are we not patriotic? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like, I don't
know, I've met a lot of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, not to say-
- Way too patriotic people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I mean, not to say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't love my country or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, I don't know, I just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess maybe (sighs), God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's hard with Australia, because I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's such a melting pot
of different cultures, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that all of my friends in high school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had something specific about their family </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that made it very distinctively Aussie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I'd say like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe the type of beer you drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The type of what?
- I drink real, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Australian beer.
- Oh, the type of beer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fosters.
- Yeah, if you say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fosters, then you are getting
exiled from Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, and then I guess like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what you order at a pub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know-
- Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't really have-
- This sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the "40 Year Old Virgin" scene, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where he's describing how
it feels to feel a boob. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it's just like,
not even remotely real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, Joey'd be like,
"It's the type of beer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they order"-
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just throwing guesses out there- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Feels like a bag of sand! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Bag of sand, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love that fucking scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking brilliant scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you get that reference,
that'll make a lot of sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If you don't, it'll make no fucking sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go watch the "40 Year Old Virgin". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you haven't, watch
that film, it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, like-
- You're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like you're-
- With Aussies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just, you start talking to them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you kind of get a sense of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right, like you just know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know how much of
an Aussie an Aussie is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with the way that they
interact in conversation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the way that you get
immediately close to them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I feel that as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For me, whenever I meet an Aussie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have this thing where
it's like, the CPM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you know-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Music has beats per minute? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, when you talk to an Aussie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have cunts per minute-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Where (laughs)-
- I'm so confused. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, cost per million? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, like the amount of
times they use the C-word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a single sentence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You can fucking count that shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) and put it as
a CPM, I swear to God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is true, that is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what your
typing words per minute is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna know what your CPM is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, what's your CPM? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, that is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We call our mates C-word,
and we call C-words mates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how it works in Australia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] That's exactly how it works! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you see a friend
from across the street, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you want to call out to them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd be like, "Oy, cunt". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you bump into someone at a pub, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd be like, "Oy, mate?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like, if you hear
an Aussie doing that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a true Aussie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If they're not afraid to say the C-word. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Going back to like, the
fucking bugs and spiders, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as someone who did grow up in Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the shit you've seen,
do they scare you at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or are you just unfazed by them now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm only scared if
I know it's poisonous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, there was this insect, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so on "Journey Across
Japan", talked about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a couple of episodes ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we went into this
area, where there was a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of creepy crawlies, and Chris was not okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with any of the creepy crawlies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> The trooper he is, he's not
okay with any creepy crawlies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was this one
particular insect that I saw, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which, I mean you'll see
it hopefully in the episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it comes out, but the
only way I can describe it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it looks like a centipede
and a cockroach had a baby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It moves around like a cockroach, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's kind of got
the body of a centipede. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is like, true nightmare fuel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even know,
Moona, I don't even know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you wanna like, put
the image on the screen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever, but like, yeah it's horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like, I saw that in this little area. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Chris obviously freaked the fuck out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was freaking out,
because I didn't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think there's
a breed of centipede </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japan that's poisonous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I-
- Aren't all centipedes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> poisonous?
- Not all of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- No, some of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what my dad said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure they're edible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are they?
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure they are-
- Fantastic source of protein. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure
cockroaches are edible too, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't wanna eat them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll give it to my dad. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I love the food
on "Kitchen Nightmares", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because it always comes free with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, I didn't know
if that was the breed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of poisonous centipede. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's what was freaking me out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Was like, if this thing is
poisonous, then I'm scared. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey's like, "Get out
the fucking Pokedexes"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I legitimately said-
- Does this look like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a poison type?
- I literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the spot, I looked it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Poisonous centipede, Japan". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I looked it up, and I referenced it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Okay, it's not it". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the filtered version,
with the nice one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're looking at it like, "Fuck". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Expectations versus reality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's got like, a mad
filter on it here dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck it's-
- Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, because you know,
obviously because there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lots of creepy crawlies
and shit in Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, the reason why
I'm scared of a lot of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is because a lot of them can kill me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean-
- And I'm not okay with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, I don't like bugs at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm frankly quite terrified of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But, I'll deal with them still. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's, you know-
- That's admirable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's manly.
- Yeah, that's admirable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Admitting that you're a little bitch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then dealing with it
anyway, that's real men. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, if I know it's not
poisonous, I'll fucking touch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, at what point
do you see an insect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or creepy crawly-
- I don't get scared </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by any singular insect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, the thing
that terrifies me most- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Collections of insects?
- Is like, swarms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well yeah.
- Well, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like-
- No one's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hell yeah".
- But okay, okay- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, swarms of anything
terrifies the fuck out of me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, there was a video, and it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "South Australian farm gets
overrun by a horde of mice". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of mice?
- I shit you not, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked like the floor was moving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There were so many mice
running, it was terrifying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And if I'm seeing that,
that's my farm, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, I'm out of a job,
have it, it's yours". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Guess I'll die.
- It's your farm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like there are
so many stories I hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from just talking to Australians, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm just like, "How much did God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just hate Australia, and yet people still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have found a way to live there?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, to be fair, my
place, my parents' place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is like, our backyard is
right next to a national park. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So our house is basically just
a house for creepy crawlies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like the first destination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, we got snakes and
spiders all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But after a while, we're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, we do live right
in the fucking bush, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so whatever-
- I always wondered, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is there, was there an old Medieval method </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of determining what's poisonous or not? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or would they just give it to some poor- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trial by fire, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it really just-
- I've always thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this, like-
- They must have had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just one rich guy who was
like, "Well, random bunch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the people who"-
- Yeah, how do you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people discovered what
mushrooms were poisonous? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't that tragic though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just like, "Oh hi, what's your job? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well I'm a poison tester. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm three for three at the moment". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you know-
- Hoping tomorrow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will go well.
- But do you know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> blows my mind, how the fuck
did like, people in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> figure out which part of the
puffer fish wasn't poisonous? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like-
- Also why- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many people had to die
to know the exact methods- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But why also, did someone
die, they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "We're gonna try it again". (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - One more time.
- Guys, guys, guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're 100 to zero on the
puffer fish right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe, maybe this one time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There has to be somewhere
on this thing that's edible, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- I just feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after you find out something is poisonous, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's okay to give
up, and not eat it, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it-
- It's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We gotta make sure, the
last guy might have had like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> side effects that he had beforehand"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you had their puffer fish? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, couple times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've heard it's very underwhelming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not great.
- Listen, if I'm gonna die, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I want it to be nut worthy, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I want the risk
to be worth the reward. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it just looks like
really shitty sushi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Not sushi, what's-
- What does it even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> taste like?
- Nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) That's what I've heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It actually tastes like nothing- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I've heard, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just grown men wanting to die. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- No, it's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just a status symbol. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's to just say that
you've had a puffer fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I've seen the videos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "This just looks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're eating fucking
cardboard", you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't look like
you're eating anything- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, you do know
what it tastes like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The soy sauce that you dip it in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what it tastes like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love unagi. Unagi is one
of my favorite Japanese dishes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I found out on Saturday, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you cook it incorrectly,
it's fucking poisonous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one told me that.
- Is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why it's so expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's poisonous as fuck. It can kill you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I'll fucking risk it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's one thing I will risk! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it fucking slaps.
- And then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "The element of
danger adds to the taste now". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Frankly, but if it's
not very good tasting- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like that's why a lot of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat puffer fish as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, the element of
danger adds to the taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whatever taste-
- Why does everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just wanna die? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Do you reckon
there's a guy out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who's just like, "God, kill me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I hope it's this time around". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm pretty sure that's whoever like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I get it, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you know when you
see poisonous berries? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- I still really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanna try them, because
they look so delicious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you?
- Yeah, because in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's so many poisonous berries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is there?
- That's how nature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucks with you, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the ones that look the most delicious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that'll kill you.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because those bright little red things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, you see them everywhere- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah! (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That look so fucking
delicious when you're a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They look like mini tomatoes, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanna have a,
mm, get a bunch of those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and see what happens, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Just see what happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - See what happens.
- That's probably how, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's probably how people found out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were poisonous, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, let's say, you know,
you haven't got much food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, you're struggling, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have a wander through the forest, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see a bunch of, you see a bush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Enough food for the family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
- Enough food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to kill the family!
- Nobody told you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're poisonous, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like also, who got poisoned
by mushrooms, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "No, no, no, no, it must just
be this type of mushroom". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And goes out, and tries another one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like, a very bold thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like who's doing this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, someone had to, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone did it back in the day- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm convinced it must have been people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with too much money being
like, "I will literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pay you $1,000"-
- Probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, when's the "Mr.
Beast" video coming out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where he's like, "I pay people
$100,000 to try mushrooms, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to find out which one's poisonous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How much shiitake mushroom will kill you?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eat mushrooms, last one to
survive wins a million dollars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, if you want people to do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just make it a fucking
TikTok challenge, yeah? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "So I found this
mushroom in my cupboard". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - TikTok mushroom challenge, let's go- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The deathcap challenge.
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Today I'm eating a deathcap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Hope I survive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I would rather try my luck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating a poisonous mushroom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just try my chance at surviving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> as opposed to putting my hand
on my iPhone for four days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, for that keep
your hand on the iPhone? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, that one, that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I would rather
poison myself than do that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for four days, that
sounds fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know.
- I'm sure the pain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be over with in two days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you just get to go to the
hospital, get it all sorted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, get slight arthritis,
and you'll be all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if it's not a bad one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I'm sure there's
mushrooms out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that just make you like, very much vomit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, probably.
- I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what-
- Which one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would you rather, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Would you rather vomit
profusely for like, four hours? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Or would you rather put
your hand on an iPhone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for four hours and you can't sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you mean for four days? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Four days, four days,
yeah not four hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's very easy.
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no!
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Four hours.
- Four hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Listen, have you ever tried
to stay up past one day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude like, how long is the
longest you've stayed up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, a day and a half.
- Me, for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like 36 hours.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 36 hours for me-
- And that's where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it starts to get like, fucking weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, your brain starts to
want to turn off desperately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, and I feel like by the third day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what on earth is going through your head? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I couldn't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why I would just
rather eat the fucking mushroom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that might poison me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Meiling, can you Google that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is there any mushrooms
that'll just make me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> throw up a little bit?
- Like a little? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like not kill me, but like-
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) Is this an option? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna make sure.
- Is this an option? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Is this DLC?
- I'll only start playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with fair rules here.
- In this line, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean I wouldn't want
to do either, personally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But personally, both sounds like hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Listen, someone's come up with it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they'll be like, "Now
it's the mushroom cleanse". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You know-
- The mushroom cleanse! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This mushroom will detox your body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, because it's making
you fucking lose it all! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what they're doing, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god.
- Muscarine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Muscarine.
- Muscarine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What does it make you do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilin] For I guess,
after 15, 30 minutes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll start getting diarrhea
and decreased blood pressure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh wow-
- That sounds pretty bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds-
- That sounds pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilin] Severe vomiting, but
you recover within 24 hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, that's good then.
- Brilliant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What was it called again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilin] Muscaria? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Muscary challenge.
- Muscary challenge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've got 50 reasons we
are joking, this is a joke, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this I not real.
- For legal reasons, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a joke.
- We are joking around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Please don't do that.
- That's only 10% less deadly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than the cinnamon challenge,
so really, it's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Makes you wonder how
that was ever allowed- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - God, remember the
fucking cinnamon challenge? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you guys ever do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never done any, the
only challenge I've done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like, the ice bucket challenge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I did the ice bucket challenge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like-
- That was for a good cause. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that was for a good cause. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, it's pretty tame-
- Easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like, breathe
oxygen for 20 minute challenge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Well I guess I'll"... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you get mild
discomfort for like, a second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the ice bucket challenge, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got tagged on it,
I never did it though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I was feeling quite lazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't wanna get a bucket. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't wanna get a, where
do you get a bucket big enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're like, 15? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know-
- Borrow from your dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - From, did your house not have one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably somewhere, I
just didn't wanna find it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just like a mop and bucket, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Every house has a-
- Or just get like a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a fucking mop bucket over my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or just get a big pot.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what some of my friends did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well I mean, perhaps when I was 15, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I should have been... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I wasn't too
fond on doing it anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was a kid, so-
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh, I don't
have a bucket, oh fuck"- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate charity, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well no, that's the thing though! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Shit like this, it's always like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what is me, a 15 year
old kid on my Facebook </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with 200 friends, what is this gonna help? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, this was pre YouTube wasn't it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was pre YouTube.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No it wasn't.
- For Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, for you, yeah.
- This was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was high school, when
this was just coming out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just thought, really silly Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you gonna contribute here, huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Little bit of an ego boost for that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in taking part in something, huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, just do it with your mates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Come on, what are you fucking helping? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not doing this for charity, Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're doing this because
your friend tagged you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly.
- Can't even get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the clout from it.
- What's the point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why donate to charity, when
you can't get clout for it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well no, when I was 15, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 15 year olds that donate to charity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like the biggest dick 15 year olds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "I've got
like, 10 bucks, have it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have, I don't even, I could
have bought something good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with this". (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughs) Like I feel
like, I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> When I was 15, I probably didn't
give any money to charity, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't have any-
- Well yeah, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, most of us didn't have any money- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I did, though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like, when my mum gave me a pound. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And she was like, you
know when it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're in school
- Oh, the old clothes day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Old clothes day, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd give a pound, and be
like, "It's on me, it's on me". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> God.
- This is not from my mom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guys, guys, don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll break out the-
- We all got this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from our parents, right?
- Yeah, I got change, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just what I hated doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I wish there was
some kind of system where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why do I gotta be the
messenger for my mom's money? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey snorts)
Why do I gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bring this shit in?
- What do you mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the messenger?
- Like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surely, can't you collect
this shit from my parents? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Why do I have to bring
in money from my parents? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, and-
- It's a pound. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not carrying a
fucking briefcase of cash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd just spend it, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I just (laughs), I never did, actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I knew people in my school
who'd just fucking spend it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there was plenty of good places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> In my town, there's a thing
called a pound bakery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm-hmm.
- Did you ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have one of these?
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bregs?
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's even cheaper than Bregs.
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could get two pasties for a pound. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck's a pastie? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, a pastie is a
very British thing as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've realized this after moving out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't know what a pastie is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a pastry? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well yeah-
- Kind of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pastry, but it's got
like, there's a lot of meat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> inside of it-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got some meat, potatoes.
- So, let me tell you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the most popular fillings for pasties- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, yeah-
- Cheese and onion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is a bunch of cheese and onion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like okay, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a beef pastie as well, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a kidney and-
- Kidney... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kidney and steak?
- Yeah, yeah- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a pie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of, kind of but-
- Pastry- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - More pastry-
- I'm not a big fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of pies, pies are a little
too thick, the crust. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're really popular-
- Like a sausage roll? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's always there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's always one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's not really a,
that's a sausage roll- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah yeah.
- And there'd be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my personal favorite was the
sausage, bean and cheese melt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is just sausage, beans and cheese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> shoved into a pastry-
- And melted, I assume. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably the closest thing you'd get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not like, in terms of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cultural importance as like, an onigiri. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, a pastie is just
like a British onigiri. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the British (laughs)-
- It is, isn't it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It is! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just like, realized that
as we were talking about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The reason why it
became popular is because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when they'd like, because
obviously coal mining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was a massive thing in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that they needed food
that wouldn't go bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they would literally put
these things in their pockets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh-
- And they would just eat them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the mines.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And for some reason, we
decided that that was just great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We should just-
- Now it's your onigiri, now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) Yeah, it's
the British onigiri. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck jelly donuts! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you take two pastries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which pastries are pretty
fucking filling things, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for one pound, and I was like,
"Holy shit, this is insane". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's pretty good.
- Yeah, two- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they taste good, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're really good shit.
- Oh shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How were your school
dinners back in the day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking dreadful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
I'd rather eat the mushroom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that Meilin pulled up.
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was absolutely terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The only thing that was
good was like, toast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason, tastes
really good at school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And always, toast, did you ever have this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the toast taste different? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, wildly different wherever you go? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, it's the type
of bread they use, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, it's not even like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like, toast doesn't
even taste remotely the same- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because toast here
tastes completely different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to anywhere else.
- Yeah, but as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you make toast at home, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it has a completely different taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to when you get toast at a restaurant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's wildly different, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't even taste like toast- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, back in the day,
like fucking school dinners </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were kind of like prison
food, almost, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd go in the fucking cafeteria, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there was always these, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the lunch ladies, they'd
always look depressed as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you'd come in with your tray, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of just felt like
you were in prison. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We didn't even have that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We just had a cafeteria, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like we called it a tuck shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A tuck shop, right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You guys have tuck shops, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- What's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck is a tuck shop? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now that's a very Australian
thing, I just realized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, a tuck shop
in Australian schools, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is basically this booth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can go and just buy food items. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right.
- It's not even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a cafeteria, it's not even a room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a stall?
- It's like a stall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Basically, because our schools didn't... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of schools in Australia, I think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't really have full-on cafeterias, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because none of them are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big enough to have full-on cafeterias. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, the only experience of cafeterias </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I ever had as a kid, was
watching the "Simpsons". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - (laughs) Okay.
- Like that was the closest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I ever got to a school cafeteria. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like-
- Australian schools- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are no schools, I
didn't know a single school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in my area, or in Australia
at all, that had that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, school lunch in the cafeteria- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This sub guy just
fucking drops off some shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in his truck.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here you fucking go, kids.
- Yeah, go for it kids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - How about some fucking sausages? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Here you go.
- Yeah, you literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just go to like, a stall kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there'd be like, a canteen lady there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the cafeteria lady. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like, you just buy stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just like, smooth talk them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Or I used to always be
really, really fucking nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to the cafeteria ladies, so
they'd give me extra food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, and
whenever my friends' mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was the cafeteria lady, I'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, come on, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me in, let me in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Give me some of the back stock there". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would, no joke, I would literally be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd be like, "That food was
amazing, that was fantastic". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Seriously?
- Yeah! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Because-
- Compliments to the chef. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I would literally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I would always go back, I'd be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Thank you so much, that was
great, that was fantastic". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, right-
- Did the give you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> anything for it?
- Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> After a while of doing this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they would like, make
specialized things for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow.
- Because I would always, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> my mates gave me so much shit for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because they're like, "Why are you fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sucking up to them", I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well look at my fucking meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm eating like a king
today. Enjoy your slop." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They custom made the shit-
- Custom made! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's off this fucking line, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're like, "Yo, Connor's rolling in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Bring out the good shit".
- Bring out the good shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bring out the-
- Bring out the three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> course meal.
- They're about to serve me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the other one's like,
"No, stop, it's Connor". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you know who this man is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's distinction! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, so they used to make like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so this is again, a really
fucking British thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Jacket potatoes, you ever heard of this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jacket potatoes?
- Yeah, I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jacket potatoes.
- Literally just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a potato. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a potato-
- With butter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You stab it a bunch, maybe
you cut it open a little. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You put butter in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Baked potato.
- Oh, baked potato. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> All right.
- You wrap it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's called jacket potato in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just potato with butter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they would just give
it to you, like just there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, come on,
I'm better than this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "I know
you've got some chuter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the back, there, I know
you've got some beans and cheese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you put that shit all over it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So they would make like, normally
you'd get a jacket potato, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but, because I was very nice to them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they would put like, tuna in there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which I fucking love,
beans and cheese as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I would rock up like, "Yeah, boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm eating like a king today". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was very good.
- You literally just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> James Bond that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You come up being like, "Connor?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, the reason why I did
it is because I realized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that one of the other kids,
who was way older than me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got a bunch of really, it
looked like he always had, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like everyone else's
tray was peasant tray, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this guy always had
a stacked fucking tay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "What is this guy doing?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like, they don't
give you extra if you ask. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They just laugh at you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, "Oh fuck, what's he doing?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I watched him, and he was just
like, smooth talking them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just saying like, thank you a bunch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who knows, all we had to
do was just say thank you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and be nice, and say a few words to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they'd give you more.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was the best part
of the school dinner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you remember? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like I know
what you're gonna say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what reminds me of this- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you gonna say like,
turkey Twizzlers or some shit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What reminded me of this
was because we went to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a local bar near us, and it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know how to
describe what the theme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of this bar is, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's this bar that we go to that has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just, the most random assortment of foods </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you could think of.
- It's all good though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all good, it's all great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so we order this, I can't
remember what we ordered. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But we ordered some dish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And what comes out is the
fucking smiley potato chips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love those things! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They taste so god damn good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I can't remember
what dish we ordered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember we came, it came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, the three of
us just reverted back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to being like, seven years old. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Being like, "Oh!"
- Oh! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sweet potato chips! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is what it looks
like, if you didn't have it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wherever you grew up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's basically just the Funimation logo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Funimation logo with eyes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird, because it has
a taste that is so unique. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's not fries-
- God damn good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not fries, it's not potatoes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just got such a unique taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm sure anyone who
didn't grow up with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would think it tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could be a billionaire,
and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Charles, heat up the
smiley faces, won't you?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) Bring in the smiley faces. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ever since I saw those
at that restaurant, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been trying to find them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, they're so good! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, I can't find them anywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Because they don't sell
them in supermarkets- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've gotta ask, what's your source? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "Wait" (laughs)- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who's your-
- Where'd you source these? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I, it's so bizarre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the restaurant,
I wouldn't call it posh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's like-
- The decor is extremely nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Very, I'd say-
- Very homely, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's very nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not-
- Bouquets everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are fresh bouquets.
- So I just laughed, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because they bring out this dish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they were just probably like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is imported potato
from Britain, enjoy lads". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just thinking here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is just school dinner
chips right here, man". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is 10 cents apiece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like currency
in elementary school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well yeah, those were
the one things I remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, that was universal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In every school dinner
we had it in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every kid remembers the smiley chips- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dead ass in primary
school, it was like currency. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you would trade other
food items with people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for smiley-
- Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's phased out now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because school dinners, from
what I've heard in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are a lot more healthy
than they used to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really?
- And that's because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you know Jamie Oliver?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I think back-
- Man is on a crusade. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For like, healthy school dinners. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And apparently it worked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm jealous, because I've seen
some of the school dinners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that kids get nowadays, and
man, they be eating good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They be eating, they're
getting like a fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three course meal with roast
chicken and all that shit- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck?
- I'm just like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, the fanciest thing
I had in my cafeteria was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a chicken tender roll. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah-
- Which is literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a bun with two chicken tenders in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> $4 (laughs).
- Does anyone remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bringing your own lunch? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I always did.
- Packed lunch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's what I
used to do for a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember why,
because I had school lunches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I had packed lunch for sometime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't remember why I didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I remember, I used to trade. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you ever trade stuff
with the other kids? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Because your mum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put stuff in your box, and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, it's not that I don't like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but that guy likes this
thing, and I wanna trade". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I always did-
- I remember I used </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to trade Kit Kat for cheese strings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I like cheese string-
- Oh, cheese string! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember cheese string-
- That's the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you like, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I'm not being funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously, I love Kit Kats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But frankly, eating a
cheese string as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is probably one of the
most enjoyable things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, of course.
- You know, still to this day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I still really enjoy the process
of eating a cheese string. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's very satisfying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I traded, always I traded my Kit Kat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for this kid's cheese string. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - (snorts) Why didn't
you just ask your mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to get cheese strings?
- Well because I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is gonna be big brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think actually, that the cheese string's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> actually more expensive.
- Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Than the Kit Kats, and
the packs of Kit Kats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were pretty cheap-
- That makes sense, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they were like the
branded cheese strings as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh-
- They were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the cheese strings.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I told my mom, I felt like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never saw her like, weirdly
upset about something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Mum, why
are you upset about me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trading cheese strings?" She was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You could have told me,
why didn't you tell me?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I didn't
think it was a big deal! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm out here hustling, mom, it's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I got, it's fine, don't worry about it"- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's like, "You think we
can't afford cheese strings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this house?"
- Wait, you told me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't like cheese string, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I like the hustle, it's fun, okay! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like trading, I like it"-
- I'm a businessman, mom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Mom, I read "Art of the Deal". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, let me be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I liked it, it was fun scouting out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what everyone else had, and you'd be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Trade? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Trade offer?"
- Trade offer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would go up to the kids
and be like, "Trade offer"- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I receive cheese string. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I receive-
- You receive Kit Kat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would, I don't know, as a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason, I didn't have any qualms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about going up to a kid and
being like, "I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We should trade, what do you think?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel the only time you can do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's not weird, is when you're a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then sometimes kid would be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like they didn't,
they wanted the trade, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but they were skeptical as
to why I wanted to trade. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's wrong with it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What did you do to the Kit Kat? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just want it, like, mm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't know, Conner, you've
got a reputation for hustling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know about that".
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll tell you, the kid
I was always jealous of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were the kids that had
the Dairylea Lunchables. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because that looked so fun! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, Dairylea Lunchables. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically like
Build-A-Bear, but for lunch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've had a Lunchable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had a Lunchable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, it's-
- It's the pack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that comes with like, the
biscuit, the cheese, and the ham. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yes, yes, yes-
- You put up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> your own like, little sandwich. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yep, yep.
- I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As a kid, that just seemed so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it is.
- But it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> expensive as fuck for a kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Those kids were eating good.
- That thing had like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> negative nutrition I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pretty sure it actively
took it out of your body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Also, you know Lunchables, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if its the same brand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was Dairylea, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They do like, the dairy
dunkers, did you like those? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, what were they again?
- Oh was that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the chocolate sauce ones? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They did have chocolate sauce. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was like-
- Oh, the cheese sauce one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was cheese sauce ones,
which I really fucking love. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right.
- They were, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think originally, they were chocolate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it was like a biscuit,
bread kind of thing- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like a biscuit, like
half a biscuit breadsticks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the other half's like, chocolate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah-
- We had those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, we had those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and then they
had a cheese version. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, they had this one- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never heard of the cheese version. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was pretty popular in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- I loved, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking loved those things as a kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucking put those away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, I was eating
them up until like, age 21. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they had a version where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like some herb stick or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I really fucking loved it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like legit eating it until 21. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they changed the
recipe, and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You've lost a longtime"-
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It actually tasted like shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I don't know what happened". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow.
- I wanted to email HQ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, "How fucking dead"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you change the flavor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you change the recipe?
- Tell me changed the flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tell me my taste buds haven't changed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This tasted like shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You guys ever had a food
product later in life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you just like,
couldn't believe that you'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> waited this long in life before you'd had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this one food product? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I'll tell you what-
- I was gonna say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you must have a very specific-
- Yeah, you must have- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because thinking about it-
- Do you have this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> super specific situation?
- Did you have this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> super specific situation? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because...
- (laughs) Because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well I'll tell you mine, actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I didn't try
Nutella for the first time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until I was 24.
- How did you avoid Nutella </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for so long?
- Okay, because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nutella's like, everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because I was a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wasn't allowed Nutella, right- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, my parents wouldn't
let it in the house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Because it's basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just fucking chocolate, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just basically chocolate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually worse
for you than chocolate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it? (laughs)
- Yeah, there's more sugar- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's understandable, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I just went my entire
life without trying Nutella. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how, but how
has Nutella been branded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as just this thing you
can spread on toast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and people eat for breakfast? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, and that feels
like a cheat code to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, because I remember
trying it for the first time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "This
is the most amazing snack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever tried in my life". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like, the fucking
gates of Babylon opened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Oh my God, I
have discovered God", right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It literally goes on like, everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I know! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You open the jar, it just
starts to glow, like (gasps). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - My favorite thing, (sighs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember which,
again, I forget this all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's little a video
where they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was about this whole,
the deception of Nutella </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being a breakfast product. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was this part in
it, where they go onto parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are feeding their kids
Nutella, and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Do you know how much
sugar is in Nutella?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "No". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they tell them, they're
like, "There's a lot of sugar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like a lot", they're like,
"Oh my God, I had no idea". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they look like, so dumbfounded. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "What are you serious?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The chocolate spread? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The pure, 100% chocolate
flavor that I'm spreading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a piece of bread
twice is bad for my son? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're kidding me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like-
- Surprised Pikachu face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally, and they're, "Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been feeding my kid
chocolate this whole time!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "What did you think it was?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one thought it wasn't chocolate! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We all know that Nutella is chocolate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because it's kind of liquidy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like very viscous, you
think it just gets a pass? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, why is it that
Nutella gets a pass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and yet Cocoa Puffs is
like, no, no, no, no, no! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because branding, Joey.
Branding is powerful. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did they get away
with this for so long? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Nutella fucking slaps, but I
knew as soon as I tasted it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's fucking unhealthy as shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it tastes amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally anyone who
knows what sugar tastes like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would be like, "I think
this is pretty bad". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's pretty bad, yeah.
- It's pretty bad for you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think, actually, you know? (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> My parents would only let
me have it on holidays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really?
- That's how taboo it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, "This is for
special occasions only". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I think my parents
let me have Nutella </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like pretty much every
morning if I wanted it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then I very quickly was
like, "This is too much". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this is too much sugar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Even for my eight year old body, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know this is too much
sugar in the morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> now I just think, "Kids,
you're not allowed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have ice cream for breakfast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but Nutella, that's okay". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, to me, they're
on the same fucking level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should put Nutella on ice cream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds amazing.
- That shit slaps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nutella flavored gelato-
- Nutella on some like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking vanilla ice cream. (clicks tongue) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That shit slaps.
- I mean that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a dessert, right?
- It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just chocolate!
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally just chocolate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] It's just a bit
of naughty chocolate, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what's another
thing I fucking grew out of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I just like grew out of all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> viscous breakfast spreads.
- Viscous breakfast spreads? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah yes, what's your favorite
viscous breakfast spread? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, Nutella-
- Viscous breakfast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> who on earth, no one has
ever described it like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It the only way I could describe it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally, you could
have said breakfast spread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You didn't have to put
whole viscous in there- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no-
- Viscous- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm pretty sure that's the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the history of man
that those three words </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have been put in the
same sentence together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like-
- No, no, that's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Alien, to the best of your knowledge, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> describe what this spread is.
- I too love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this viscous breakfast spread, human. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is wrong-
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I specifically used the word viscous, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like, jam-
- I could feel someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing the fucking lawnmower
(imitates a lawnmower revving), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in his fucking head, trying
to form that sentence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because okay, I used the word viscous, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because jam, for instance-
- How are you gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> talk about peanut butter and jelly, right- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, that too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, jam for instance, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not viscous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- Depends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can make it viscous-
- It doesn't stick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to the roof of your mouth
like Nutella does, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love a good fucking jam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing is, is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not only did I grow out of Nutella, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also peanut butter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I used to fucking love peanut butter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know a single person in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who ate peanut butter as a child. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, but like-
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't eat peanut butt either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I ate it as a
child, but then after a while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like, I don't know,
I don't think I like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just, the fact that
every time I take a bite, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just feels like I just
swallowed a mouthful of glue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like, honestly, it's viscous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The viscous! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the viscosity of peanut
butter that I don't like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think nine out of 10 people I know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> who have peanut butter is
just for catching mice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why I had it.
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I only bought it because
apparently mice fucking love it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well yeah, I don't blame 'em. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I'm licking the floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I mean-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They call me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I gotta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> God damn I got my-
- I'm just ready </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the Drake meme, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> peanut butter and jelly sandwich? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I sleep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, viscous breakfast spread? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Real shit. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I remember, because
I hadn't tried peanut, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was another food
item that I didn't try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until later in life, was peanut butter- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never had just
peanut butter on a sandwich </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or something.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember trying
it for the first time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was very underwhelmed by it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like the most
five out of 10 food item </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever tasted in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What about its viscosity, though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Doesn't that shit just
like, stick to your mouth? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, which kind of
spreads did you have? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you have like, the chunky spread, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or did you have like, the smooth spread? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I went either or. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never had a
spread of peanut butter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've never had a
spread of peanut butter? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've only had Reese's cupcakes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which, yeah-
- I also hate the viscosity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of those.
- Well, I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first time I-
- Do you just wanna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say viscosity?
- I love that word. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I very much had a, like
the kombucha tea meme, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I first tried the Reese's cupcakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I had
it, and I was like, "Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh! Oh?"
- I think the one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't look about Reece's cups is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again, the peanut butter
overpowers everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like a certain-
- Is that the point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if that's the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if that's the point- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's like, something
about the peanut butter that I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I just don't like peanut butter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Foreigners trying to
figure out American food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "What is going on here?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, I just
realized, like right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think I don't like
peanut butter. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it, okay Americans,
is it normal to feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> violently uncomfortable after eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more than two of those cups? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that normal?
(Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Meiling, is that normal? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does your stomach feel
really uncomfortable? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many Reece's cups can you eat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can eat like a bunch? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right-
- You start to feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like real uncomfortable, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> There was no, they came
in a nice pack of three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So I assumed I eat all three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh you don't, fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is the biggest lie
America's ever told. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a lie-
- You share. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You share.
- Share bags, my ass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would they, why would they- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it-
- My hand fit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so perfectly in it then?
- That's like saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, you can break off a Kit Kat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and share it with another person". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No one fucking does that shit.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just open it, and just eat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially now, I don't want someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with their fucking sweaty
hands snapping a Kit Kat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The whole palm reaching over
the whole Kit Kat to snap it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because that's-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what you have to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't trust a person who
tries to do it like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's weird, you want a clean- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you want that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I also don't want
your whole palm touching it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a little too much palm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So frankly, we'll just buy
our own Kit Kats, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just eat the fucking Kit Kat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or honestly, in the
packet, rip it in the packet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you can do that-
- Oh yeah, you can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Big brain.
- That's too big brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But sometimes you forget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You've opened it up, and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fuck I can't wrap it back up". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Grab the packaging, just wir. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You gotta do like, have
you seen the Kit Kat adverts? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where you're like the foil wrapping, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just like,
split it in the middle? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, with like a knife?
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With your finger, you like,
it just splits perfectly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does this-
- Is your fingernail </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long enough for that?
- No, it is! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, so-
- Have you done it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. (laughs)
- I've never done that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did that advert stop
getting played or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never split-
- I've never seen that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, I gotta
fucking show you after the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never split a Kit Kat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've never, what? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have-
- No, I have not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you eat Kit Kats? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just fucking take it out
of the package and eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I have done that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But I don't believe you
that you've never split- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the Kit Kats I always used to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were like, the mini packets of Kit Kats. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like, it would be in a bag- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You tell me you've never had a thought- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've never had a single Kit Kat- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've never had a four bar Kit Kat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, and I just eat it.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You fuck off. No you didn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey (laughs)-
- I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you must be lying-
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> shut the fuck up, do you
just fucking bite that shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> without splitting it?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No Joey, no!
- No- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am true evil.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't believe that you've
never cracked a Kit Kat apart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't do it on the
fucking regs, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - When are you eating Kit Kat? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who the fuck's eating Kit Kat often? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but like every
time I have a Kit Kat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's usually in like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> two Kit Kats together, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The max is like, four in a row. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and you split it-
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eat it one at-
- I literally just grab, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and just, do this.
- Don't! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No Joey, no.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like, the crumbs
get everywhere and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I just eat it in one go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's such a mess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, crumbs go everywhere,
the wafer falls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The structural integrity has
been compromised, frankly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't matter,
because two seconds later, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all going in your mouth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty sure society would crumble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if everyone did that, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is why we ran out of toilet paper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gotta wipe up the Kit Kat crumbs- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is this an Australian
thing that I just don't- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I know this is just a me thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, has no one ever
shamed you about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in your life, but there's no
way you went through school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating Kit Kats like
that, and not got bullied- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never ate Kit Kats in school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kit Kats were a me thing, in my room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's wrong with you, Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a fucking chocolate bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Who cares? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Does it say on the packaging,
"Must crack one at a time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in order to eat successfully"? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No, it doesn't.
- Well, it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> only drinking beer via like, shot gunning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, yeah okay,
it's a one off, I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that shouldn't be
your primary go-to method </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of drinking a beer out of a can, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, stabbing a hole in the bottom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and fucking drinking it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That shouldn't be your go-to method. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like that, it's like-
- It's nothing like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are you on?
- It is like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is like that.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're literally
making it harder to eat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not, I'm making it easy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm saving my fucking palms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from getting all chocolatey by doing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (sighs) Oh, God.
- I just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> open it up halfway, and then
grab it by the packaging, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then just fucking do this- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a reason there are
crevices in the Kit Kat, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There are reasons for it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally designed into
the fucking food product! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's designed to be eaten
a certain way, Joey! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, sometimes I wanna break the rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right? (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you ever just like,
wake up and remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that Toblerone took out like 50% </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of the fucking chocolate?
(Garnt giggles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just can't believe
they did that still. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I still cannot-
- Do you know Toblerone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've seen the modern ones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know how the gaps used to be very, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would argue, perfect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, when the one went to up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the next-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you could easily just do that right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's not like that.
- Yeah, like with Kit Kats, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Toblerone-
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Listen, Toblerones are fucking massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like this big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm no gonna fucking (gagging). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have done that, I have done that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I bought too many at the airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to start, and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just getting a little wild and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just fucking deep throating- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Deep throat a Toblerone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you not seen what they look like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughs) Toblerone
deep throat challenge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, Mister Beast,
"Who can deep throat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most Toblerones for $10,000"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, so because,
I was out of the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by this point, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But, so Toblerone, you know
what a Toblerone look likes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks like, it looks like this, Chads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not Chad, fucking-
- Chads! (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been watching too much Twitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But so, I think one year they just decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to make less Toblerones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or, they made the gaps-
- So this is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> original Toblerone.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I'm used to.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And your gonna fucking cry.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] This is it now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, so that can't be real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's real.
- That cannot be real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's real, that's real!
- Yeah, that is real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That is real.
- Are you shitting me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, that's what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why are the Toblerones
social distancing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "We're too close". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just-
- Give me some room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes I just wake up at night, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just remember they did that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no.
- They got away with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And they still are expensive- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did they get away with it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure like, they-
- I haven't heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of recent memory, of people
buying Toblerone. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd like to think that
even like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that this plummeted their stock. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I don't think it did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty sure people
rioted because of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like the impression I got- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if I'd known
about it back in the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would've rioted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I remember, it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just when I moved out of the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I can't remember
if I was living here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When did they do this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Was this when you were living in the UK? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was when I was living in the- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I must have just moved
to Thailand or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember moving to Thailand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one day I wake up, and
my entire fucking feed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just people complaining
about the Toblerones- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
- It's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like they didn't even try and hide </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> how much chocolate they were taking away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like just fill it with some shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Make it less tasty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like don't ruin the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because one of the best
things about a Toblerone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that you get so God
damn much chocolate- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- You get a fuck ton. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like arguably, one piece
of Toblerone is too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That shit lost you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think actually, eating a
single piece of the triangle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is actually uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's almost too much-
- It is too much chocolate- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's always the best part,
because it's good shit too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It tastes great.
- It's the perfect amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're like, "I don't
even wanna go for another one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll save it for the next day". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I also learned as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I used to always snap it away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Did you do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then, the way that I actually do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is to push it inward, and it snaps easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, like that?
- Yeah, you snap it in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just breaks off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But now you'll never get to experience it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no. (laughs)
- The design </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is fundamentally changed, so-
- Wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> How are you supposed to
snap the new ones now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking-
- With a fucking knife? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Smack it against the
concrete or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - (imitates a cutting serrated
blade) Cut it with a knife. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, you don't need to snap it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It will probably just like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so long that it'll
probably just break under the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey giggles)
- Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, why do they do this to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why are they masking my boy like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I couldn't believe they did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm still like, I wake up in a cold sweat- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How have I like, just
found out about this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll tell you what-
- I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's the UK only or not-
- I'll tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what I think is an underrated
snack, chocolate snack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Terry's Chocolate Orange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking love Terry's Chocolate Orange- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh-
- Do you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Terry's Chocolate Orange? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't, but I've heard of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They have it in America.
- They have it in America? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, they have it in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so it's basically
just a chocolate orange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But the fucking best part of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it's literally an
orange that you have to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> smack, and you eat a little chunk- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the shape of an
average sized orange. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I don't know what it is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Solid chocolate.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just a ball of solid chocolate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you eat like an orange, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, they have the Terry's
Chocolate Orange bars, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't know what it is
about playing the minigame </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, fucking smacking the chocolate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and peeling it yourself, it
just tastes so much better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and so much more satisfying-
- It's because you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> working for it. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love just smacking it
against my concrete wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my home, just fucking (grunts). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Who wants a piece?
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who wants a piece of
Terry's Chocolate Orange? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's always really cheap as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They always go on offer for like, a pound. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So you've got like, way too much chocolate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for really cheap, somehow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was yeah-
- Wait, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> does it have like,
actual orange in it, or? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's like orange flavor-
- It's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> orange chocolate flavor.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really nice, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Really like it, I don't
really like orange flavor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I think-
- It's very- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I think my aunt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the only reason why I
know about chocolate orange, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because like, my aunt used to
hand make chocolate orange, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but actually get slices of orange, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, coat it in
chocolate, and then like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually I've just figured out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what fucking Australians
get patriotic about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- For some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tim Tams.
- Hell yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tim Tams.
- Hell yeah! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mid as fuck, Australians.
- Fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think of the bourbon
biscuits (indistinct), you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I like-
- Every Australian I've met </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> has actually like, picked up Tim Tams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, extreme levels, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the only like, good snack we have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (men laugh)
- Debatable, debatable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it just goes to show the quality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the rest of our snacks, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, man, like it's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, Tim Tams or a bar of Toblerone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll take the Toblerone.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be honest, like there
are better snacks out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But Tim Tams is just so
readily available in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, anywhere you go,
that it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's comfort food, basically.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I feel like, I remember I tried it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first time,
and I feel like we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some very similar-
- Yeah, we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> very similar products in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't Penguins kind of similar as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Little bit, yeah.
- Penguins are great, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Penguins are great.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What else do we have in the UK? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, Jaffa Cakes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, Jaffa Cakes, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you think about Jaffa Cakes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretty shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh okay, good, good, good-
- What are Jaffa Cakes, again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That sounds familiar.
- Sponge cake with- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Orange?
- Orange jam- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have
those in Australia too, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty gross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They have horrible shelf life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Those things go bad really fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, you know-
- The only time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I ever ate them was at my
Grandma's place, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The packet is big
enough where you kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have to do it in one sitting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if you open the
bag, they go bad in one day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, if you buy them for yourself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta commit to-
- It's definitely like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a home party snack, right?
- Yeah, you gotta- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, whenever you go to any gathering, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or any kind of camping trip or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone always brings
out the Jaffa Cakes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I never understood why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's the middest snack in England </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my opinion, and for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people think think I want
a piece of that. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean-
- I like the taste of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's nice, but after I have two, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "You know what, I'm
good for the next five years". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want anymore.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm fine.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I enjoy it though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean-
- That's how I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about Kinder Eggs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I fucking love Kinder Eggs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kinder Eggs are great.
- But I have like, two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "This is so much sugar". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm about-
- Kinder Bueno bars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> are amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kinder what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kinder Bueno, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Those are fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Those are great.
- Oh dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just bars full of the
Kinder, they're bueno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just Kinder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really fucking good.
- Oh like, Kinder Eggs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in a bar-
- They're hazelnut as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the hazelnut ones are amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll bring you some when I go home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you have Aero in Australia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We do.
- We do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, the really
like, fluffy chocolate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not fluffy, but the really
like, bubbly chocolate- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bubbly chocolate.
- Yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We have those, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're pretty good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I really, really
fucking like Aero, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I've just realized they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> selling me air. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because-
- It's the equivalent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of like, a pack of chips,
and 60% of it is air- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I just like how-
- Some people want like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the light flavor-
- Yeah, I do like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the light flavor, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it costs the same amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as every other chocolate bar. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you like some chocolate air? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you buy the expensive chocolate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Lindt, or Lindor, or
whatever the fuck they are- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lind, whatever it is, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Swiss chocolate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes you eat one, and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Ah, it's good, it's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But do I really want like, 10?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's not a chocolate you eat 10 of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what I've noticed
about expensive chocolate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is like, you eat one, and
you feel like you've just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ate 10 chocolate bars in
this one fucking chocolate- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and then you're like, "Great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I paid 50 bucks for these 10
chocolates, like this is..." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Time to give them away, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, "Fuck, what do I do now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really wanna eat these anymore". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I like chocolates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That you could eat so much of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs)
It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you never get bored of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like Dairymilk, I never
get bored of that shit- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just can't even really eat
a lot of chocolate anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no me neither.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But Big Macs? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, hell yeah I can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dude, I can smash
a Big Mac back everyday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if I want to.
- McFlurry? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck yeah.
- Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Ice cream is, I think my
love has grown for ice cream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- As I get older. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But my love for chocolate has gone down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why.
- I think my- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ice cream is pretty MVP, though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think my love for
chocolate and ice cream's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just kind of gone down recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, my love for sweet things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> has definitely gone down.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're already sweet enough, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aw.
- It's not gonna (laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I definitely do like my
savory and saltier stuff better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think a lot of people say
you have a second stomach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for dessert, I don't have a
second stomach for dessert- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's bull shit. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like, if I
have space in my stomach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for more food, then I'm
gonna eat more food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right?
- Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, I mean if there
is a tiramisu available, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I will always make room for a tiramisu- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, to be fair, if
a tiramisu comes out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm smashing that shit back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love tiramisu-
- Yeah that's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it has to be my favorite cake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What's your favorite cake? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know.
- This is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> asking an alien, name
your favorite celebrity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughs) I guess-
- The human on the TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is my favorite-
- I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if not like, the default chocolate cake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then probably red velvet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking love red velvet-
- Red velvet is good cake- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Red velvet is probably
the only other cake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I like to eat, other than chocolate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Red velvet is very good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't eat a chocolate cake anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just way too heavy now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it depends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I never eat a chocolate cake- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Getting old, boys-
- I could never eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a chocolate cake after a meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just, sometimes I just
get a random craving </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a chocolate cake.
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like for me, I don't really
eat as much chocolate anymore, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but sometimes I just get this
random craving for sweets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you know when you fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know when you're
hungry, and you feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you could eat everything, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, when I get this chocolate craving, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I buy like fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) I fucking like,
buy 10 different types </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of chocolate bars, chocolate
ice cream, chocolate cake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "I'm fucking craving this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm hungry enough to eat everything". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have one bite of the chocolate cake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "Okay, I'm done now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck, I've made a massive mistake". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
Because I just have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a table full of chocolate in front of me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I know I don't wanna eat anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - God.
- But, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I'm not really,
I'm not a dessert guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you a dessert guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I prefer the main. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But sometimes, some places have like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really good desserts,
and it makes you be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, hold up"-
- Could you get the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have you ever been-
- Dessert's got a point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever been
to like, cake buffets? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that, wait what, it's a thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is that?
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where, where is this?
- In Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're fucking everywhere, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, where?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's one really good
one I went to in Harajuku, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally like a
sushi train of cakes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like, tiny little cakes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many can you have before
you start becoming sick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had like four, and then I was done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, some of my female friends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can have like, you know
10, 15 of these cakes- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ.
- It's like, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You guys are built different.
- Real food? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Nah, sweet shit please.
- Sweet shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah but-
- I like cupcakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cupcakes are nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Something about a muffin
or a cupcake that I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've had a cupcake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like, five years (laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just a muffin, I just like muffins. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Most of them are pretty easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Muffins.
- Pretty good size. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is it about muffins
that are very British? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's very American, I'd say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think it's more American- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I think a muffin, I think British. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe the English muffin, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is what you're thinking of.
- Oh, could be, could be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I feel like,
definitely with dessert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dessert culture is way stronger in Asia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> than I feel when I was living in England. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I didn't, until
I moved to Thailand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or until I went to Thailand,
I didn't know the concept </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just like, a dessert bar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it's just a restaurant
that just specifically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> serves desserts, that's
just not a thing in England- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's some.
- Like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was it, like Casper's
or whatever it's called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck is Casper's-
- The ghost? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(men laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A big chain I saw everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like a dessert thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it was like, really tacky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't really like the look of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah like, the only kind
of, dessert oriented places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I find in England now are just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they are marketed as Asian
dessert places, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that only started
cropping up more recent, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the more recent times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I guess I'm not a
fan of how fucking bright </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and loud dessert places are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I'm, do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Almost exclusively white as fuck- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're always like,
really pastel colors, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or really bright colors,
and I just feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Fuck I'm in"-
- You go blind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you walk into one, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, I wanna just get a dessert, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not be visually attacked-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> By all these fucking colors.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like I'm in the wrong place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I go into there, because I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm too British for this, I'm too sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't be in here-
- I just hate the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that like-
- It's horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't stand it-
- All of the walls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are just white as fuck, and
they blast the light on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Oh God, it's 2 P.M., </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why are the lights on in here?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Jesus Christ-
- When you use light mode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just depends on the place, yeah? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> When you get different types of lighting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and walls, whatever
the fuck, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever, are you one
of those people who like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> care about the mood of a restaurant? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah-
- The lighting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that?
- Definitely helps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with, get a feel for what
the owner wanted, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I didn't start to care about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would say like, my mid twenties. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they gotta build the atmosphere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> before you even sit down, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like they gotta get you
understanding the vibe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what the food-
- Yeah because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before when I was a fucking
uni student or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not just restaurants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't care about the bar
vibe, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, to me, does it serve food? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it cheap, can I eat it?
- Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's all I cared about, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, as I grew older,
I'm just like, "Damn"- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Life's too short
to waste on shit places- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, the vibe in the
place can really effect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'm enjoying my meal
or drink as much as usual. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know if something switched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into my brain or something. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But there's a part of me that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel if a restaurant
has a really nice mood, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or a mood that is fitting
and is comforting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then it almost sometimes
blinds you to the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that the food might not be
as good as you think it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, I mean there's
plenty of times where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it sets up high expectations,
and the food comes out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's-
- It's like, E. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so disappointing, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because especially in Japan, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I feel like especially in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every place has a unique vibe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every restaurant you go to looks amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It has a unique selling point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But that isn't always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this isn't always, that doesn't
always equate to good food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or it just doesn't always
equate to amazing food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Weirdly enough, it's like
kind of the opposite in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Where like, the shittier
the place looks usually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the better the food is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially when it comes to ramen- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I was gonna say ramen- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like family-owned restaurants
and stuff like that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If the sign is falling apart, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then the ramen place is
probably pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because why are you gonna give a fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how it looks,
just eat the damn food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or like, because that's how
I feel about Thai food, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I very rarely eat
in a Thai restaurant here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's because, for me, growing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or not growing up, but
whenever I go to Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the best food would
be street food, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that to me, was the best kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comfort food that I would find. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to me I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's only when I'm like, really,
really missing Thai food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and really craving it,
that I actually go out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and go to a restaurant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But most of the times, I cook
it myself, because it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To me, it's like comfort food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's something comforting about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, the same with Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you go to a ramen shop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it looks like a high
class, prestigious ramen shop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably doesn't taste as good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as the run-down, family
made ramens, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and (sighs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I guess.
- Wrap it up there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess we'll just wrap it up there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jump right into the ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jump right into these patrons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, wonderful patrons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at all of them.
- Goodness gracious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bet they eat their Kit Kats correctly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I bet they do.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I bet they don't use viscous spread- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna get so much shit for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Spreadable breakfast, viscous saliva. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you're talking about
viscous breakfast spreads, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> all right. (laughs)
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hashtag viscous breakfast spread- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) Viscous breakfast-
- It's like a tongue twister. </SPEAKER_01>
