<SPEAKER_03> - Dinosaur before.
- We never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - got to taste a dinosaur. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a T-Rex probably tasted great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah, T-Rex would be gamey as (beep). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you (beep)ing kidding me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Velociraptor is like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good sized, you know,
too muscular though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true, that would be too tough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the (beep)in' long
neck (beep) that, uh... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (engaging tones) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Gamers, gamers, gamers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I remember whenever
that like message came up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the cinemas, it like
always just scared me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - What message? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That you wouldn't steal a car. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why would that...
- Cinemas? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why would that become like the standard? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why did everyone use that one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What, that you wouldn't steal a car? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that one, why did
that become the one that... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause that's the argument that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was the
easiest to like, explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but like why did everyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just take that exact video clip </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and use it in everything, like why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, because, did you, were you grow... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Did you grow up in the
Blockbuster era, or like the... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I got games
mainly from Blockbuster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so basically
why that became a meme </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because at the start of every movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you rent from, like
Blockbuster or anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that one message would show up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know that, but then like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was also in like
non-Blockbuster things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like why did that video, that thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get just used everywhere? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why did everyone agree this was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the best?
- Wasn't it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Blockbuster videos? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, it was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because for me, it played </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before every movie at the cinema. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, every movie ever had it, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, I didn't see it in movies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I only know it from the cinemas. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I only know it
from like rental stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Twilight Zone" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Welcome to subject of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a strange topic that we didn't mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to get on, but welcome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm your host Connor with
the boys, Joey and Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hello, as we've established,
the host means nothing now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as someone on the Trash
Taste, Reddit pointed out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I explained to them, I
was like, on my last show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, listen, you don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> You get power when
you're on the solo seat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You get space. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You do, yeah.
- You do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You just get like a
feeling that your like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm the host.
- I'm in control. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm in the conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like every time when I hosted before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was a guest on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, well that's
my hosting privileges gone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I gotta take care of the guest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm on babysitter mode now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now you're in the beta seat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate that seat the most.
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I'm furthest
away from everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Hi, guys, hi, host, hey,
like across, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not that bad.
- I know, I know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A part of me just feels
like I like these two seats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like that seat.
- I like this seat, too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (talking over each other and laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm the only one that's
literally never given a (beep). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, we're still
sitting at the same table. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Something about it just,
you know, feels different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's differently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like getting like the
front seat in the car, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You are the alpha male. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are you, five years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, you are.
- Shotgun! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gotta get
- Every time we go on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - the booster seat, too.
- a road trip, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey's the one that shotguns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the front seat every (beep)in'
time, I swear to God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] Appreciate it
because he can read the signs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm doing it for the driver, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's more responsibility for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> You can chill in the back of the car. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - The front seat's only good if the driver </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is also really confident because
if the driver's confident </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then he's not gonna bother you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but if the driver's not confident, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then he's gonna bug you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Can you look at the map? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Actually, can you change the song? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Can we can stop?
It's like, no, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but if the driver chatty, he's like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - But even if...
- I drive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - But even if it's a
confident driver, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're gonna be the one
guy who's like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> someone in the back's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can you turn up the AC? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, fine, I'm (beep)in'
in a hurry, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is why I feel
sorry for any short person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who is on a group road trip, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because here's the
thing, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> No matter what, no matter what we think, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no matter what we think is
the best seat in the car, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we can all unanimously
agree that the worst seat </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is the middle seat in the back, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- And who always gets that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's the short person because
they take up the least space. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause I can always be like,
look guys, I'm a bit tall. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Can I get at least get
one of the side seats? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And everyone's like, all
right guys, I understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love how the people
throw in that argument </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> as if like the one that
is in the middle seat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has more leg room or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> We all have the same amount
of leg room, so it's like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're like worrying
about invading two people's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> leg rooms as opposed to
just regarding your own. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, is that the loathe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think so, but also it
doesn't really have to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that much with height, surely it's... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's about width, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could be like...
- What if it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Eric Cartman, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Eric Cartman is like wider
than he thought, like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like where's he gonna sit?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and for me it's always like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's whoever has
like the smaller stature </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that sits in the middle.
- The stature, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which a lot of the times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> happens to be the shortest person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's true.
- Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But there are some like short, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> thick people out there in the world, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so like where do they sit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sure they are, but I'm just saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time, because I'm always that person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that forgets like shotgun the front seat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm just like, if I
can't get in the front seat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no way in hell I'm
getting the middle seat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll catch me dead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> before I'm in the middle seat.
- Yeah, you'll catch me dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before I'm in the middle seat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll catch me in the mood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, you want me to take the middle seat? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, okay, well, oh I guess these long legs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have no space to sit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, let me just, let me just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> lemme just man spread as much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Lemme just man spread as much as possible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you can regret this decision </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of putting me in the middle seat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's polite enough though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're like, Garnt,
get in the middle seat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't be like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But it depends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> on the length of a journey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's a short journey, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll take the middle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't...
- Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
Even on a short trip, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't want the middle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like an hour in the middle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can do an hour in the middle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - An hour's short?
- Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say like four hours
where it gets like long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Four hours, you can
throw me in the trunk, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll have a better time in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it's the middle seat, especially. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's not just like the least comfortable. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just the one that induces
the most motion sickness </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for me as well 'cause... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't get motion sickness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The problem with the middle seat is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's always got like the
(beep)tiest seatbelt, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what...
- That's the bulk.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the waist-only one, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's it's the waist-only one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it feels like the top
half just like has less, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the word I'm
looking for, like support. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It has less support, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're nice and snug.
- And that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> makes you motion sick? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kind of like a lot of things make me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> motion sick.
- Garnt's one of those people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who literally needs to be like
(beep)in' straight-jacketed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into the seat to be like
no motion sickness for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The other thing as well
is a lot of the times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the middle seat doesn't
have a headrest as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So a lot part of the thing that helps me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with motion sickness is having
something to rest my head on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That sounds like a tall person problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It very much is a tall person problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Either I get motion
sickness or I just have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> massive whiplash from just like trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to lie like this for like two hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Then after saying all
of that can you really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> fault me for shotgunning the front seat, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> clearly so I can avoid (beep)in' sitting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this for the entire trip, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why short people
deserve to be in the middle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is your right as a short person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to take a bullet for the
team, no headrest for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No headrest for you,
you don't need a headrest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're short enough as it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I need a headrest, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt hates short people, confirmed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He wants them all to
sit in the middle seat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the rest of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the birth of heightism. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Heightism, is that a
thing, is that a thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe, probably, if you're on Tinder. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't call them short. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's gonna end up being derogatory </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at one point of our lives.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause everything ends
up being derogatory. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, there's no clear definition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> for when somebody becomes short. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Vertically challenged. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's that's all we have
to start using from now on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate that, it's so dumb.
- Don't call them short. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, at which point? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> What is the cut-off for short? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Well, it depends how tall you are. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also how self-conscious you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] Depends on
where you are as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some guys say anything below
six foot, you're a dwarf. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but then again, it's like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who says that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I say that.
- Insecure men, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like...
- It depends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the definition of short </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is dependent on like your
point of reference, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also the country that you are in, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you're from Netherlands. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then everyone here is short. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I feel like an average
sized human being in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I moved to like Thailand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and like the toilets come up to my shins. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's that's that's
like the bigger indicator </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of when I go to like
Thailand, I can't remember. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think Japan's like kind
of the same when I go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> into the public toilets and normally like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it goes up to like my knees.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then the toilets
there go up to my shins. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, what, what is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is this country?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's some Japanese high school kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that are (beep)in' massive.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've noticed.
- Walk on the train. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> They'll be like six-foot-five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh my God.
- I've kind of noticed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that like I feel that
when I first moved here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or even earlier than that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone around me was shorter than me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But nowadays, like, as you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are like seven feet
tall high school kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's nuts.
- It's like hat happened? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The entire country just
had like a growth spurt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
- 'Cause I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember, like...
- Anecdotal, but I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, no, it's certainly anecdotal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember at one point
when I was in high school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I basically, I
reckon I stopped growing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like around 16, 17, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm still growing (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm still growing.
- Are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, I'm not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I personally stopped
growing at around like 16, 17, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so right before I graduated high school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember there
was one time where I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on an absolutely packed train in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like a (beep)in' Q-Tip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a field of like cotton swabs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just me and then it's
just like a sea of heads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But nowadays I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get in a packed train and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone around me is
the same height as me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like what happened? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why am I Beta now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is everyone like wearing (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I was the only one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey thought he was built different, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but he's built the exact
same as everyone else. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, I'm exclusively
in the six-foot club. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Now everyone is in the six-foot club. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, aside from Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Except for Connor.
- Aside from Connor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> As is evident in like every photo we take. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's surprising about we've
taken this many photos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and we still get the same... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We still get the same three comments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every (beep)in' time which is... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Asians are taller than white people, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't expect Connor
to be the shortest, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> which Connor's not a short guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Connor's not short, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're not a short dude
(talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like the Mr.
Incredible meme right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> You guys are like happy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like the (beep)in' pain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not short, I'm tall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm 5'10". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the thing is, but the
thing is you're not short. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't really...
- Especially in this country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't feel, I don't feel short. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like you meet people, you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I am tiny on this earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, yeah, every time
I go to the Netherlands, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, oh I am literally
vertically challenged right now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> compared to everyone else, but in Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like, you know, you meet people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who are like three feet tall </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're living their lives
normally, so I'm like good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your so full, you're
like why are you living? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (background noise drowns out other sounds) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it tough, is it tough? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why you, why are you doing this here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why, why give up, give up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How can you live? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How is hard mode? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> How is hard mode going? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - She had pogos for legs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> My girlfriend is literally the
shortest person I know, so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know I don't really
give a (beep) about height. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know.
- Eh, me neither. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's one of
those things that people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> don't really care about, and
when they do, I'm like why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've met people who are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I will only date someone
unless they're like X. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the common thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, why, why though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What are the privileges of being taller </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> than a certain?
- I get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have a preference,
right, you might like really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know guys who love
taller women than them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> They love women that are
taller them, I get that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nothing against that, but like.. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess it's the wording, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Some girls just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they word it, I can
understand why it hurts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of those guys out
there that are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanted a break, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I'm just not six foot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like it's all
right, man, it's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't worry about it,
don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't get like why
is it just that cut-off? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, it's just, I it's, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's always weird to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm yet to meet a woman who was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> man, I want a man who's
at least four feet tall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just every man be
like, thank you, thank you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Inclusive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I think six foot sounds nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, what about like 175 centimeters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> or something?
- No, doesn't have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the same ring to it.
- 180 centimeters, that's... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno, it's around the same, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> What's what's six foot again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 180, I think.
- 181, something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm exactly six foot, so whatever I am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's start a new standard in metric. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey's like, phew, just made it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, I literally,
I was like just scraped by. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There is a God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I grew two millimeters last year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just scraped by, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] 183 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not even six foot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always thought I always
thought six foot was 180. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey, you're kinda looking
mighty short right now, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're kinda looking
mighty short right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] It's technically 182.8, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, hold on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know what I am in
centimeters, let me ask. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's okay, it'll make
your dick look bigger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hey, Siri. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Hey, Siri, (beep)in' Siri, wake up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Hey, Siri. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's 181.2 centimeters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in feet and inches?
- .2, throw in the .2. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm desperate.
- Shut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm desperate.
- Shut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - She picked up all that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Siri] The answer is 100 over 381. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey, Siri. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Hey, Siri, what's 181
centimeters in feet and inches? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Put it put up against the mic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Siri] 181 centimeters is 5.94 feet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - 5.94, which that's what, 5'11", right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's it's not 5'9". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's 5.94 feet, which is five, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which means it's 5' 11? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How many feet, how many inches in a foot? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's not... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's not six though.
- But it's not six though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's...
- That's all that matters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the important apart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not six, which
means you must be six. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I am six.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's the Chad kid.
- How does that feel? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - How does that feel? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're the real Chad,
Joey, you're the real Chad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought you were a brother to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought I was a real Chad, I'm not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could have lied this whole time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I could have, I could've just said 183 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just to make myself feel better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could've just spent
this whole time lying, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but now you've, now you've outed yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> as not being confirmed six foot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, I like my height,
it's a comfortable height. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I see like people taller
than me, and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm at the height where
there are some things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in Japan where it
just gets a bit inconvenient. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I like some buildings are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to like, just bob
my head down a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't imagine what it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for someone who's like 6'5" or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like trying to live in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Could you imagine having to duck down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every time you go into a train? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, remember that toilet
we went into in that one bar? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We found this toilet in this bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I posted a video on Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, it was like a closet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like this tiny little door opened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you had to, no joke, like duck down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like maybe four foot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like the, it was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (beep)in' Harry's room and
(beep)in' forced for (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Where it's under the stairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was crazy.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's a toilet on the wall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought, the (beep), it looks like some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some kind of old 1800s
charcoal storage room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was literally like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> out of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> That was like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - (talking over each other) and (beep). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The room wasn't that small,
the room was quite big. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah
- It was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the door was comically small. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I liked that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What so you could feel like a Hobbit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, it just looked cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, it was unusual. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> We're talking about it now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like the bar in Niseko. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Remember the one where it was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fridge door to get in and you had, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone had to duck
down to get into that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah that was cool though.
- That was cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's something about having a crawl </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to just take a (beep). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like Shawshank Redemptionesque. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It kinda made me feel like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know.
- It wasn't that small. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was pretty... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember I had to like really... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't a hole.
- Like go like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like get in and like.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then I could get in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought that was just like really small. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, I thought it was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is there no regulations
around door sizes in Japan? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, apparently not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sure in the UK we
have some like kind of rule </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like the doors...
- Why would there be? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would there be? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just for like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause maybe it gets to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're like, all
right, to get to the toilet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you have to climb through the vent. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> By the way, this is a Mission
Impossible themed cafe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, ah... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, it depends what
you constitute as a door. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> What is it, like a cupboard? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is a door? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I felt like there were stretching </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> the definition of a door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah.
- The same way like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I were to open my no, no, no, not my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (background noise drowns
out other sounds) . </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like if you open the fridge,
no that's a fridge door. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a fridge door.
- It's a fridge door. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was about the same
height as a fridge door </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I would say.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, I would say so as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a small fridge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just impressive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, okay, why
not just like knock a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the wall down and make a
bigger door, like there's a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could get what they, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're just going for like a unique.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think they would go the bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - To be fair, the bar
itself was pretty small. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like a, would you
describe it like a diner? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a diner kind of? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> There was one bar top and then
there was like two or three, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe like two, like three
seater, like bar tops. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it looked like
the classic diner seats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, like the black and white. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just like some random bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> cause we were finding
a place that was open. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But yeah, I don't know why
the toilet fit into the theme. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> There was nothing to indicate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like a Hobbit theme or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> It was really strange, but you find this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> in Japan occasionally, just random places </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with the weirdest toilets or doors. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 'cause there's a diner in Shobara </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I go to a few times
where the entrance to it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> is basically the toilet door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, it's maybe up to like here for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - On the street, mind
you on the main street. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So people who walk in, you just see people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (beep)in' (audio goes
out) in on the main road. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you do see some
strange toilets in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember like it's, sometimes
it's just a strange layout </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I remember that one toilet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think you also that
tweeted this one out as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is I think we
were like having dinner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with people from Netflix or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was this toilet in there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was just in the corner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the lighting was like so ominous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it felt like you would
approach it Jojo-style. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- You remember that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like diagonal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was like diagonal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - In this room, it was so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just leading to this one toilet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and all the lighting
was just behind this one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this one toilet seat.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the toilet
of the promised land. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Japan has that 'cause I feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the restaurant comes first,
then wherever the (beep) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they can fit the toilet and they do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, not that we can really talk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We have a (beep)ing toilet over there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that's in the corner as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's weird as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a weird toilet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I know that there's like um, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, (beep), what is it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Brain, I got... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Brain.
- Brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Brain commits suicide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I forgot what I was gonna say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Ah, go ahead, talk. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_06> Back to the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do you guys feel about
just the different like themes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like the restaurants you find here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I feel like in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there are more like you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there are more ways that
you can find just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really uniquely done like little cafes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or restaurants more than I've seen in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically where I came
from or even London to me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think more so bars,
there's more themed bars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in general.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's a lot of bars. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bars and cafes mostly, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you look at some of
these bars and you think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how the (beep) do you
stay in business, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because some of these bars are tiny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like you think of a
bar, at least in the UK </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and America and you think
it's a building, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a building with a dedicated room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with tables and chairs,
and that is the bar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And some of these bars
are just a countertop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're talking about the
one we found the other night? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> The one that was literally
the size of a hallway? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was so weird
going into the building. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you wanna tell a story? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so we basically, it was after </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the really short toilet bar, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were like, oh, we're feeling good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you know, it's been a
while since the three of us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had like gone out to go
drink and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we were like, let's go
to this other place in Tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> called Yokocho which
has like a lot of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> small hidden bars and clubs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and stuff like that all over the place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And by hidden, we mean
like there's one road </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that is just like covered. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's like buildings
that have like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe 20, 30 bars in it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Over like six stories
or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there were like maybe some like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> six to 10-story buildings
and they just had like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the signs were from the top to the bottom, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all like stacked and...
- It's just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 30, 40...
- Bars, bars, bars, bars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we just like, let's
just go into one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And the one we went into was
like really like pristine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like very like shiny
and very like chic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is weird 'cause outside of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks like a normal apartment building. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like really grimy.
- You get off the elevator, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was on like
the fourth or fifth floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get off the elevator and
it's just this dark hallway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like yellowish building color. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like the doors are this horrible... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Any other country that is like a floor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you would get stabbed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah, there was like three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or four bars that were open there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just like, let's
just go into one of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We went in, it was really pristine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like silver chic looking thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And there was this like
old lady at the end </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was like, you
know, drinking something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really expensive, but yeah,
the size of this place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was maybe what four people
could sit at the bar? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I think about six, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I remember there
was a lady on one end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were on the other
end and there were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> two seats between us and the lady, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's all it could
seat and that's it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the width was literally
the size of a hallway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly.
- If that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they had three
people running this bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for a bar that can seat six people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - There were just as many
bar men behind the bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> as there were people sitting at the bar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was really odd
'cause we walked in there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like this woman, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> quite elderly woman in like a kimono </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Drinking, like Dom Perignon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Clearly like a really important person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something like that.
- Yeah, and like these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> three bartenders were
like all caring for her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like laughing at
everything she was saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we walked in,
they kind of went like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do you guys want?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And we sat down like,
"Can we have a beer?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They were like, "Fine." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they gave us like a bog-standard beer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> from a glass that cost us $20 each. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To be fair though, we did eat like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all of their complimentary snacks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they put out a lot of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what the
(beep) snack that was... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so good.
- But it was so good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - These weren't like
your average bar snacks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like premium stuff
like dried fruits and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And every time we ate them
they immediately refilled it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I started feeling really
bad 'cause like we must have... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw them like opening new packs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and like reluctantly
pouring more snacks for us. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It was a cool bar, but it was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the atmosphere was like really weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It wasn't real weird, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Because then when the elderly woman left, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like two of the bartenders
followed her out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and just...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And didn't come back.
- And never came back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They might not even
have worked at the bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> They might have just been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> her personal attendants, yeah.
- Lackeys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Two of them, like one of
them was in like a tuxedo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He was quite elderly as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he looked like, like the
(beep)ing butler from Overlord. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Sebas Tian.
- Sebas Tian </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally looked like him
and there was this other guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and they left and then we
were like they'll come back, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they never, never came back. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> But they all left at one
point and left us in the bar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like alone for like
five minutes and we were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> only in Japan would they leave the bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the customers still
in there just to make sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this like rich customer
can go and do whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- So strange, so strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was very weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like how do you
think some of these bars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do stay in business if they... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - If there are rich
customers that are regulars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know there's a big like regular, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what's the word?
- Culture? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's very common </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> to find a bar you like and just only go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to that bar.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like to just constantly bar hop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and just see what else is there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, me too, because like
some of these bars that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, you kind of like
discover like this one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but this is like one of like basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time we go out and
discover a new place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We go into one of these
kinds of bar where it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time we go in the
bar is like almost empty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or there's just like that one person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sitting in the corner like
I remember when we went out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with Jan as well, it was
just like the three of us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and one person in the
corner, and it just was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one bartender who I saw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, I...
- Chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's just chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's just enjoying his job,
which is just a delight to see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why like, it's so weird to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that tipping culture isn't a thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and yet bars like this are
able to stay in business </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I can't imagine bars
like this staying in business </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if there wasn't a tipping culture, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because the drinks were
expensive, but they weren't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ridiculously expensive to the point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> one or two people can,
in my mind at least, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> run the entire bar economy
and keep it afloat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So it just, it just,
it just blows my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I have a mate actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who owns a bar in Saitama. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really?
- Yeah, and like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my hairdresser at the time
was like friends with him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> so I got to know him through
that, and he was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just like
curious, 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how many customers do you get? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's kind of like
in Saitama, first of all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like far away from Tokyo, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So there's less of a population
to, you know, for customers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm like, it was also in
like a really like hidden area. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like kind of similar
to the one we went to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, how many
customers a night do you get? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, oh, like
three or four on average. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, how
long are you open for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he is like, oh, like two days a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, and this is your only job? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, yeah, all the other days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm off, I go skiing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, how, just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where does this money come from? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he literally just said like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I get three to four customers, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's usually the same
three or four customers </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that just keep coming back
and are there literally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> from bar open to bar close.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Just because like they're
his mates and this is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the only time they get
to hang out with him </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> while he's working kind of thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kinda kind cool, but
sad at the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean he's
enjoying it and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's still around and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just like really fascinating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> how you can just make that as a living. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It goes into like the other
aspect of Japanese culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is very prevalent where
they, they like predictability. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They like the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They want to know what's gonna happen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess for bar owner and customer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's good for that 'cause you get to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the same bar every day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You get to know what you're gonna get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then if you're the
owner, it's like great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know my customers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know they're gonna come and X, X, X. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I do think that like
that's a really cool part </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of bar culture in Japan is that you, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there are so many small little places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's like places that
you would never be able to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in any other country or at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in any other country that I've lived in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because that kind of business
model just wouldn't work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you have to have that dedication </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of your regular customers, and even... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There has to be like, it's like kinda like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a symbiotic relationship, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that the customers
always need to be there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The customers come back
knowing that they are the ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are keeping this bar in business </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they are the only ones,
but I guess what I wanted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to know is like how do you
establish yourself with that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How do you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's literally just
word of mouth at that point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - The turnover is so fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I know that restaurants and bars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> close and open very fast in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I imagine that a lot of
them unfortunately fail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like ramen stores are
like incredibly expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to start and operate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's also incredibly competitive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can get ramen at any street corner. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. And then you
just get destroyed by... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking and laughing over each other) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you either get
destroyed by a turnover </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like a McDonald's,
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like one of the mega
corporations, but it's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally think it's just like a mate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, you know, if one
of your mates is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna start a bar in X location. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You'll be like, oh I'll come
and check it out one night </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you go tell your mates about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then that friendship forms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then that symbiotic
relationship forms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then if it keeps going
well, it'll keep growing out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I mean with how quick it, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With a bar, is there much
expenses to start out with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> apart from obviously getting the location? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess all the alcohol.
- All the booze. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably quite expensive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, you need to
like, I mean the bars, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the bars we went to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some of them were in like
an apartment building. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were basically just
someone's apartment, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the way they renovated this bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it looks (beep)ing great, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There were so many small
touches in every bar we go to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm sure a lot of it was
also spent on renovation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just to make it look like a bar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we went to two bars that night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember the second one
was a lot more themed, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but the first one was very chill, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very nice.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I think they were reasonably priced </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because this guy would spend
like 10 minutes making a drink. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Could he have been faster, yeah probably, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was nice watching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like that's part of the experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're in these cool bars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you just get to
watch the guy just go ham. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like do little things, just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Make something cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I taste it
and I don't really taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> much difference in other drinks,
but that's not the point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's that it feels nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the experience that you get, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, he's making it for you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Drinking one of the spoons </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> has like trained my mind into being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to get this drink
as fast as possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You mean your like, I order like a mojito </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they'd better be serving
it in a (beep)ing jug </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because otherwise this time
I'm waiting to get this mojito </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could be used to like drink
something else, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So just going into these bars,
which are more chilled out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is such a like different
but nice experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you'd only normally
go to these bars in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you had like a (beep)
ton of money to spend a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I also feel you don't go... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I personally don't go into
those bars to get (beep)-faced. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, you can't really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, which, you can if
you're there long enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're ordering
stuff that's like easy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's, at the same
time, it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're gonna pay for that experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that like atmosphere,
that chill atmosphere, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> then just like go easy
on your drinks, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just go slowly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kind hard 'cause the
atmosphere doesn't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> make you feel like you're
like drink, drink, drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just take your time.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just take your time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's just relax, let's just talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like really...
- Let's just talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also really thankful that
I speak enough Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to be able to do those
bars like no pressure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Those bars don't require that much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like if you... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If there's any reason to learn Japanese, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> probably just learn super basic stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so you can go to those bars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> If you don't speak any
Japanese, they might be like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's also a really good
place to practice Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] That's true
as well, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because every time I go bar hopping, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get to speak more Japanese
than I would normally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And the bartenders are normally, well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kind of their job to
be, way more understanding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and, and come...
- It's their job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to interact with the customers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Basically, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you're gonna talk to a bartender, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they're not gonna be like,
oh, what the (beep)... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing noise drowns out other sounds) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - They might, they might,
but they probably wouldn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> They're really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never been to one of those bars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the bartender's been like rude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're always super nice
and like always interested. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - They wouldn't be in
business if they were. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, at the end of
the day it's customer service. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - If there's only like six
seats, they better be nice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> to every (beep)ing customer that comes in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - They can't pretend to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, well what was that you were saying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, go to a different customer, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but you are the only one there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've had other customers be rude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> while I've been in those bars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think one time I was with Chris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were asking a bar,
and it was also a bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that made food, and we were
ordering a bunch of foods </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause we hadn't eaten all day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause we were like traveling and filming. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This one woman was like,
'Don't you think you've ordered </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'enough food," to like me and Chris, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we're like never, never enough food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Shut up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were like, what the
(beep) is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Why would you say that
to someone, (beep) off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think she was annoyed 'cause
she was talking with him. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think she was like flirting with him. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We kept obviously making
him like actually like cook </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and do his job, I guess, and
she was like really annoyed. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Every time we order anything,
she'd be like, chh, you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, what's your problem? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God, leave us alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We drank so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] She's trying
to get the deed, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know she, (beep) off, let us eat! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's because we ordered kamome, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we ordering cheese
and stuff off, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Chris was like more kamome. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So we were drinking so
much, we were getting hungry. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like more, more, more, more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Imagine trying to give them business. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, I was like (beep) off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was so rude, I was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the (beep)'s wrong with you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was in Kochi I think as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause this really tiny like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I bet for her, that's like
the only like, you know... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe yeah, that's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Solace out of whatever she
is living through, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Clearly she wasn't very happy,
she wanted take it out on us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno why, I remember... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean it's Kochi and there isn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> a whole lot else to do there.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there's not much
going on, (beep) you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, it was a nice bar though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember that it was like
an Irish bar or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the theme of it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What?
- Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was really good though
'cause they did like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they had Heineken on tap.
- Oh, (beep). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I just drank like, and it was... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They had actual pints of Heineken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ooh, okay.
- I was like, this is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I drank way too much 'cause I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> so excited to finally
have a real sized pint. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, oh, my God,
it was good though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sorry, random tangent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Random tangent.
- That's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You guys then been any other
like weirdly themed bars? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean I know you have for
a bunch for your videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or like just outside of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of the cool bars, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't want to go film anywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd just wanna kind of do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like there's that bar we went to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like this bar that's
like, I don't, I won't say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I don't want it
to become like brammed, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's like they have
like live music there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that was really cool.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like dude playing piano, cello, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, violin, and double bass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that one.
- The jazz ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kinda like a jazz bar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's like, and it's
there's like the whole wall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just like wine.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was really cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they have like cigars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and like the atmosphere's very chill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds nice.
- Cool, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's super awesome,
these dudes are amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's super chill just being there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I really miss going to a bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that has live music 'cause like all... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - When it's good as well, you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause sometimes when
you've got live music, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like (sucking
air through his teeth). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like, when the
music's not too in your face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, well if it's too loud, I... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, sometimes you go to a bar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the music, the music, like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the music is way too aggressive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you can't focus on
anything else but the music. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like this bar is just perfect. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The music was just like,
you can have a conversation </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or you can just like admire this guy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like tearing it up on like
the trumpet or saxophone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or whatever he was playing with the piano. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> They were (beep)ing insane.
- Really cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Really cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you can actually tip them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They had a tip jar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I assume that's how they make most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> of their money there,
but it's really cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was really awesome.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But you get charged for
just like sitting down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like the music charge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah.
- Like $20. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> But they're playing for like three hours. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean if the
music's good, why not? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's really (beep)ing good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I used to go to so many of
those places in Australia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but like they all just
got (beep)ing replaced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by like just standard, like
poker machines and (beep)ing... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the Australian bar culture like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Um, I'd say pretty similar to the UK </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the sense that you go in,
you have, you know, some food, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, beers and what
not, and then you watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the footy on the TV kind of deal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know?
- Yeah, 'cause like to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like would you count a pub as a bar? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not the same, but it
is in definition still. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess it's...
- The OG. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It fulfills the same.
- It's the OG. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the OG Bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's only since I've
moved out of England </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've considered a pub a bar, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because before like, I mean, I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a place that you go to drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But to me, like a pub
always felt different, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the UK at least, to a bar, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> A pub's somewhere where most
of the time you go there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to drink, but you know,
you can just have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a nice Sunday lunch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can have like a nice breakfast there, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever as well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A bar was always like
somewhere you would go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before going to a club,
or somewhere where you are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 100% of the time...
- Like spend the night there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Getting (beep)-faced.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> A pub you can go to like
in the daytime as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I could never like imagine having gone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> to a bar before 5:00 PM, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right, or yeah,
I guess in that sense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> then a pub is more so
similar to Izakaya in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> in that instance, whereas like a bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like live music.
- People drinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Most people normally go
to, at least in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've, hmm.
- - See because for us, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like everyone eats at the pub. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna say like 70% of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't eat when they go to the pub. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the older you get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the more likely you are to eat at the pub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, yeah, that, yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it's just a thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause the older you get, the
more you wanna on weekends, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you wanna go hang out with your mates. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's true.
- Oh, yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You wanna go meet down for a Sunday, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the, yeah, yeah, maybe, I
don't know, but I like pubs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Pubs are interesting in the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's one place where, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's also a (beep)hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's also a (beep) ton of
historical significance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to some of these pubs.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some pubs have been around
for like 800 years in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Isn't it insane?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just some guys pouring drinks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that have been there for like 800 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's like four times
the length of Australia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't that insane? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like there are like
pubs that are still open </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that have been around for
like, like 500 plus years. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's crazy.
- Maybe not the same name, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but like the location is
the, it's just insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, and you go in and it's
depressing most of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, because it's been around
for like 500 years, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not much has changed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, pubs
are one of those places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it very much reflects the
local area, the state of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The state.
- The state. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The state.
- Absolute state. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You go into the pub and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, we're going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - If the community's doing
well, the pub will be nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's true.
- Everyone's happy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The pub is nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If it's an area that has been like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of forgotten by the government... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Shankings every week.
- You know, it's kind of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - you know, it's a reflection. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know the pub scene, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's where you get to see the actual, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd say culture of the actual place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really is probably the most
honest way to find out about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> the culture.
- I'd agree with you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like if you wanna see
what proper British people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like you go to pubs,
you go to pubs, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'll see that there's a difference. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Well, I mean, I remember
before whether the image </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was different, but now, you know, if you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's, it's not all just like
either, how can I word this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's not that we're either
like prim and proper people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or just whatever the (beep)
we're getting clowned on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> on the internet.
- I remember when I went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the UK and you took
me to that gaming pub. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know...
- Ohhh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don't put that all on
me, we both took you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, yeah, you both took... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I'm pretty sure it was Connor's idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to bring you to that gaming pub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor's like I know a place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was supposed to be chill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think that day specifically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was 'cause the Overwatch World Final. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. The Overwatch
World Finals was happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really (beep) 'cause it was
so busy and you could get on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - But even, even before
the actual final started, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> we got there a little bit early </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> before the finals actually
started so we could at least </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> get a few drinks in then
chill and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like in my head, you
know, I was like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A gaming pub in the UK, all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wonder what they have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They just had a Wii on the window sill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> A single Wii with Smash, that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And five PCs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And five PCs.
- And five PCs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But the PCs were all taking out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause of the Overwatch finals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'd never been
unironically oy oy oyed before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> until that night when I
was like sitting outside </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause the Overwatch
Finals are happening inside </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was like way too loud
and I didn't really care. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So I sat just 'cause there
were a couple seats outside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, and this dude clearly
like about six pints in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just literally came up,
sat next to me, was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oy oy oy?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing and talking over each other) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that happens in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, wow, you exist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I was playing in an
Overwatch tournament that day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I think, was it that day, yeah, I was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it was that day.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think you signed up.
- Yeah, you did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did.
- You did sign up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was like the winner got a free drink. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like a six-round tournament. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I won the first four matches. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah.
- But then the fifth match, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like six beers deep.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so it was starting
to get a lot harder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> to win these wimpy ones at Overwatch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the guy, I remember
I got so annoyed, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy I'm going against,
he was just drinking coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, how is this fair? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm six drinks deep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this guy he's just
drinking a (beep)ing Starbucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of course I'm gonna lose. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can barely like (beep)ing
sit in the chair correctly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I didn't get my free drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I lost, I was very salty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think he was like a (beep) rank as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could have easily have beat him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It could have been easy, it's not right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I do notice that
about it's especially like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> themed bars in the UK, because like UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like the UJ bar-themed bar game
is (beep)ing weak as (beep). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno if it's changed
ever since I moved, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, you know, like you... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Back in my day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have a gaming bar in the UK, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the gaming bar in the
UK, as Joey has just said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is just like a Wii in
a corner and four PCs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the stickiest Wii motes
I've ever touched in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, ahhh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that shut down now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It might be, I dunno, I can't remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Real quick before I lash out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me make sure they're
not in business before I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was it called again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember what it... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Meltdown.
- Meltdown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Meltdown, oh, that was it!
- Meltdown? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that was shut down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is closed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's closed and it
keeps reopening and closing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was quite gritty though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It was all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I still had a good time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was better than nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was better than
nothing, but you compare it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to some of the gaming bars
and some of the theme bars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you find...
- Some of the gaming bars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in Tokyo are like...
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - In the UK, they do have a new one now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember...
- Is it good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I went there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's called the Meltdown. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, it's called, ah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the one now's
called Platform I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was very expensive, like
to go on the PC it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh God, it was like paying
normal computer costs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like computer cafe costs in London. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like five pound for an hour maybe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right.
- Or maybe 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It might have been five
pounds for 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- It's like $7.00 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you weren't allowed to take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> your drink up obviously,
but that just kind of sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - See, but like that
sounds like a gaming bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> where the gaming takes
priority over the bar, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas Meltdown was definitely
like 92% bar, 8% game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing I liked Meltdown
was that it was just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, it was just
kind of like comfy, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was comfy.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could do anything in that bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You could like order food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from like the local pizza
place and eat it at that bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a cool place to
chill out, but in terms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of just like having like a cool themed bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where like, you know, a lot of effort </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has gone into like the
theming and the vibe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I've been to bars in America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been to bars in
like, you know, in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you know, for example, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you have like an anime themed bar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You have like a Jojo themed bar in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like, you can tell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You walk in and immediately it's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're transported to like
a theme park, you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Thought has gone into like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the aesthetic, the vibe, the design. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then you go to like
an anime bar in the UK </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's a pub with a
docu-marker in the corner. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> That's basically like,
that's what I remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like that's the absolute state
of themed bars in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mind you, I still had a fun time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm saying all this (beep) about Meltdown. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I still had a good time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it was a fun time,
but it wasn't exactly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it wasn't exactly a gaming bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's just say that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the thing about UK bars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> We have fun there, you have fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - We have fun. You have fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You have fun.
- You have fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just not what you're expecting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think we took you there to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a board game bar, but it all
also has video games, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You told me about it, but we decided </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not to go to it for whatever reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kind of far out the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> We went there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember we went there, the other, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> when I went back to the UK
recently just for a drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was Rock Band night.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was rough.
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because people were singing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyone's allowed to sing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's basically a karaoke bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kind of karaoke, but I don't know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Rock Band makes people worse singers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was like, I remember it was rough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, you know,
I'm not one to judge singers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I'm (beep) myself, but I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this is, this is hard to drink with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like Wedding Singer vibes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even worse than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
- It was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think just the
problem with having themed bars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the UK especially is
that if you are going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> for like a more delicate
theme, that requires more, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, that requires more
thought and more precision </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that you have to make
everything drunk-proof </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and not just drunk-proof, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but just like UK-people drunk-proof. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like a much higher level. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Chaos-proof. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This board game bar had a bouncer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So that, that should tell you how much, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this state of the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the absolute state, like
a board game bar, right, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Where you would think that, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> us nerds would go, right,
we're like chill, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We need a (beep)ing bouncer for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, hold it right there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's your top score on Scrabble? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sort of that you got a
mortgage that property, mate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Gotta stop you right there, you
broke our Monopoly, get out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you finished your
Monopoly game, you can go, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We got someone stabbed over
a game of UNO the other night, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I gotta do a pat down real quick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's kind sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, like what's wrong with us? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Why can't we just
(beep)ing be (beep) for... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've heard there's a lot of really fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> board game bars in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never been to any of them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I know of a couple
that I wanna to go to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's a few in London, actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] There's one
new gaming bar in, in Juku </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that actually just (speaking off mic). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Well there's one next
to the Arosa bar, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Arosa Cafe in Akihabara, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a board game bar there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Problem is you need
one that you'd kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> if you can't read Japanese,
you need be somewhat familiar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> with the game.
- Yeah, sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's fine if
you know a lot of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> or you have someone who can explain. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Most of these games, I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't wanna read the manual. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll play it with someone who knows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They can just explain.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's much better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like if there is
anyone living in the UK </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that just does legitimately
go to a cool themed bar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please, I would actually like to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if the UK, bar game has improved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since I've moved out of the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd love that, too.
Because like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> compared into what's
available internationally, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it is, it is weak. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I will say that, it is weak,
but I mean, I understand it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why, hello, you lovely listeners </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> Back to the show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched more anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I did, too, actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - What did you watch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I watched "Attack on Titan." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, me too, me, too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is going on now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's watched as Joey's
only, and first anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't just drop this
bombshell on me, guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I tweeted.
- Watch anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I tweeted about how the
first two episodes were wild. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I immediately silenced... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you gotta mute it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I muted it, didn't see it at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But I guarantee all
the comments, all like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "You don't watch anime." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well after this episode
comes out, I think episode six. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Something like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only 12 episodes this season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's ending. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had to go back a couple of episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> just because it really does
just like throw you in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, it is just
a continuation, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I'd completely
forgotten about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, it's just
the new season, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, I was
waiting for like the recap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, where is it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Where is it, what's happening? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because like not now
anime has this thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where they call things seasons </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but they're really not (beep)ing seasons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's just parts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's Final Season, Part Two.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wasn't there a Part Two of Season Three? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, there was a Part
Two of Season Three as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So Season Three, Part
One, Season Three, Part Two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then Final Season, Part
One, Final Season Part Two. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause like the last season
wasn't really a season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it was just a story that was cut </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right in the middle of the story, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I wouldn't really call
that like a full season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So this was just like the continuation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the Attack on Titan season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I completely forgotten
about that when I started </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the first episode of Part Two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So weird to (beep)ing say that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate that.
- Final Season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - When I started episode
one, Final Season, Part Two. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Final Season, the actual final season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, the actual final
season supposedly, but yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jajar looks pretty good this season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Jajar looks pretty good this season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It isn't even that bad actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The attacks have gotten a lot better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- In CGI. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno what people...
- I haven't actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the new Attack on Titan season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno if I'm just being
like, I'm just used to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah, I think the CGI Titans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> look a lot better than they
did in the previous seasons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't really notice it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> until I saw on Twitter that
people were complaining about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like...
- Oh, well, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> They complain about anything CGI. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - They feel like detectives. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw it, I found the CGI, I did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I saw part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you cross reference the manga panel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that they took this from. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I saw a guy on Twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> complaining about the CGI
in Part Six of Jojo as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the other day where he was literally like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno who it was, where I saw an image </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was like side-by-side comparison. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw this one.
- Like arrows of just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is Part Five, and
this is how many CGI things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are in the background,
and this is Part Six </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is how many CGI things
there are in the background. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm, we are getting to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the (beep)ing always sunny
Charlie meme at this point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't comment on the Attack
on Titan Final Season CGI, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but it wasn't too bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Why do people do that?
- Part One. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - People just hate CGI,
they're just like the 2D style </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I get it, you know, obviously
I would prefer the 2D, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I don't I wouldn't use any
sleepover CGI being included. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not...
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, does it affect the story? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or the impact of the story? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get more annoyed when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they just don't even animate stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I think there was
a fight in the previous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Part One Final Season that
I wish they'd animated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (talking and laughing over each other) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Final Season.
- Which part? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Final Season, Part
One, there is a fight in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that I wish that they'd
actually done something with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they just kind of
didn't show anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> They kinda like cut to the aftermath. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's when I'm like, well, that's (beep). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, show me something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if it's CGI, I'd love to see it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Perhaps something to do with Levi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know the moment you're thinking of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That one was kind of disappointing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Show anything, that's where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, this is (beep) when
they're not even showing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the fight.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's when it bothers me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only thing I would say that I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has been a step down is that the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Attack on Titan Final
Season has been amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but compared to like what
previous seasons did, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there wasn't like that epic
oh my God fight moments. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like that's the only
thing that's really missing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from this final season
or that has been missing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like, there are
some amazing action moments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the previous seasons and this one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has just been amazing for the
story and for the conflict. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I look forward less and
less for the action scenes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and more so what's gonna
happen, whereas, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like Season Three, Part One
had that glorious scene, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> which you've probably seen
all over 'cause the gifs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are like (talking over each other). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the Levi one.
- That (beep)'s insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like anything involving
Levi is just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was kinda interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember when that
came out, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone was like joking
that Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Season Two was so boring.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That scene came out in Season Three. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Part One, Part One. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, Part One, and everyone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like a Attack
on Titan hype again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone was like that one scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made everyone hype for Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was so well done, it was insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, there were even like some scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in Season Two though, like
(beep)ing incredible as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - People just didn't care 'cause
it took five years, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like four years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it took like,
yeah, five, six years? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was also the point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it was also the point where
the story started to get like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> had like the political side of it all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the story and the world... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, Season Two was slow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it was a lot harder for
people to get like hyped over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were gonna be like, yo
politics, hype, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> they wasn't gonna.
- I think that's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it was like so
different from Season One </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because Season One was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it was so fast-paced and so
action packed that people like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was so cut and dry and
like straight to the point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is what's happening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You're gonna get hyped for this fight, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this fight, this fight, this fight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm glad they slowed it down in Season Two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and literally like
built up the characters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> built up as well because now I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so much better for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a much...
- It's like a payoff show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like the action scenes now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> has just become like so much greater </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even though part the Final
Season, Part Two right now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there isn't really any like
fight scene that's made me go, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I've only seen
the first two episodes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like there hasn't been a fight scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's made me go like,
yo or anything like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything's a fight right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - If anything, the one thing
that's been talked about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that (beep)ing face, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Oh my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mean (beep). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even know the
context of that face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've I've seen it like on my timeline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That caught me off guard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That caught me off guard as well, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, whoa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a horror anime
now, what the (beep)? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess it'll be interesting to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how our opinions change when it's over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and to see our final thoughts on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That would be interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that would be interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Following it now for
like, I don't know, six... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you think, do you feel
like this is the anime that has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like just defined this modern
generation of anime fans? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is gonna be the show
for the next 10 years that when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> someone was like, well I wanna
watch anime, what do I watch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watch Attack of the Titans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You go back on the
greats of the two thousands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like, well Attack
on Titan, obviously, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - you know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is, like as much
people wanna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no it's (beep), whatever
'cause they wanna have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a counter opinion, like, no it is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is a good show.
- It's a great show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In this generation.
- I'm interested to see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how the ending is gonna go down because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whether it is good or
not, 'cause I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I'm not a mind reader,
whether it's good or not, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the anime community is
probably gonna explode </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> one way or the other,
right, through discussion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know how I've
like (beep)ing dodged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these spoilers, I don't know anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because whenever you even like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> utter the word Attack on Titan ending, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> all the (beep)ing mongerators
come out of the shadows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like war veterans being like, ah... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll soon see one of these... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All I know is it's divisive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That's good, that means
it's gonna be interesting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- I'm excited. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause if everyone
agreed, like it's decent, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd be like (beep). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now that I know it's divisive, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that I'm I'm in for something good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like preparing a nuclear shelter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a (beep)ing Twitter that's... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When the ending comes
out I know that Twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna be like a (beep)ing
landmine, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] I'm hyped, I'm
hyped for it, I'm hyped. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Any opinion will be shattered
by the opposite party. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna be one of those
shows where you just need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to watch it just so you
can have a take on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know like your personality
is going to be defined </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> on whether you on what take you have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> on the Attack of Titan... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Match.com will be asking what you felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the ending of Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So my credentials for
a boyfriend over six feet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> thought the ending of
Attack on Titan was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> If you don't fit these, get out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how you know,
man, it'll be interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm really, really hyped,
and also it's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> the longest anime that
I've been following, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, okay, it's finally
like an end is in sight. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like an actual ending,
not a oh they (beep)ed up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> the production, oh, it's gone
now, it's never coming back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like an actual wrap
up of a long running thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I can't even remember
the last time I experienced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like this where I
was just watching an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was like, it just ended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I had to wait years for it to end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually, I know it's even (indistinct), </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but aside from that, I
just realized it's just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wasn't there from the start. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like for me, it's like,
'cause I've been there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like the beginning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've lived through this.
- I'll lived through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - the initial hype, every single phase </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of Attack on Titan hype and
controversy and everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've been through it all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So having it come to an
end is gonna feel so weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause even like, if you
were like, all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well One Piece, yeah,
but One Piece was around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before you were around, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Started in '96, '98? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like imagine if you're like a 50-year old </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Japanese salary man who's
been reading One Piece </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> since your 20s, it must
be like really weird </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to think that one day it's gonna end. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- Unless you've been around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> forever and conscious around
every single phase of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what a bunch of
50-year old salary men </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> were like when Naruto ended, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, true.
- They were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like bleach, right, it
was like, oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was crazy.
- (Beep)in' over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. Like
to me Naratu ending got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so soured by the fact
that Boruto, I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like announced rightly
even like before it ended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just like, well it's
an ending, I'm emotional, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but I know it's not really ending... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause there's more of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause like there's already more of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wish I could go back
and watch Death Note, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like what episode one,
through like 30 seconds, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just log onto Twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know I oh, (laughing and
talking over each other). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Hunter as well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like going in...
- Join the anime... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Could you imagine if you
were around when Death Note </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was, if it was an anime only,
and it was like week by week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Holy (beep), that would have been crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish I was there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was there during
the second half of when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the manga was serializing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And even that was (beep)ing crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like it obviously started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> before I started reading Shonen Jump. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had to like do a quick
catch up to like keep up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with everyone, and even then
that was (beep)ing crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only imagine the levels of hype </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that it would have reached nowadays </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> if something like that dropped today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was weird because
I was one of the guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who was watching like
Death Note when it aired, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was just a different
vibe because rather than people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> discussing it weekly, you just had people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> be like, watch Death Note, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you could only get like
discussions of the entire show </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> after it had finished.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - As opposed to, yo, did you
catch the newest episode? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> (Beep)ing...
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I letter got removed from the alphabet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, that was (beep)ing insane, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is true though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish I could have been around
with something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so, I guess, I don't
know what the next show is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's gonna be like
that one, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe Mushoku Tensei, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe.
- I hope so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a hard shoe to
fill just because it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you very rarely see anime
that literally appeals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to everyone and has everything
that everyone likes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Everything is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do hope the next one is Mushoku Tensei </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they literally created a studio </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just to make this one show,
but they kind of need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because of how long the story is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It follows like his entire life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many episodes do you think? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably need like six seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Six seasons, that's not that many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to like One Piece or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, in terms of that
many high quality episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like a lot.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's true, too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It feels like more like an autobiography </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a biography of
a fictional character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like you guys ever seen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Boyhood, or that movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah, that sounds so familiar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was an movie that
like took 15 years to make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> because it basically is
the story of this kid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and how they did it is
that they filmed every year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> for 15 years, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's pretty cool.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, so they, yeah, do you remember that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I think, didn't it win an Oscar? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You'd (beep)in' hope so.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - After 15 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was sort of a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Was it Boyhood, I can't
remember if that was... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Boyhood, there was
a movie like that with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, now you can just go on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and watch those family
channels just raise their kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can just, who needs that now? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That groundbreaking thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> has now been turned into ad revenue. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So now a compelling piece of media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is just film farmed on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why condense it into
a feature-length film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when you could make multiple seasons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> of that (beep)?
- So much more ad revenue </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you're doing, you
know, day by day uploads. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, my kid (beep)
himself vlog, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like episode 4700. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you don't seen those, they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> the kid gets called up by the
principal and they film it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're like filming picking
the kid up from school </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> after he's been like kicked out of school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- That (beep) is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Family vlog channels are so weird to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the most scariest
part of the internet for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what scares me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't imagine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It scares me because I can't imagine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it's the complete opposite of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a healthy environment to
raise children in, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know it's awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine you're a kid and
you are just like growing up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just thinking that
everything you're gonna do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna be filmed and you
have to like permanently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be on entertaining mode.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We are only years away from
like the first influencer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> who was raised in an
influencer, like, house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean they're probably all ready born. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, as in like,
what I'm saying is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> there's probably, there
must be one of those kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> on one of those family
channels that's gonna be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first big like YouTuber or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where his whole entire
life has been documented </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> willingly, awful.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Awful, awful, just not black
mirror (beep) right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it really is.
- Literally just Truman Show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right.
- It is Truman Show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Terrifying, terrifying stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The kid is raised, not, not, not on his, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what he should be taught in school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but how to use Google
Analytics and Google Trends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> What a terrifying thought,
what a terrifying thought. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So scary. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> What did you wanna say, Ashley? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] What do you wanna
know about Boyhood, it won... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - How long did it like take to make. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 2002 to 2013, so.
- So 11 years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 11 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know it got like canceled,
almost got canceled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause the cast members just
wanted to stop doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like imagine being tied to
a project for like 11 years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and having to do this
one thing every year, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though you never know
if the film is gonna be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even be finished and released. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean that's, yeah,
that's 'cause like 11 years </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is literally, you know, a
kid just starting school </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to almost graduating school. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean.
- Especially for a kid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that is the
entire point of the movie </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you literally get
to see this kid grow up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my God.
- A lot of it wasn't scripted. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> A lot of it, I might be talking my (beep), </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like I think I had a rough plan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but because they didn't know
what would happen in life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Sometimes they had to change
the script every year, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> depending on what happens,
so I mean, I highly recommend </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you guys watch it, it's
a (beep)ing amazing film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sounds good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because like it's rare to see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a project that lasts for a long time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you get to see the
end of that project. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think some some things
like Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is such a rarity that we
should cherish it whenever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we do get to see something like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess I had a normal anime weekend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I also watched the
new season of Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ah.
- Oh yeah, how is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been meaning to start it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so good, it's crazy, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I watched the movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> right before I watched the new season, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the animation in the season </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> was like way better than the movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really?
- I'm not kidding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was watching the trailer thinking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting for some like insane, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movie budget animation kick in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, oh it's not
really that much different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the episodes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would say the last fight
scene was pretty crazy though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The last fight scene was...
- But nothing like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - they didn't already do in the TV show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess, yeah, the bar
of quality was pretty high. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know who's in
charge of the animation there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but holy (beep), how do
they even step it up more? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like there was a... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man discovers Euphoria Tape. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (talking and laughing over each other) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is another level.
- Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like how do
they keep doing this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do they keep getting away with it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like Mapper as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like every year they
just step it up somehow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Generally the new season of
Demon Slayer is really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I hate to be that
normally guy who's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yo, I just heard of this amazing anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (background noise drowns out other sounds) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's good, it's really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Really (beep)ing good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've been meaning to start it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I did actually finally
get around to watching it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, after all those years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I really enjoyed it, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's ironic, I wanna watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't seen the new
season of Demon Slayer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's one of those
shows where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll watch it when I
feel like watching anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with no pressure to like make
a (beep)ing video about it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You'll know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like to
me, like Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Demon Slayer, everyone
always knows these shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't need to make another
video about them yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Think about it, the effort. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on, it wraps up,
gotta do another attack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll do I'll do
another one when it ends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to.
And then that'll be it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I've made like
(beep)ing four videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Attack on Titan is still a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't form an opinion
unless Garnt also agrees with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking over each other) on
his video about it, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> If he says it's a masterpiece,
it's a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's a strong
nine to a light 10, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like okay, there we go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, would you
say Demon Slayer, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would you say it's as
good as the first season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or is it like even better? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - When did the last season come out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How many years ago is that now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 20...
- 2019. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right before we moved
to Japan then, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it 2019, I thought
it was before that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I feel like,
(talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like I'm forgetting, but
I feel like it's better </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than the first season. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I've been
enjoying it a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they got like right
into it, it was nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> No (beep)ing around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It was good, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like the first season, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it did take a lot of time to get going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I felt like it was just
like the first half </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> of Demon Slayer, Season One is, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just very standard
Shonen stuff, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, it was nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like comfort food, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You knew what you were getting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It was only until like
the (beep)ing spider rock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where I feel like it actually got... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, kicked off.
- Really, really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like this season so
far I've I'm on episode seven. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, really impressed with it so far. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Not a single episode I thought was boring. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Pacing's really good,
animation is just God tier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I must say like one aspect of Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I've just like never
really understood is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno, it's a good show, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but do you think it deserves
as much of like an insane hype </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in Japan as it does? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - what do you mean in
Japan, it's worldwide. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, but like, I feel in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's on another level.
- It's hard to explain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you don't live here like how insane </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the hype (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like everyone knows Kimetsu </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is (beep)ing popular everywhere, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like everyone's watching the new season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone went to go see the new movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like in Japan, when
I say so when something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> is inescapable that I
feel Kimetsu in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> perfectly suits that word
because everywhere you look, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> some product or some store or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is doing something with Kimetsu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even like five year olds to
like 80 year old grandfathers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like my entire Japanese
side of the family has like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> a favorite, like a top three
characters in Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> so I have like a four
year old cousin, right, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who obviously loves Demon Slayer, right, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because (beep)ing every kid
loves Demon Slayer right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So like for Christmas I was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Breathing young. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So for Christmas I was like,
I'm gonna get him something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Demon Slayer-related, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I asked his mom, my
cousin, just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is his favorite a character, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And she just lists off like
two or three characters. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, all right, cool, easy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then she was like, oh, by the way, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I like this character, your
uncle likes this character. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Your aunt likes this character. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Imagine my 60-something
year old uncle being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah, I (beep)ing love Shinobu, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She's just like my (beep)ing
favorite character. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like that's so weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so weird how in Japan
literally every one of every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> age generation is watching
Demon Slayer or has watched it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's intense.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you think it's the
movie that's got it this big </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I didn't realize how big it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I think...
- It was already big before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think.
- Oh, yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How big it already is was the
reason why the movie's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the (beep)ing like highest
grossing from all time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause like that one
year where it beat out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> One Piece by manga sales
like tenfold or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it was, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Before like, it was like
the years before that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the top selling manga was like One Piece, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> One Piece, One Piece, One
Piece, One Piece, One Piece. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Well like a long shot, and
then Demon Slayer came out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let me like 10 times
like your previous sales. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It hilarious when you saw the graph </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was like all these
other's shown in jump stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it's like One Piece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Because within 2019, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the rankings for like (speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rankings, like Demon
Slayer was like every week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every, yeah it was every week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] Jujutsu Kaisen
came out (speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like second and
first, and then like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a fight between Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was going to say Jujutsu
Kaisen seems almost equally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as inescapable recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause of the new movie.
- 'Cause of the new movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 'cause of the new
movie, but even before that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like after he got released,
it just seemed like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it had such a big explosion,
and I'm not sure like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I haven't been living in
Japan long enough to see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how big or how
fast trends come and go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like it was way bigger than I thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was going to be.
- Yeah, I mean like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in Japan trends come and go so quickly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because I feel once
something trends in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan just milks the
absolute (beep) out it like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, throw it back,
if you can remember PPAP, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for instance back in the
(beep)ing day, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For you kids, that's
Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> When that was (beep)ing big,
like three or four years ago, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> however longer it was.
- It was longer than that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it was longer than that, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that was (beep)ing
everywhere in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's crazy, like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - So when you go to the
supermarket, they play it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, right, like it
still has staying power, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what it is about
Demon Slayer specifically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to like a
trending anime in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because every, I feel there's
all always that one series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that is trending
everywhere in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like during the different
periods, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's nothing new to Demon
Slayer, I feel, in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I was like, what is it
about Demon Slayer specifically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that it's literally appealing
to every single generation? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know.
- I don't get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird.
- It's a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Doesn't really have like
the family- friendly appeal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like I can't imagine a four year old </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching these demons, like
heads getting cut off, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Being like, ha ha ha, ha. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not the same as like
Beauty and The Beast, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, right, it's not like a Disney IP </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or, you know, like a Pixar IP
or anything like that, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it can appeal to the family. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Even comparing it to like
other anime or other Shonen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's it's good, it's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a good show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time I make this
argument, people just think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, you're just a Demon Slayer like hater. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I'm not, I enjoy the show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but I just don't understand
what about this show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> specifically that is
literally inescapable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don't even think it's
like my top three Shonen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, it's definitely not in
my top three Shonen, it's not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> But the animation is just so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It makes it so easy to watch, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, this is just amazing, it's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the thing is it's not only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because of the anime though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but because you know,
like the manga sales, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's something like
fundamental about Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that is somehow appealing to
everyone and I don't get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And yet, the run time of
the manga was so short. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Someone needs to write </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a (beep)ing dissertation on this man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it is genuinely, really interesting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I like, as good as Demon Slayer is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how unique it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not...
- Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not exceedingly unique
in any one aspect at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it's not like One
Piece that's been around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for, you know, a hundred volumes, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I think Demon Slayer
only has like 23, 24 volumes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something, which for a Shonen
Jump manga is really short. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are there just this many
mouth breathers in the world? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just, it's only mouth breathers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe they were just lying in wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They come out from their basements. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like finally representation, all rise! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The total concentration technique </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is breathing through your nose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Take that ball gag out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - My nose has been blocked
for like two weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been a mouth breather for two weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I watched it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Finally I can relate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can relate to this anime. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> What is even like the top
character in Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in terms of like popularity? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - In terms of popularity?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gotta be Tanjiro, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Is it Tanjiro? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's...
- No, it's not Zenitsu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, it's...
- No, it's not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, this...
- I can see it, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is a lot of Zenitsu fans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like, it depends because I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the top five definitely is like Tanjiro, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Nezuko, Zenitsu, Agatsuma, and Shinobu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> as like the top five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like hardcore fans, and
there's a lot of hardcore fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan, all love all of the Hashiras. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the Hashiras are pretty cute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's you know, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if that's like
their way of being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, I'm a true fan.
- Yeah, 'cause like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> with some shows you immediately know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the most popular
character's gonna be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like Jujutsu Kaisen, it's
easily gonna be Gojo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah.
- That character was built </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be the most popular character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like in, Demon Slayer,
you just don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> who is gonna like, I can't
think who it's gonna be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if it's Zenitsu, then... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've lost hope with Zenitsu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm glad I'm not the only one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who can't (beep)ing stand Zenitsu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Saemi's so much cooler than Zenitsu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I (beep)in' hate Zenitsu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't understand Zenitsu fans. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, it's, I
mean, it's like I said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a good show.
- She's relatable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (talking and laughing over each other) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wish they wish they had some power </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that could make them useful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm joking, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know why the cast is popular. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you can call every
character a cinnamon bun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's...
- Why, why can you do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno.
- I hate you guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't say that (beep). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dunno, Kamchacha. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm trying to like
understand this myself, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's such an interesting social study, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just because we've seen the anime market. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - (beep) your, your ENTP type,
whatever the (beep) it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tell me your favorite Hashira. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how I know if you're a real dealer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (Beep) your star sign.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're a Zodiac cringe, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Tell me your favorite Hashira and why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Update that match.com for a profile. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, put that in the match.com profile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Before Demon Slayer,
what would you say was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the biggest like kind of
cultural trend in terms of anime? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Has there been like an anime? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure there must have
been like other animes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that have...
- Yeah in terms of like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Call the Japanese public </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as much as Demon Player is doing now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Slam Dunk back in the
day was definitely like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] That was Japan
though mainly, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, in Japan, was like Slam Dunk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> was so big it became
a cultural phenomenon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you asking in
Japan or like the world? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not asking in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think in the world
there has been one yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, not really.
- No, not yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - One Punch Man was for a
little bit while it was out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I look at One Punch
Man and I'm just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a big deal when it came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was a big deal, but I see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Attack on Titan, Season Four being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bigger deal now.
- That's 'cause it's had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> more time to brew.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's had more time to like relish it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But even then comparing like
Attack on Titan, Season Four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to some like other mainstream
stuff, it's not there yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It had hype, but it
didn't really create like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a cultural like shift or anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whereas like sometimes you see in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is a show that comes
long that does create </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a cultural shift, like
Slam Dunk back in the day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - My Hero, maybe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't, My Hero?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's hard to say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] My Hero was really big here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is really big here.
- It is really big. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like Demon Slayer was
just 1,000,000 times bigger. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like the My Hero hype train, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like we thought the My
Hero hype train was big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then Demon Slayer came out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though I think they're
like in terms of show quality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're around about the same... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, they're not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - When we're all getting
into this, Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> We are not getting into this, Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just saying, I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, which, which side are you on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think Demon Slayer is much better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> than My Hero.
- Okay, I agree with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I agree. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - How are you comparing them, (beep) off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, I, I, I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, in the grand scheme of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's they're
of like comparable level </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of quality in terms of like
if someone wants to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm looking forward
to the song right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What I'm trying to say is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if they prefer My Hero
Academia over Demon Slayer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna lose my (beep)
unlike a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the community, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My Hero fell off, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My Hero fell off, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing and talking over each other) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Bro, My Hero took the
(talking over each other). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look, everyone's telling me
that My Hero's gonna come back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and see Season Six with the
My Villains Academia Arc, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I've heard it's amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It might be amazing, it's Shonen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what Black Clover fans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> have been seen for years now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And it literally hasn't
escaped out of the manga fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> We all know this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno what happened with
My Hero on Season Three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It just became like a snore-fest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't even get to that point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I couldn't believe I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched like Season Three and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bored out my mind watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, this is so boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just do something then,
have something happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Be heroes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Leave school or something
for (beep)'s sake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is why Hunter Hunter was good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they (beep)ing moved,
they actually did something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They like got on with the (beep)ing storm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Until they didn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Until he stopped writing it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's why the story stopped. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Not because he just kept going in, like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like an I purgatory
at this (beep)in' school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, as an an anime only, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think what drew me
(talking over each other). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, as what drew me out
of like what made me lose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of hype between,
in My Hero was, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first few arcs would
concentrate on the school kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing their thing and I'm like, cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're getting to see progression. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they started
introducing the wider world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the heroes and like these bigger, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these like vast plots that like
pertain to the entire world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're like, cool, this is
amazing, this is interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's go back to high school afterwards. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> How can you do this to me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, let's go to, let's
go to a concert arc that I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't give a (beep) about
where you just introduced like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the entire villain's world,
and I'm just like, and yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It feels torn 'cause you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just leave the safety net, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just leave it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like you clearly have built
this world that's interesting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think everyone likes the world. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Just let them get outta school,
push them, come on, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually expand upon it.
- Get on with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like actually do it,
but I get it, it's safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You can milk it, you can
get 10 more years out of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Stay in the (beep)in'
school, never leave it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well isn't isn't the manga ending soon? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the manga's ending soon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this year, right?
- Right outta high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They eventually get out of school? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Ashley speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm never gonna finish it
'cause I've lost all interest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in the anime because I was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't wait for these clips
to get (beep)ing clipped, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and put on Twitter out of context. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't wait for Shonen to Twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get on our asses for these clips. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (beep), they're My Hero
fans, what're they gonna do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Ask their Mum for more Fortnite
or Roblox, like (beep) off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mama, cancel my Trash Taste merch! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Come on, it fell off, it fell off, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It did, it did, L-Ratio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one talks about it,
no one talks about My Hero. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's the biggest thing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I don't even think it's bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think it just...
- It got boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just got boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, I didn't hate it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> but like no one talks about it now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like there's no
point in watching it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause who am I gonna talk to
about it, no one watches it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I, you
know, maybe the hype </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> might get reinvigorated in the new season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe Margaritas are
right, maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it is that good of
a season where everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets back on the hype train, fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll be a normie, I'll jump
back on that hype train. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll get back into it, but like I need </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> a promise that something's
gonna (beep)in' happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like, it's been like a season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and a half of just boring
stuff and it's been like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> two movies of just boring stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I watched the
movie in the cinema as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was just like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I heard it was just a milk fest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, well it was just nothing happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like I felt
like I went in the loo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that's what I hate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about Shonen movies in particular, right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like Demon Slayer
is like an exception </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> because that actually
adapted the manga, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But to me Shonen movies just feel like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very high budget filler episodes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where you watch the movie,
has pretty animation. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be in every One Piece movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, I mean every One Piece movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true, that's why
I don't watch anime movies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause there's just big
fillers that make money. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is true.
- But I'm glad to see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I finally feel like Demon
Slayer finally figured out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to make a (beep) ton
of money whilst also not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (beep)ing off TV watchers,
just release the movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> make your billion dollars,
and then just be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hey guys, before the new season starts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here are your list in 20 chunk
epi-, in 20 minute chunks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can just watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought that's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing about the movie
is I remember watching it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember thinking this
just feels like a TV season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It literally had points
where I could feel where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it cuts off for an episode,
and then it continued. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get the money of the movie
but then keep the TV style. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, so many more series
are gonna start doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because of how (talking over each other). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I guaran(beep)ing-tee
Attack on Titan's gonna do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I have a feeling, I have this like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In what way?
- I have this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you think? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have this gut feeling.
- I don't think they will. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you think about the ending </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of Attack on Titan is going to be a movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bold prediction, I think
it's gonna be a movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, they wouldn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's no way...
- It would be leaked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's no way, there
is no (beep)ing way, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like people in the industry
saw how good Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did financially for the industry and go, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> we can do that again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I bet your tenfold hat on that, Joe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Attack of Titan Final Movie Part One. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guarantee.
- Of three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm going to bold prediction. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care if this
ends up being all like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> pull the age things, bold prediction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's gonna be a movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - (Ashley speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but that was a pretty-cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that was a pretty cool, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Yeah, but still
it actually pre-tells. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to know the characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Does the Jujutsu Kaisen movie
follow any source material? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] They actually
release the prequel manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's a prequel manga that... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] So it kind of follows
the same formula as the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all I care about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just don't wanna, like
when I watch anime movies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanna know that I'm
not watching a filler episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, look, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Don't get me wrong, I've
I've seen like almost all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the One Piece movies and they're fun, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I'm not (beep)ing
on the edge of my seat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waiting for the next one.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know what you're going
into with a Shonen anime movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, what's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's gonna be the very bog
standard three act structure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> where you know exactly what's gonna happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how it's happen, maybe
there'll be a slight twist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, at the end of
the day, it all gets resolved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the plot needs to
be resolved to move on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It can't be exciting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just introduction,
conflict, resolution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then we end up in
the exactly the same place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that we started.
- Because it has to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - All the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what sucks, and that's
why I have no interest in... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And thus, they continued on their quest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's how it ends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you think that Chainsaw
Man getting released </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this year is going to
reach the same heights </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as Jujutsu Kaisen?
- I would hope. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would like it to.
- What I want to get... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - As a fan of the manga, I want this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to be talked about this more.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have a feeling it definitely
has that potential now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's been a long time
since I've seen people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hype up this one IP this much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I remember watching the trailer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the trailer just like,
you felt like the trailer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just broke the (beep)ing
anime Twitter for the day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it got like a million views in a day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> on Twitter or something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Less than a day.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It got like a million
likes, like the actual tweet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] That's crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is (beep)ing nuts
for an anime trailer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It did not fall off,
did not get ratioed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> No, it did not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It ratioed every other anime trailer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] That's for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just hope like the hype
doesn't collapse in on itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone starts watching it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people are just like, oh,
this wasn't as good as it... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's what I'm really scared of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really hope Map will like
actually pull through with... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't see why we have any
reason to doubt Map though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't doubt that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For Mapper or just like
collecting the infinity stones? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, they're killing it right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Attack on Titan, did
you see Jujutsu Kaisen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (beep)in' Chainsaw Man?
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm praying, I'm praying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that was, that was the anime talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of Trash Taste.
- we have a clear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just still dislike the
quarantine zone for anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No more anime (talking over each other). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> No more anime for... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even enough outtakes for one anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like there's, that's really like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> from what I can see, I mean
the, the only memorable things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that people are gonna remember this season </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> are probably those shows.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And My Dress-Up Darling, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's pretty much going to be it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Manga's good.
- That's a good show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I've only seen like two episodes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is what happens
when those kind of rom coms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or not slice of life, but kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I dunno how to describe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That kind of genre of thing
comes out, it always comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's like 10 outta 10, 10 outta 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone, everyone, everyone
hypes it the (beep) up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like the best anime,
and then no one talks about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like right after it's gone,
it's like it's forgotten, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like to this day, there's still like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Naruto, Naratu, Naratu, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you, it's never gone,
like, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Can you really fault me
for not watching anime? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I guess
that's 'cause maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the characters you can't speculate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much about or whatever, but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, like Naruto is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was a long running series that were... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot more, more grandiose and such. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt's girlfriend,
that's grandiose, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's grandiose. (everyone
laughing hysterically) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's grandiose. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - (audio cutting out)
you're rooting for, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Big moments, big (beeps).
- Big plot twists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big plot twists.
- Big plot twists. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am I right, Connor?
- NGR? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's got everything you could
speculate about on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't wait for Season
Two of Rent-A-Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, I want those
videos where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how like in those
Naruto YouTube videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like what if thingy went against thingy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they speculate it and it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what if the main protagonist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from Rent-A-Girlfriend went on Tinder? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's speculate how well he would do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Personally, I think he would
get a success rate of 95%. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He'd be slaying, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's just the theory. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Lemme know down below, everyone's
like fighting and I dunno. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - How dare he make that speculation? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, I mean, I believe
when Rent-A-Girlfriend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Season Two comes out that's
going to be worth watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that arc is
legitimately going to be good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it gonna cover that chapter though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I shouldn't have
brought up Rent-A-Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I should have, you know,
you were gonna bring it up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> so many times.
- It's the most excited </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's been entire episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're so happy though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just not, I, I, I can't hear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Rent-A-Girlfriend now
without just laughing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's some real clown (beep) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If, if you know, you
know, like it's like, it's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel sorry for anime early watchers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're gonna watch season two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're gonna think it's really good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it, it was a really
good, it was a really good arc, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're not gonna know
what they have coming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They'll never know what hit 'em. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They'll never know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what what's waiting for
them on the other side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess we're done talking about anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, stop talking about anime now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We, everyone leaves.
- This is it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This this is your anime talk for the year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Finally played 13 Sentinels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> after Garnt's recommendation last week? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yep, I beat it in three days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so obviously you
guys watched last week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I recommended 13
Sentinels to these guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I thought, you know, I
didn't know if they would take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my recommendation or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's in the well of recommendations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I was just like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna continue playing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like playing it at a comfortable pace. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then three days after recording, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey texts me and goes,
I finished 13 Sentinels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the (beep), Joey! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally went home
that recording night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> downloaded it, started playing. I play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I'll give it a
couple of hours, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like, like as Garnt said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll give it a couple of
hours just to warm up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> See if I even get into the groove. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I got into the groove all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because the three days after that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just me waking up
having like six coffees </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just so I could (beep)ing
stay focused in this game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Playing it for like 10
to 12 hours straight </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and going to bed.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- It is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now that I have someone
to talk to it about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I can, without spoiling it.
- We can't talk about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We can't talk about it because like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I get like now someone finally understands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I actually think 13 Sentinels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> might be the most insane
plot I've ever seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in a video game and I
haven't even finished it yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, it is by far one
of the craziest like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> video game stories or
just stories in general, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've like sat through.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, so Garnt last
week made the comparison </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it's like Bokurano mixed
with Steins Gate, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As someone who's finished the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can say he's right on that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But only on like a surface level </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's like, it
has elements of Bokurano, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like with the robots, and it
has elements of Steins Gate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is the time traveling aspect. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then you combine that with like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Ghost in the Shell and The Matrix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And just imagine all four of
those mashed into one story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - How is that cohesive? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Somehow, I don't know how.
- I don't know how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they did it, but it is cohesive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Out of 10, out of 10? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like strong nine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't finished it
yet, but like playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through it now, you get to about the third </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of the way point, right,
and you think like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm gonna say there are twists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously.
- You don't say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are...
- Don't spoil anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are twists in this
story and I remember getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about a third of the way through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, I know the
twist that's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know that's gonna happen,
and then sure enough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what I predicted happened,
and then that was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the twist that leaded into another twist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that leaded into a (beep)ing bigger twist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - There were moments as I was playing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially the second
half, where you think like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like, all right, this
same story has been told </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from 13 different perspectives, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So you're like, so you follow everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're like, okay, I think
I know what's going on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think I can predict
what's about to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But there were moments where
a character would say one line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I literally have to
put my controller down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to be like, I don't
believe you just said that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because now what I thought
I knew about this game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is completely out of the window. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, enough.
- But it's still, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it doesn't come
outta left field either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I genuinely want to know...
- What the writing process. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the writing processes is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so insane how many
times you get (beep)in' </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actual physical whiplash
for like new plot elements </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that get added that seems that make, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it's like bat (beep) crazy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you explain it outta context. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like in context, it
makes the most perfect sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It makes perfect sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It makes like the (beep)ing
Fate Law look like Disney. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, Kingdom.
- I think I said to Garnt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I texted Garnt saying it
makes the Kingdom Hearts Law </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> look like Sesame street. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, Kingdom Heart
fans are going finally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can hear a story I can
follow along with you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's like, I can't put into words </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how actual insane in the story is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's (beep)ing incredible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It works, I dunno how it
works, but it just does. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, and, and we were saying like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how more people
haven't heard about this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even in like the JRPG community </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause even like the JRPG community </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a very tight-knit community where as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if something's good, you
normally hear about it from about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from like five different
people in the JRPG community. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think the problem is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because when I tweeted out about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I was gonna maybe get like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three people being like, woo,
you know, about it, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because again, you don't
hear about it, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it just like
opened the hatch and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the 13 Sentinel fans came
up being like, yo, let's go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I got so much (beep)ing support </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for being like, oh, he's finally
(beep)in' played the game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've all been trying to get
him to play kind of deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, I looked
in, cause I was curious, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I looked into it being
like, why have I not heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this game until Garnt told me about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's because Atlas
put literally zero money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the marketing, so they
kind of just released it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and was like, if you
find it, here's a gem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if you don't find it, then
you'll never know it existed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't...
- Don't do any marketing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's because it's literally
impossible to explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the story without spoiling it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Actually, scratch that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's literally impossible to
explain the story, period. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even if I did spoil
it, I can't explain it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like considering
doing a Twitch stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for this play-through 'cause I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more people need to like
experience the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I was like
thinking about what would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the experience be like for a viewer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, if you switch
off for like five minutes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go, you go make a
cup of tea or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're completely (beep)ing lost again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause then you've missed
a piece of information </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's important to someone
else's plot somewhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - How long is the game total? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd say around 30 hours? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I put in like 32, 33 hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd say that's...
- Which is short for a JRPG. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was gonna say that's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> not a bad length to stream a game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say any game that
takes like over, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> If you're doing a full-time shift, right, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> let's say eight hours, if
it takes more than a week, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably too long for Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean I tried to stream
The Opposite of Seven, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's a really, really long game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And a lot of people fell off like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe like after like
stream six, stream seven. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, which is understandable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People do like those
types of games to watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> especially people who have played it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They (beep)ing love those streams </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they're like, I wanna see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The reaction.
- Someone else, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Reaction to the bits
that I thought was insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- So that that's cool, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but also, I don't know, it's easier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's normally easier to stream
those kind of games as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you're like, you're
so invested that, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it doesn't feel like you're alive almost. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just so into this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think as well, the problem I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I thought about it too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like maybe I should stream it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, but I
thought about it and like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm glad I didn't because
the reason why I played it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> back-to-back three days in
a row is because I thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to myself, if I don't play
this game for more than a day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to forget everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you forgotten everything now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of it, yeah, but
like, I remember how it ends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but like it's the build up
to how to get to that end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> which is what makes it so interesting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like you have the
beginning and the end, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and the beginning's just like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and then some way it just goes whoosh! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you're just
like, I, we're here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We made it here somehow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how we got
here, but we got here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We got here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it was a bat-(beep), insane journey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like one of the, most, it is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is literally the
sourced intro to the game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like you, like, in this game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you follow as this protagonist, or do you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have tempted to play </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you guys have hyped it up so much, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I'm like, I would have to stream it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I couldn't justify
playing a game that much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and not, not monetizing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> That's crazy.
- God forbid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna, okay, the thing is
I wanna see you try and do it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just to see, no, no, no, no, just to see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> if your audience can even keep up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even know if I can keep up, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Is there a skip option for the cut scenes? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all cut scenes.
- Oh, (beep). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's gonna be hard to not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you're basically... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do they give you options to skip? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, okay, let's get that... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is a fast forward option </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for dialogue you've already experienced, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but like...
- Because you experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the same scenes most of the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I say this with like zero
irony, you need the dialogue. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need the dialogue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know you do, that's
the thing is it's hard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause if I'm like,
the skip buttons there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's just say it's not a
game I can see you playing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's probably why I
think it would be funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to play it as well cause I'm just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> While you spent three days playing that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I spent three days, four
days playing Jump King. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Four days playing Jump King? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, how was that experience? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It looked like it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> while I was enjoying
myself in my own space, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you were being ridiculed by
tens of thousands of people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I know, I, yeah, it was tough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's tough, it's really
like soul destroying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a really good game though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna play it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know how to describe it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like when Calli was on
and talking to us about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think you can appreciate this game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and how difficult it is until you play it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I certainly didn't
because looking at it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks so simple that it...
- Yeah, it looks easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It looks so simple. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How hard can it be to
- Just jump in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jump, just jump </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how hard can it
be to judge the jump, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then you're like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well the only instinct that gives you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> like, you cannot see any
indication of how long </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this jump is gonna be other
than your muscle memory. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> How long you hold the
space bar or controller </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and how long are you gonna jump? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it is soul crushing
because there are some jumps </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's like, it is like...
- Pixel perfect? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, there's like a 1/10th
of a millisecond window </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> where you have to get it
precise, and if you (beep) it up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to go back and
do 50+ perfect jumps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get to the opportunity
to (beep) that one up again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which you'll probably (beep) up again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's really soul destroying and yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> At the first game, I beat it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I did it in one eight-hour
stream which was long, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it was fun 'cause, you know, I left </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> text-to-speech things on so
people were just insulting me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They were like Connor, you can't stream. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You can't keep streaming this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You'll get a DM save for streaming </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> White Men Can't Jump and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, Connor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just turn your monitor upside down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> You'll be making good
progress, and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just insulting me, and it was really fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it made for a really good stream. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I decided, 'cause Calli said </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that she think I could do the DLC, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I regret doing the DLC. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> The DLC was so much.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember you finishing
the original Jump King </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in like one day and
everyone's like celebrating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like good for you, 'cause I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tuning in the morning
and tuning in the night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like Connor's
still (beep)ing on this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was all on this bull(beep). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, finally, you've done it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then when I saw Calli told
you to do the DLC as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh, so it's
just a little extra </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would take like half the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Extra bonus.
- An extra bonus stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that will take half the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember tuning in one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you were doing it tuning in the next day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you were still doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, (beep) this
guy really likes this game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cruel man, the DLC is so much
harder than their base game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> So I think, I dunno how
many people have beaten </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the base game, but I know
that only 2% of the people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> who have it on stream beat the second DLC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's a third DLC,
which is even harder, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which I'm too afraid to attempt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Didn't Ludwig beat like all
three of them in like an hour. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Ludwig's insane, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think Ludwig's first run of
it though did take 40 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of the last DLC, so just like.
- Built different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - He's crazy though, he is insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like you can't appreciate these games </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and how good Ludwig is at them
until you do them yourself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And you're like, this is insanity. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like this is insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the sheer amount of
muscle memory required </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for this game is just absurd. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a frob software game, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Muscle memory. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you die a dog soldier,
you go back to the swamp point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which could be far, but
in this game it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you can lose like two hours of progress. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's like no
checkpoint anywhere, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, so the base game, there's
points where you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to where you're kind of safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't fall too far, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the second DLC, there's points </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where like you can fall massively. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's never any safe points. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And in the third one
again, there's another, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> even harsher jump, and it's just brutal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I recommend trying it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kind of
- Yeah, I wanna try it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I wanna try it as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Although, you know, there's rage games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> There's like not, not like
getting over it, but like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, there's like Cat
Mario games back in the day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like those flash games </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> where they just like troll. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just (beep)ing with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> This game was, it feels
like you never blame </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the game when you fail. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it's always you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> You were the one who didn't do it right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You never feel like you
were unfairly played. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> There are some sneaky things
they do here and there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it's a very rewarding experience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> However, I do not wanna do
it again for a long time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I had horrible anxiety on the last day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was getting to the end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wanted it to be (fuck)ing over with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was so close and if I fell, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would go all the way back down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think my heart rate was like resting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at like 110 or something
'cause it was just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was nerve wracking 'cause you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you (beep) up this one jump </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta redo it for three hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> So that's one point during
the DLC on the 2nd day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where halfway through the stream, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd gotten into the final part. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Somehow, like I was stuck
on this one stage for hours, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then I just started going through </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all the stages perfectly, and
I was on the very last stage </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, oh my
God, I'm gonna do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like my heart is like 120. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like (beep)ing holding the space bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I'd do one big (beep) up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I lose like half
the progress I'd made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I couldn't, and
the rest of the stream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I couldn't get back to where I was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just so miserable,
I went to bed just so sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, this is horrible. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I just couldn't do it, I couldn't do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm a fake gamer. I couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why would you do that to yourself? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that, that...
- Content, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was the content,
fantastic Twitch content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People love watching a man
go insane and be miserable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course they do.
- You know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno why anyone would ever
play those games just for fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - On all hours straight.
- I only did it... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I was gonna ask
would you ever consider </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing a game like this if you didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream it?
- Absolutely not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No you couldn't, but why would you do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's absolutely
no reason to do it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I do it on Twitch, it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> well, it's great content. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> People, it's really easy
to understand, you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You played 13 Sentinels. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like hey, so here's
the 15 characters. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You need to know all the in
depth law about, by the way, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> miss 10 seconds of dialogue,
that changes everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jump King, it's like
my Mum can understand it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you fall, that's bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] You're a king who jumps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You literally go up and if you fall, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you can sometimes fall really far. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And that's bad, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's super easy to get people invested in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, it's just fun
watching someone go insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, I don't know, I
would never do it off stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, of course.
- Ever, why would you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't understand why
people have done it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What compels you to keep going? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What compelled me to keep going. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Self-satisfaction, right?
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What compelled me to keep going
is that I don't want people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to call me a little bitch for quitting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was like, I've gotta keep going. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's gonna call me a little bitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically.
- I also am very stubborn, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Callie's still going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Callie is still going right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that the 3rd DLC? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, by the time this has gone on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure Callie's beating it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure.
- Let's hope so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hope you, hope you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Callie's insane, Callie
also is like insane on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Callie beat the base game in
like an eight-minute speed run. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Very insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Holy (beep). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, really good stuff, real insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Again, I've much more appreciation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for anyone who beat that game now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you ever consider speed running? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I was about to
ask, would you ever want.. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I would the base game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Base game is like easy mode now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like that's, there's only a few jumps </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that scare me in the base one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The rest of it's like super easy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause there's like
there's margin of error </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like, if the platform's wider, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can obviously move
a lot, but sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they do like just like a little pole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have literally like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to get the arc perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And sometimes there's ice on the platform </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can fall off or
they're rounded, so you can... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just sounds like those
like really punishing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like NES and like Super Nintendo games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel that's like kind
of becoming a trend again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> especially in the gaming
like e-world, I feel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like, but
sometimes those NES games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> were just bull(beep).
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They were like unfair. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like this was an experience
that is very challenging, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but also very rewarding weirdly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I've never felt more
accomplished about a video game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I felt that when
I streamed Hollow Night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> a while back, like that game
is like (beep)ing unforgiving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in some ways, and to this
day I haven't beaten it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just 'cause this is one ball stone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> where I'm just like, this is bull(beep). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Those are the types of games that when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we finally overcome it...
- But when you beat it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you finally beat it,
(beep), yeah, let's go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, I feel like I learned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot about myself in those 30 hours. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I learned an awful lot about
me and who I am by just. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - You kind of have to, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You play a game like that for that long, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> which I don't know how
the (beep) you do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Respect to you for being a true gamer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't even play game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't even play a game that
has like more than five inputs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like more than three hours, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Beep)ing just pressing one space bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just jumping for like 10 hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't (beep)ing do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I was sweating playing 13 Sentinels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you literally just
press soak for awhile. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure I'm getting,
I'm pretty sure I'm getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> repetitive strain injury,
repetitive, what is it called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ah, RSI?
- RSI. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - RSI.
- I was pretty sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was getting that after a
while 'cause I was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's mind-numbing.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's good though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really do recommend trying it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I definitely wanna stream it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just to, you should, I
really wanna see you stream it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - We should race.
- Huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you guys should
do a stream together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should race it.
- I'll commentate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's stressful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's fun, 'cause if
you, no one expects you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't wanna do it on my own. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you want me to suffer more, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't want to be alone by myself </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> with Chad just (beep)ing
doing this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want someone to be there with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - People would love that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> People would love that,
you gotta do this now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a brilliant idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, come on, let's do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you go in... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes, Garnt, do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm dragging you in.
- It's easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just press the space bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll (beep)in' do it, I
just love the way Joey's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, I'll do it, right, Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You're with me, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't say you're gonna beat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just say you're gonna just gonna play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's see what happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I play, I'm gonna beat it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the thing, right, if I start... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If I start, I'm saying it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> If I start, then that's my commitment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well now we can't
(beep)ing do it with you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I have to finish it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [Connor] - You don't have
to, you don't have to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> No, you don't, you
don't, you don't have to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't have to, you can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what, Mama
didn't raise no quitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mama didn't raise a bitch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's in 4K, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She raised someone who
was so afraid of failure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that if you don't start
something, you don't need to quit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're gonna play it,
you're gonna play it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> both, you should do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But no, like yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it looks fun, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Big air quotations in fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like you completing it looked fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't like see... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It didn't look fun,
it looked satisfying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's very satisfying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very satisfying. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's got a good soundtrack too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meanwhile, like Joey's
doing his best to try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like convince me to not pick up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Final Fantasy online because... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shut up! (background noise
drowns out other sounds) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm doing this man a favor right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm saving a life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Whoo! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was like a (talking over
each other) game, apparently? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - So last week, I off, like me and Sydney </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> off-handedly mentioned that
we maybe were interested </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in getting into Final Fantasy Online, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Joey like, Joey perked
up, like we just mentioned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we wanted to try crack
or heroin or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, Garnt, what did you just say? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I'd be more understanding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> if you said you wanted
to try heroin, you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think doing heroin is
less life-threatening. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it that addictive?
- I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had friends who have
started it since day one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're big, Final Fantasy fans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and myself, I was like,
okay, I'll give it a go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I remember, but
then like 'Nam flashbacks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came back to me of like
times where I used to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like heavily addicted to MMOs, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Where like, I would literally, what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically think of my three
day streak with 13 Sentinels, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but over the course of like three years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was my experience with MMOs, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, that's why I don't touch them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so I tried it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I did the trial for Final
Fantasy 14 'cause you could do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a trial period without
actually purchasing the game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I did that, really fun,
but I was, I stopped myself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, no, I
cannot, I cannot do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've got some willpower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, dude, I must, I
unlocked 100% of my brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, Joey, you
are not doing this now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> not during the busiest year of your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You are not gonna upload
for a year straight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you start this right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause I didn't notice, like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't know what you were
doing in the, like the past </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the days that you were
playing 13 Sentinels, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I did notice, normally Joey uploads, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like every other day on his Joey channel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Suddenly he stopped uploading. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Dude, I didn't even tweet for three days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, I was literally
shut out from the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it the gamer thing where you wake up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and immediately start
playing until you fall asleep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> for three days?
- Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I love those, love those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was me for three
days with 13 Sentinels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, but like 14, Final Fantasy 14, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I'm going to be that way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I just know it because I
love Final Fantasy games. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I love MMOs, and like every
around me is playing it as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> right, so I'm like
there's no better feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than playing an MMO with
a bunch of mates, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's true obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, no, I have to stop myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I wanna be a responsible adult </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that actually does what he needs
to do and what's important. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You need to be a functioning adult. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I need to be a functioning
member of society </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm not going to do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then, you know, and (beep)ing
all my friends are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> so when are you gonna start 14 Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, stop it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the forbidden thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I just don't go near them.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just, I know that they're
bad for everything in life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure I'll have fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You were you like into WoW
and MMOs back in the day? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, looking back, I
just think this is insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I would just sit there clicking
on trees for eight hours. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right?
- And I'm like, what is this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- I can't, why did I do that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so emotionally invested. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> If I was a teenager like
now and 14 came out, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd be on that (beep)
(beep)ing every day, right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but because I have less
responsibilities than I do now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause when we
did the Room Scape stream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I remember I had a lot of fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it dawns on me
that whatever we were doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like twice the speed or
like how much faster was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was like 20, 20 or 10 times.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's it was like more
than 10 times the speed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was 20 times speed? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like, yeah, it
was like 20, 10 or 20 XP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- But it took us the whole day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just to get to one single boss battle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Welcome to Room Scape.
- How long would that take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if we didn't have the
XP ball to play with? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably...
- A lot, I don't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like a couple weeks.
- Yeah, like in Room Scape </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as well, I think like the last few levels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> are like the equivalent to
the entire like levels before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like getting to like 95, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and doing like to 99 is like
the same as getting to 95. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Literally, man discovers how much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of a grind Room Scape is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - People say One Piece
fans have commitment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, the thing was, I think the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that made Room Scape so kind of addictive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you could kind of just
like, kind of hands off it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but kind of not, like you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of it's other monitor (beep). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> You can just click. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I knew people who would do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They would have their normal life, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but always have, have Room
Scape on the other monitor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and they would be like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kinda sounds like a catch game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm just gonna say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pretty much, pretty much.
- But they're never gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> cut you off, they never
had sanity or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, what's the other one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like playing Achmeds
with unlimited sanity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This just never ends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, it literally was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just, it never stopped you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's what made it so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause they never tried to stop you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like people
probably put more money in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it wouldn't stop
you, but they never had, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> they just had a membership.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Those were the good old days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good old days (talking over each other). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, I'm doing everything
in my power right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to stop Garnt and Sydney from
getting Final Fantasy 14. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause...
- You shouldn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You shouldn't.
- You shouldn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, we were just
like mildly curious, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We were just like, we were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe we maybe we'll look into this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then...
- That's how every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> drug addiction starts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were just like...
- Mild curiosity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were just like mildly curious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we saw that it
had gotten so popular </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they literally
removed it from the store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I remember we just
tried to like download. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So that made you want to have to play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes.
- Whoa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Classic, classic Tinder lover. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> If it's hard to get, then
he wants it even more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So like Sydney like mentions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that she's gonna try and download it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, I'm like downstairs playing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my 13 Sentinels or
whatever, and she's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Garnt, I don't know what's wrong, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "but I don't, I can't download it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just (beep) it, "Sydney,
come on, come on Sydney." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Come on, woman! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Have you never downloaded
a game before Sydney? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Come on," and I so I
go up and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Sydney, you press the download button." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like trying to
scroll down to find out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where the (beep) this download button is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, is this the download button? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No, just goes into another pop-up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like trying to
like navigate this site. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I like try to go to the steam page. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> There's gotta be a download button. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm like, I'm like so confused. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I realized that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they had to like take it off the store. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because their servers
literally aren't big enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because the servers literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> are too small to handle the player influx </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that came in with the new expansion. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mind you, this is Square Enix, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> literally one of the
biggest (beep)ing games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's so good about this expansion </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like...
- I don't know, but now... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the story.
- I wanna know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've I've heard it's the story, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And when we couldn't
download it, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, is there any other
way to download it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So I start researching to
see if there's any other way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to download it 'cause now I
really wanna (beep)in' play it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, are you like hacking
into the streaming server? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Garnt's like where is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just like, there must be a way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, they couldn't have just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they couldn't have just
taken the file away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Surely there's a way to download the file, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like it's yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You, you literally can't download it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't buy it, You can't any, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the only instance I've
seen in the gaming community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I've tried to give a money company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they've refused to accept my money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A money company.
- Sorry, a company money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've tried to give a company my money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and they refuse to accept it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just throw it in the air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Just let the service be broken
and still take the money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll fix it, we'll fix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, well, we'll definitely fix it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so I've heard
sales are coming back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> on the 25th of February, so...
- Stop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, of January, sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So that's that's coming up, so... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The reason why 16's been
delayed for like two years </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is because (speaking off mic). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember when that
game initially released </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Final Fantasy Online,
but it was terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so bad that they
removed it and they built it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They built it up from scratch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the rerelease
just (beep)ing exploded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, well I even
remember when it re-released </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that wasn't that big, was
it, I don't think it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was big, but nowhere
near as it is now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now it's there, I can't escape it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's been a game where I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one or two people talking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't like a massive explosion, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but like slowly over time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just keep hearing it
more and more and more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's it's really, it really
just (beep)ing exploded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with this new Endwalker expansion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the name, right, Endwalker? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know, you know,
I've been to a lot of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> themed cafes in Japan, but
the most I've ever been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to one cafe is the (beep)ing
Final Fantasy 14 Cafe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just 'cause all my friends like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "You wanna go to the Final
Fantasy 14 Cafe again?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, I don't even
know this game, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why are you dragging me into this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (Ashley speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Shut up! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I don't know, I mean,
I'm sure it's a good game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just never gonna do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't wanna get addicted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a good game. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just, you know, have
responsibilities now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean I'm sure it's a good game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I've just been looking
for a new game to get into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like...
- Minesweeper. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hmm?
- Minesweeper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know like there's
there's games like Jump King </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you know, I'll play it for content, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I also want a game
where I can just play. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You want a comfort game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I want a comfort
game 'cause once 13 Sentinels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets finished, I just dunno
what I'm gonna do with my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We grow when we leave our comfort zone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> We accomplish things when
we leave our comfort. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> You think they climbed Everest
in their comfort zone, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what I, I would
learn like right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, we fill that void with more work </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I would like to know what happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if we just do something
fun instead of filling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that void with a more work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, certainly not Final Fantasy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'll never (beep)ing see you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Trash Taste will be on hiatus.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what the (beep)
happened to Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Garnt and Joey are playing
Final Fantasy Online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Remember when they
promised like three specials </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this year or what's happening with that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't want you to be the Togashi </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of Trash Taste, all right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want you to be present
and here, no hiatuses. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt will be like,
he'll break down, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he'll call in to like Zoom and (beep). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He'll be like, I'm doing a raid right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but I can Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - If we can talk about Final Fantasy 14. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Ashley speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - How long were you?
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - This, yeah (beep)ing Navi,
this mother(beep)er like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know how he tried to
convince me to play 14? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, they have
Mahjongg in Final Fantasy 14. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, what do you think,
I'm some kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because there's Mahjongg. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like no one's playing you for Poker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just cause there Marjong in a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't mean I'm gonna be
like that, just give it to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like what do you think I am? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, like you're the dog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like the cheese
and the pill, swallow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Swallow, swallow the pill, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You like, it's in a layer of cheese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like Pavlov's dog from Mahjongg. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like Mahjongg, Mahjongg, Mahjongg, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yes, I'm playing it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So rude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm looking forward to
is the new Kirby game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That looked pretty cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's like Kirby 64, but on Switch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it looks (beep)ing amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'm I'm looking forward </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the new Horizon: Zero
Dawn 'cause the first one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is one of my favorite games of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I've been waiting, biding my time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> all this, like for like the past two years </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to like not buy a PS5
or to like to buy a PS5 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when the price has finally gone down, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're not just buying
it from like scrapers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> or whatever, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like, there's now a
game I want to play on PS5, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's still not (beep)ing available. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So (beep) my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bottom scrapers, sorry, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Scalpers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, is that the name? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the name? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Scalpers.
- Scalpers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bottom scrapers.
- They are bottom scrapers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's what I was thinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like (beep)ing, they
are bottom scrapers, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it looks like I'm going
to have to try and buy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a PS5 sometime just to
play this game and... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Get it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Is there enough games on the PS5 like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are exclusive at the current moment? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause for my rule of
thumb with new consoles </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is I need at least like maybe three games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I'm like, I really wanna play this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That'll get me to finally buy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's what I did with the Switch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I did with the PS4. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if it's just like one or two games, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> then I'm like, what am I gonna
do after I finish that game? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm only getting a PS5 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> just because that's how much I like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, that's not much. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I like the original
Horizon series Zero Dawn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to play this game at launch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I only bought a PS4 to
play Persona Five, so yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are the really big games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are available on the PS5? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, Demon's Souls? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Spider-Man game.
- Oh, the Spider-Man game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Ashley speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - FF7 Remake.
- Is it actually? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] If I'm mistaken,
that's why I got the PS. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't feel like a
true PS5 or like a Next-Gen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and if it's on like the Gen before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm kinda like, eh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean two-second faster
loaded of time, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Oh, the privilege. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Ashley speaking of mic) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Oh, we'll increase
our sales for PS4s instead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cool, thanks, Sony.
- Cool, thanks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cheers for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's 'cause the global
chip shortage, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Can't get any devices.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Can't get GPs, can't get... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tablets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can't get service for FF Online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You couldn't even get
hash browns at McDonald's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a while in Japan, did you hear that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, why?
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We had a hash brown shortage
in Japan for a couple of days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, is it because the potatoes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because of the potatoes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was so bad it was to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> we couldn't even get hash browns. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Wait, wait, why was
there a potato shortage? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japan doesn't import potatoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - So they only accept like their potatoes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because they believe that theirs... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So we had a potato shortage.
- We had a potato shortage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] The french fries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't it because they couldn't
get salt, like the imports? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe, I'm pretty sure
Japan doesn't import </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the majority of their potatoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whatever the issue was,
it was all this as a result, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the pandemic, and then
for, I think it was only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like two or three days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause they had this a few years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with potato chips in Japan, or crisps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They, yeah, they didn't have any potatoes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause there was, I think
there was a really bad season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they refused to import potatoes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they saw them as lower quality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, that's a load of bull(beep). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> A potato's a potato, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- You're not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So they didn't have any pizza potato chips </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people were really angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] They do import
the fries are processed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the US and Canada before
being shipped to Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, really, they are? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe it's just maybe potato chips then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Like shipping disruptions in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Vancouver's side so we can get... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe it's just for potato chips then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Japan is like, or like
maybe Kelpie is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> no, we only use Japanese.
- We only use Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably a company thing,
not a like nationwide thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it makes sense, really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And Japan does have this
massive culture around their, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, vegetables and
ingredients and where it comes from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it being high quality, and... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It needs to come from X Prefecture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Otherwise it's not right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you taste it
and you're like this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just a very good version of
X thing that I normally eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anyway for 10 times less the price. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna do a test where
we get the same vegetables. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's an after-dark strip.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - From different prefectures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and see if we can figure it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or all of the expensive
versus cheap fruits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> We should do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause I will say like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there are some fruits where I've had like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you have like Japanese
strawberries, for example, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I've ever had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bad Japanese strawberry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like it's more of like consistency. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You had bad strawberries in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there are some
strawberries where you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, it's just not that sweet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a bit sour.
- It's sour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's sour, you know, but
it's still a strawberry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But every time I buy a packet
of strawberries from Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like three, four times the cost, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but every (beep)ing strawberry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the sweetest strawberry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you would get from a UK supermarket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is the non-brand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's also sad that they probably waste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot more food as well if they throw away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ones that don't meet the
quality standards, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think it's that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's just the
quality of like cultivation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> is just like incredibly high here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause like I remember, I think
I saw this like documentary </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> about like melons, for example. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I saw that one on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the melons one is
like the (beep)ing process </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of that is like insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like this guy, this dude in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in his 50s
- He massages them, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is taking better care of this melon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> then some parents do their children. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he was taking
better care of the melons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> than I was myself.
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's just nuts to think that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> okay, yeah, now that I see the process, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can understand why it's
a little more expensive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and way tastier, but can justify
me paying $300 for a melon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wish there was a
cheaper option, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I would be fine with it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If there was a natural
option that, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rival the price of the same ingredients </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would pay in like the UK or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that's the problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember I used to eat
so much fruit in Australia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> just because like an apple
was like less than a dollar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, exactly, and it's just
(beep)ing easy to pick up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was cheap and it all tasted good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But like in Japan, like the
cheapest apple you can get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like 300 Yen or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, pretty tough.
- And it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't justify me
spending $3 for an apple. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes you want that
high quality experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I get that, with every bite that you take, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but sometimes you just wanna
eat a (beep)load of one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and not feel guilty afterwards
for spending a lot of money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you eat steak every day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes you want a hamburger, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just how it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know Japan doesn't
grow bananas, does it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't think hey can grow here, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What?
- Bananas. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No
- I don't think.. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think bananas are all
imported from like Philippines. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love the banana gacha, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> where you are like.
- Banana gacha? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You crack open a banana and
you're like, I have no idea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> if this banana is gonna
be like (beep) or good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Can grow bananas
in Okinawa, Kogoshima. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that makes sense.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just never know if
a banana's gonna taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the perfect banana, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is the perfect banana? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know when it... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It depends, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Like some people like
are really like brown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like some people,
- Oh, I hated brown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't like it brown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, you want it to be... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you bite into a banana </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like fighting back sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like kind of tough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would...
- What the (beep) happened? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's got some give.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would prefer a banana be
too ripe than too brown to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I, prefer.
- No, too ripe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like rock solid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I prefer when it's like a, just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just like a tiny bit of firmness, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like a tiny bit of
firmness still there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like my perfect banana. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not like it's, you know,
it's not completely green, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's not like, it's just,
just turns completely yellow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like, to me, that's
like my perfect banana. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't like the green ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but sometimes even get like
a non-green one and it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it still is like rock solid or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know what I'm
gonna get with these bananas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and frankly, I quite enjoy that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I quite enjoy that maybe I'll
get that dog-tear banana. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that its just like really smooth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of little bit sweet, like, ooh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is just the perfect banana. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why would you ever play a Gashu game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when you just, you can.... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bananas are the OG Gashu world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> You just never know, never
know if you need a good banana. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I love about bananas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so sad though
'cause I really miss eating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like a lot of fruits,
but just, I just, again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't justify myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like banana is actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> one of the cheaper fruit you eat in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Plus, it's imported. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Coffee bean, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, like you
know, maybe like three bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> for like maybe a five or six pack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I eat like three bananas a day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's just the one
fruit I get at every coffee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Real monkey human.
- Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually do, you know
what I realized the other day? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why, I really,
really like bananas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's 'cause
they're like pre-portioned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Again.
- They're like the perfect... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pre-portioned! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like, we as humans,
we love portioned food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We love it when something tells us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is how much you're eating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And the bananas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the perfect one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really, really love bananas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like eat them every day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm a Jojo fan as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, but, but.
- I gobble bananas. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - But for some reason I
hate banana-flavored stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I dunno why (talking
over each other). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like banana-flavored sweets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> There's just something.
- It depends for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, you know, 'cause
the banana-flavored stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is from a variety of banana that is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we don't use anymore,
it's like extinct. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really?
- Totally, 'cause it's... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The artificial banana flavor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - There is like this after taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that tastes so artificial that
it just really puts me off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like, I think it
was, I don't know if it's the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if the one we use right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> is the cabin dish banana
or the one before. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know there's a bunch of
YouTube videos about this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah, there's the one before </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> apparently is much sweeter,
much better flavor, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but like a plague wiped out that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that type of banana.
- Species, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they had to grow another
one that was more resistant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Problem is that it apparently
doesn't taste as good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So the original
banana-sweetened flavored stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> that you taste in stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially that original banana flavor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Supposedly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right.
- I don't know if it's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't mind the artificial. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really like the
artificial banana flavor more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than the like real banana flavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I feel like I've been robbed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, you, you like the
artificial banana flavor more? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like I'm missing out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> on the OG banana experience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I'll come late to the party. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - This mythical banana. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a monkey, I feel like
my ancestors had it good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They had the OG banana, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the sweeter banana, the better banana. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Have you, have you had a... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Our ancestors were eating good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] Extinct banana
flavor is part myth, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Banana flavors actually
became more popular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> than bananas because nobody had ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eaten bananas before.
- My God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The mythical banana. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause that's what I taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I taste banana-flavored stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It doesn't taste like real banana to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's because your
concept of real banana </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the only like one that we grow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is your real banana flavor is one... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that all a real banana is, Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's only one variant of banana. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many bananas
that all taste different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're eating a real banana, or are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually like my...
- You are, but there are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more flavors than the flavor you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know that.
- Resources. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - My favorite banana actually
is Southeast Asian bananas. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't like, okay, I
dunno you've ever.... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like all of Southeast Asia? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I dunno, but I'm saying Southeast Asian, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because I've only had it in Thailand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh?
- What about European bananas? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> European bananas are the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (beep)ing bananas that we import, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But Southeast Asian bananas are like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really funny out of context though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't wait for the
banana edit of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Jojo fans are talking about dicks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Only brought to the
comment section of this clip, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> bananarologist, here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, because like in
Thailand you can get like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> these really small bananas
that are like half. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, the finger bananas.
- The finger bananas. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I like those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is like what they
taste like if you take, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you take one of the four
bananas we are used to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just pack all that
flavor in half the size. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's getting the big banana in... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Photoshop the banana. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just a shot of banana. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I'm like addicted (beep)ing
addicted to those bananas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like my Dad comes
in with a pack of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't even sell them
in like, you know, packeted, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't sell them in
like packeted bunches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> You just take like, you
just buy them by the bunch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like, you buy like a
bunch of like 10 or 20, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I swear I can get
through like 10 in a day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I like, I like
eat one and I'm like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Potassium overload. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The (beep)ing ape, the (beep)ing
ape brain just takes over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, (beep)ing
just gimme 10 right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do, do you think that all
apples have the same taste? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well then I think that's
the same thing with bananas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> except we just don't have the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't start this conversation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just saying, we don't
have the other bananas, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where have you had the other bananas? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't, I want to.
- - No, one's had it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> It's a myth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It existed.
- It's literally a myth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, you know, all... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just established
all of the apple flavors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> are really distinctly different, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah.
- It tastes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very, very different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what's we've missed
out on with bananas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're speaking about a mythical banana </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that is artificial tasting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That may or may not taste like.... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've never tasted before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so how can you say that this tastes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like this mythical banana. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're actually talking
out your (beep) right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want to try this banana </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I know is gonna taste different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What if it doesn't exist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What if it just.
- It does exist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's completely artificial. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] In his defense, it did exist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, but... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We can't have it
anymore, Garnt, it's gone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It did exist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but have they perfectly
replicated that flavor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and how do you know?
- How do you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we don't have
science back then, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Science was just a guess back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly.
- So how did we know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that this mythical banana tastes the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as the artificial flavoring? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can just, you know,
speculate based on our apples. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can speculate what a
(beep)ing dinosaur tastes like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I know I'm gonna taste
a (beep)ing dinosaur. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bet it tastes like a bear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If something came out with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like a (beep)ing
dinosaur-flavored lollipop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or steak or something, I'd be like, cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is completely bull(beep) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because no one's ever
tasted a dinosaur before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't it sad we never
got to taste a dinosaur? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish we could have tasted a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a T-Rex probably tasted great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We'd be arguing about like a... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - A T-Rex would be gamey as (beep). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you (beep)ing kidding me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What would be the tastiest dinosaur? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (talking over each other) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> RosaRaptor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably the velociraptor.
- Velociraptor is like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Good sized, they're too muscular though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Too muscular, that's true,
that would be too tough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the (beep)ing long necked (beep), </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the (beep)ing long...? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (singing tones) Can
you pass the mustard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The brachiosaurus
- Brachiosaurus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I bet they tasted delicious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, we missed out on
all these foods and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that we could have had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Trash Taste, we've literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> run out of food we can argue about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Let's argue about food
that doesn't exist anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's speculate about
(beep) that doesn't exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Ashley speaking off mic) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can just wake up in a cold sweat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and wonder what bananas
we've missed out on though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> That does happen, that does happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just don't know if
it's ever crossed your mind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the word artificial means. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It means it doesn't exist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - At least I've speculated
of the bananas we've lost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - What if the bananas we lost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> just taste like absolute garbage? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would be able sleep at night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably does because they gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If they taste.
- Extinct </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they were little and like bitches </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like Gordon Ramsey didn't like them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They were extinct because a
plague wiped them out, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What if the plague was...
- based on taste. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - We did you a solid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We got rid of these (beep)-eatin' bananas. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We'll give you these other ones. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You can imagine what it tastes like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - (Beep)ing argument that we've had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you ever want to taste a Dodo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause man, if... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] They became
extinct for a reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They weren't extinct
because they got over hunted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm just like, (beep), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how good do these (beep)ing birds taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were over hunted,
for what purpose were they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They have like a beak that
was special or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ah, no because...
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you know why Ashley? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] I can Google it for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Google it, I'm going to speculate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Is it because they were
just (beep) weak animals? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kind of like, I've heard that dodos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> were just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (beep)ing stupid.
- Just (beep)ing stupid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're like really
dumb an they were like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> if there was a predator
that came up to it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they wouldn't even know it was a predator. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that's how dumb they were supposedly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] Part of the
reasons is because... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look, I've seen Ice Age. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know exactly what happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Their habitat was almost
completely destroyed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> after people started
settling on Mauritius. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ah, people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, this is why, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes I watch those
YouTube videos where it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the animal, like
there's a tiger eating </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a (beep)ing deer or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And you go in the comments are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God, I wish I could
have helped the deer." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, what, stop nature? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, what do you mean,
like, what are you gonna do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I hate these comments
where they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish I could've helped that poor Adam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is literally nature. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like just let it do its thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We wouldn't be in this
position if it weren't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for where we are right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah we're a plague, all right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> That's fair enough, we
probably not do that (beep). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] We're the
problem, we're the virus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you're asking a lion
not to like eat it's prey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like no, that's what a lion does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like the whole point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why, that's why everything exists. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like let it do it, like don't intervene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you gonna do is
like go to a lion and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> just stop.
- Like Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the lion be like,
yeah, you're right, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever soybeans? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Veganism, that's an option. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think David Attenborough
spoke about this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one time as well, and he
was like, someone asked him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in interview, they're
like, do you ever feel like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sorry for the animals that like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think there was one with like the birds </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> were falling down, and
starve or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he was like, no, you
know, it's just unfortunate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's life.
- That's nature. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not our place to intervene, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to get involved and say, who can do what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> until obviously we've
burn down all the forests. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And literally killed the... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is kind of on us, we. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We should probably intervene
as little as possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate those comments though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is it you wanna say, Ashley? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] There was an animal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was literally eaten to death though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was the giant tortoise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most, animals are eaten.
- Yeah, that's on us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Ate the whole species to death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- That's on us, that's on us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What animals that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] I think it
was a giant tortoise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the (beep) to you eat that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, humans?
- How do you even start? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's (beep)ing wrong with us? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, apparently they make
turtle soup and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's...
- Yeah, but, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just find it, just
the image of just a guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> looking at a giant tortoise
being like delicious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] It really was delicious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, stop that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't wanna... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, we've
eaten a lot weirder things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is true, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - If there's something that's breathing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm sure humans have tried
to find a way to eat it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe humanity just has Trash
Taste, feed source music. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - At the end of the episode.
- Nature is scary, or is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This episode of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> with nature and scary things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know what's more
scary though, our patrons? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, Joey, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They survive natural selection. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they won't eat the meat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is your favorite banana </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you may own the
may or may never have? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tell us your favorite of
banana that you wish you tried. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tell us what you think
is the tastiest banana. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many variations of
banana are there even? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Enough to...
- I've only eaten two. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How do yo you?
- Real and artificial? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, it's the bananas that
are that widely available </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot around the world and...
- Like 800. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna Google this.
- Oh, there's only 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> There's only 10 variants. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] There's just 10,
but I think there's more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's loads.
- Is that a top 10? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] It's a top 10, actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Top 10 bananas.
- #10. </SPEAKER_06>
