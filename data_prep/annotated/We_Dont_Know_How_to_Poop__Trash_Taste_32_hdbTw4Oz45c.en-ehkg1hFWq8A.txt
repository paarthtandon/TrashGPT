<SPEAKER_03> - The most ghetto thing that I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that I'm actually using a
bed sheet as a mattress cover. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (jaunty music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do you stretch that sheet over it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - With a lot like the
fucking power of Zeus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like...
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (groans) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm, like pulling the
red sea back together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a zip, it goes
all around my mattress. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you fucking zipped
it around your mattress. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (soft music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's up, G Fuel enthusiasts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Welcome back to another episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of the "Trash Taste Podcast." (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what you came up with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know.
- That is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is it.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is it.
- He literally just looked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at the nearest thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> next to him (indistinct).
- Yeah, I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh, G Fuel.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's just playing I Spy at this point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, welcome back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm with the boys as usual, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor and Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- Did you see- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am Steve Hanjobs though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Steve Hanjobs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you are, yes.
- Bringing back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the Steve Hanjobs cosplay.
(claps) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am so glad that you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> making that a character.
- What is this podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am so glad, I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I wear a turtleneck now- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you're Steve Hanjobs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Why do you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many turtlenecks, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's fucking cold in Japan, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never saw you wearing
turtle necks until this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And suddenly this man's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got a fucking-
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's always worn turtlenecks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No he hasn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes he has.
- Fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically before, because
I lived in Thailand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so all the only winter clothes
I had were turtlenecks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would just, every time
I come to Japan in the winter- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - First time I met Garnt, he
was wearing a black turtleneck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, Garnt during
summer, Neanderthal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt during winter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big brain five head.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm wearing the turtleneck mother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not gonna lie, I've never
looked good in a turtleneck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I've personally never worn it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think Garnt is
the only person I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that actually rocks turtleneck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to be kinda skinny though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to pull off a turtle neck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, you need to be skinny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you also need to have a neck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a long neck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry, Ed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big Ed's swearing right now.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just imagined big Ed in a turtle neck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It covers his entire face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He'll just look like roll on deodorant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry Ed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry we're take
cheap shots at you, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're questionable Ed, but. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Remember that was the thing
in 2020, the big Ed thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big Ed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So many good memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can we just all agree that back in 2020, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is still when we're
filming this by the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that My Little Pogchamp
was the worst meme of 2020. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can we just agree? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what meme of the year was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that was the worst.
- But it was definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> not that fucking meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I should say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, that meme kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One, it came out of nowhere
and two, it died so fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well because it was shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was shit.
- I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm so glad that it was animated, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so that the poor person who
voiced it didn't get fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obliterated.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Destroyed, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you imagine if that
was like a person on TikTok, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'd be like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the Pogchamp girl.
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guarantee there's a number of girls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who went on to TikTok
and did the whole voice- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah there is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course there is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna look. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you had TikTok's of
people voicing over your videos? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So, she went and did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of anime character stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's loads and they
fully dress up in costume. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've heard people doing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just me talking like normally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they would take a
segment of me from like an- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, you just get a fandub? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- That's just a fandub, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> extra steps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw a bunch where someone
took really old audio of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in like an answer me simp </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or where I'm just fucking
answering a question normally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they just like voicing
over and acting over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I mean there's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's lots of audio
clips you could have taken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a little more interesting, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever get people
impersonating your voice? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get that a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but that's 'cause
you have a distinct voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't exactly have a distinct voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a few videos out
there of people like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I mentioned this
before on the podcast, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where they like go around on
discord, pretending to be me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And film the reaction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't have crazy fans like you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so no.
- Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And what, do they just do the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> broken English accent?
- They're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hello, I'm Connor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello, hello.
- And then everyone's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, its Cdawgva." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs)
And I'm like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like that is not me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't sound like me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are you believing this man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello, I'm Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello, governor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally a terrible British accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't sound remote-
- But with a deep voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, just doesn't
even sound remotely like me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just British accent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deep voice.
- Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's going on here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They'll be like-
- This is a Cdawgva video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hello there.
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> its the real Cdawgva. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Imagine how Micheal feels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, poor Michael. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll like do... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People will impersonate Sebastian, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but not like the actual Sebastian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll impersonate like my Sebastian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Cdawgva Sebastian.
- Yeah, Sebastian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But they'll be like
in an American accent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh how the fuck do I do this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm so ingrained
to do this in British. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It'd be like, 'cause you
know Sebastian's catchphrase. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I'm simply one hell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a butler, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There'll be like, "I'm
simply one hell of a butler." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing)
And it'll be like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was awful. 'cause it
would sound like half English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> half American attempt,
and it's like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then-
- That was like layered- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was layered there.
- That was hard to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like how do I break barrier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That took like 100% of
your brain power to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A British person impersonating
an American person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> impersonating a British person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then I'd be like, I would
hear these voices they would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, there's no way
they're gonna believe that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the moment they do
it, they're like, "It's Cdawg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, my God."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This isn't me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there was someone as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who went on voice acting
websites trying to be me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called It's Connor or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they would go around
making references to my videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I fucking reference myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I go around being like,
oh yes, remember that time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was Sebastian, good times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who the fuck references themselves? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's something like Tommy
Wiseau shit. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who actually does? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's the only thing you have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like I've made it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm done making new stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna reference
myself until I'm entire... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then people are like, "Shit, it's Cdawg." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He said the thing, so it must be him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It infuriates me to
death, 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if this is all it takes to
get you to believe this is me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope your credit card gets stolen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You deserve it.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you had a it coming
if you think that's me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm kidding. (laughs)
- Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't had people
impersonating my voice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've had people
kind of trying to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> by just speaking in a
shitty Australian accent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And sometimes the voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is totally not me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a completely different voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But because they're
speaking in a semi like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I'm fucking Australian, aye. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is pretty funny how much room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people are willing to
give-for interpretation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It's so crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've not seen any TikTok's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've had exactly the same comments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of like some random YouTuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who is reviewing anime clips or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a slight British accent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gigguk.
- And they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my God, it's Gigguk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking Gigguk.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The thing that annoys me more actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is not on YouTube or
TikTok, but it's on Twitter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where apparently anyone Southeast Asian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> who posts a selfie now
who's also into anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like, "Oh my
God, you look like Gigguk." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, I have so many
photos fucking of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like random Indian celebrities. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And people are just like,
"Yo, I thought that was Joey." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I had a guy, my
sister even sent me one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, she found on TV
there was this Bollywood movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I guess some Bollywood show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right, right.
- That they were promoting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on an ad or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And apparently one of the
dudes just straight up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently looked like me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, he's just
a Brown man with a beard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That doesn't make (indistinct)
- That's you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Apparently every Brown
man with a beard is me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I get that with white dudes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every white dude with a beard on TikTok, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like, for some reason... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They say I looked like Cedar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, what the fuck, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there like any moment
where that kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, that you look like so-and-so person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been kind of flattering? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've only had one example of that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's when people said
that I looked like, what was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> A cracked out Jason Momoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, oh, you look like Jason Momoa, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if he didn't work out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, yeah, I'll take that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jason Momoa's a fucking good looking dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I had like
Benedict Cumberbatch once, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was like-
- You had Benedict Cumberbatch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I used to have really big curly hair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that looked similar to him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so my parents just joked
that I was like him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And cool, 'cause I was also like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - British.
- Yeah, British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My parents are British too, Joey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what do you mean?
- Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh he's British fucking aye. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's a British man, therefore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he looks like Benedict Cumberbatch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, fuck it, I was like, no, I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't look like that fucking armature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, he's nice, he's fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> We like him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We have fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you have one Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
- Garnt's too distinct. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Garnt has a very distinct- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause nobody really knows
anything about Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, now it's just like
we are like the new, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like Japanese or Chinese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right now.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause now there're like
Chinese and Japanese culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is been more like, and
Koreans have been more- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pushed out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Globalized.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like all Southeast
Asians we'll just sit here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in our own corner being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well, there's more than one
country here as well, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's gone from, I
can't tell the difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> between Japanese,
Koreans, and Chinese too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- I can't tell the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between Thai, Filipinos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Malaysians.
- Vietnamese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Vietnamese.
- Malaysians. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck, I'd feel called out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But no, it's not like half
the memes on our subreddit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like a different
white person with a beard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like, oh my God it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He is Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its Connor, I thought it was Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a monkey brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got no beard now, actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, I just shaved it like two days ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The amount of memes
though of you with baby face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is hilarious.
- Is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I do look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a 10-year-old without a beard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone fucking posted
it on the subreddit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this old ass photo of me in a suit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you guys seen that one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I saw that, that was funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I was like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did they find that, it's on Google? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's on my Instagram, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like the second ever photo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I put up on Instagram.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was six years old or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do look so shad as a baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, fuck, how old was I? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like 20, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just looked like the
kind of kid who was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> get me out of here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I did, yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I regret putting that photo up- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not a good photo of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me, I feel like
I haven't changed much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my look apart from... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The only thing that's
changed is the spikiness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of my hair over the years.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've calm down, you've calm down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can tell the Gigguk
years by the younger I am, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like the more spikes in the hair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Like there are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You look at some of my first videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I look like fucking Sasuke, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm wondering,
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how did you decide on that hair style? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that's a look, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that hair you've had
since we were young or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I think, I can't remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just remember... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I have hair that's really easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be spiked up, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- So, I think ever since </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was young-
- What constitutes a hair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's easy to just spike up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like light and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Could you spike up your hair? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, easily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because of my
hair, if I cut it short, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I put a bit of water in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just immediately, naturally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like the fucking
anime character spike- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of Asian hair has that too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause my hair is also quite strawry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if I put gel in it
and it's just up forever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, no, I get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then again, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just because your hair can do that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't mean you have
to commit to it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, was it inspired by anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. No, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't inspired by anime.
- Fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What was it inspired by? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was inspired by the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's only-
- Sonic the Hedgehog? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's only so many
hairstyles I could pull off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I had no idea what the
fuck I was doing with my hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Therefore, look, it was the hairstyle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that took the least
amount of effort to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because all I would- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That look like a lot of effort. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, it wasn't, because, like I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my hairstyle is just naturally spiky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, all I would need to do,
just put a bit of water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put a bit of gel and just go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they were like peaks bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was done.
- You had like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking mountains. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It naturally went to that shape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Naturally Sonic the Hedgehog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Naturally Sonic the Hedgehog. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just woke up and I was Sonic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What can I say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, because I remember
in some older videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> your hair is like so... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looked like a wig. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how perfect the spike was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, this man could pass off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as like a side character "Yuyo." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like you'd been watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too many David Bowie concerts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs)
And you were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right, I like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'ma mimic that, basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what it looked like.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wasn't trying to mimic anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just had no idea what the fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was doing with my hair.
- It was like some guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was trying to bring back
the '80s glam rock scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, it's like
whatever the Mr. Anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that video pop ups-
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so funny watching
that and seeing Garnt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with this teenage hair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Which is really, really sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel bad but 'cause
obviously you're my mate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like that's funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you didn't know the context </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just saw the thumbnail, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks like those angsty fucking video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It totally fucking is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't focus 'cause you're fucking hair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is like Sonic the Hedgehog
where you're talking about- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like 60% of the frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like argue the most serious thing ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've got like
this fucking Sonic hair, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and (laughing) I can't focus on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I'm just talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, this guy just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> killed his family.
- Killed his family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But bro, that fucking hair though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that fucking Sonic hair.
- Meanwhile this man's hair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> has it's own orbit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well yes, welcome to
"Trash Taste" where we are- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Trash on each other's haircuts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now we're trashing on
each other's haircuts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - As good mates do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what we do.
- That's what constitutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a mirror. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you really call your mate a mate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if they don't make fun
of you after a haircut? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, what age did you reach, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where you actually paid attention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and gave a shit about
what you looked like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was really fucking late. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, same.
- 'Cause literally the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I looked like that was because
I didn't really give a shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about what I looked like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Until I got to my first, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> second year of uni. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was probably about the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you ever have any interest in dating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you where in- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You didn't never wanna
date a girl in school? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I was on an all boys school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, of course I did.
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love my boys, but not like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, yeah, I
invite them to Kiss X Sis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but we don't kiss.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't kiss.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll have a session Kiss X Sis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't care what you
look like, it's all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess maybe it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to a boys school that,
not to say that I didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hang out with girls.
- Man I fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would have loved to have
gone to a boys school, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Even get the pressure of having a fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to get a girlfriend.
- Impress. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, yeah.
- And trying to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a girlfriend 'cause everyone
else is getting one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, not to say that I didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have any interest in dating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just like, it
wasn't a priority for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, I was speed running
them in school, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never had one that
lasted more than two weeks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was school relationships. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had one that lasted three months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the boys were like, "Damn,
you lasted three months?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, if you last more than- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three months is a long time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in high school.
- In high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a long time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a dedicated relationship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Anything beyond a month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is like, okay, I am dedicated to this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're probably getting
married, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly (chuckles),
it's like one step away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from marriage, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We've passed three months, damn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My life's set already after this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I must have
started paying attention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to how I looked at maybe... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I say how I looked,
the hair, basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything else was like,
what am I gonna wear, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking school outfit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- My mum still bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all my clothes, so like I was-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not gonna lie, I didn't
start buying my own clothes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> until I moved out here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, same.
- Same here, same here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My mom was just like, yeah,
I got this nice T-shirt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like some shitty
$5 T-shirt from Target, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, yeah fuck, I'll wear that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - My mom still buys me
clothes and sends them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- And it sucks that she has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking better taste than me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what's weird,
Aki's mom buys me clothes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But my own mother doesn't anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember us, we
did a shoot a week ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I remember Joey had to
borrow one of your T-shirts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just see Joey in one of your T-shirts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, this is
such a Connor shirt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- 'Cause it was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a plain T-shirt- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literally that,
but a different color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a plain T-shirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a drab color.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm just like,
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> man, this just screams Connor, right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a color that I would never buy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's a color that
Connor would definitely buy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, this is gonna be one of those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird Connor things, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Only like last year have
I been open to the idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with owning shirts that have
nothing but plain color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For some reason, in my head- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it because you don't like logos or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hated logos and prints,
they drove me insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why?
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, for some reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it just looked cheap to me and always... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean that it's kinda- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, I get that.
- It's kinda like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it costs me that 'cause
normally they're cheaper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> these colors.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I get that though.
- It depends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because some of them can look very tacky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like there's a fine line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> between having a cool print </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having a cool piece of artwork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just looks tacky on a T-shirt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the whole concept
of simple is best, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Sometimes... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like the whole
reason why all of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> high brand shirts and shit like
that are so fucking simple. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's what changed my opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of fashion in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have started to be more open to spending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bit more money on clothes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- 'Cause at the end of the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, all right,
I'm wearing this shirt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like how many months? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm gonna be on camera
as well, especially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I wanna wear shirts,
I know today I'll see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, I've still got a little
bit of the old me left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Obviously, recently, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been like okay, I'm
willing to spend like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, I might spend 80 bucks on T-shirt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is unthinkable to
me through the years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
- Because, bear in mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in university, I used to go to Primark, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which if you don't know
where Primark is in the UK- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've been to Primark. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah so-
- Primark's amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically-
- If you bought shirt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on Primark, I'm gonna fight you on that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I don't wanna question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how they make their shirts so damn cheap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure there's some ethical question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember, I specifically
bought eight T-shirts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for 10 pounds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like $15. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I fucking love these shirts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they were all plain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Nothing on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I wore them for like two
years straight, these shirts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were fucked by
the end of it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - For real though, Primark
is like one of the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> low budget clothing brands
I've ever seen globally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, true, true.
- Honestly the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can get for the price at Primark, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which I don't know where
Primark's available </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> internationally, 'cause i know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its in Europe, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it in Europe?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like, if
you wanna budget place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can just buy cheap clothes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that don't really don't look cheap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause people said,
Uniqlo here is cheap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And we have Uniqlo in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not cheap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Uniqlo compared to
Primark is very cheap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Uniqlo is cheap for
the quality that you get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll pay a little bit
extra for a T-shirt at Uniqlo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but that shit is gonna last
you like 10 plus years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bought a whole suit
from Primark for like $40, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I wore to-
- 30 pounds? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The 30 pound set, yeah? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I did exactly the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for my prom and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My graduation I wore
a $40 suit and actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate to say it, but it
doesn't look that bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not bad, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Primark basically, carried
my university years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, there's a big but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And a lot of people in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tend to also have the
same mindset, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where a T-shirt should never
cost more than 20, 30 pounds- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Yeah, yeah.
- Which I can understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you haven't got a lot of money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spending that much on one
T-shirt is it's quite a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's quite a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- But, as I started to... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's where my
hatred of prints started. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that I thought a lot
of these Primark ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are pretty fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- And they often </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> do look super tacky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't really like
the collaborations. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They have like SpongeBob and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they like, oh, we
stuck a PlayStation logo on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think they're just
starting to do anime, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they are.
- Which is weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like, was it
last year where they did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a DBZ a one piece
collaboration, as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there's been a
lot of stores like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Forever 21, as well,
before they went under, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they did this huge
fucking thing with anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So every time I went to Forever 21, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was always this
entire section of anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you look at it, when
you actually go over to it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just like, all right,
let's see what they have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's all like Sailor Moon,
Dragon Ball Z, Naruto. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's always the fucking basics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's all the basic shit.
- And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't give me that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want-
- And it's not even done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a creative way either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, let's just slap the logo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the main character, boom! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Doing anime clothes is really hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm probably gonna about to call out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bunch of our viewers by saying this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but the ones I hate the most are the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just a T-shirt
with a waifu on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or the anime logo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or like a anime logo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Those kinds of clothes I call
anime convention clothes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's a T-shirt or
clothes that I would only wear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to an anime convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's no way I would wear it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct)-
- You know what I call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> clothes like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- Pajamas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the only time
I'm fucking wearing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is when I need to wear something in bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But there's probably someone
watching this right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in like a fucking Asuna T-shirt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd be like, aw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I think as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> going back to the whole
cheap versus expensive stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for clothes, like it's only... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think 'cause I moved to
Japan, I actually started seeing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the clothes that I really like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's kind of expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you're like, okay, I
am gonna wear this a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when I paid 350 bucks,
fuck, for that Diavolo... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry, King Crimson jacket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I bought that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was the most expensive
thing I'd ever bought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> clothes wise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I thought, oh my
God, this is insane, but- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This peak. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is insane, $350
on a fucking jacket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, it's sexy, look on screen it's sexy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But now that I've been wearing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wear it pretty much every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm wearing it every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I get maybe four or
five years out of that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like 20-
- You're getting bang </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for your buck, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I mean.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I understand that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I always felt that
way with tech, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like to me it's like,
don't buy a $20 headset, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy a $100, at least, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you're gonna
get your money's worth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know why for
some reason took me so long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to have that with fashion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think going back to the
whole topic, which is school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and why I didn't give a fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is 'cause I just didn't care for clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't really understand fashion at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just look like-
- I mean, who does? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean high school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was always that
one kid in your school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who somehow always fucking
dressed amazing to shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you all have that kid? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't have that kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not have that kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I had kind of a similar view of fashion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just I didn't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No I didn't get it.
- I didn't understand anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who would spend above like, yeah $20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like $30 on a T-shirt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think my mum would scoff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if an outfit was over a total $50. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> She'd be like,
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Get a load of this scam."
- Yeah. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's the thing though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> At least with me, there was this like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was a boys school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but there was this
whole, I guess stigma of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People who dress well.
- Oh, if you dress well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> then your gay. (laughs)
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like that whole shit.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I think people just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there were boys
who actually did give a shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about fashion and didn't-
- And didn't want it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But they didn't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they were probably
worried about getting beaten up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, yes, a fedora
might seem quite fashionable, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the common eye but
why would you wear that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't wanna get bullied? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like wearing fedoras. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they look fucking
cool with the right outfit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the problem is a lot of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'ma agree with Joey here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like the big problem with fedoras </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that the fucking neck
beard community just ruined, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> completely ruined their image. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like the Hitler mustache. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't wear it because
Hitler's ruined it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the same thing with
the fedora, you can't do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everyone's like incel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if they see you wearing it.
- That's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel that a lot of
the reasons why fedora </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just commonly seen as
that type of negative thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is because the hat itself is fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's what you pair it with
that just makes it look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like absolutely dog shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, you're either gonna
look like a neck beard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you're gonna look like
a rip off Michael Jackson. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no in between.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd rather look like
a ripoff Michael Jackson </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than a fucking neck beard, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I've seen- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then you can truly enjoy
your lonely life (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen fashion magazines
of dudes who wear a fedora </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or a hat of some kind
that's similar to a fedora </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a really nice suit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And they can match </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that shit really well-
- Yeah, but those are the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking attractive men on the planet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's what I'm saying, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the other problem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that there are no attractive
men who wear fedoras. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just preaching to the choir right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not gonna lie and pretend
I know how fashion works, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But-
- I'm no fucking fashionista. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're not fashion experts here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thailand next top model. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking Steve Hanjobs is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me teach you about fashion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like having
that one kid in school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who elevated the game really fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Elevated the game.
- He elevated the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in school.
- He was the bench mark. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He was the trend bro- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's really make me look fucking bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When he turns up with his
jeans with holes in them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, how can we compete? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have holes in my jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, wait, because-
- What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, because you guys
didn't wear school uniforms? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No we did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We wore school uniforms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And we had some days where
you would pay for charity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- You would pay like a pound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to dress in normal clothes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do we do that?
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, we have this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in UK schools-
- You had that as well right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, called own clothes day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's it.
- Right, own clothes day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where we have one day in
the term or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where we could just come
in in our own clothes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hated-
- And we had to pay a pound. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we had that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was speaking to Sydney and apparently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in her high school, they
didn't have school uniform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- Yeah, they just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause American high
schools don't wear uniforms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - School uniforms are big brain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because you always wear
the same shit every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, it's great.
- You don't have to worry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about like, oh, I wore the
same T-shirt for three days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in a row. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a big reason
why I didn't give a shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about fashion until later in life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was just because most days of the year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was wearing a fucking school uniform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Although I say that, the fashion... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whoever designed my school uniform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> deserves a slap because... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, so in our high
school there's a set piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you have to wear from
when you're seventh grade </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to 10th grade. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then when you enter
11th and 12th grade, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like senior. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you get to wear a senior
blazer and long pants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and shit like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The senior uniform is fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks dope as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's basically just a suit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the junior uniform is a little, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because for one, everyone
has to wear shorts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, it's hot most
of the year in Australia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so you wear shorts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then on top of that,
you have to wear long socks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm talking like up to the
fucking knee long socks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like anime girl long socks, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like anime girl longs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these gray knitted long socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Someone had a fetish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, someone had a fetish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, basically there's just
these seventh to 10th grade kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> running around with
basically just only showing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> their fucking knee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was your school run
by Herbert the pervert </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not gonna get into that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, so I fucking hated that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And, of course, because I
went to a private school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you didn't wear your thing properly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a fucking punishment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like you just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look at this private school boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, oh, I can see your shins. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You're gonna get a fucking slap for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You pull your socks up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Was like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (whooshing)

<SPEAKER_03> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (whooshing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So in British schools it
goes, secondary school... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, primary school, then secondary school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then sixth form, right?
- Which is part of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> secondary school normally
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kind of, kind of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So like our high school
is secondary school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and sixth form put together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like the same- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why does it skip from two to six? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, okay so, it's
called secondary school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's the second
school that you go to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you start at
age 12 and then you can... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, it's mandatory now, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to do sixth form now, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it used to be, you could leave at 16 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you could go and work or
you can get an apprenticeship. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there's always an optional, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want to go to university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to stay an extra two years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Which normally has about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least in my school
half the kids left at 16. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so in Australia
that would be junior high </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and senior high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's like we have high school... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, we have primary school
and high school, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And high school's from
seventh grade to 12th grade. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Seventh grade when
you're like age 12, 14? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 13.
- 13? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you can leave at year 10, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like I guess the end
of secondary for you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes.
- And then the last two years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is senior high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's like 16 to 18? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's 16 to 18 then you go to uni. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so that's what
it's like in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Okay, okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And when I was in sixth form, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so I was in my last two years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they tried to introduce
the school blazers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we didn't wear blazers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we had blazers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But we were a public school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so blazers were like, get a
load of these (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And there was outrage
because they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Here's the thing, the school uniform, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can only buy from
a special place, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can just get it on Amazon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they were charging
70 pounds for the blazer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right.
- And obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a public school and
70 pound's like 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And for some parents
it's like way too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- So, they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, we don't want a fucking blazer." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was a whole outrage about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then eventually they
were like, fine, fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, because the older kids are leaving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't need to wear blazers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I didn't have to wear one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's very fun watching-
- So wait, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't mandatory for you guys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was mandatory.
- So what was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> your school uniform? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just a tie- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So in England, we call
sixth form college as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Which gets a bit confusing when- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really, that's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When we say college, we mean
sixth form most of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you can go to college? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can go to actual college. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, where college isn't college. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> College in the UK is
one or two years, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Of a specialized thing
that you can then use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to then go in the University. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, we call that something different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, we have that college. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's college. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but we have sixth form college </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we have whatever
preschool university. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that called college, as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I believe those two are
the same institutions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'm correct, or someone
could (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because in Australia, we
don't even call it college. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't use that word. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what college is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why when an American say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Are your going to college?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We're going to university. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
- Yeah, we go to uni. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the Winnie
Poo meme where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> college, university.
- College, university. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because college is
something entirely different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to British people.
- Yeah, yeah. It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, anyway they were outraged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, half the school didn't
have to fucking wear blazers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and half the young kids did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right.
- So, that was fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And you could just be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at this fucking little 10-year-old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wearing his little blazer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, we fucking loved the blazer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The blazer was the bit.
- I don't wanna wear a blazer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you weren't supposed to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the teachers got
so fucking done with it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can just wear hoodies
of your school uniform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Man, they must have like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where are the rules in this school, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For us in the winter,
if it was just a regular </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> white T-shirt underneath,
it'd be way too fucking cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- So, sometimes you'd have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to wear the blazer just to stay warm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the other option
we had was this like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Our school colors were black and red. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, we had this- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you, fucking like
the evil school in Hogwarts? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it was black and red. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we had this like, if you
didn't wanna wear a blazer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had to wear this
fucking bright red, white, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like woolen fucking sweater. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we had something
like that, but it was green, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like moss green.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know the exact color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But ours was bright red, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the reddest red you can think of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So you just fucking stick
out in a crowd, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But at least you had pretty colors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ours was drab purple. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but the problem was is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was like a wool
thing, it was so fucking itchy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't matter how many
times you wash that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just like, fuck, I'm warm, but, ow! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck this! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, people were just like, fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna spend the
100 bucks on the blazer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I don't wanna wear this itchy ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking like grandma's sweater shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember in my sixth form, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I knew I was a fucking
grown up in my sixth form. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right Garnt, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We went to the coolest sixth form, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they let us wear our own clothes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, wow.
- Ooh la la. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was the big thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We were allowed to call our
teachers by their first name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh!
- And that was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> bringing you up to the next level, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, we could only do that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but It was a fucking Kaigi
gamble every time, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, fuck, do I call you Mr. Smith </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or do I just call you James? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes I remember one student
did that in my class, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and he immediately like, "What
the fuck did you call me?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He basically said that-
- I've heard that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so many times.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's basically towards
the female teachers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, excuse me, Margaret. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's just like, what the
fuck did you just call me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bro, I remember.... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sorry, I just had this
flashback to something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- I remember I did like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we had to do a presentation during... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you have registration in Australia? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where you basically,
when you get to school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd had a separate
class for registration </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to say that you're here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've arrived in school.
- Oh, like orientation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess yeah, orientation
for maybe Americans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a quick 15 minute thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where everyone just goes and says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I'm here.
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh fuck, I forgot what that was called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was called like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that registration? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what we called it in my school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Home class? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had a (indistinct) for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Homeroom, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it called it.
- Homeroom? That's American. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck Joey.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, we called it homeroom, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - At my school, we just call
it registration in English, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we had word for it that I forgot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- So I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But we just do like a short presentation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Between like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It would always be one of
the student's presentation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> each day.
- Why would you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do a presentation? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> On what?
- Just about saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you fucking learned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just some (indistinct)
pretentious bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is that, at the start of the day? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you have to do
a quick presentation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about something you've learned that day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God, that sounds awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like 14, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we all fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this teacher was horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So my best mate in school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a really bad stuttering problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He got a lot better now,
but everyone loved this guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause everyone just
wanted to see him do well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this one teacher was
so fucking rude to him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about his stutter, and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, all my homies hate that teacher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, we were all just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We all took it in turns
trying to see how much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we could troll in these presentations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did a pro gamer move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I'm gonna present, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 9/11 conspiracy theories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I shit you not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I shit you not.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I dead ass think I got
the teacher to believe me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, I came in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, moon landing, fake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But what is the biggest conspiracy theory? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did like this, like Steve
Jobs in a Ted Talk, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, listen, look at this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I did the Wingdings thing
with the flight number. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look, it's two towers
and the star of Israel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I rest my case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone was like, "No way!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause everyone's like 14, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and the teacher wasn't really smart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, what the
fuck, this is insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whoa! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just so fucking funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I never got told off for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think for some reason, I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they thought I was super
genuine about my belief of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But obviously-
- So, they didn't wanna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> crush on your belief? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just said it was enough conviction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that they were like, he must be right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He must be fucking right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't just like the Wingdings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think said a bunch of other stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that was the big piece
of evidence where I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (claps) look, Microsoft planned 9/11. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's so fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I do not know how
I got away with doing that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that is bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how-
- We didn't do anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> during homeroom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No?
- I feel like the school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just implemented that to give the teachers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their 15 minutes smoke break
before the beginning, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause our teacher
was the one who did it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we didn't have
any lessons with her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She was always that one that goes like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You should be constantly
learning and advancing yourself." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, hell no, I wanna play
Modern Warfare Two at home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna fucking prepare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, for us, homeroom
was just coming together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just fucking getting
on our shitty iPhone 3S </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and playing Doodle Jump together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the only thing we did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm wondering if we... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I even had a
homeroom segment or session. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Segment of the episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a segment.
- Segment of the fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> school day or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanna fucking call it.
- Garnt thinks it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> life in episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The homeroom mark. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Season one, season two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I didn't have anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, let's talk
about some current topics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that aren't just nostalgic
trips back to high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right?
- We talk about high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and shit so much but we
(indistinct) fucking funny stories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the prologue to our lives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's great memories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People listening to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are still in high
school, wouldn't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But once you're out of high
school, you'll understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll look back on them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - God, I was such a little shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You sound like such
a grandpa saying that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll look back to your high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one day.
- I remember back in the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we only had three phones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, but, what's the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess the big news quote, unquote. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Other than "Attack on Titan." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, other than "Attack
on Titan," of course, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's fucking-
- Probably gonna be old news </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the time this episode airs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, everyone's fucking loving that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I guess like some news
that is more industry-driven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is the whole Funimation and
Crunchyroll thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Got bought up by Sony. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Big cardy Sony. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sony buying out Crunchyroll. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And basically having control </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of most of the big anime companies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically, just monopolize
the Western market. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it is slightly worrying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you hear that initially, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You're like, that's a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of market share that Sony has. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At what point would it
be considered a Sony like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess a monopoly if
they had Netflix, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I feel like if
they had Crunchyroll, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Funimation, and Netflix, then- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then it would be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game over-
- Then it would be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 99% basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause basically, I think
the only other company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably Sentai
Filmworks who do Hidive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is Hidive still going? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hidive's still going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shit.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, Hidive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm so sorry, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess it's just not available
outside the US, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's available in the UK, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the problem with Hidive
is that I don't know how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big exclusive titles that they have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, how can you compete? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the only thing that I've watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only big exclusive
I've watched of Hidive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is probably "Legend Of
The Galactic Heroes," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking old, old...
- They did a new one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, like the old one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, the OG one, oh shit.
- So the only service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have licensed, the OG
"Legend Of The Galactic Heroes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't how many other exclusives
they have outside of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can't get on.
- I've never used Hidive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so I couldn't tell you
- Yeah, 'cause I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Made in Abyss," I watched
that on Amazon Strike. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> back when that was a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Amazon Strike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Remember Amazon Strike?
(claps) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have Amazon stopped buying anime now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I don't know what
anime they're getting anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have they got anything?
- No, they're still getting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The problem with
Amazon, is that they can- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They buy one big show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like last year they had "Vinland Saga." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the big problem with
Amazon is that they sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> get big shows, but I fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They don't know how to market it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking hate watching anime on Amazon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't know what shows
they have half of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right.
- They actually have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quite a lot of anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but nobody knows about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause nobody fucking
watches anime on Amazon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, not to mention that, I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the general problem with Amazon is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't know how to market it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You find out, usually,
second hand from someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's like, "Oh, I watch
"Vinland Saga" on Amazon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're just like,
"Vinland Saga" is Amazon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, Amazon is "Vinland
Saga," what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually, watching it isn't bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The play is really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know like what
fucking conversion they're using, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but man, it looks crisp as fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you play it.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But God damn is it horrible
to use their fucking platform? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy shit, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, am I renting this
shit or am I streaming it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not clear half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking time?
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is like, I didn't mean to rent "Bora." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why am I watching "Bora."
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I try to watch fucking anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck, Amazon? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then also, because now obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm using Amazon Prime in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Amazon did that fucking pro gamer move, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of being like, yeah, no
subtitles for other languages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside of this country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah>
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, if I wanna watch
it, I have to buy Prime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which I have in Japan, and
Prime in the UK or the US, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does Prime even work for you here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like UK Prime work for you here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it doesn't work for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no you need to use... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You have Prime, but it's
probably Japanese Prime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which doesn't offer any English subtitles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And obviously, because their like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we don't want people going
on to other countries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and buying stuff, which
kind of makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also why, who cares? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (scoffs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's 2020, I don't
know why licensing laws </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't caught up to the fact that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a global fucking media now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you're gonna limit it to one country, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> people are gonna find a way to
find other ways to watch it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because people are gonna
watch it whatever happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like most people,
cause I see these threads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Reddit where they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Bro if you buy Netflix now in Turkey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "you can get it for like $2." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, but that seems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of fucking effort.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Do I really care that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go through all this (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm glad that if I
put all that effort in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can save a whole $4. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you gotta keep
using a VPN when you log in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and do that shit anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you're only pay for
the VPN anyway. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And like it's not worth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking effort, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do I really need this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who cares? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The country that I'm in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna have to
fuck around with VPNs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't make this hard for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Amazon, obviously made it... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, how do we
make it as hard as possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in every single (indistinct)?
- So that no one use it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, how do we make it so that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you accidentally buy a dildo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instead of watching "Vinland Saga." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's basically like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> every Amazon Prime experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do we have any like, I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there is very little information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the whole Sony acquisition, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's still very early days now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, Meilyne, how much was it for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How much was, 'cause we don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] Funimation buying... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Sony buying Funimation or
Sony buying Crunchyroll? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Both.
- Both. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] So Sony, when they bought 95% </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of Funimation in 2017 it
was around 143 million. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 143.-
- Oh, that's right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they did do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- 143? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For Funimation.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - For Funimation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] For Crunchyroll
it's around 1.2 billion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wasn't Amazon only like 900 million when- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you say that number again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] 1.2 billion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - $1.2 billion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's more than Amazon bought Twitch for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Twitch for, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow.
- Oh, my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The question </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I wanna know-
- 143 for Funimation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's already surprising, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but the biggest question I have is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right cool, Sony you
have all this fucking money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to spend on Crunchyroll and
Funimation, that's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But in my opinion, it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what are you gonna do with it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is the question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I mean, I guess- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because when Sony back
in the day bought the 95% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Funimation or whatever it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not gonna lie, they didn't
really do much with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I haven't seen much
of a change from Funimation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how well
Funimation was doing back then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- But it seems like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've just gone on
business as usual, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 1.2 billion for
Crunchyroll, just kinda sees </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how much they're investing
in anime, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because they must see the potential </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the anime industry to get to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chill out this big of a market share. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess, maybe they're willing
to throw that much money, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they realized that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a massive competitor
now, and that is Netflix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess when you put it into perspective </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of like Twitch was bought
out, but that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how many years ago was
Twitch bought out by Amazon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably around the same time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that Sony first bought Funimation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it was earlier than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it?
- I think it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 2016, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It must've happened, 2015. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Yeah, but still- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When did they happen
Meilyne, can you Google it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- 2014. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 2014. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay to be fair-
- But still Twitch was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking big shit back then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] Twitch was 970 million. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so Twitch was 970 million. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I guess Twitch in 2014, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I understand it really makes sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Twitch nowadays is pretty
worth like, five, six times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that right?
- Oh, easily. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I would say that, you know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Twitch at that point is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Comparing Crunchyroll
now to Twitch back then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Twitch is still bigger I'd say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would say Twitch was a whole property, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause everyone was expecting
YouTube to buy Twitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember back in the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it was just like-
- Yeah, that's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it was just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like, well,
Google is gonna buy Twitch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just a natural move, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was a big surprise when Amazon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of stepped in.
- And then Jeff Bezos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like, "JK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'ma step in." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's been great for creators, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That, that happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm curious as to why... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you have any thoughts of might why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this might be good or bad for anime fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in general?
(Joey sighs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just-
- I mean, I'd say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a consumer, it would
probably be better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, okay- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - For more money in the
industry is always better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it's not only that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember I would say the golden age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of anime streaming was... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Remember when you could get every anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could conceivably want
to watch on one platform, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which was Crunchyroll back in the day? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it kinda just like got spread out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to different streaming companies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean that was inevitable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that it was gonna happened.
- It was inevitable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The biggest thing I find annoying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't just the fact that I have to pay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for different streaming companies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just the fact that nowadays </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when I go through an anime char, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally have no idea which anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is gonna be in which platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless it's specifically
says like Prime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for example.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want to log onto one service </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, okay, I just wanna... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't care how much I'm
paying for this service, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want to watch all
the anime I want to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in that one service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it's confusing 'cause
I thought "Jujutsu Kaisen," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is that correct? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was on Netflix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that was on Crunchyroll. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's on Crunchyroll.
- But it is on Netflix. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In Japan? (chuckles)
- No, in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, it's really
confusing living in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm like, wait, who owns what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because of Japan and like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because obviously it's pretty
much Japan, rest of the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's how the anime market works, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's really confusing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like, wait, where
do I watch it though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I realized Netflix doesn't
offer English subtitles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably for that reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the licensing, right?
- Yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck, it's a mess though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is a mess.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, how do I know
where to fucking watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then everyone's
just laughing being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs), "Piracy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like TDXT.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna pay, I want an easy service. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want a convenience service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm willing to pay for
a convenient service, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which for the longest time
it was until it wasn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And now it's like I wanna
support the industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but at the same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm having trouble
finding which service </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has got which anime,
I literally have to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is a dedicated
search engine for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the name is like
Because Moe or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the name of the website. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally a dedicated search engine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to search which anime is
on which streaming service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love that someone had to make that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That really is telling- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like this fucking
pre-order like a spreadsheet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what do you get in what pre-order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a fucking know what's on what. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well then would you say
then in that instance that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess a full monopoly
of the Western market </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> onto one service is a benefit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it's not the
monopoly though, is it really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because Netflix is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, but that's
what I'm saying though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if, for example- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, monopoly is always bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But for example, if Sony,
hypothetically is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hey, we wanna buy the anime side of things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the Netflix's, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That would truly, I would
say, turn it into a monopoly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at least in terms of the Western market. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That'd be awful.
- That would basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be a monopoly at that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That'd be awful for anime fans though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it'll be awful for anime fans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but at the same logic
that Garnt was saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would all be on one platform too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's kinda like the
fucking Disney argument, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now, isn't it?
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, yes, all my characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now are gonna be in the MCU. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yay for monopoly, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] (scoffs) Oh my God.
- Because (indistinct), right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like with the whole Disney shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's worrying because if
everything's on fucking Disney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we only get Disney ass products. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- I don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking Disney shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking hate Disney movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That remind me of other
day when I was streaming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how true this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so take this with a grain of salt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But somebody was saying
that there's a rumor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that Disney might be
acquiring "Shonen Jump." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God. No, no.
- Please no, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, seriously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how true that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fact-check this Meilyne. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please, can you fact check this because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fact check. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because he sounded
pretty fucking convincing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when people in the chat
were talking about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But apparently, Disney
is thinking to acquire it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they want to do
a collaborative thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> between "My Hero Academia" and the MCU. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just in my head- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's gotta be a fucking troll though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No way.
- If it is a troll, then- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's gotta be a troll.
- That sounds like a meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it's a troll than
I've fallen for the bait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the same time,
I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if Disney actually wanted do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cannot stand Disney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, think about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like MCU, super heroes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "My Hero Academia," super heroes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a match made in Heaven
according to Disney, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, I can't wait
for when fucking Omai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shows up in "Avengers Five" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my-
- I don't see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't see it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right Joey's bullshitting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is bullshit.
- Maybe I'm using </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the wrong keywords. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God, you know what
that would mean though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The fucking Thanos versus
Goku memes like become real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And become like a
legitimate talking point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It would be horrible for
like a realistic standpoint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But my God the amount
of shit post and memes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would come out of
this will be fucking epic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Again, take it with a grain of salt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It might be a troll. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It might just be-
- Joey's talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> out of his ass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I might be talking out of my ass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know.
- You are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That just means every MCU conversation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would end with, both Goku
could beat. (chuckles). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But Goku could beat Captain America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But could Goku beat HIV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I already liked the way Disney
does things with properties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's worrying that
they're acquiring so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They have so much control over things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because yeah, Disney movie
is streamlined and it's nice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you don't get the
weird shit from Disney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't (indistinct) shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> When I heard about that
supposed rumor, or bullshit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever it was, I wasn't immediately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, that's bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's never gonna happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there is a very likely chance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it very much might happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And if it does happen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's gonna be really bad for anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anime is gonna get fucking
boring when that happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, what I would saying now is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we can basically break
down the main plays to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix of... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Crunchyroll, Funimation and Netflix, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's Sentai Filmwork
doing their own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But I will say that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting those two together, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they do have very different brands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes you watch an
anime and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, this feels like a Netflix show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Beastars" felt like
it belonged to Netflix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- "Devil May Cry" maybe felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it belonged on Netflix. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What I always say when it was
Crunchyroll versus Funimation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that they have exact same branding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I'm just like, oh,
"Kaguya-sama" is on Crunchyroll, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then on Funimation like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Season two is on Funimation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they were both trying
to acquire the same show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the same type of consumers, I feel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that use both Funimation and Crunchyroll. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And not to say that Crunchyroll
users don't use Netflix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and vice versa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I feel that, yeah, as you said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a certain, I don't
know what the right word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Edginess when it comes
to shows on Netflix? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know what the
right word for it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Netflix is that cooler older brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who comes in and is like, hey,
you ever played a game boy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean, like that vibe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've obviously done
work with Netflix, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But this is totally separated from that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I mean their service is the best, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, obviously the Netflix
jail stuff fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes, at least in Japan,
the subtitle differences, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again, those we obviously know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sucks, but you use that player </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, you can't beat that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can download it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and now you can do audio only on a mobile, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I love.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you used to have to keep... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I used to listen to stuff on Netflix, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to keep my phone open in my pocket, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the screen going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- But now you can just do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audio only. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, oh, my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like they know what I fucking want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> before I do it.
- Okay, but the question </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is then, what would you watch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What kind of content would
work for audio only stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like documentary's.
- It's not about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just sometimes I'm
in a situation where I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I couldn't do that for anime, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I'm in a situation where
I can't look at my screen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like just two minutes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause maybe I'm getting off the train, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I'm walking around real quick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna lock my phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I wanna keep listening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just got my headphones on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's just, quick little moments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you just wanna turn it off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you don't want content to just stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Honestly, the big thing for me for Netflix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the skip opening button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Skip opening.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They've also just added
the two times speed, 1.5- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, really?
- So now you can decide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you wanna be a bastard and watch anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at two times speed.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know it's a fucking
cardinal sin to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could skip opening
anime openings, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I skip them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's made it so much more easier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch some of the anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause let's be honest, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They do it automatically for endings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can physically
tell them, no, no, don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause every time "The
Great Pretender" ended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, no, let me listen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I love this song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fucking love this.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes you do watch the ending, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and sometimes you do
listen to the opening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But let's be honest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most of the time you
wanna skip the opening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You watch the opening ones
and it's another generic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> J-pop opening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a binge.
- Especially if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like binging.
- If its a binge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I love binging anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't watch anime weekly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So for me, unless it's a
fucking banger of an opening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is there's always one
or two shows every season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not every fucking show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For me "Beastars" was one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always fucking listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the "Beastars" opening.
- "Beastars has a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking amazing opening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Mob Psycho" as well.
- I was like, no, no, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't skip it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just leave it, Netflix, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just let it play.
- Yeah, come on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna watch this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like, you said,
"The Great Pretender" ending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've always got time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for Freddie Mercury.
- Come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Come on, you've always got time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Never skip Freddie Mercury. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What time is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've got time, regardless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you can download episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know you could do that on
Crunchyroll now, I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you pay extra. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can pay extra to
download in Crunchyroll. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have never tried it
so I don't know how good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the services is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I know you can do it on Funimation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it didn't work that good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was always the biggest
complaint in Funimation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is that the website was garbage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- As far as I wouldn't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't use it downloading the US. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you think the plan is with Sony? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do you think they decided- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a good question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no fucking idea.
- 'Cause that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've always wanted to know, again, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, what is it about
Crunchyroll and Funimation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that Sony was like, "We'll
drop a billion bucks on this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sony has a movie division. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- It's pretty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think a big part of their business. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So do you think we'll start
to see maybe like funding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Sony Original anime on
Crunchyroll and Funimation maybe? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause they have to compete
with Netflix Originals, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right now Sony already
own the production committee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to a lot of anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Including like big animes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I think isn't it
like "The Demon Slayer?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, they could be.
- Kinda funded "Demon Slayer" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's Aniplex, right?
- I have no idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually I might be
talking out of my ass here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which company does Sony own? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it Aniplex? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Aniplex, yeah.
- Yeah Sony owns Aniplex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, Aniplex is a lot of (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm pretty sure Aniplex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was with "Demon Slayer." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- They're usually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the majority of the big shonen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It only makes sense so they'd wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get a big grip on the Western market. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, if you're funding this shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you already have a lot
of say over it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think right now, I don't
know what their plans are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think the amount of
money they threw at it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just shows how much potential they see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the anime market, right?
- Yeah, for real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause.
- It's a gold rush right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think all the companies
are fighting to get control </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over the Western market
'cause they realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this shit's big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like an IP race, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> To see how many IP's they
can grab, essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - While it's still young and
it still hasn't fully settled, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which is now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why wouldn't you just
throw money at the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and try and get all the IP's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get all the foundation set up?
- True, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you see anime becoming as big as, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> say gaming or like other things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in a few years?
- I do, I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe not like hentai, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, maybe not-
- Hey man, hey man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You just wait, you just wait boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just wait.
- You just wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You just wait till I
drop my original hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we will see how big it gets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone watches porn, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But there isn't no like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Avengers of porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, one's discussing like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no podcast about porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think, actually, maybe there is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no big discussions
about porn and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my God, who's Johnny
Sins gonna fuck next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the next episode?
- Johnny Sins </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is the Captain America of porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not gonna be that Garnt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get your hopes down now, all right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know man, isn't like
Pornhub in like the top 20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most used sites.
- Well, they just gutted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> their library.
- Yeah they just destroyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 60% of their library. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (whooshing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This episode is sponsored
by EJ Anime Store. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> of a special introduction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As some of you may know,
over the span of three days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of November, we
released a series of streams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on each of our Twitch channels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as part of a speed run competition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in which we had to put together
one of the EJ Anime Store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plastic model kits,
which is this box here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we had to see who
could do it the fastest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also known as the "Sword Art Online" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Figure-rise Standard Asuna Dengeki </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pearl color limited version. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I said that in one take, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> let's go.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if you've already
watched the streams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you already know who won and lost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Absolutely getting destroyed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I was fast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then Connor was like, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hold up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hold it.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I didn't know this
before, but we have a forfeit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that the loser had to do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Meilyne, is about to present to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my forfeit.
- I've seen it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen it and it's gross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's a black-
- Oh, that stinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a black cobra chili.
- Meilyne, what the fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> did you buy for me?
- No it's not a chili. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is this Meilyne? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] That's a black cobra chili. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that is a black cobra chili, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right there.
- Meilyne, this is not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what we agreed to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - (chuckles) What is this thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a giant water bug. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should have gotten good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not gonna fucking forget this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is Meilyne's idea, by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wasn't our idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh fuck, it's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it just flipped over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you hold one up to the camera, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's disgusting.
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would not wanna eat that. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> - It has the worst fucking after... </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] That whole
thing is 60,000 units. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
- I'm fucking dying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (dramatic music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why did I just do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what you get from
moseying around in a speed run. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanted to get honestly-
- Oh God, I can smell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the chili from here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, the chili is like
a fucking breath of fresh air, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to what I tasted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> My mouth is on fucking fire right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it feels better than
that fucking water bug, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know why, but
I kinda wanna try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I allowed to just try it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] Go for it,
there's three of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One for you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, hey Connor, there's
one for you as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You want one?
- Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't
- So, what do you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You rip off the head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Rip off the head, take out the wings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, wait, what is this used for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this fucking thing-
- For food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh God, that's very juicy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (whines) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like salty- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, God, look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I don't wanna look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't show me, don't pry it's
asshole open in front of me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, let me try. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (soft instrumental music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Oh, God, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] It literally
tastes like salty swamp. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally what it like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you spit it out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Where did you spit it out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - In the (indistinct).
- I just swallowed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] Do you want a purin? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, actually, you know what. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, thank you EJ Anime Store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for sponsoring this
episode of the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck you Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Back to the episode.
- Fuck you! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Back to the episode.
- Fuck you! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (whooshing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (whines) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm fucking bored talking about anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're not even an anime podcast anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine talking about
anime on "Trash Taste" guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Ew! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I'm attempting
to be the Winnie The Pooh meme, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the high class one
when I talk about anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to form opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have opinions Joey.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have well formed-
- I just watch that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't have well formed
opinions about things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, you think we do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just say what I feel, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you don't have
well formed opinions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about anything-
- Fuck off, Garnt! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck off! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anime, food, gaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, no.
- Let's be honest here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's be honest here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I went on a little run
on my stream the other day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just being like, Garnt is actually like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> your parents didn't beat you enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing)
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, he was allowed to get away with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not eating crusts, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I didn't eat my crust- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I think I saw you
talking about that. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I didn't eat my crust right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what my parents would do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They'd be like, "That's fine, Connor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You have dinner ready for tomorrow now." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'll be like, but
mom, I don't want them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "No Connor,
you're eating fucking crust. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "You're not wasting food?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who says that I didn't get my ass beat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for not eating my crust? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Were you like fucking Spartacus, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like, mother I will not bow to the crust. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I had gone my
entire fucking childhood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having to being forced to eat my crust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So as soon as I was a fully
grown adult, who can make my own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking decisions.
- This is what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, mother, I do not
care what you think anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to not eat my crust. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I pay my own rent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I pay my own bills. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I buy my own food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you mother. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All I'm saying is you
should've got a backhand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It should have been a little harder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's such a bad joke, I'm so sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is something that I
didn't fully appreciate as a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or like I didn't fully- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Crust. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, not crust.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good food.
- Not crust, but like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not getting into food by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not getting into food again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was yesterday
fucking cleaning the house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I fucking hate cleaning the house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think anyone in their entire life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> likes cleaning the house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't realize why
my parents fucking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically just every parent
manipulates their kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like their personal slaves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do my job slave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - When it comes to cleaning the house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's the reason why they used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to have so many kids, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, they got
to plow the fields, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I intend to keep that
British philosophy alive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when I have a kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need seven kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He needs to plow the
fields, and clean the house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and prepare the food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Connor's gonna
like mean max that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, my house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has six rooms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's six children,
I need to have, at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> One per room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna beat my kids Valerie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a distasteful joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just saying that now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause why is
the activity of cleaning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just so awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Does anyone... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Who actually enjoys cleaning the house? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you get rid of a lot of dirt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why I let it build up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I let it get gross. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right
- 'Cause when you clean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that shit, it's like
peeling off a good scab. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right,
- Its like, oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, it's so clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but-
- I need to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a physical layer of dust </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in order for me to be like, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude when you swipe a
whole layer of dust off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with like a wet wipe or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> damn that feels good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That takes that (indistinct)
- I get like a quarter chub, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I don't like cleaning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- No, because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, that is a satisfying feeling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But my problem with is
that cleaning just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Shit I never knew as a kid how
much fucking time and effort </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it takes to clean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, when you're a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you just clean your own fucking room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You hoover the living room.
- I didn't even do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or whatever-
- I did that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, you lucky motherfucker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You lucky motherfucker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would, but then five minutes later </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it'd be back to where it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So my parents were just like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I still have
fucking Vietnam flashbacks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of my mom calling me like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I know she's about to ask me
to hoover the living room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it.
(chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna come down right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This time I'm having Vietnam flashbacks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I realized as an adult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the act of cleaning just
like, it takes you all day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the reason I hate it
is because it feels like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when you do something productive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do a hard day of work or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like even playing a video game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you feel like you're making
progress with your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know about the
video game thing, but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, like when it... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like for me, whenever I'm
playing like a first person game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a single-player game,
making progress with this story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah something like that,
- I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This guy.
- Like a JRPG, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're like a JRPG.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel you, I feel you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love wasting my time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With cleaning, the whole.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The entire concept of cleaning is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're working towards
making things zero again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're working towards zero. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're working towards
making things normal again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, what happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it switched off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry, Joey laptop is shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, you're working towards making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the default state zero again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this doesn't feel good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yet it takes so much
time and energy to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And no one prepared this for me as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like shoveling
snow in a blizzard, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's gonna form back up again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like, what's the point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I only used to clean on like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is how I would decide
if I'm gonna clean this day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Is somebody coming to my house? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I'm not cleaning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
Is somebody coming to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is still my stay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, is somebody coming to my house? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fine, I'll clean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what the best
adult purchase I ever made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while I was in the UK?
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- It was a good vacuum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's all this hype
around here's Dyson things? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What is all that hype? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I lived with a friend- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a brand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I lived with a
guy and his dad worked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for the Henry Hoovers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the fucking... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The ones with a smiley face.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Little smiley face? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know if these are in America, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but their everywhere in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- These things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like tanks, they don't die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they also kinda suck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't suck good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They should be sucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct)
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, this guy in my house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I wanna get a Dyson. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "No, no, no mate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "All you need is this thing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he fucking slaps it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "It's a fucking
unit, this thing is." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I broke it within two weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's my own thought there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck did you suck up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The border. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that'll do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, oh no, I
have to get a new one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh no.
- Oh, no there's a puddle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quick grab the hoover. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, I have to get a new vacuum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I bought a Dyson, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That shit cleaned up... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It could have, oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The carpet was a different color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, what have I been doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my whole life?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never believed in that Dyson shit too, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> until I bought one a couple of years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, it changes the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lets see how good these are? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I do it, I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Not buying anything else anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the one thing.
- You crank that shit up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to max suck and like, oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It gives the good suck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The max suck.
- The max suck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's how I could... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, this Dyson has all this bullshit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about rotating fucking
things like 10 cylinder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a load of shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me say why it's good, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know that one piece that always sticks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the fucking carpet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that doesn't come off.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dyson never has an issue
getting that one crumb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> out of the carpet.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That shit always comes out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the normal vacuums
they don't get that shit out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- There's always that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing that for some
reason won't come out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like clinging onto the carpet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with dear life, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you're like,
how many roll overs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> am I gonna do this thing
until I just admit defeat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bend over, pull out of the
carpet, like an animal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and feed it into the vacuum
like it's some budget dog. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like here you go, here you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Come on, take, take. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't like doing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- I don't wanna do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not a peasant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I shouldn't have to touch
my carpet with my hands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. (laughs)
- So yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how I can sell it to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You will never have to bend over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll never have to bend to the knee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, it's amazing, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was my gift to my
parents when I went to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously I couldn't bring it with me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- So I was like, parents, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can have my priced possession. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's a vacuum cleaner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Here's a vacuum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like bending over, like giving them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the sword of Camelot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, fucking here you go mother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing)
Take it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Take my Dyson V12 max suck edition. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> To be fair, she thought
it was all nonsense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but she tried it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like, "All right Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "this is a pretty fucking good gift." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I get you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She was converted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're welcome mum.
- She was converted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is a lot like the biggest reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't cook or I don't like cooking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because cooking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like cooking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cooking's great, I like the food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cleaning up, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the ratio of
time it takes to clean up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus eating good food,
nice home cooked food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not optimal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so sub-optimized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The entire activity of cleaning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just sub optimized in life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've become like
me, I swear, recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're caring about the
splits, the efficiency. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cleaning for me has
always been suboptimal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why this is
the one activity in life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's just like, this
needs to be balanced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There needs to be like
a balanced patch in life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just makes cleaning less effort. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like doing a 20-minute side quest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to get to a two-minute main question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah because it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It takes more like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a side quest that
takes more time and energy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than the fucking main quest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You finish cleaning
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, all right,
time to get down to work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like cool, I'm
glad I spend 30 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cooking this thing that
took me two minutes eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Exactly, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I order a lot of Uber Eats, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I caved and in Japan
they have an Uber Eats pass, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where if you pay $9 a month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you get free delivery fee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So there's no delivery fee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like two bucks each time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, fuck dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> am I really ordering this
much fucking take out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, yeah, I am. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- And then I did it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my head, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did this thing where for
three times when I cooked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I timed it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't speed run it or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't doing splits or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Expendedicts, 80%.
- Yeah, I was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the onion split. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, I got a gold onion split. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No, I wasn't doing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just had a timer and I timed genuinely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how long it took, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- And then I timed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cleaning up, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Because I wanted to know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> based on my average earnings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a month, right,
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is this technically, am I
losing money by cooking myself? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I was like, this
is how I can scientifically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> justify to myself ordering takeout. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I split it up, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did the average... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I knew you guys would
fucking laugh at me for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just hilarious that
you went to this effort. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is big brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, well.
- Do it yourself, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Go home now.
- No, I don't have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you've done it for us, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do not enjoy cooking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that whole factor of enjoyment is gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not a factor of my decision. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But do you enjoy the end result? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I enjoy Uber Eats more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, there is something
about a home cooked meal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay to be fair-
- 'Cause you can cook it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly the way you wanted to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a charm about a home cooked meal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you know how to cook. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My cooking's mixed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you don't then its
just like punishment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should try it sometimes Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, I'm good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just tell Akie to be like, yo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I only make like curry and Mexican. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all I make, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- (chuckles) Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, that's all
you need in my book. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So Mexican food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't really like make enough to store, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's really expensive,
the ingredients as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But curry, I can only make
like enough for like six meals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's just pretty nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause then that like the like time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> versus money effort is fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I don't cooking anything else, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because when I did this thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I found out that I was like wasting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you did the time to money conversion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on my earnings to like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like 40% less efficient
to cook my own meals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor's got like a fucking
Spreadsheet (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it was driving me insane, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was speaking to some people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who were like this fucking
entrepreneur people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "I never
cook or clean or any thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I hire a maid, I get Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't do any of that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "It's a waste the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm on that grind 24/7." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In reality, I would like an
extra hour to play video games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna lie.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because in my life, an extra
hour to play video games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's quite a lot of time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- So if I can get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an extra hour playing video games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I can then later on
spend an extra hour working </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, okay, it makes
sense to just get Uber Eats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just Connor the podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to justify his spending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that what this is?
- No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this rich people problem? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kidding, I'm joking.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's entrepreneurial problems. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I completely- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, this is why we became </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking entrepreneurs, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I've never fucking enjoyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cleaning in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- I never will enjoy cleaning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what's the only, I
guess housework quote, unquote </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I really enjoy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Doing the laundry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, laundry is nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's something about
laundry, it hits man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I just put some
music on, I'm outside- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you still clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You still clean.
- Yeah, usually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a nice day and I'm
just hanging up my clothes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, hey, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- Stress free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro-
- Sub-optimize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, listen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
- No. No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is why Sydney does the laundry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- Thank you Sydney by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is why I get a woman to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I laugh sometimes, 'cause my mom's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You're gonna need to learn how to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "the laundry someday, someday." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Sydney come- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Formigation family bond.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then Sydney comes along
and it's like, I love laundry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Laundry is so relaxing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll think of thing of
like your old school teacher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like you're not
gonna carry a calculator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with you every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like (laughs), about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna say it dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have fresh sheets not
only is that sleep the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the best wank you'll have in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a whole month dude,
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in fresh sheets, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're disgusting.
- Wait, you wank away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why am I disgusting Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time out, time out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry, you can (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you like wanking onto your sheets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you like jizzing on to it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm outside on the fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now, when you put them on, it's so fresh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the room smells nice,
and it feels comfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, ah, time to wank. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was the biggest they
had us in the first half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever had on this podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I was gonna be like,
yeah I know exactly what you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What are you saying?
- Are you saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, Garnt.
- I don't jerk off in my bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't jerk off in my bed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so that's probably why.
- Okay, well if you have sex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in it as well, its also great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's not what you said though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You said fucking (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you would have said that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then we would be like,
yes I agree Connor, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same thing, same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The same climax in the bed, fresh sheets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the same thing, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I love fresh sheets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate the process of
getting fresh sheets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, like putting on bed sheets- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, you've seen my setup. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, what's your setup? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay wait. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor has like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, you look at Connor's gaming setup, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything is like optimized. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then you see his bed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, one of those Reddit reacts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to some of the worst fucking
gaming setups you've ever seen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a $2 bed set up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just have like a fucking towel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on your fucking mattress. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So there's literally nothing
in my bedroom except a bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's like, literally nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's like this-
- Why not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, it's
for my fucking bedroom, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just sleep in there
and do anything else, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, your bed frame is like broken, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't it?
- Yeah, it's broken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well, yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I bought the cheapest one on Amazon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when I moved here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Cause, moving is expensive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it was so expensive that I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuck I gotta cut cost. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I regret it because
I bought a $200 bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was the mattress combined. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And this shit fucking awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All the Springs are
fucked, the beds broken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literally- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were talking so much about like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, why would you buy a $20 headset, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you can just buy a $100 one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you get your money's worth? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here's the thing, here's the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I had that philosophy, but
again moving kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> distorts your price range. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you're spending like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got to put down like a
fucking 4K deposit on this shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the flights are this much, I
had to pay shipping for my PC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I was spending a lot of money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm kinda losing a lot of money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've gotta start saving costs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't buy a 10K bed frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right, right.
- So I bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the cheapest one on Amazon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which I regretted within about two weeks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually no, immediately when I built it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause building it was a
pain in the fucking ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I could tell
when I was building it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh no, this isn't
even like budget plywood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like the throw away
plywood that they would use- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like the foamy plywood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the worst. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember seeing the exact bed frame </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you bought on Amazon, and it
was like two and a half stars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's when I knew that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mistakes were made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I just wanted something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I wanted it now, and
I've regretted it so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But anyway, what happened was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the most ghetto thing that I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that I'm actually using a bed sheet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as like a mattress cover. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughs)
- So what happened was, right- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you stretch that sheet over it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, actually with a lot
like the fucking power of Zeus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like (groans). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like pulling the Red Sea back together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm trying to put these bed sheet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a zip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It goes all around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my mattress. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you fucking zipped
it around your mattress. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You like put it in? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just fucking like
condomed your mattress. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck did you do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like fucking Spartacus,
when he's kicking the guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like doing that to my mattress </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time I wash it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (groans)
- Wait, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to do that every
time you wash your mattress </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as well, sorry, wash your bed sheet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I wash my bed sheet
as well, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I have-
- So you have to fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strip this thing out and then wash it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then condom it back in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because-
- I feel so sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for your bed sheet, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its very stretch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, but also I do avoid
that annoying thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like the only plus in this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've gone to the many negatives. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> The only plus is that, you know
that fucking annoying thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're sleeping and
the bed sheet comes off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the corner? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can never get it back on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you actually get off the bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fucking hate that, that sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Never have that issue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because the entire
thing is wrapped. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, its zipped up around it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can see like the benefits of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because the best bedsheets
are the ones that are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super tight, they're firm.
- Firm, firm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- If I see wrinkles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on that sheet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (sighs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like instant- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know it's soft too
because sometimes you'll wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and on your body you have imprints. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I hate that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I'm just like,
what the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Instant soft sheet right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do have a backup bed sheet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is actually like
proper, but I refuse to use it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> unless I'm desperate
because I love this one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I like even putting it back on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You love fucking turning
your mattress into a beanbag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So here's how I ended up
with bed sheet as my duvet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it goes all around my mattress. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fully put it all around
my mattress and zip it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all around.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So when I moved here, I went to Nitori, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is kinda like Japanese Ikea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I think we mentioned before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I go there, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I buy the pillows, the pillow sheets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I buy the duvet and I
go to the staff member, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I ask him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like I'm making sure I've
got Google translate, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, duvet or like
whatever they're fucking called, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blanket, whatever? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did not say fucking futon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did not say futon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm showing him, I'm like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I even showed a picture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I want this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a matrix, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a couple of matrix.
- This part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which one is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then like broken Japanese
with Google translate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, oh, no problem fam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Points me to this, I buy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get home, what do you think it is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a fucking futon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he saw me buy the
futon, another futon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't even in the
same section as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that's where I was
confused when I got home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm like, wait, this
was in a different section. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why don't we have two
different futon types? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So I have two fucking futon covers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I have the bed sheet and then I have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, the mattress.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So I got home and I needed to sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, well, fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's going in one way or another. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's going over my bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think Garnt helped me
the first time get it on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This was a two-person- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a two-person job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like how the fucking do
you get that on yourself? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, the stuff we got... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay.
- I thought- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you like cold, Garnt every time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You Just assumed that
you've got a duvet now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've mastered the
technique of doing it, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, this is what I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To get it off it's easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's like you're letting- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wants to get off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like letting a pig out of clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That sheet wants to come up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Get it back on, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, first of all, this is the setup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I flip my mattress to the side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's upright. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I fucking pull over half. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I flip it upside down
the other end, pull it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then this basically,
what happens is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's up to here, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So this is horizontal way, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- I've got to basically force </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this sheet together. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Grab it together and hold it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it hurts my hands 'cause it's tight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta like slowly pull a
little bit by little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if I let go, it all goes back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I have to keep grabbing
a little bit and zipping, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grabbing a little bit and zipping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a pain in the
fucking ass and I hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why don't you just get a fucking duvet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like putting on the
world's largest condom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) is the bed sheet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just get a proper bed sheet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just get a proper bed sheet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love the firmness of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love how tight it is around my bed- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just get a fucking bed sheet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - At this point, you might as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not even have a fucking bed sheet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I like it.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a difference
between having no bed sheet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having a firm bed sheet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I sweat like a motherfucker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need a bed sheet.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So then just buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking bed... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a thousand yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I've kind
of gotten used to it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I kinda like it now though- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its not a struggle to him obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This man literally made a Spreadsheet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to optimize cooking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he can't even buy a fucking bed sheet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well.
(roars) (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because then I gotta optimize that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's another thing I would optimize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sick of it man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, to be fair, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that whole organization with the Uber Eats </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just to justify to
myself why I can have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pad thai three times a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- To be honest. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like the final result of cooking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and cleaning fucking bedsheets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like having to change your duvet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you find it annoying? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like fiddliest fucking thing ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like take the duvet off
and like putting it back on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having to make sure every corner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is perfectly situated on every- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you have a zipped up one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every corner will be.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't have a choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not the bed sheet, the
actual fucking blanket part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's easy, 'cause
the ones in Japan, big brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They come with the holes at the end, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can just flip it up inside, out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grab the thing, and then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's what I always do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you know you could do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What?
- That's what I've done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever since I was little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you turn it inside out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you, like a little
ghost, you put it over you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) with both hands.
- Yeah, I do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you grab the ends of the futon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just like flip it over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then shake it down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah then shake it down.
- And then release. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like for me, I don't know if- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't that that what hotels do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, 'cause they gotta speedrun it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they're doing like a hundred rooms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if my like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I think I have
like my fucking nightmare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where my duvet is not the
same size as my blanket. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's slightly bigger.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I always have like left-
- I hate that, I hate that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you have like a little bit of fabric </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> left over.
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It triggers me so much, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate the ones like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Our old fucking duvet
it was the perfect size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the problem was is that it would... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The duvet inside would move around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like one end of the
duvet would just have like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just fucking scrunched up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that you try and pull
it over, it's just sheet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like fuck,
where the fucking duvet go? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This why I think you are most likely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have a mental breakdown when
you're doing your bedsheets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or putting your duvet on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what it is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I fucking hate it, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I fucking hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what it is
about putting sheets on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but what if it just doesn't work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wanna cry and just
be like, why won't it work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why won't it work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is my day going bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to work in a hotel lodges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like ski fields and stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I had to do that
shit every fucking day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I basically- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you shovel shit out of the drains </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you gotta go do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was basically-
- That sounds like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my nightmare.
- Yeah, so at first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then he came to adopt the sheet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's 30 rooms in this hotel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't seem too bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Five rooms in and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck man, I wanna go home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Just fucking around with the duvet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like not going in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have 25 rooms left to do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would actually have a mental breakdown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just do like five
sheets in like one hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I would actually be like,
no, I don't think life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is for (indistinct).
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, I'm not getting
paid enough for this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would actually work in-
- I'd rather shovel shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'd rather shovel shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like fucking get shouted at McDonald's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than do five duvets in a row, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So now I'm just used to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've lived through
that fucking Vietnam war. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What didn't you do at this job, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Jesus Christ.
(Joey scoffs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't work in the kitchen,
that's for sure. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because there's
something fucking special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about hotel duvets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Getting in like a hotel bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just feeling like you're
in a fucking straight jacket, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking love that feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't like it when hotels do that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when they fucking-
- Yeah, because you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the bed and you're like, what is this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the world's fucking strongest
man for weight pulling? </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> You feel like fucking safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You feel covered. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I feel like I'm
in a straight jacket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is my safe zone right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and no one can fucking touch me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like a moth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like a fucking caterpillar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who is like about to fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No! (laughs)
- Okay, what about... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate it when they tuck
half the fucking duvet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> under the front of the bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So you're getting in and
it's like you're trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to fucking tow a car when
you're pulling this sheet out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like this on the bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (groans) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just shimmy myself
in and I'm just like, ah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I'm back in
my mom's room right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Nothing can harm me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't even shimmy myself in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like I'm trying to get
into pants five sizes too small. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, fuck I gotta get in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel bad as well when they
put like a cloth on the bed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, like that sheet they put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the front of the bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, get rid of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get that fucking out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh the thing at like the end? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a linen thing or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what that's for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is that for?
- It's for... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently it's an American thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Apparently it's so that you
can wear shoes on the bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (gasping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm about to leave right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, you probably seen
it before in hotels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where there's just like this one weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking tablecloth size- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I hate that thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] At the end of the bed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's for shoes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the shoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they do that in Japanese hotels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you have to take your
shoes off at the front. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's what I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why?
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay.
- I understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in American hotels- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - As the only white person here- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't put this on me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need your opinion.
- I was raised correctly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shoes on sofas and beds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does that trigger you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as it should?
- Yes, yes. Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My parents would hit me if I did that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never understood. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always thought, you
know when you'd watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "The Simpsons" or like
American TV shows or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> how they would take their
shoes off before going to bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They would like keep their
shoes on the side of the bed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then when they wake up
the first thing they would do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is put shoes on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just thought that was like parody. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't actually think
Americans did that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's not just America, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's most of the fucking West. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> As an Asian, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why did the West just normalize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> war cries?
- I'm like, why your like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dirty fucking gross ass
shoes on the carpet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That shit's gross.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what blows my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, you are literally dragging </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> daily shit into your carpet
by bringing your shoes in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It drives me insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then people complain being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh man, I hate carpet
because it's so dirty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, well, yeah cause
you're put your own shoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whenever I would go to a friend's house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they would be like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I go to his house
and he would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's okay, you can keep your shoes on." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, motherfucker, tell
me to take my shoes off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to take my shoes off, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would actually (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not a fucking animal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna bring dirt
into the house, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when I'm shitting with
shoes on in somebody's house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it feel so weird.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I'm in a public restroom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna shit with my shoes on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna be comfortable, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, this shit drives me insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's people... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There'll be people call me and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I wear my shoes in bed." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stop.
- Stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stop.
- For your own sake, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> please stop.
- It's gross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If you wanna go against the
Geneva Conventions, just do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do it in your own fucking-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It goes against basic human rights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know right.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - To wear shoes in bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love all our fans except for the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that wear shoes to their bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All my homies hate people
who wear shoes in bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - My God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I went to fucking... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jesus, my editor Evan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I went to his house and
that was disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He had like a five inch thick carpet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what color this
carpet was supposed to be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it definitely wasn't
the color that it came as. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This shit was vile, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Evan, fix that fucking carpet man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they all will wore like
the dirtiest shoes inside, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, Evan, I can't, I can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, I'm like have you
not heard of house slippers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you have to wear something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wear slippers.
- Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's wrong with bare feet, man or socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but even if,

(whooshing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Going back to the topic
of beds and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Opinions on pajamas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do any of you guys wear pajamas? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I sleep naked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Specifically like pajamas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, just pajamas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, for me it's just like underwear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and some random T-shirt.
- All right, good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand pajamas at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And some people- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wear a T-shirt to bed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna wear... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you wear a T-shirt To bed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless it's like fucking stinking hot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the summer, I'll wear no shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But most of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to wear a shirt.
- Max comfort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the least amount of clothes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you could wear, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you basically only wear boxers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so you're fucking dangly
bits don't go everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's pretty much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the only reason though.
- I like the freedom though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Let them loose.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sleeping, I wanna be comfy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like wearing a T-shirt
because sometimes in the morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the weather can completely change. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially nowadays in the winter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm a little bit too cold if I don't wear, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least a T-shirt,
even with the heater on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about when you stay
like a friend's house? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you wear a T-shirt when you sleep? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm just like
immediately, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right I'm stripping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm getting-
- It depends how close I am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to that friend, really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't matter who they are, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I'm staying in your house, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll sleep with boxers on, I'll humor you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I won't get my junk everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll sleep with boxers on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like you can just not wear a shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't sleep with the T-shirt on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why?
- Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I feel
like I'm outside still? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I take the T-shirt off,
in my head it signifies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay we're going to bed
or I'm going in the bath. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you the type of person who like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when doing a serious heavy shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to like take your shirt off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> No fucking way is this true right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm serious, I'm serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, do you think like

<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> belt it up.
- It's like, ah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause for me wearing a T-shirt in bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like, sometimes,
especially in the winter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you wake up and it's like
a cold fucking morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I love that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like how do you escape
your duvet at that point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, I don't know, being branded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like just fucking do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just do it.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For me it's just like
gravity has increased tenfold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in this bed.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like experiencing 10
G's in this bed right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I actually can't get out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally takes me like an hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get out of bed in this case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have like the fucking
"Call of Duty" text </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> popping up on my screen,
mission, get to the shower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that's what it's like for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have to do like one
limb at a time to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, let me just
get my right arm out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and once that's like room temperature </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I'll get my right leg out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, all right, now I can go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to have like a heated thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that you could put under your bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But that just made me
lazier, so I got rid of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - (chuckles) What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I never wanted to leave the bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a heated bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a heated thing under the mattress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that it was always warm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I was like, this
is also a fire hazard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah, I just don't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can not get out of bed with this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, okay, have we
talked about a kotatsu before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't remember.
- I don't think we have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Explain them to the audience Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So they watch anime, you watch anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what a kotatsu is.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you don't know what a kotatsu is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's basically like a heated coffee table </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like a little coffee table </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has blankets around it
and you put your legs in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you put them under, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's all nice and cozy, and warm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it is amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know about amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a few logistical issues </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that crop up with kotatsu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, how many legs can fit under there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Depends on how big the table is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Depends on how big the table is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's normally not that big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You can comfortably probably
fit two people's legs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you comparing this to my kotatsu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is fucking tiny? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, like a normal kotatsu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I wanna stretch my legs fully out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> underneath that thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can only really fit
like two before you start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> touch people's legs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna touch Joey's legs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their disgusting.
- Why not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Disgusting.
- All my homies touch legs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't wanna play footsie
with Joey under the table </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm playing Uno. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna twiddle toes while I call Uno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What if you don't know them super... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh you pretty do know the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you sharing a kotatsu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not sharing a kotatsu
with a fucking stranger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why not?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That should be in a restaurant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's weird.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's nice, but then also
I find that it's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you can turn it up and down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's either like I
would rather the room be hot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than my legs be hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I would not rather that.
- No? No? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I literally had
this problem recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is why I get reminded why I really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't fucking like winter, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So unlike these boys,
I fucking hate the cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I hate winter.
- I love the cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love the cold.
- And the reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate it is because,
you're in a cold room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you wanna get comfortable, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so what'd you do, you
put it on the heater, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I hate the feeling of a stuffy room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like this room's getting bit- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you considered-
- You're from a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stuffy country though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you considered wearing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> another item of clothing?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Perhaps a jumper or a hoodie?
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there's a problem
because if you wear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking jumper or something
and the room is cold, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then your fucking hands are cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like I'm just trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to work.
- It is not that cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it can get that
cold sometimes in winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does the blood circulate
to your fingers enough or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - My fucking feet... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Before we turned on this heater, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> my fucking feet were ice cold, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am not joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really not that cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get cold limbs.
- Are you a fucking lizard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with your body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, my body was just
not built for the cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's nothing more
uncomfortable for me- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Built different in the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Than just a stuffy room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause sometimes I'm like,
maybe I'm getting ill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I realize I go outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's because the room's so stuffy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I haven't realized how
uncomfortable I'm feeling- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's why I very
rarely turn on the heater, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unless it's like a seriously cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because for me it's like, if I'm cold, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just wear another layer of clothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then A, the room isn't
stuffy and B, I'm warm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also it's really easy
to make a room not stuffy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just open a window for like one minute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> after you've heated the up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It won't be cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after one minute.
- Yeah, but then after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you open the window, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it gets cold again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then like one minute-
- And then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the cycle continues- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not in one minute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There is never a perfect temperature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm like happy with when it's winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because if I need to like
artificially warm it up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then either it's gonna be too stuffy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I'm gonna be too cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is no between. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But there's something so nice
about being in a warm room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> knowing it's freezing outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I agree.
- There's something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's so magical about that.
- It's like going to bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a thunderstorm, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> There's something comforting about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't if you guys relate to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just gave you like
the thousand yard stare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You were like, "Yeah, you guys
know what I'm talking about." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I like it, I like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know what you mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like white noise outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's something comforting about outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is fucked right now, but I'm
safe inside dry and warm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some of the best sleeps I've had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been like camping on the floor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but because it's so
fucking freezing outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're in your
little like worm cocoon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I agree, I agree.
- It's, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just like being
comfortable existing, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make my existence more comfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just like being in
a room and being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, I can do whatever I want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you just spoke
on behalf of all humanity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want a comfortable existence- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna be- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He just wants to wear a
fucking turtleneck in his room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be a happy boy.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, what's wrong with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna put on a heater- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, to be honest,
the only reason why I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, two reasons why I
don't wear turtlenecks, A- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You look like an asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I look like a dick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> B, my neck-
- Yo, Steve Hanjobs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> here though, come on.
- No, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can make it work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't make it work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I look like a fucking
weirdo with a turtleneck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But B, my neck for some reason,
I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it exerts so much fucking heat that... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like legit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the reason why I
can't wear a scarf, either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because when I wear a scarf,
my neck gets so fucking sweaty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, I fucking love wearing scarfs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, I-
- Scarfs are great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love wearing scarves too, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but only if it's like really,
like I'm talking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 10, -20 degrees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally the reason why I
started wearing turtle necks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> had nothing to do with like me thinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> turtleneck looks nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just remember the first
time I put on a turtleneck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh, this is like
permanently wearing a scarf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I'd never have to take off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is like perfect for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly.
- 'Cause I fucking love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the feeling of wearing scarfs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, but it doesn't
matter how cold it is for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why I get
so sweaty around my neck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who needs renewable energy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when we can just use Joey
fucking neck to power the planet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can just all hurdle
around my neck like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just warm your hands up on my neck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> My neck is always so fucking hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which sucks, because
people have always told me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, you look
really good in a scarf." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, yeah, I like wearing scarfs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I like the feeling of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But I can only wear for maybe like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, you say that you're fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you're not really fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I like wearing a scarf </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think I look good in a scarf, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the problem is I can't wear a scarf </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for more than two minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause then I'm like,
fuck this, it's so hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Overheating, overloading. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kinda on topic... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, go on Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, going back to why I like kotatsus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that kotatsus is like, I
can feel warm in a kotatsu </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and not feel stuffy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like one of the few
spaces where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm getting hot, I can
just roll on the kotatsu and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's the problem
I have with kotatsu, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this exact same problem
I have with beds in winter? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the moment I enter the kotatsu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the G's jerk up like 10
G's and I can't leave it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, I feel the same way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also how are we look
sitting on the floor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sitting on the floor isn't
that comfortable for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And kotatsu you normally
have to sit on the floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need some like back support, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there's those chairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's the back support.
(indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, those are pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, most of the time they don't
really have those, do they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just kinda like, you just sit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you've gotta put your hands back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you wanna lean back a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can lean back on the couch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, if there's a
couch there, it's nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but (indistinct) people don't have that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, (indistinct), right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, I'm being nitpicky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should just bring your
own fucking foldable chair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like if you have kotatsu, I'm coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like that guy
with the camping chair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like flips it out with hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I'm ready for the kotatsu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm ready to be comfortable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- Yeah, honestly kotatsu... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the first time
I tried out a kotatsu </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here in Japan and it was like
instant life-changing moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a warm table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are you here like,
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how is it life-changing?
- Come on, come on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> come on, come on.
- Fuck off! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you have some of those moments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how did I go my entire life without this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like okay, heat- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is pretty fucking likable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Heated toilet seats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The first time I went to Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and tried a heated toilet
seat, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> how is the rest of the
first world fucking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Other first world countries
haven't caught on to this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I won't lie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I have actually
ruined toilets myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause whenever I go to a toilet now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't have a
bidet, I legit feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm bored.
- I have a panic attack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I legit feel like, how am I
supposed to wash my ass clean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wipe it, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not an animal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't touch that area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I ever move back to the UK, no joke, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm 100% like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Invest in a bidet.
- Even if the suitcase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is empty, dude, I'm making room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the premium $1,000 bidet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I'm using that shit daily. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna shit like a king. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And like I remember Prosey D, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was talking to him, as well one time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, dude when
he came back from Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one thing he brought was a bidet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- 'Cause he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I insist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He has taste, man, he has taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was arguing like, I
insist that I shit like a king. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, honestly,
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I completely understand it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause once you get used to a bidet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get the heated seat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a little pressure washer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can have it set to
like boom, boom, boom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that go back and forth on your
ass cheeks, it's nice dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My ass feels permanently clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why wouldn't I wanna shower
for my ass every time shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes I don't even shit, but I do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm like, why not clean my ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why not?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got some time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got time.
- I wanna make my ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feel refreshed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause sometimes right, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have those days where
like it's a hot day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get like swamp ass,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Where you're ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gets kinda sweaty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not even bad, but
just a little bit, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, why not just clean it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're butt cheeks get
a little (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why not clean my cheeks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I completely missed on this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So you're not talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's heated seat.
- The heated seat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is also amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you're talking bidet?
- Yeah, the bidet and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the heated seat is part
of the bidet package, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Even the cheapest ones have that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I don't use the
ass washing function </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of the bidet at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just doesn't feel clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know.
- It's clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know.
- It's the cleanest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does not and like I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are kidding me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like going to
space and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I never look out the window. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would I ?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would I look at the window? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you bidet your ass, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You got the water shooting up your ass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you stop it, and then
you just got wet ass cheeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you get some of the toilet paper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just dry it a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you dry it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like you
need the toilet paper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it doesn't feel
clean without that wipe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why you have to wipe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of them have dryers
and those are pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you tried? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you tried Garnt?
- I have you tried. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck off, you haven't tried.
- I have tried. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, because there is a
difference between wiping to dry... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are we talking
about this (indistinct)? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a different in
wiping to dry your ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and wiping to get the shit out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're very different
types of wipes, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One is like a deep wipe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the other is like a shower wipe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - One is just-
- One is an excavation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the other is a pat down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look, toilet papers were not
designed to wipe wet asses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because your ass isn't
the fucking Amazon River, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a little moist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You just wipe that shit dry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I hate is When you
have a wet ass after a bidet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you go to wipe it and the toilet paper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just fucking disintegrates on your hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro are you using one ply?
- How much water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you fucking using? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, how much water can your asshole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in vertical position contain?
(laughs) (claps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It doesn't matter.
- And second of all- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Its fucking toilet paper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What ply are you using Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What ply are you using? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One ply, fucking sandpaper? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What are you using to absorb this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta use the double though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least
- Bro, double minimum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Toilet paper- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What ply are you using Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Answer real quick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's a ply? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - (chuckles) It's how many
sheets of paper is used in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, okay.
- Are you using one square </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like shit I'm allowed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't fucking matter, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Anyone who lives in Asia-
- No, no, it does matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyone who lives in Asia
knows that toilet paper here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is weak as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is flacid.
- That sounds broke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That sounds broke as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You sound broke right now Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe how much
of a peasant joke this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I thought it
was just a Thai thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where toilet paper was just
like fucking flacid, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I moved to Japan and toilet paper here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like fucking weak as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you can't buy the good shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you get the double ply shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you do maybe like
one wrap around your hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's more than enough to
absorb any amount of liquid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's down three.
- Yeah, you would pile on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> three little sheets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's a nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thickness to it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're two-ply (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least that thick, and
then just get under there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it won't rip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And your ass is clean and it's dry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cannot believe you would come here... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause honestly, bidet is
in the top three things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about Japan, if I'm
gonna be honest with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Heated toilet seats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bidet's okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The whole shitting
experience is top three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The whole toilet experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a top three
Japanese thing for me, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's just great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, another thing- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I look forward to shitting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Another thing about bidets as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it shoots up right up your asshole, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's exactly what I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you just feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're fucking shitting
out water and so like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How gaped is your asshole? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you like goatse? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he's like this.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like. (grunts) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like just sit down on it, man.
(claps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just fucking water
stuck in your asshole, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A bidet-
- No. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you like giving yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a prostate massage on a bidet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just not- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you got water stuck in your anus? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do you do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What is your asshole like?
- Unless I'm fucking like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you putting your
asshole over the bidet thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you putting it in?
- With the hose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, are you putting the hose in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are you doing?
- No, the stream of water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is fucking strong enough- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Put that down, put it down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You probably set it to
like fucking pressure hose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's how-
- He's got it to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> public fountain display.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because if its not strong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's just a fucking
trickle on your ass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's no cleaning up shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is called medium. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You need the fucking pressure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to fucking clean that shit off your ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if it has enough pressure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to clean the shit off your ass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then you're getting water
stuck in your asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no in between.
- No, you're not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No you're not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My bidet is on the fucking
max pressure and it's perfect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because you can feel
the shit coming off and, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I don't know about you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but my asshole is normal.
- Fucking ironclad asshole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right here man.
- Yeah, just clench it a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're all right.
- I clench up a little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause if you clench then your not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking cleaning it properly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes you are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you're shitting, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait, you're not cleaning
it properly when you clench? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course you are.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean like clench? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait you clench when you
fucking bidet that shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - A little bit.
- Pucker up your asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pucker up a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (claps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt is like relax my anus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Allow the water to flow in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you doing?
- You're giving yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking bidet anima. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what it feels like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It obviously feels like I'm
taking a fucking bidet anima </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> every time.
- You're doing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> totally wrong Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, because like I
don't clench when I shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're just like, I let
gravity do its work. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is this, a fun slip
and slide you're asshole? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> How is the shit coming out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How lubed up is your asshole? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean by clench? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just mean push? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, punch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the same thing, normally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, okay, that doesn't
how with the bidet is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Still goes up the fucking asshole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you push that shit out, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need an anatomy of
your asshole in display. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Can we get an X-ray of your asshole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so we can see what's going on.
- Can we get like a bidet cam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just to see how fucking
loose your asshole is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it gets bidet. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't like the
feeling of water on my ass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't know, it just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So wait, what about in the shower? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what do you
cleaning your ass with? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, so you know when- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you clean your ass Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I clean my fucking ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you clean your ass? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You talked about the sweaty feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your asshole.
- Swamp ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, swamp ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I get swamp ass, I just
take a fucking shower, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even bidet that shit.
- A whole shower, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I fuck-.
- That's so unnecessary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can take three showers a day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if I need to.
- Garnt takes one shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and goes home, he's like
fuck gotta shower now, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, sometimes
if I wanna feel clean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after a shit I just take
a fucking shower, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Quick five minute. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you doing in this toilet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt is that one dude when
you leave some public restrooms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a fucking war zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- That must be Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The shit everywhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shit on the wall.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, that is Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's Garnt going in the rest room- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like shit in places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you didn't think shit would end up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the fucking opposite, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> My shit-
- Why would I use a bidet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when it can't reach the wall. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My shits are like the cleanest shits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck off! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck off!
- They are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no such thing as a clean shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, have you never
had the perfect shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The no wipes, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the perfect
shit, which is just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just shit out a log and
it's like one solid clean log. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you look at it
and it's like, no wipe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at it and you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man, that's a fucking
piece of art right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - In my family, we call that the swish, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it doesn't touch the sides. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope no one's eating
during this episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yo, I just did a
swisher over there, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't need a fucking bidet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after you did that fucking swish, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I still like it though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still do it anyway
because it feels good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, that is like the
equivalent of coming to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just being like, yeah man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just ate only KFC and Burger King. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you've wasted
the true potential of Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what have you done? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is on pearl honestly with
food talking about Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like food is amazing and
the shitting experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is also God like.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually look forward to taking a shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I can't wait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to crack open the bidet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just feel amazing.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Crack open the bidet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Crack open the. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Crack open the bidet with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Crack open the bidet and
just have a great fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) You shit for pleasure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I do.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, I used to shit
'cause it was a bodily function. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now I look forward to my
shits 'cause it's Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they've figured out
how to make shitting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> an enjoyable experiences. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I look forward to
shitting for other reasons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if the bidet is just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not one if it.
- What's the other reason? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you have a warm ass? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, one, I have a warm ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's like two fucking
sacred places for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and one is the shower and the other one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is when I'm taking a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Probably like my channel wouldn't exist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if I couldn't shit or shower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause where the fuck am
I gonna get my ideas from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're having fucking
existential crisis on the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck, yes I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who doesn't, do you not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because taking a
shit for me is enjoyable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I have a great time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the reason... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People think that I take
such a long time to shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm having like
a mental breakdown time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I'm just having a fucking great time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, why would I leave early </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm having this much fun right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking love shitting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bidets are just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, in Thailand we
have like an even worse thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a self bidet, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So in like most Southeast Asian countries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we don't have like the
auto on your ass bidets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We have like a little, like a shower head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a mini shower head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have to put between your legs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, some European countries
have that too, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- With the little bowl? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The thing that... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the little bowl next to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you do it in the toilet itself? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the toilet.
- Its like the little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bowl thing but without the bowl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay.
- And at that point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I've
always hated that feeling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause then you just get wet balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's too much,
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because the bidet is precise
with where it's aim is, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And when you've used your
own, bidet long enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know where to aim.
- The bidet's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sniping, you're asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah you know where to aim your cheek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know the radius
of which it'll spread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So you've got it down or not, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We talked about fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long have we been talking about it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Showering our assholes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've always wanted to
talk about it on the podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's one of the, no joke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most enjoyable parts of Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know what to call this episode, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Japanese toilet experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The shitting Japanese experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know where golden requiem
experience comes from now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's when you're
on the fucking toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Were you a bit like
worried when you first saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how to operate the bidet
when you first came to Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think a lot
of British people are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's like, the
thought of spraying your ass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is so foreign to us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah (indistinct)
- What was that thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you and Allen did again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time you went to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking hotel bidet?
- We were curious at how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the bidet knew when
you were sitting on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The bathroom was like a wet room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we were like, okay,
well it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if this bidet sprays everywhere? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we had like a few drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were like, let's figure
out how the bidet works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we figured out the bidet won't spray, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unless there's pressure on the seat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is pretty fucking cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, and then it was
like spraying on the wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause no one was sitting on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were just like pushing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, this thing was going far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was spraying on the wall, it was crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the pressure that goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up your asshole, man.
- And that's what I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> going on my ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the pressure that goes up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> your fucking asshole.
- I had a traumatic story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of 'cause... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In our house in Australia,
we always had a bidet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause my mom was like, "I
can't live without a bidet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because she's Japanese
and she shits like a King. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would she go back to
shitting like a peasant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's like, let me teach you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me teach you Australians
how to shit like a King. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we had it in our house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But of course when I was
little, I didn't use the bidet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I didn't know
what the fuck it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, oh, buttons, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I didn't fucking press any of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I remember first
time seeing a bidet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, yo, do I need a license </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to operate this shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A bidet license?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like, I feel like
if I pressed the wrong button </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this toilet's gonna take off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here is like the fucking
operating system of the bidet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can see on screen right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially like going
to Japan the first time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's somewhat in the
different language as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I was little, like I
never knew how to use the bidet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was just learned
to just make sure to wipe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and wash your hands and
then you'll be good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, when you get to
around age six or seven, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you start to get a little bit curious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what these buttons are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just like, I wonder what this is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I did the fatal mistake though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I pushed the bidet,
like start bidet button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I made the fatal mistake
of getting up off my seat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and looking down at the toilet bowl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no, it spray you in the face? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it fucking sprayed me in the eye </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing)
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And there's just water going everywhere, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, I don't
know how to stop this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck's happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually thought I broke my toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I called my mom and I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mom, come here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, she came in, fucking
bidet water going everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's just like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the last thing she said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like she finally stopped
it and she's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "You could have at least
flushed your shit, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I didn't have to see that."
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But also, the bidet water is also warm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So it's literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a warm shower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is like a warm shower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only, W's, only W's.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you know thing is right is that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're an American or your
just a Westerner in general </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you come and you see this toilet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, it can be daunting, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause, normally things
don't go near your ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're not used to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no.
- Just embrace it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's scary. (laughs)
- But once you admit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing feels good when
they spray your ass... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That could be so out of context. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like discovering a new fetish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, you now what- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just give it a go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does it feel a little
erotic after... (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it feels good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The wet ass afterwards
just doesn't feel good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dry it, just dry, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just dry it man.
- It's not that hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then it doesn't feel clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, my asshole
doesn't feel properly clean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless I soap that shit.
- There is no proper clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't feel properly
clean after a wipe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like 90% clean after a wipe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's always gonna be a little bit left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know that bidet is
scraping that shit off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just pressure washing it.
- It's like washing your hands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without soap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You might feel clean, but you don't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until you use that soap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I need to physically
feel my asshole being clean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and not like getting it washed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to feel that shit, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to confirm with my own hands. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well then, that's what you should do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You should use the bidet and
then wipe it with your hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and see if it's still there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because it doesn't
feel properly clean to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless I fucking shower. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like my asshole never
feels clean unless I shower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I have probably soap in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This man is like wasting
fucking buckets of water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to clean his ass, when he
can just be using a bidet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can never take too many showers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love the feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of taking a shower.
- I'm pretty sure you can take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too many showers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, (laughs)
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your skin has natural oil
that if you shower too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you get rid of it (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, for
me, I love the feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in summer when it's hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just taking like a nice- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's different.
- A nice cold shower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a little different though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a bit different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But even now in the winter
I take like three showers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I get a bit cold-
- Three showers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You take three showers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not like-
- No wonder you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking upload videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're always in the fucking shower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not like properly long showers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like sometimes I get a bit cold- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I said, my mind- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like either I'm too
stuffy or I'm too cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So sometimes I can't be bothered to wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for the fucking heater to go on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just pop in the shower, get
a bit of warm water on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, I'm back up to warm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This man spends more time in
the shower thinking of ideas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Than actually committing
to the ideas. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This man is not the clown,
he is the whole circus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what's also fucked
up as well about you Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hate to bully you this episode but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't use your bath at all, do you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You and Sydney don't take baths. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't either though.
- Sydney... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like taking a bath in like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels like I'm in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a prison cell bath, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I'm taking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, so Japanese baths are fucking tiny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're not that... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yours isn't that bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can, sit in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I can't stretch legs out in the bath, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's not even a bath to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't need to stretch them out fully? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a glorified sink in that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The point is you have to
take a bath like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You do the fucking-
- It's not that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The L thing.
- You do the fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> L position. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like-
- It's not that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I take like, I would say
90% baths, 10% showers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because in Japan, the
best thing is is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can like reserve your bath. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As it says.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is like, if you know
what time you're waking up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you can set the bath to be
full and hot by that time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Which, why the fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do we not have this in any- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the biggest brain move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would they have like NASA in the US </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they haven't figured out
how to fucking schedule a bath? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know what time I'm gonna wake up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know what time I need
to be in that bathtub. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Why can I not do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this basic fucking function? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right right.
- Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then also you have one button, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause in the UK, what you had to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is just turn the tap on
and keep checking on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every five minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In Japan there's one button that fills up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the perfect amount of
the amount that you set </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the exact temperature that you set. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the future man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why wouldn't I take a bath every day? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just feel like for me baths </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are not ergonomically designed for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I feel like I'm too
tall to properly appreciate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a good bath, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're not that much taller than Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're not that much tall than me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, 'cause I love onsens, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The reasons I love onsens
is I'm submerged in water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm in a comfortable position. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can never get in a comfortable position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in any of any of the baths
I've ever owned in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause here's the issue, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I wanna stretch my legs out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then my body is above the water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you gotta submerge yourself
and then you unsubmerge, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and then your body just gets cold, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Peak bath position is like
the water's up to like here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your arms out of the tub, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe watching something there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Maybe got a beer as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you wanted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause then your upper body is cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like-
- No way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the perfect temperature control </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because your head is free, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you've got this bit getting cold, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you got the rest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of your body boiling.
- Also because the bath water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is so hot, the steam from the hot water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes the room warm, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like you just haven't given baths </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the true shot they deserve Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I-
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Again, you're wasting
another potential of Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is how fucking good the bath are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, the bath's are way too small here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no.
- I don't wanna be sitting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're deep.
- If my legs are curled, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> then that's not a bath to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, you know we're doing- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're not fucking daddy
long legs in this (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not that much taller. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Next time I'm going to your house- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Baths are meant to be relaxing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I need to be in a comfortable position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be relaxed.
- I don't fucking believe you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why I love onsens
and I just don't take baths. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Showers to me are just more relaxing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't believe you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Next time I'm going to your house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm forcing you to get in the bath </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with your clothes on.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You just sit there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna judge this
position, that's bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't believe you.
- We have one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we have one in the
studio, go in this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, after this episode we'll- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That ones tiny as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That one's too-
- Okay, that one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is actually smaller than normal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we'll get Garnt in there
and we'll vote what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll post the screenshot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The other thing of like I have... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only times I've had
baths is in my home in England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know, the way, okay... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> When you're in a bath, do you
put your legs towards the top </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or do you put like your
back towards the tap? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Legs toward the tap always
- Legs toward the tap, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of course.
- What animal puts their back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> towards the tap? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the tap is
always like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always have like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if it's just me but sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I accidentally hit the tap, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's either too hot or too cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it just like ruins
the entire vibe for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You want the legs there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you don't wanna burn your back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - (chuckles) I've
actually done that before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> completely-
- You're a clown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're a clown.
- Fucking mighty brain move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also, I saw your bath
at your parents' house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't that nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on Garnt, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can do better than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Come on, come on, come on.
- Even if I'm in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a fucking nice hotel
I'm like, I don't take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a bath in this.
- Bro, there is nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better than a hotel that has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a big ass bath.
- Yeah I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That shit's amazing.
- That's the only time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm exclusively like, fuck showers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going in that bath. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Always, always, always. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, I like the feeling
of just having water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> spraying on you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, it's just like a nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zen feeling.
- Well, then go out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the rain. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly rain in Southeast
Asia is fucking great, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause when we think of
rain we think of like cold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking depressing British
rain, just fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like God blew up a
fucking raspberry on you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I hate that feeling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But in Thailand, when it
rains it fucking pours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right.
- And it's probably like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's warm as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like taking a warm shower </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Doesn't it feel like you're
just getting pissed on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, also it's so fucking humid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it was doing that in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In the summer, it was raining. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was deceiving 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> finally I'll be cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But no, it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more fucking heat directly
applied to my skin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I hated about
when I went to the Philippines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first time and it was like May. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it wasn't even like properly hot yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- But because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is Southeast Asia, it's
still fucking hot in may. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the moment I got outside,
my hair just fucking turned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into an afro because of
the amount of humidity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there was a pool
where we were staying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, oh, thank God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can finally jump in the
pool and I'll call myself off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> No, because it was so humid outside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like walking into
a fucking puddle of piss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I like heated
pools and I like regular pools, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the temperature of this pool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like halfway in between of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just like lukewarm
kinda what I was just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That makes makes you feel
like someone shit in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't make the water feel clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like perfect bacteria temperature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. (laughs)
- Makes you feel real gross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro that's why cold showers are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking amazing.
- No, they're good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why when I used
to swim in public pools, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the best ones are like the
ones that are initially cold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you get warm as you swim. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, yeah.
- Because that's like nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause then it also forces
you to keep swimming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you don't get to comfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the ones where you're just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you feel the water and
you're like, oh, that's cold, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm just gonna commit
and just fully jump in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and submerge my body all at once. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're fine after that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, (indistinct).
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, I can't believe
you're jus an animal Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can take the peasant out of Thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you can't take the peasant... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, Sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The Thailand out of a peasant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I messed that up.
- Nailed that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have the superior taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (scoffs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just-
- Mr. don't eat crust. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want to exist
happily, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all I wanna do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want you to exist correctly, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I want you to use the bidet when you can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I want you to take a bath every night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Treat yourself Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, treat yourself.
- You deserve it, come on man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're better than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want a wet fucking ass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't have to be, wipe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what the toilet
paper was invented for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then I don't want wet
fingers after a wipe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How fucking weird is your ass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you clawing your ass
out with your bare hands? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you-
- Meilyne, your hands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't get wet when you use a bidet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do they?
- That's disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right.
- Right? See. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is disgusting, that's why I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] You're not
using toilet paper, are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I am using toilet paper. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) Seriously,
he's just using his hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's using the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like, ah, fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's using the heat of
friction to warm his back up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to evaporate the water off his cheeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you doing Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's ass cheeks are just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna watch you shit after this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna see what you're doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to judge your technique. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're doing it all wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's fucking do it, I'm ready. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Shit review, let's go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can we get a GoPro
inside of the toilet bowl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and see what's going.
- Yeah, I want a bidet cam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to see.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to see what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to see what you're doing
in this fucking bowl, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Next special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The bidet special.
- The bidet special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Will Garnt be able to learn
how to use a bidet correctly? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Needless to say, I am
100% bringing back a bidet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if I have a house-
- I am bring back a kotatsu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm bringing back a heated
toilet seat and a kotatsu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, you don't need the table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can just get the heated
element and screw it on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a box that makes heat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's basically it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - A box... (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, 'cause you need the heated element, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need the table, and you need the cover </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on top of the table </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to place the blanket.
- Well, you can just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get another. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the good thing
about a kotatsu is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the summer you can still use it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because all you have to do
is just take the sheet off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it turns back
into a regular table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. True, true.
- So it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> specially made table, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kotatsu is a bomb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kotatsus are like the
best thing in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No (scoffs) best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One of the best things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bidet.
- Heated toilet seats are- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bidet, all my homies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> love bidets.
- Heated toilet seats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are a close second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm on team bidet in
this instance, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love my kotatsu but, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's nothing more disgusting
than a gross asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just saying right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How dirty is your... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even wanna imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe you guys are just shitting wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, we're not sitting wrong Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You are-
- What's the wrong way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of shitting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like shitting on the wall? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How is it wrong if I have a great time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I end up perfectly clean, I'm very happy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my ass isn't wet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm doing it the right way,
as far as I'm concerned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you're sitting wrong if you end up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a fucking swampy asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt's like, instructions
unclear, I dropped as a child. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are you doing on this toilet, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Sort your fucking life out, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm thinking of fucking
bomb-ass videos on the toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and in the shower as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Clearly you're not thinking
about personal hygiene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or staying dry.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am very happy with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my personal hygiene.
- Men I have a poppy asshole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I got a great video idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's exactly it, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's exactly it.
(claps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt's like literally stinky poo poo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, oh stinky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But Hey look at all these lovely Patreons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are helping to support the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> These Patreons of team bidet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A question to you
Patreons this time, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> See what I did there, little reference, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause Garnt loves to say that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the joke.
- Question to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We boys we'd love to do a
tour or something in the US. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, we gotta talk
about that, don't we? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have-
- Would you guys be interested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in us maybe doing "Trash
Taste" live across the US? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Would that be something that maybe- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a very brief idea, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We can't do it now because of
the state of the world but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But maybe in like a year or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe doing it like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whenever the US gets its
shit back together, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll definitely be open to that idea but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you guys open to that
idea is more of the question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I guess let us know.
- Yeah, we wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gauge interest if that's something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys wanna do.
- So definitely let us know. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> - Why wouldn't you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want you to see in H, no, 4K, sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me shouting at Garnt, about him being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a little uncultured
- About having a poopy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> butt hole. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - About being a little
stinky poopy poo poo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - About our shitting technique. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which I can't believe that we've... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think half the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are literally fucking
gone Prenen when you shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like Netero
with all my eight hands, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slapping my ass clean dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're so inferior, you
can't even fathom the level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I am on, man.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all I'm gonna say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank you for watching this

- Yeah, yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're eating this
with food, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should probably have a warning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the beginning now that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what you're getting into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what you're getting
into, it's Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We talk about anything.
- All right, see you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next week.

<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Bye. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (soft music) </SPEAKER_01>
