<SPEAKER_00> - I want the coffee so when that's ready, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> please give it to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold on to your knickers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I heard I can see your knickers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When he said it, it sounded
to me like he was singing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I say the word knickers
the same way as you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guys, stop! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You guys are really leaning into that N. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't put your knickers in a twist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I am your host for today, Little Baby Man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Stop doing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And together with me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are the other little baby men. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The little baby men. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you seen that image on Reddit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like the little baby men. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] All three of us? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I fucking love that image man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing)
- Of course you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Finally, I'm as tall as you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's actually gonna be as tall as us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw some guy make it
his phone wallpaper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, thanks guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, you guys
probably haven't seen any, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like you guys probably
haven't felt any break. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We felt a massive break--
- Six weeks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Six weeks since we last recorded, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> which to me has felt
like six months, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, it's one year
since I saw you guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing)
- I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah like so if you didn't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me and Connor went back to the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah.
- For like three, four weeks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we had two weeks of quarantine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So basically scheduling that out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it comes out to about six weeks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before we last recorded. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It has been like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> since we started Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't realize how much my schedule </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> relied on me going to Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just seeing the boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it was weird just not seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the both of you every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was so bored during September. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna lie,
while you guys were gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like every Tuesday I
was getting ready to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I don't have to." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honey I'm going to work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm going to work JK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, we have our coffees, yes! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, finally! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God, I love this.
- Thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, we went back to the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That was fun.
- Yeah, how was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was good.
- I mean, how long is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like two years, or almost, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since you guys went out?
- Yeah, two years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's been about two years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's been two years basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> since I've seen any of my mates there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or my parents or my family.
- Same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it emotional? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you guys hug it out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was weird seeing my parents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've only seen them through Zoom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for like two years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was just kinda like-
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was weird having
conversations with people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not through a discord
call or the Zoom call. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you realize, I've
forgotten what it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just actually catch up with someone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not through a computer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, "Damn, look at those graphics." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can touch them now.
- It's like no lag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I felt like, when I went back to Wales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I felt like the Pope
going around a small town. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "HI guys--
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "HI parents yes, come, give me a hug. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll give you, I'll take a
picture with your parents." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, now I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I also learned from my past mistakes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of when I used to go back home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually try to schedule </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as many hangouts with friends as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- I reached out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to as many people as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the last time I went home, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just kind of thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I'll figure it
out when I get there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I ended up not doing anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like half days and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Shit, I really should
have planned things." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did the same thing as you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I think I made another mistake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think I planned two months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, yeah, then that happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because then, I kind of realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about like five, six days in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not even like halfway through my trip, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing someone every day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you haven't caught up with
someone for two years, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what do they wanna do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like crack open some
beers or bottle of wine? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you end up just eating
and drinking like shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so you basically downloaded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the alcoholic DLC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing)
- Well, basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, so I was there for 20 days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and only one day I didn't drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every single day, I had at
least one beer or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just because that was like the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that you do in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think 70 to 80% of my schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for my days there were seeing someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or catching up with someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And that meant 70% to 80% of my trip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was like having some sort of drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that's how you socialize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you drink with your parents? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so your parents are
drinkers as well, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- My parents don't drink, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you drunk anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, but since we
haven't drunk in two years, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they brought open a bottle of wine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they had a glass, I was
just like, "Oh shit, okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is special.
- This is a special occasion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I've seen my
mum drunk before this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once in my life when I was
four at my cousin's wedding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you know, it was just
the weirdest fucking thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause my mom is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as far as my perception is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the biggest straight
edge there is, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Right, right.
- She doesn't drink, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she doesn't smoke, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't do anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had never ever seen her like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> In my life, I think I've seen
her take a sip of alcohol </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about like, I think five times in my life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> total, total. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I remember going
to my cousin's wedding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and my entire family were there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone had like flown in from Thailand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was a rare occurrence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that we have a massive
family gathered in one place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd seen a different side of my mom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that there was just this
monster laying within. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it felt almost like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she got more drunk than Sydney on the day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, she got drunk faster than Sydney. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that gives you an indication
of how surprised I was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember like halfway
through the wedding, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I come sit down, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and my mom and dad are
just sitting on this table. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My mum has a glass of wine in front of us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know how much she had drunk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at this point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was like, "Gig." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, my Thai name is Gig. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like, "Gig, do you wanna see me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down this glass of wine?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like,
(Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, no, no mum, I don't wanna see you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down that glass of wine, mum, no." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like, "I'll do it, I'll do it" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Mom! No, no, don't do it!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And she just-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Mom, what are you 15? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you 18?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Meanwhile, there's
like six bottles of wine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> below her feet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And Sydney was on the dance floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was like 10:00, 11:00 PM, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney was on the dance floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney was pretty not sober,
but she was like merry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> She wasn't completely drunk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then my mum just comes up to her, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> takes the bottle of beer
that she's drinking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just downs it in front of her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and takes it and gives it back to her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never seen Sydney so
dumbfounded in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah so, yeah, I ended
up drinking with my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a bit more which was a
very rare occurrence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course, of course I'm gonna
share some alcohol with them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but about like the fifth day
in and your body's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Please, please no more, like please." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like the social aspect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but my God, my body just died </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like halfway through the trip I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a thing where,
especially with my family, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they drink quite often. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I feel like they saw it as an excuse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to drink more than usual. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So then it became a
thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is great, but I'm dying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> My dad's retired as well now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So now, he loves it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought my dad would
get bored being retired. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He seems like, I thought
he was one of those guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that really needed like a
job to keep him occupied, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but yeah, and he fucking loves it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> He just gardens all day and he loves it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It like he's like--
- That's the life, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he's living his life.
- That is the life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He like bought a canoe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like--
- Oh shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Buying a canoe?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Buys a canoe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where do you even store a canoe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you even keep that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the logistics behind owning a canoe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seem way too difficult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, throw it in your backyard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, he seems
like he's loving it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah, so it was nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least he's picked hobbies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that are gonna keep him active. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's other things he
could have invested in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - True. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He occasionally does do work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he does like, helps a friend
with houses building stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah for me, that's all I saw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's just like--
- He's chilling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's chilling.
- That's just retiring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I've been doing.
- That's just peak retirement </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's where I wanna be
when I retire, just vibing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I went back and forth
between Wales and London, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I got to see as many friends as possible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and drank way too much alcohol. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We did, we did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like 'cause we
posted a few pictures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while we're on break in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember we were catching up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with a bunch of our friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I actually hardly
ever talked to Connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in our trip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, we obviously
like talked and caught up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything but we mostly
spend time just catching up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with other people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't feel the need
to talk to you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we see each other every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking talk to you way too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that we had a
mutual understanding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I couldn't escape you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've talked every week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like the past fucking over a year now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can have a little bit time apart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the only times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we did do something together was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we played like
a game of chess, IRL. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, I was drunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were both drunk.
- We were both drunk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course you beat me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The only time when there was-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fortunately there was no cameras. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No cameras. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No one watching it.
- The next chess tournament </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> should have a blood-alcohol
level measured before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and you need to be X
amount required to play. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what we need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just qualify if it's below 0.7. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're a little too sober for my liking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not in, you're out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Got so many brain cells
for this tournament. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time you lose a piece, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you got to do a shot or
something I don't know, just die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what chess needs,
the next evolution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Drunk chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're going from casual chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to absolute euphoric drinkable chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I also like playing chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember playing chess against you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we had a physical board, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> none of this online chess business. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We went old school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we even had like a chess clock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think I've realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how much I've relied on the chess.com UI </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to really like-
- Oh, it's very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Be good at the game 'cause-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because otherwise you
have to look down like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I was pretty
intoxicated at that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember I fell for
the most obvious checkmates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, I was great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was trying to question
how I couldn't see that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we bet 20 pounds on the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why we bet
20 pounds on the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I was drunk at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever I'm like
playing games with friends, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, 10 bucks, one buck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's make it interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's do it let's have fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fair, fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah how was your perception
of England going back? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wrote notes, I wrote notes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You wrote notes?
- You wrote notes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh this is why you--
- Chris told me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to write notes and my phone is on 1%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You better read them all.
- So what I'm gonna do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna read through them all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then we can talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Very, very dirty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> London is really loud, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize how noisy it was before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like the same amount of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are walking around Tokyo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in London it's less orderly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lots more homeless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People making gestures or
saying something to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever you do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This guy just started
talking to me in the lift, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was really confused. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just forgot that
that was like a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> We started just talking and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had literally just
checked into my hotel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I just got off the flight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like-
- what did he say to you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was just like, he
was talking about like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you say hi? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was like, "How you doing?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Me?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so funny to say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I literally got
recommended a video yesterday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of this satire news
report, that's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Northerner terrorizes Londoners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by saying hello." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Literally what happened.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People would... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, when they bump into
you, right in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- And I've totally forgotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this was the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the longest cable on earth, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When people bump into you
in Japan, they say sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Someone bumped into me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and those dickheads didn't say sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They didn't say anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could not, every
time that happened to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I could not stop saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor and Joy laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just like muscle memory. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if I hadn't bumped into someone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like on the tune. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like (speaking
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I'm not in Japan anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to stop doing
this 'cause no one else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is saying this shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just couldn't stop saying
it or like subconsciously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I heard one thing that happens in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now I don't expect this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so I just noticed that it was different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When you get a taxI in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the taxI driver will always try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and help you with your bags,
even if you don't need it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It could be the smallest bag on earth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he might try and come out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and help you with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that never happened with
taxis in the UK I noticed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time I had a suitcase or anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they would just sit in the car </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'd have to open
the boot too as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which is fine, totally fine with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I just felt, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah, this is the
thing that we don't do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was most of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that was the most it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll tell you the biggest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the immediate thing that I noticed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> about going back to the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I immediately missed about Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I think it was the second
day that we landed there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and also my second day in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we went out to just
walk around Brighton again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> walk around town, because
it's been quite a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since I've been in my hometown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, me and Sydney just went
out, did a quick shopping trip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I got thirsty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My throat was a little bit parched, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I started searching for a drink-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can see where we are going with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - In order to quench my thirst, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I look around and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Where are the vending machines?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> How am I supposed to procure some liquids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that I may quench my thirst?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I walk around in this shopping center </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I soon realized, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have to go to a shop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in order to purchase some liquids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even a community
shop, like a supermarket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like a corner shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "What
backward system is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to go into a shop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that sells other things other than drinks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I need to do human interaction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in order to purchase this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We really do take for granted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how many fucking vending machines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are on this country.
- I didn't realize that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because sometimes, I'm
just walking around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I get a little thirsty, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like literally a minute away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the next vending machine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't realize how convenient that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until I went to the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's in a big shopping center, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of this is just like cloves, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or different kinds of stores, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are not like food drink items. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And even if it is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> most of them are something like super drug </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or some very big pharmacy store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they sell the drinks there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's way bigger than it needs to be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I ended up like having to go in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go into this massive store, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go to like the small segments, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just for food and drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then line up.
- And then line up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like--
- Disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine lining up for things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Not on my watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine lining up for a bottle of water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Jesus! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's like the
first thing I noticed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really missed the vending machines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just being able to
buy very conveniently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> buy like a snack or something . </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt that way as well,
whenever I got back to Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or like the U.S or anything as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because we have vending machines, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in Australia and the U.S </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you don't have like a Suica. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like I said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you have to reach in,
grab your fucking change, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jiggle that around and then--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they got you five fucking
vending machines in the West, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes the drink
doesn't even fucking pull back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm like, "Oh, good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm about to gamble $3 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to see if I can even get this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes you gotta double-pull as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That just happens sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're really lucky for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, you buy a drink and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm gonna buy another drink immediately." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then, the machine is designed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in such a way that it just can't handle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two drinks being dispensed at once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you have to like fucking
scrunch your hand inside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and pull one out, just so you can unblock </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this fucking thing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But, I noticed as well, obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I got at the airport and it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No one was wearing masks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Yep, yep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one was wearing masks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't have fucking opinion on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do whatever I'm told to do, I'm a sheep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, what can I say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wake up sheep! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's taking a stance in the self club. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really don't give
a shit, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If everyone around me is wearing a mask, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll wear a mask, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was one of those things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, whoa, this is fucking weird." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause in Japan, you'll be crucified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't wear a mask. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could be in the
middle of a rice field </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'll still somehow find a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to crucify you.
- [Garnt] Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was just like so strange, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just seeing everything
kind of back to normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like the UK just took the route of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we don't give a shit anymore open back up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But the rules are different as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between England and Wales. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And because I was traveling between them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on Wales trains, you have to wear a mask, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on English trains, you
don't have to wear a mask. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But some trains go from Wales to England. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So what happens is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that when you get into England, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people just took off
their masks on the train. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which does nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which then eliminates
the whole point of... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Not that I think one of
either is wrong or right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It invalidates with both </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have to put it on off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're on the same God damn train. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like you being on a flight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, well we're now in Russian airspace. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - COVID is like, "Okay
guys, I'ma head back now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sir, I can't survive
in this jurisdiction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to get back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, it's like, "Okay,
that's kind of weird." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was wearing a mask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I thought this was
early, like in America, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but someone came up to me and was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Take off your mask." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, someone came up to me and was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Take off your mask." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "I don't think I will." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he was like, "Why?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where were you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was in Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He was saying-
- Where you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to wear a mask, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Still in Wales?
- No, no, no, you don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you just did anyway? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Obviously everybody was wearing a mask. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I looked like shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to cover my
face, I felt dreadful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But he came to me and was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Take off your mask." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "No." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he was like, "Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why are you wearing a mask?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, I just ignored him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I carried on with my phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like-
- On the train? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Outside the train station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was just like,
"Take off your mask." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "No."
- Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I said no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Some people get weirdly offended by it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Sorry,
I'm protecting myself." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - At one time I was wearing it as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the guy asked me, he was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Are you wearing that for me or for you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "For me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think both, technically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the thing was
that even though, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we had a flight to get on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was coming up to that flight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "I'm wearing a mask." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I do not wanna be having
to rearrange all my plans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and delay transportation."
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that's why I was wearing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I was like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> why are so many people coming up to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and tell me to take off my mask?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you're taking a stance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think going back to with him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I had very similar experiences </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where every time I'd meet
some group of friends, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they'd question me of why
I chose to wear a mask. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why I chose to put on this mask. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing)
(group chattering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They didn't listen to me
until I put on the mask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I get questioned about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, "I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to fly back to
Japan in like two weeks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm pretty used to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just don't wanna take any risks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just my opinion, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do you have to be accused
for protecting yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not saying- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like being like, "Why
are you wearing the condom? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Take it off." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not like I'm
going around and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Put your mask on, put your mask on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't need it... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If the government tells you
you don't need to wear it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a shit, don't wear it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna wear it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if the government also
says, "Don't wear a mask." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like they're gonna
fucking take your mask away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just feel like what I've
realized going back home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at least in England, it
became very political. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like as, you know,
as everything does, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like we got
sheltered from that in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because everyone here wears their masks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone here wore a mask before COVID </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why it was like super easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just integrate that into society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas like people just don't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being told what to do in England </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and America as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was something where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just doing this one thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like wearing a mask, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the environment you
are making a statement </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or a stance or a choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was conscious, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just never really thought
about it that deeply. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get that, but it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why that is subject </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to ridicule or criticism, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like your doing something bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by protecting yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd get it if it was
the other way around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, this was
the way I looked at it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was not even a political stance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just like, I just wanna wear it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I wanna wear it, fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I was wearing a hat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you tell me I can't wear a hat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Take it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you hiding? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm bald head, bro, leave me alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like me before going to England, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd never really thought
about it that deeply. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I've thought about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the difference between chicken
breasts and chicken thighs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more deeply than wearing a mask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should have just turned
around to the guy and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "It ain't that deep bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just wearing a mask, get off my back." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just like, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Leave me alone." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck are we gonna do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rip the mask off of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just like, Oh, my
God, I couldn't believe that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, "Fuck off!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus!
- One positive thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I think changed about England though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since I've been back is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever since the pandemic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of big establishments now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have made it possible for you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just order your food via QR codes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, that was-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Great! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're getting to the
Japanese way of things now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> less human interaction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Brilliant, I love it.
- Although, I was at Nando's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to pause that
just for dramatic value. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was at Nando's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was trying to order my meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was in a kind of a rush as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I didn't have much time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I thought it'll be easier on the app. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It turns out this specific
Nando's restaurant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just didn't have good cell phone service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they didn't have free Wi-Fi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like fighting for my life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to order this fucking thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And every single time
I got to one webpage, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just could not get to the next one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like, I had to keep resetting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spent about 20 minutes
trying to order this meal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I only had 10 minutes to eat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then eventually went up to the counter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, "Give me this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they got my fucking order wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He just couldn't get a dog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Oh my God, man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fighting out here
just to get some Nando's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was terrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it didn't taste good either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The specific Nando's did not taste good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like,
- What did you order? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I ordered a butterfly chicken burger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You mean the chicken breast burger? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, chicken breast.
- Don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Just don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had great Nando's when I was there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking miss that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The chips were kind of shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The coleslaw was not as
good as I remembered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if my tastes are-
- Maybe Nando's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't just as good as you remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or maybe that Nando's specifically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to try more Nando's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I had KFC and that was fantastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I had UK KFC was so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - UK KFC is good.
- I miss that so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll tell you the second
biggest thing I noticed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was, I really, really miss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese food service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So many times I'd go to restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like half the tables
still had the shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the previous customers on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that isn't a thing in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that shit's gone immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They won't even let you in the restaurant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, sometimes
they'll take the plate away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while you're still at the table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I think, after being there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like two weeks or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you you've had like all the food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you missed from being in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then after that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go back to your usual eating routine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just like, "Man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You forget how good Japanese food is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Japanese restaurants in general, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because, you order anything here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if it's off E-breeze </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or you go to random restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is really good food standards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'd just forgotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how many British establishments, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were just really, really mediocre. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And after the novelty wears out of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes, I'm having all of these things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've missed being out of the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after that wears off, you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Damn, Japanese food is just better." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just so, so much better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, I've really felt that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in my last week in the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just missed having good food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the daily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you have any Japanese food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> while you were around? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, I didn't have any Japanese food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some of my friends wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I looked at them like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, we're not having Japanese food." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the first time I went to LA </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they took me to Little Tokyo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Fucking kidding me?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I came from big Tokyo motherfucker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like that episode of Simpsons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they go to Japan and
they go to America town, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like, "No, no, come on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, cause like what
I didn't understand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I just realized this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the UK is also an island
nation like Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but Japan has really
spoiled me with good seafood </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and fresh seafood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can find everywhere basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just like getting
good seafood in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is so fucking difficult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know why it is,
'cause we're an island nation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that is smaller than Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Our coastlines should be easier to get to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is it so hard?
- Less distance to travel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is it so hard to find good seafood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that is not just fish and chips? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did have a good lobster, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You did?
- Yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But how much did you pay for it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't wanna know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's probably like, if you
want good seafood in UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you probably have to pay
arduous amount of money for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You do, you do.
- It was like a seafood pasta. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was really craving lobster. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I was like, we don't
really get lobster in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I really wanted like a creamy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do we get lobster in the UK? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you can pay for it.
- It's quite expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Feel like most frozen canned stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was probably the most I'd spent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on a single dish in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was something ridiculous,
like $30, $40 or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But man, was the lobster was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was so worth it.
- Worth? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, everyone said while
having something like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like treating yourself to
something kind of that expensive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah , yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Definitely something
I felt so guilty for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was looking at the bill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I literally had a pasta." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like filing a mortgage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Holy shit!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did something similar in Hawaii. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a $55 pasta. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Once in a while, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta treat yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But again, it was another seafood pasta. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what is best seafood pasta. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was like the entire
cost of a little mermaid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on this fucking pasta. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was so much seafood on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, now I can see why $55." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll never do that again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know how Australia is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I noticed that the
fancy restaurants in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are cheaper than the fancy
restaurants in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - By far.
- By a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause in Japan, you
can go to a restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can buy a bottle of wine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And even though it's
obviously more expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than it would be buying it wholesale, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's still not that bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If we went out together, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we could split a bottle of wine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it comes to like 20 bucks each, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I noticed wine in
the UK was way cheaper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why-
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Someplace I went to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the lowest price
bottles are like $150, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "I want wine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What kinda bougie
ass place do you go to? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not even like that bougie places. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the wine was bougie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, I don't
know, maybe I should. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck me for trying to eat good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember going
to Tesco's and Co-op </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to buy some wine and I
recognize some of the wine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that was available there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> There were like premium
wines here in Japan though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that is like 20 bucks plus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can get a five or a
seven quid in like Tesco's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I think that's just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan isn't really a wine drinker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's exactly it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And for the most part, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when I noticed wines that were available, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can get wines for
like a much cheaper price </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause if you're drinking wine in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're eating good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're drinking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This was the hard part, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to have the good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the wine that was way cheaper and nice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also wanted to drink all the beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I had to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was very hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having to decide.
- You can't do both. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't mix and match, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> otherwise you'll end up in a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna be in a coma the next day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I had a drink the next day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had to make sure that
I was in peak condition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at all times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was the biggest
thing that I forgot about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was tactically
choosing how much you drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so you can survive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and drink the next day as well. (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We sound like such alcoholics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I miss having like nice... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You can get IPA's and
stuff like that in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love like the craft beer in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really nice.
- I miss having good ciders </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ciders was like the biggest thing there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lagers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lagers, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just missed that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I drunk a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had Tesco meal deal as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Was it good?
- It was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "All of
this for three pounds?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get out of here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He says after having his lobster pasta, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he goes straight to Tesco. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, I bought that lobster pasta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like $30, $40, I don't
remember how much it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it still didn't make me as happy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as that three pounds meal deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It honestly, a part of it tasted better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, 'Oh my God, I
get an innocent smoothie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a three pounds smoothie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this three pound meal deal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're practically giving it away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was happy going back to Nando's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like the biggest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm home now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am now home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I ate at Subway as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, Subway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've forgotten how good
Subway was outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because Subway in Japan,
if you guys don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't toast the sandwich, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't pick your bread.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like two choices
of bread, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck is the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you can't pick your bread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and choose to toast it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was so shocked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you couldn't toast
your sandwich in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like the best part of any sandwich, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even like Subway that much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's literally the
drawing point of Subway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We can like Uber eat Subway here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And sometimes when these
two don't wanna choose, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they order a Subway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If I'm not having my subway
toasted, it is not a Subway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had a lot of fast
food, a lot of fast food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm surprised I'm not
obese by the time I came back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with the amount I drank and ate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every time I saw you in the holiday, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you had a bag of crisps in hand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I went to town on Christmas.
- I think you were more crisp </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than manner at a point.
- I was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was like one day
where we were hanging out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and there was just no food in this Airbnb, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but there was like family packs of crisps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I ate like 20 packs of crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think your dinner
that day was like a hotdog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like five packs of Doritos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't five, it was like eight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Eating like a true gamer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally went full gamer
mode and ate only chips, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> crisps, I should say, before
British people kill me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I almost said chips as well,
which is why like I paused. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm used to saying it for the Americans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The chips. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Americans watching. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, no, it was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had a great time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got to see all the
friends I wanted to see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of things really worked out nicely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was asking people
like last minute to hang out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and luckily everyone was able to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I had enough rest
days, well, towards the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because, my God, my body was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to not touch alcohol
for like a month after this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is great, 'cause we've
had quarantined since then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tell us about the hotel experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I wanna know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> This experience doesn't
start from the hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It starts from the point
where we get off the plane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It starts before that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It starts before we've
left the fucking country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's already like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, me and Connor had two
very different experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leaving the country and
getting back in the country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I mean, how should we do this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How should we split this up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to go section
by section (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So first of all, the most annoying part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is to get even on the plane, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need a negative COVID test form. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, I am making a video
about my quarantine hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things in-depth, stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're interested by the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'll give you the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna talk more about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I didn't wanna bog down that video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We are just complaining for nine hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we are gonna complain
on Trash Taste right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this whole thing is confusing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So normally, if you want a negative test, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most test providers would give you a form, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say, "Hey, you're negative. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Take this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then everyone will
accept it, normally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Problem is, Japan doesn't work like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan just decided, we've gotta do things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We doing it our way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally our way or the highway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "how about
we just give you a form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you need to fill
out the very specific way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we want it filled out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And this just sends fear
down, anyone who knows Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you know they're not playing games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have heard that some
airlines will let you on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the negative test, and
you don't need that one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but why would you risk it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I was shitting
myself, 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "How the fuck do I fill out this form?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this form needs to be
signed and stamped by a doctor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It can't be a nurse,
it has to be a doctor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The test can be administered by a nurse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it has to be signed
and stamped by a doctor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So, the most testing
facilities don't have a doctor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's gonna stamp or sign it for you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So then now, you have to find a place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that has a doctor that will stamp it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Turns out like none of these test centers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have doctors that are willing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to sign or stamp things for you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I managed to find, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I found after I basically... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to the UK government
website and got the email </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of every single test
provider they recognize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sent out a mass email to all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was a big mistake, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because then what ended up happening was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was one thread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were all replying to each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a blank carbon copies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they weren't replying each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But for me it was one thread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I sent this email off
and within about 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I realized the mistake that I'd made, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I had 15 replies in one thread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I couldn't keep track. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, you basically opened a forum post? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I basically opened a forum
post directly to the person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, I got like 50
responses in the first day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that all be like, "This is okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then some of them were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yes, this is totally fine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But they didn't say yes to everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I had to then call
up places that said yes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I walked them through it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Are
you sure this is okay?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And one of them was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, that's no problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We've done it all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We've had people go to Japan all the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> from our facility." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Great, okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I booked on with them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 150 pounds, it's like $200, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, I know Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that I should have
a backup, just in case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I don't fucking trust... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you have to get it 72 hours before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if I this up, I'm panicking
to try and find something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So I booked two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I booked another test,
but this place said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Book a test with us, and then
when you get your results, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three hours later, take those results </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and book a doctor appointment
and then get the doctor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to sign and stamp it all." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I did that too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I had that first. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I went to this testing
facility at 8:00 AM, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they shoved a thing up my nose, I'm dying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I get my results at
11:00 AM, and it's negative. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Great, great." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So then I go to the doctor, and perfect! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They sign it all, they stamp it all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was all super easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I had to pay individually
for both of those things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like 150 pounds for the test again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or, no, 90 for that one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then 90 for the doctor's appointment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this is already like 400,
500 bucks, just on the test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not counting the amount
you have to pay for the test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to get in the country as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you have to pay for like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of things people don't
consider is, I spend a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We both spent a lot on
just tests, basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, we did so many tests. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you got to obviously get tested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> before you fly out of Japan to the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like 150 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which was another 150 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you have to pay for another test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you land in the UK as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is also about 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lots of tests, so many god damn tests. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you're thinking traveling is just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you just have to consider
the cost of the airline, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not a thing anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which also they've increased
the prices on the flights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that they know people are flying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, like the direct flight
from Japan to London, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was very expensive compared
to what it normally would be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, you also booked very late. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did book very late. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But even then, it was still
more expensive normally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I got this paper and I was like, great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have this Japanese document
signed the way I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I sent a message to Raina Sculley, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who'd also done traveling abroad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, I sent her a
picture of the signed document. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Does this look okay?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she's like, "Yeah, it looks great." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Okay, good." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I had the next
appointment the next day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the people who were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, dude, it's all okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'll get it signed there and all that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But to me it did make sense a little bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was like, "How are
you gonna sign all this stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while I have to wait three
hours for the results?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I turn up to this test the next day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'd already paid for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, "Fuck it,
I'll just get another test, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why not?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I go there, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, so you need to fill out this form." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "No." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "No, we
don't fill out that form." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I called you up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you said that you
could fill out this form." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're like, "No, no,
no, no, no, we don't do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We will give you a phone." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Yeah, but that's
not good enough for Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I told you this on the phone call </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you said it was no problem." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, "No,
we're not doing that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you not read the forum? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you not read the thread? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so then, a woman
came out of the office </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she was like, "Oh
no, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're going to Japan?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "Oh yeah, come
with me, come with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got you, I got you." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I go there and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, so can you fill this out?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "No, no,
I'm not gonna fill out.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why aren't you gonna fill out?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, because the form I'm gonna give you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna be enough anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's gonna have your
passport information on it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "All right." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I already knowing that
I had the signed document, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put me at ease. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I probably would have
been very uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I was in that situation
and didn't have a backup. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm glad I didn't,
because I got my test results </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after filling out this form and doing... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were like, "We
promise, it'll be fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We promise this form will be enough." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I'm like, "Okay, fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right, fine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I get my results back later, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's got even less information on it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and no stamp, no doctor's signature. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Then like the other test result I got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to take to the doctor, which
wasn't even the real one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they've given me
this piece of shit form, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I went to the website, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I should have done this before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the reviews were
terrible for this clinic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I found out it was a clinic, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was like a weird
modern medicine-esque clinic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was a legitimate COVID testing... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They were allowed to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But not for official
documents, I'm guessing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so then I was like, "All right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm gonna see." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause now I have two forms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I go to the airport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I'm gonna give
them the shit one first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and see if they accept it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They probably thought I was
weird for doing this as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I give them the form, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they looked really confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They looked really uncomfortable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they brought like some staff over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I knew they were
about to tell me like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You can't get on the flight with this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And before they said anything to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, 'By the way, I have
another form just in case." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And they looked at me like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Like I have like another test
with the form filled out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And they looked at me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I was doing something really bizarre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I imagined it would be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, "Why
didn't you just give us?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I paid 150 bucks for this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to make sure
that it was bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This man limit-testing
the system right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (group chattering)
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanted to see if I'd been ripped off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I realized now I played
paper please the other day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I feel like, oh, this is
what I did in paper place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some people just wouldn't give
that passport or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Testing for bugs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They didn't tell me they
weren't gonna accept it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they were like bringing
managers over and stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> after I handed them this form. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Let's not worry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's not kick me out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's the real one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's the real one." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I talked
to like a few people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who had traveled to their
home country and back to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I even flew, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's how I knew
about this quarantine hotel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we were going to have to stay in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we'll get to that, but
every one of them told me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "You need to get this form, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this form that the Japanese
government gIve you, signed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doesn't matter what any clinic says, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't matter what they promise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't have this form, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not gonna guaranteed
to get back here." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so you have to look
for a specific clinic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that can fill out this
exact form with a doctor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a lot harder to find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than you originally think it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a big difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between getting a positive COVID test, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is all you need to get out of Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but getting back into Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to have this exact form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in order to get back in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And luckily, Connor went
a few days before me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so I had like my own clinic booked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And hearing about his second experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "Yeah, I'm just
gonna go for the proven way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, let Connor be my beta tester." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just like, it was so stressful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just trying to get a
goddamn piece of paper signed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like impossible, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but luckily, I managed to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how it would be in the US, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just know that getting
doctor appointments in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is quite difficult unless
you're spending money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a lot of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, and again, it's kind of
come under a lot of criticism, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rightfully so, 'cause traveling, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> even though it's a luxury in general, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they've made it ridiculously
expensive to travel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably spent like 600, 500
bucks on COVID tests alone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I'm lucky enough to
be able to afford that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's pretty fucked
that it's that much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's annoying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So then yeah, got on the plane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it almost felt too easy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I got through check-in
and it was super easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Was it easy for you as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was very easy-
- Show them the paper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like, "Yeah, have fun." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Once you show the paper,
which was the same for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like going out of the country,
once you show the paper </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything's accepted, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then it's the most stress-less experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've had in an airport,
because it's fucking empty, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause no one's traveling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you're like, no queue
for security or anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just walked straight in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just a breeze. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like after everything got accepted, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never had a more pleasant
experience in an airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I never thought we'd
get a good experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in an airport, until now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was really chill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a great time at the airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was charging my devices. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In my terminal, I think I
counted, there was like 20 people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the whole waiting area. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For like the whole thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you had your whole section to yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but then it came to
coming back into the Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and we always obviously
talked about the documents. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was just the start of the process. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you get off the plane, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and obviously you have to
present the same documents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they put you in this
queue of just checkpoints. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It was like eight checkpoints, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's before immigration. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you do eight checkpoints
before you can even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> get to what is normally the annoying part. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you kind of like, you go in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they present you these documents, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they give you a tag, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have to put over
your hand to identify you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a fucking slaughterhouse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is exactly it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So you're literally like being
cattle, being herded through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's how they know you're
going to the quarantine hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They put this large thing
on your hand like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] They literally tag you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I took it off for a second
and someone shouted at me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I wanted to get my
coat off and I took it off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were like, two men came over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shouting and panicking at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pointing at it to put it back on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "What the fuck man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Give me a fucking second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, they give you about
17 million documents, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that they will check
across like this journey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you take. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the thing is like,
you present this document, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they check it, great, go
to the next checkpoint. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Then also the same
document, and they check it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you go to the next point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And for some reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these few documents that you have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get checked a total about like five times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by different checkpoints,
even though nothing changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> between you walking
from point A to point B. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's like eight stops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the first stop is they... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this is also a thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one told me this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to keep your boarding card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Normally on airplanes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck it, the moment I'm on the plane, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just put the boarding card in my pocket, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> scrupled up or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you don't it need
any more, you're on the plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah you do, the luggage tags. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you do with the luggage tags? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause that's normally on your card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They normally put that on
your passport or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the luggage tags... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know my bag, I've never had to use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always hold onto them
until I'm out at the airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, the luggage tags, I keep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But normally the boarding card, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just scruple it
in my pocket or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one told me you needed it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you never need it at an airport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just hold onto it just in case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just in case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't throw it away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not like on the plane,
fucking tearing it up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't think about it much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kind of just like whatever,
but yeah, you needed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So when you get off the plane, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they ask for like your passport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your boarding pass and the documents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, I printed off all the documents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that the Japanese
government told me to have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Turns out that some of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just give you on the plane anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I didn't need to print them out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I didn't even end up using my version. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I used the ones that
they printed out for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was like smaller, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the one I printed out
was A4 and it was like a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, you have these two documents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of them is a declaration
saying that you're a good boy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you won't leave your house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you won't break quarantine rules. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you do, they'll deport you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not ominous at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And if you're a Japanese national, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think they will do criminal
charges or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how much
they're enforcing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And another one was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to circle the countries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've been in the past 14 days, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just sign your name and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they always check this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they put a lot of your
information on the sheet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't realize what sheet
was gonna be important. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I didn't either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, yeah, the first check
is they check those documents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and the next one is the wellness check, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they take your temperature
and then you have to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a COVID test immediately at the airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a PCR test, not
like antigen tests as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So the difference between a PCR test is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to take your spit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas with an antigen test, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you can-
- Shove the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in your nose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They shove the thing in your nose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like an instant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost an instant response
for the antigen test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With the PCR, takes like an hour or two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need a centrifuge for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Director] It's the other way around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The PCR test is the one up your nose, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the antigen test is the one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think you can, I mean, I took both. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Director] PCR test is the
one that takes the most... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - All I know is that they
put it in a centrifuge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the hard part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's why they can do it fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you get asked, "Oh, you feeling okay?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They check your temperature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Again, I don't know what happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you have a high temperature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I assume they just like put you down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they just like shoot you
on the spot, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Grab the pillow and, silencer Pa! Pa! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I imagine something like
Oompa-Loompas come out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just take you away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, you get melted into the chair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's so fucking scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You are literally treated like cattle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anytime I asked anyone questions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I got looked at like a fucking weirdo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is this cow taking? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Before we go on to, and
I'll explain more of the flow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, okay, I'll do it after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you go to the wellness check </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you have to do
a COVID test immediately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Problem is, I was really dehydrated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I needed to start spitting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I couldn't spit anything,
I was just spitting air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And on the wall, they had
pictures of plums and lemons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to help you get some saliva.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "This is not helping!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why did they not just
give you a plum or a lemon? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you're not meant to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> eat or drink anything before you do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because that will dilute the result. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone takes your test, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they will look at you
like you're the devil. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing is, you're in a room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just full of
a bunch of people spitting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they're spitting in this container, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not really like the nicest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to watch people spitting into this glass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or in this container. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And Sydney had like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney, after being on this
flight for like 12 hours, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> felt a bit queasy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could just hear her in
the container next to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because she was feeling queasy
before she had to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And her seeing people spitting
around, she was just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I felt so bad, it smelt so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because yeah, you do feel a bit
sick seeing a stranger spit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's fucking weird,
it's really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds so post-apocalyptic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You do the spitting thing,
you give it to someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they check the documents that you have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the right COVID barcode on your thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you go to a place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they make you give your email </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they send you an email </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then make sure you got it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's okay, that's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they make you install these apps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had pre-installed them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then I had a problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This app was so fucking junk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I selected my birth date as July, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it would randomly just go back to June. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That happened to me too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did it happen to you as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And I had to re-install </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the whole app, and the internet was shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it wasn't installing for some reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And they came over and they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, here's a pocket Wi-Fi." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "No, I've got 4G, it's fine." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know this app is just dog shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It didn't install. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's this really fucking weird thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's watching you fill
out this app as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "It's all right, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You can go and get help someone else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm all right, I can do this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Apparently the first time,
but I can fill it out." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they make make sure that
your Google Maps thing is on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Yeah, it's on already. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's always on." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were like, "Can we check?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "All right, sure." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I showed them and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, good, good, nice, nice, nice." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Oh yeah." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then once I got that installed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to the waiting area to
get your COVID test results. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which takes a couple of hours, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mine took 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How long did yours take? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Waiting, mine took about an hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Mine took about 30 minutes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you get put into
the bus waiting area, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was a long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I waited like an hour-
- To be shipped off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the butchers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird, 'cause they've laid you out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you're sitting on a bus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Did they do that for you as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- There like in a corner, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're all sitting
like you are on a bus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a dress rehearsal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like what they do on school trips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's exactly it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you have this teacher,
who leads you onto the buses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have to sit in the
exact same way you sat down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then, you know, once
you've got all that then... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so this whole process
is just part of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you can go through immigration, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which takes a while again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But luckily, 'cause there's
no people traveling, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a little quicker. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, it does just takes time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so, if you fly back into Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the moment, regardless of how quickly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or how many people are flying in with you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna be in the airport for around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three to four hours-
- I was there for five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before you can get to immigration, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before you can even get your bags. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was there wondering, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Am I even gonna get my bags today? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's happening with that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically, after your 12 hour journey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is what we had,
12, 13 hours on a plane, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to withdraw the four hours, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in an airport being herded, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through this system, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which kind of felt like
this dystopian society </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you were just treated like cattle, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a piece of meat being herded through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You are there to be processed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird man, 'cause
I don't know what happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if you just don't follow along. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just really weird and very strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You are treated almost like a disease </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rather than a person, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a shit about, it's whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, waiting for my bags took so long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause obviously when you
get your bags at the airport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can just go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Because we're all on the same bus, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all dirty travelers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We have to all wait till
everybody's gone through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everybody's got their bag. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you can start going
through the bag checking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Once you've got your bag,
you still got to wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, I don't know
if this happened to you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did they bring out like
search dogs and stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And they checked everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God!
- And I was like, oh my... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bro, I don't think the dog
can smell COVID, can it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "This is a joke." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they were like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did they interrogate you
about what you brought in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They were asking me like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you have any food?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I mean, I got some snacks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like, "What is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What snacks?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Just like a nature bar." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like, "Does it contain meat?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "No, it's a fucking
nature bar, I don't know." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like grilling me
about these cereal bars I had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "It's
a fucking cereal bar! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds like typical
Australian customs to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you illustrate
there, it makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And yeah, we finally got through it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was talking to
this old Japanese man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he'd lived in the
UK for like 20 years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and he was just so funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was just like, "I miss pub already. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I miss my friends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have good friends in pub." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Yeah, man, I love the pub too." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Wait,
where are you going to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "Oh, I'm going to Kyushu." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "You're going to Kyushu? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you can't, how
can you get to Kyushu?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he was quarantining
in Tokyo for two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then Kyushu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like fuck that
- Jesus, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This poor guy was like 70. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause this guy was a 70
year old Japanese man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they didn't even try and
make him wear a mask. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He just took it off and no
one told him to put it on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But anyone else who even took
it off, they stopped them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like,
"Put your mask back on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you fucking playing,
Squid Game all of a sudden? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (group chattering)
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I immediately befriended the old guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I would have won Squid Game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We were just chatting the whole time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was like, "Bro, I think
you should put your mask on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I told him, "I think you
should put your mask on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "They won't make me put it on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "I'm too old,
they won't make me do it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To be fair, they didn't make him do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was really impressed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> He was that kind of amazing old man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just did not give a fuck anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "I'm far too old to
give fucks about your rules." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which I respect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Also, I was like, "Bro,
they've got guns, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Put the mask on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally Squid Game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They have guns bro." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was trying to help him out here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My God! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And we got through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Of course this old man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they didn't make him open
his bag or do anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm next up, they made
me fucking open my bag, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got like three bags and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Uh, for fuck's sake!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, "Do you smoke cigarettes?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "What about tobacco?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he was like, "Do you have any?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "No. I just said, no" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can I have some? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanna hit man, I
just wanna hit, give me a hit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then after that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after you finally get through all that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm assuming this is the same
for you, you get on the bus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we get to wait 30 minutes
for it to fucking go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, 'cause it was peak
traffic hours at this point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it took an hour and a half
to get to the fucking hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So not fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But where was your hotel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't remember where my hotel was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was a different one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They blindfolded me in the bus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, I got in the bus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just like fucking conked out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh really?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like Squid Game 'cause I was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it had the squid game music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They didn't need to gas me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucking conked out myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, Jesus, fuck.
- Woke up on a bunk bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If they could have
gassed us, they would have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Congratulations, you're
here on quarantine day one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They took us- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Only half of you will survive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They took us all the
way from Haneda Airport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like very south
of Tokyo to Ryogoku. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ryogoku?
- Ryogoku. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like an hour and a half away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like North Tokyo.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I've never been to Ryogoku before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was literally, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we were staying right on
top of the Sumo stadium. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, mine was like 20
minutes away from the airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Motherfucker! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We'll get into how good
your treatment was, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, we get to this hotel
and I shit you not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is like 40 armed
guards at this hotel, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like 20 of us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like literally Squid Game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was literally like 40 armed guards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And all they did is you
watch you get off this bus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're watching you the whole time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But again, presumably I don't know why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this seems excessive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even think the prison system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> has that many fucking guards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - These hotels have been
completely converted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into COVID hotels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're closed to the public. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There's one right in Shinjuku Sanchome, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I walked past it, and I saw all the guards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and with all their face masks on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was just weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have to wait, again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have to wait for fuck's sake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to wait another 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Finally you get to a table
where a woman talks to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she was explaining what
you could and couldn't do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but her English was really bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and obviously again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know this is my fault,
I don't speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I asked her a question </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then she just got really like, "What?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She like didn't understand that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Oh, maybe
I can ask someone else?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I felt really bad, but
then someone else came over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and who spoke perfect English. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "So come on, tell me what's going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What am I doing here, man?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And also, this whole time,
during this whole thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I kept asking everyone at
every single checkpoint, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Do you know how many days
I'm spending in this hotel?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they said three days, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When does three days start? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When would you think it would start? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the moment you
get to the hotel, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's day zero.
- That's day zero. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, here's the thing.
- That's orientation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At every single checkpoint, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I asked people which day does it start? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone said a different thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I didn't know how long
I'm staying in this hotel for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> until I heard that thing where she says, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, you will get a test on this day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then if it's a
negative, you can leave." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is when I found out how long </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm staying in this hotel for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And yeah, so, if you get a
negative test, you can leave. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, oh my God, it
was fucking terrible, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just getting there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not even to mention the hotel, oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause what was your room like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, it's a nice room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And like APA hotels-
- You stayed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the APA hotel, right?
- Yeah, did you not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't stay in APA hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - APA hotel is a chain of business hotels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Also very famous for having
a very funny book in them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you heard of this book? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a revisionist book
of Japanese history, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that is quite, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what's the word? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Racist, that's the word. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a really famous book </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it caused a lot of
controversy before the Olympics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the Chinese team
refused to stay in the hotel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because of this book. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah , I heard about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause this book, it
would say that like things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that Japan did never
happened and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of a somewhat
weird controversial, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the owner is a controversial figure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of APA hotel, I think, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyway, just a fun little history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this hotel, I had one of the rooms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just a business hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you're not supposed
to be in there all day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The idea is that you go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you travel to like somewhere in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you do your businesses in the
day and then you sleep there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just used to shower and sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's got everything you need. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've stayed in the APA hotel as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Probably like they're
all very similar style. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like there's
only enough space in there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's no room to walk at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is very much like a prison cell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you do have a
TV, but the TV is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can probably kick the TV, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with how close it is to the bed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's like, it has like enough space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to contain a human being in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's what it's designed for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so I'm 5'10, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and my feet were just
at the end of the bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So if you were like
6'5, bro, you're fucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I show it off in the
video a lot, that I filmed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you get this room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's about two steps horizontally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like two steps vertical
of walking the room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So that's all the room you have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're not allowed to
leave the room, obviously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if you do try and leave the room, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's an armed guard
outside who will shout at you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you even opened your door </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for longer than like five seconds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I spoke to an
Irish guy who was there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he said he wanted to get
some fresh air in his room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you can't open the window. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can't even crack it open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The window doesn't open at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So if you want any fresh
air, like you can't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's kind of, at
least by the second day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my room started to smell not good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I understand that he
wanted to leave his door open, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently like two guards came over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like told him to close the door. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if you do it again they'll like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we never saw him again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And now, so you spend
three days in that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you get a negative
test, you get to leave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The scary thing was,
is the moment I landed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I got into my hotel, I got an email </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the Ministry of Health, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> telling me that somebody on my flight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tested positive for COVID.
- Oh shit! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if I got COVID, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have to stay in
that hotel for 14 days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't know when
they change your sheets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or do anything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They don't change your sheets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I was accumulating a lot of trash, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, meals and stuff adds up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the bottles and stuff adds up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, couldn't you get rid of that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, only the meal, they
didn't collect bottles. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They took yours? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God!
- We'll get into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll get into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, the room itself is nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a good hotel except the pillow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The pillow, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This pillow is for sadists. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one of those
concaved-like medical pillows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So your neck is like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's supposed to
stretch your neck out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not wanna sleep on
that when I have jet lag </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm trying to just fight for my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get eight hours of sleep here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I told Garnt, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Bring your own pillow
because this pillows suck!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you didn't have APA hotel, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I guess you didn't need it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, definitely the worst thing was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not being able to walk or have fresh air. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I thought, "Okay,
at least even in prison, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they get one hour of outside time of day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can I have one hour of
outside time please? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want some walking." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's only three days, so it's not bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was shit, but it had to be done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then the meals were crap, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You guys sent me pictures of the meals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I posted one of them and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is the saddest breakfast ever." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it caused a fucking
argument on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You must have got canceled
on Twitter for that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone was like, people
like, man, Connor's privileges, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> acting out so much... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Didn't you say something
like, "I don't eat breakfast." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't eat breakfast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this breakfast had like
French fries, slice tamps, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is fine but... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's single cheese
slices, sliced in half, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one small tomato, one piece of broccoli, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) omelet, I still
didn't know what it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a really, really hard croissant bread roll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and cinnamon roll, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and three pieces of
macaronI for breakfast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think in-flight meals
are better than that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's the thing
is that, people were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This looks amazing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Think about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> This is breakfast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just want cornflakes or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want cold french fries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's another thing, all
of this stuff was very cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All the meals you get are cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cold and they are-
- You don't have a microwave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no way to heat it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It would've been nice to have a microwave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I could heat them up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause some of them are nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was one where they
made jerk chicken rice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But most of them were really
ice cold, not that good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But that one breakfast, oh my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that made me so depressed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "This is it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As if your situation
isn't already depressing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And everyone was like,
"You're so privileged Connor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Look at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is not a balanced
breakfast in any capacity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one should have cold
french fries for breakfast." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "What's wrong with you guys?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "In my country, that would be amazing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "What country? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tell me your country." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whenever I've been to countries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that are not as wealthy
as other countries, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they normally have the best breakfasts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they're always home
cooked and they're amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like really
cheap, really filling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had Sri Lankan breakfast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that shit was the best shit
I'd ever had for breakfast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like a curry thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would kill for that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over some shitty cornflakes or oatmeal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got so annoyed about this whole thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone who called me privileged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it sounds like Garnt
had a much better time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like I was prepared... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was prepared for prison. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I talked to other
people who'd traveled before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they had a very, very
similar experience to Connor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you did feel like you
were stuck in a prison cage, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you couldn't leave your room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I knew about the cold meals as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like the one advice everyone gave me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> before traveling was, pack snacks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I brought a lot of snacks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I'd seen the meals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> All I knew is that most
places had a kettle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, "All right,
I know I'm gonna do." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I filled up an entire carry-on
case with just instant ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I posted a picture on my Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I saw that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Why did you need twenty? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so before flying off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I tell my mom, "Mom, I'm
probably gonna need snacks." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If anyone knows Asian moms, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they will over-pack food for shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, here's what you
need for the quarantine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe you might need a bit
more of you're missing home, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you want a bit more ramen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you know what, I've got a few spare, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why don't I pack that as
well in the suitcase?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I just see a fucking
mountain of instant ramen there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, "I can
survive nuclear winter now, man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fucking sorted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let alone for quarantine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I had like just a whole,
like a normal suitcase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just a carry-on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was just full of food and snacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> prepared for this prison
experience I was gonna go through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so, I had exactly the
same experience with Connor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going on the bus and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Conked down on the bus and
woke up don't know where. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just like fucking Squid Game, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Where am I? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God, okay, I'm ready. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm ready for the prison
experience to start." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I get off, and first thing is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get chauffeured in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't have any armed guards, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just like a bunch of people
who worked at the hotel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who are obviously like decked out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was no security? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was security, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they weren't armed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were just people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It looked like they were just people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who worked in the hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just with a full like
hazmat suit on, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's totally different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, here's a hack, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's a life hack that I learned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> going through this process is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're traveling with someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they will give you extra
privileges and extra rooms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, Connor traveled by himself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was traveling with Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, when they sat us down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and gave us the whole spiel of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, you can't do this,
you can't drink alcohol, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't leave your room,
can't open your window. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yada, yada, yada. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, I mean, me and Sydney are together, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can we get a bigger room please? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, my God, your room
contains a double bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a semi-double.
- A semi-double. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that took up like the room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That took up the room, so I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "There is no way I could
stay with another person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that room." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So me and Sydney were deciding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Should we just say we're separate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in case they do put us in the same room? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Let's see what they say
if we say we're together." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I said, "Oh, I'm with Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Can we stay together, please?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, we'll see what we can do." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so they go off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they talk to their supervisor
or something, they come back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they tell us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh yeah, I think we can get you a room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> suited for two people." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At this point-
- The suite is open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At this point, I didn't
know what it meant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like doubling down to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is this room big enough for two people? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, if it is not big
enough for two people to stay in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for possibly two weeks, if
we test positive for COVID, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God forbid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if it is not big enough, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then we would rather have separate rooms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they go off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like chatting
again to the supervisor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they come back and they go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I'm really sorry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Okay, maybe
we do need to get two rooms." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I'm really sorry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the king size beds are gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This one only has a queen size bed." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Bro, you getting a five star experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm out here fighting for my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did your quarantine in the Hilton? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm sorry, can you say that again?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, unfortunately all the
king size suites are gone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we're gonna have to
put you in the queen." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sorry, the room
has only three jacuzzis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "The queen size suite,
are you okay with that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Yes." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I looked at a Sydney, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Are you okay with that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Sydney's like, "I think that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, we get taken to our room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did anyone like take you to your room? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We had like a guard behind us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He'll like smack your ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he's like, "Don't
look behind or you die." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we had like four luggages with us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to two big luggages
and two carry-ons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we've been lugging them around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking airports and
it's like heavy as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so after they check
us in to our rooms, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we go pick up, they give
us our meal right away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a table with all our meals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We pick one up and then I
started putting the meal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the suitcase, and
started lugging around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't do that."
- What the fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I had like 10 bags, that
would have been nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was like, "Oh, what's going on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they called another person over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we have a luggage person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who puts mine and Sydney's
luggage on a trolley, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> leads us to the lift, and they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What room were you checking into? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a Room 301. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, that's on the third floor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they take us in, he
takes us into the lift, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> presses the button for us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it takes us out and he says, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Have a good stay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Have a good stay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on here?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we get up to the third
floor expecting me and Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to have to take over from there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's someone waiting
for us on the third floor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they take our luggage
out and leads us to our room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And before they check us in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once again, they explain
everything we can and can't do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so this is like the moment of truth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is where I find
out how big our room is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm preparing for the
worst because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, I'm not gonna be able to walk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna be able to do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's Japan sizes.
- It's Japan sizes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We open the door and it's a fucking suite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bear in mind, these hotels are free. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the government paying for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like this is a hotel I would
stay in if I was on holiday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We walk in and there's a
hallway that leads to our bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So we walk in, me and
Sydney look at each other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "The Gacha gods are on my side!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is this, a Trash Taste special? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is he getting a dab
and you're getting the L? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Gacha gods fucking
smiled down on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we walk in and there's a hallway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> before we get to our room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we have like
a decently sized bed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a queen sized bed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we have an office segment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a big desk and a massive TV, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that both me and Sydney can
use for desks to work in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we really wanted to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'It's gonna be a great holiday, Sydney. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This will be a great fucking holiday." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never thought
myself as a communist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes I wonder if they have like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are humans truly equal? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I remember... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was so pissed off when
he messaged me a picture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of his hotel room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, I fucking hate you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate you so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
after I checked in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor was just like,
how's your room, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's shit, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's shit, tell me it's
shit, tell me it's shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, please
tell me it's shit, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Please tell me you hate
your life right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just tell me I'm not alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then he sent me a picture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was this fucking massive room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't just tell him-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This man could've ran laps in his room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't just send him a picture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I sent him like a video tour of our room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The fact that I could send
like a video tour of our room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We live in a society. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We live in a society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And yeah, we, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we had a lot of
the same experiences, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I mean, did you have a
laundry service in your hotel? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, you didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No you fucking didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what we are allowed to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we had a receptionist, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when we walk into the room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we notice that there's only
one pillow and we're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fuck, what do we do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's only one pillow,
we can't contact anyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm just like, there there's this... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They gave us like a hotline </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in case anyone developed
symptoms or anything like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then there's a small print that says, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can phone this hotline
for any other requests </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you may need during
your stay as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so we called them up
and they were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, how is your condition? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Everything's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's only one pillow
in my room, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there's two people staying here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Could we get another pillow?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, yeah, sure, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll have someone
deliver a pillow to you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like normal hotel service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, so we get another pillow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we start checking in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we start looking under the instructions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we see that we can order
things to our room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we can order Amazon
and we can order deliveries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to our room as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They said I could do that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but they had like a
very weird list of stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you weren't allowed to order, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like burgers and pizza and chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like food?
- Certain foods, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was really oddly written </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I didn't really understand it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you couldn't get certain
things like Amazon delivered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They said that you couldn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we actually were able
to get Amazon deliveries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to our room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We couldn't get Uber Eats, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we couldn't get hot food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was like the only
thing that we couldn't get, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was hot foods. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we can get Amazon deliveries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we can get anything
that would help our stay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be more pleasant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We had like a laundry service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they would come
collect laundry at 7:00 AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they would like
deliver it back to our room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the evening.
- You can't make this shit up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We live in a society.
- It's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We had like a garbage service, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would pick up the
garbage every morning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had my garbage in my room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We also had a masseuse, just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like they would give us
new garbage bags every day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so we could fill it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And honestly, our food
aside from like being cold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was pretty damn fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We got like a pretty--
- Yeah, I saw your food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it looked way better than mine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we got like a fucking
decent bento everyday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some of this shit was better than Matsiya. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What was like the water
situation in your place? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you can ask for
more bottles of water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A unit got one bottle of
water with every meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I ran out 'cause I was a thirsty boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I asked for more and they said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, sure, we'll deliver it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They never delivered it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They just didn't turn up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So when we went in... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, sorry, I forgot to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> our place also had a minI fridge as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah, mine did as well.
- Did yours as well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think most hotels have minI fridges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just like never got cold though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like--
- Just a container. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They made it like less
than room temperature, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I was like, I guess that's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I mean, what am I gonna do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> call them and make them
replace the fridge? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we realized water would
be a very important resource </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fucking survive as it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They said you can use tap
water, but you know, obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It taste like shit in Japan.
- Yeah, it does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we go in and there
is two bottles of water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is standard, I guess,
for every hotel stay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't even know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You didn't?
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so they gave us.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They started off with two bottles of water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we opened the mini fridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was a mini fridge
full of bottles of water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, fuck off.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mine wasn't even on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had to turn it on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So at the start of our journey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had like eight bottles of
water, which is brilliant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And every time they delivered meals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which was like three times a day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was like, they gave
us more food than I needed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because by the time... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had the breakfast was massive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and by the time lunch
was being delivered-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I often didn't eat breakfast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I just wasn't hungry at breakfast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, by the time lunch was delivered, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was still full from breakfast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I had a little bit of lunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like, by the time dinner came, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was eating like a king. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This man, this man, this man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a great experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The dichotomy that we faced, oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This guy is literally
living like a English king </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> during the black plague. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, this man is a plague- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - While the peasants are
dying from the black plague </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> he's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, there's too much
food here guys, fuck me" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, you know
that scene in Goodfellas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well the gangsters like go to jail, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but they're having-
- They're like champagne </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like champagne and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's basically my
quarantine hotel experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't wanna leave, honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Me and Sydney woke up on the third day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're like, oh, do we have to go now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do we have to go back to our-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can one of us just get COVID? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing)
Just so we stay here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like two weeks or so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just a free vacation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't have enough to pay for it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't have enough to pay for the meals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a good meal everyday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had a hotel service. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - While this man living in the slums. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I got so depressed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like on the second, third
day I was miserable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's it called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cabin fever, is that what it is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't even play games or watch shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was just so miserable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You were just like lying in bed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just like lying
there, checking Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then just like, should I do something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No, I'm too tired. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I can't fucking walk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm literally just
lying, sitting down all day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're just bed-ridden. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it make you feel fucking awful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, if it was terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I know I'm gonna sound
just like a little bitch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm sure everyone's gonna say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw the photos, some
of the photos you sent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd feel the same way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's one of those things where
when you see it and hear it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like doesn't sound too bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but then when you do it you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, shit this is really depressing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Meanwhile me and Sydney
were just like playing games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like the big screen
TV in the living room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like it's fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's pull out the PS5 we packed in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't have a game console. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried playing some games on my laptop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I immediately was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, this shit is not comfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not comfortable doing this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the smell of my
room was so goddamn bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause all the food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like coagulating in the air </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then after reading a few more posts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and after like talking to various people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think your hotel quality experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is literally down to chance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, 'cause there's three buses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I noticed there's three bus lines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they all take you
to a different hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And whichever one you go to,
you get a different experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think our hotel was
not just a business hotel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was actually like a four-star hotel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they put us in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Certainly sounds like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Gacha luck man, the Gacha
lords are on your side. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know I will say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't make any more Squid
Game jokes but this is... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I got on the bus that we all came on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like half the people on the bus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which means that half of them got COVID. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was weird.
- First round elimination </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Irish guy was there who I spoke to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the old man was there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's up guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I saw that guy without his mask on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in front of like seven armed
guards, not giving a fuck, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like damn man, I did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What day did you travel on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What date?
- What day? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it like a Saturday like a Friday? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know man, it was all the same, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was all the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause what I will say is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I traveled on like a weekday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like not many people were traveling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I feel like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was traveling on a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Friday maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah, Friday's like a peak time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for people who are traveling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not sure you know,
I have to have a look. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause if you travel on the weekend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think more people travel on the weekend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I feel like the
worst hotels are for like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when there are too many people traveling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it kind of like bleeds out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, I think we didn't
have too many buses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is why like, I think
we had like one or two buses, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they all went to the same place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I feel like once that hotel
started getting filled out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean if you think about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> why would you need to drive
one and a half hours... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we flew in through
Haneda which is like south. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no reason to drive
to a hotel in the north. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well they drove to the hotel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they drove us back to the airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then when you get to the airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to have a weird specific taxi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't get a normal taxi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't book a normal taxi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it has to be a quarantine approved taxi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the problem is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know what time we were leaving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So what time I should I tell this taxi? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't figure it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I didn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had to guess and I
had to wait for two hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the Haneda. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the thing was, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so this whole period has
just been in quarantine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They drop you off at Haneda,
and they're like, fuck off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No one checks you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one makes sure and
everyone just went went off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, where's everyone going? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Does everyone know where they're going? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I spoke to the Irish guy
who'd done it a few times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, you can just chill
around the airport and wait." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, well I can just go to the cafe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and interact with people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "Yeah, if you want to." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, that doesn't seem right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't, I just I stood
in like a corner waiting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> far away from everyone, and I
was like don't come near me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, yeah, it was fucking weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally like that dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's been in jail for most of their life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just trying to assimilate
back into society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah man, it was it was fucking weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and not a very fun experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they've got rid of
it now, for UK travelers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have they got rid of it, have they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They probably will soon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They reduced the quarantine time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Before we flew, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean before we flew off to England, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was six days in quarantine hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they got halved to
three days in quarantine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Six days in a hotel, fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why couldn't be six days?
- He would've been all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I shiver at the thought of
spending another day there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was nerve wracking, 'cause
the day I had to do my test, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they called me up and they said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, when you get your
results if they're negative </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to leave the room right away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you have to pack just in
case that you're leaving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I didn't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause someone on my
plane had been infected </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a good chance
that I could have got it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Luckily I didn't but
like they called me up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like, "Your test
results are negative, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please leave the room
as soon as possible." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like everyone's leaving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, what the fuck,
I gotta get out of the room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is weird, it was
really a shit experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't recommend, IGN
is 10 out of 10 there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't recommend that experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my experience wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, you got a free suite hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember Connor like
messaging me every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor was like trying to drag
something negative out of me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like tell me about,
Garnt, tell me about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, honestly it's
just pretty good actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm having a good time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He'd mention to me the
next day, me being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe this this day will get to him, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this day will get to him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure something
bad happened since then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I went on Twitter as
well the day I checked in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and a fucking video from
Zed, the musical artist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This motherfucker had like
a penthouse suite somewhere, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally a penthouse suite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Zed] A bedroom and an insane view. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at this, just crazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm ready for the
quarantine, let's get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And bear in mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Japan isn't even giving out
visas right now to anyone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but somehow he got in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He got a penthouse suite in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - In Japan and he got a
visa to get in, somehow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he's doing a concert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And somehow they made an exception </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people were not happy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there was tons of people
in the comments being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Zed, you know that students
haven't been able to enter Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in two years, what the fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's off here showing his suite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And Zed didn't even have to
do a quarantine for two weeks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only three days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah so after the quarantine hotel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you still have to quarantine at home </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for two weeks.
- For 11 days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - For 11 days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There were people trying
to cancel you for privilege. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like--
- That's real privilege there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I made a joke 'cause he gave a room tour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that was like two minutes long, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like all the different rooms he had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and all the shit he'd been sent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He'd been sent like
everything you'd ever need. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Someone sent him like a
gaming pc for his quarantine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like this is fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the stupidest shit I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I made a parody video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Hey guys this is my room tour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just turned the camera </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like the room
and that's the whole room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just joking about how like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the difference compared to rooms. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then people got
angry at me being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you should be happy that you
even were able to enter Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know people haven't
been able to enter Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for two years, the privilege your showing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so annoyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just can't get a dove there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I deleted the tweet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was getting pissed off with the replies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like what the
fuck are these reply... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like why are you blaming me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't blame me for being
a resident in a country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and getting back in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blame the country for
banning any form of visas, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck!
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They were like taking it out on me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was getting so annoyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was fuming, fuming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, those people
couldn't fucking tweet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the Japanese government, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they had to go for the next best thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You're so lucky that
you can re-enter Japan." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'm lucky that i
can re-enter the country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking live in, what
the fuck do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Shut the fuck up.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is absurd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't try and say that I'm lucky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is pretty unfair.
- We're all unlucky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that the government has
some shitty rules on this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like don't don't take
it out on each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why I got annoyed about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause people are attacking other people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who are able to get into the country </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> instead of, I don't
know, blaming the people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who are making the rules </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and these arbitrary
rules between countries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like in America, some
states have to quarantine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but others don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And so there's this
whole weird thing where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like why, I mean it's
all one country, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, same with Australia as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like most of the states... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I mean, Australia had
that the fucking worst though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, Victoria I think was in lock down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for 280 days in a row,
something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, no interstate thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My sister was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, I'm not allowed to
travel more than 10 kilometers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from my house, otherwise I get fined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But like there's nothing stopping you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from just, if you live in like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So one of the countries that
was banned was like Texas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You could just fly--
- You mean state? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the state. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The country of Texas. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The state of Texas was like one country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that you'd have to quarantine
in, go to the hotel for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But there were other states </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you didn't have
to go to the hotel for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like why wouldn't you just
drive over to the next state </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and fly from there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And just say that you've been there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there's no way
they can validate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They can check that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So to me it just felt
really like fucking weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But COVID has shown that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the rules are not to do
with what's practical, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's political ties and all those things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if we've learned anything
and that's what is shitty, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that it sometimes feels
like you're just caught up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in some international
bullshit politics of countries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that don't like each other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and countries that do like
each other and favoring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean the UK did it a lot
too with countries as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They've been pretty bad for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just a mess and I
hated it and it's shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well at least you guys got to you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sit here with me.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You guys made it, you made it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like for the longest time we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like literally trapped in this country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we couldn't fly
out for the longest time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was only recently
that the rules got changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that people who are already
residents can fly out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then fly back in, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I mean now we're just
waiting for the actual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who are waiting on visas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I can only imagine
that, that does suck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because we were really lucky
to be able to get our visas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> before all this happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> otherwise we would have literally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Trash Taste would have never happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if we would had applied for our visas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally a few months
after we got our visas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We would still be waiting now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to even get our visas to move to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's actually crazy to think about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Japan faced a lot of criticism </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the coronavirus started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they banned... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Only Japanese nationals
were allowed back in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is like okay I
guess that makes sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then they also didn't
allow green card holders, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> permanent residents,
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're like me you're British </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're married to a Japanese woman </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you went and
then you came back in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I was married to Japanese person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd be allowed in but
I wouldn't be allowed in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That came under a shit ton of criticism, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> rightfully so, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because if someone's a permanent
resident of your country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's literally like
where their whole life is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't just say like, no, but they did, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they faced a lot of criticism, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which they did eventually change </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they've still been banning visas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And like I feel really fucking
sorry for these students </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who've had their life on pause, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who had their whole
like basically two years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lined up in Japan,
they've just been banned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from entering Japan.
- They've just been waiting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't make sense to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they wouldn't allow some system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> even if it's complicated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and even if it's fucking
stupid and tedious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get in if you're a student. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I don't understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why they haven't changed the rule on that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just Japan being Japan, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's because Japan thinks that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, the foreigners, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're more likely to get
it if you're a foreigner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just not true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's just one
of those things where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can go through enough precautions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can do enough tests </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make sure that 99% of
the time you'll get it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that it's good and it works, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know to me it just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't fathom it why they've banned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> issuing any visas at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It really doesn't make sense to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know, it's dumb as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and after going through that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quarantine experience like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't believe anyone who's flying in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is spreading COVID. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They have this shit on lockdown man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, yeah, there's like two tests </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you get here and your test before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Obviously, somehow, someone
did get COVID on my flight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but that was caught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then if you test
positive in the three days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand it can still slip through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but also it feels like
such diminishing returns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at this point, to keep this rule in place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I mean it's whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure everyone will have
a personal opinion about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I understand allowing tourists in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously I get that
this is like, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There like different
levels, there's tourists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is opening the floodgates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then there's people
who are literally waiting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on a working visa.
- It breaks my heart, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really feel sorry for these people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> who had their life lined up to come here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and they've just been just
hanging around, waiting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Really, I do feel so sorry for them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so fucked, it's really fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, hopefully soon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean the the cases are
going down a lot now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw an article today that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Japan's drop in COVID
cases baffles experts.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But also I heard that
Japan isn't testing as much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so I mean yeah yeah... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I mean it's also because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> most young people now are
finally fucking vaccinating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have we missed anything
since we've been gone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean the country's
opened back up again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean in terms of like
the the 'lock down.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So beginning of October they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, yeah so everything's just good now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everything's open, you can
drink alcohol if you want." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone's like, "Are you sure?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you said that last time... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We did that last time we
could only do it for a week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> before you shut that shit down again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just like, the
floodgates were open, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone went out drinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then a week later
everyone's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, that was a good time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Experts were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, that's a bad
idea, let's not do that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Japanese government
managed to do something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I think they've never done before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> test the patience of their population </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and piss them off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never seen people
get so actually angry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about shit in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It just doesn't happen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but people actually
got so angry about them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> keeping extending the lockdown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because they're so
fucking wishy-washy as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "Oh, yeah, so
the cases are going down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not zero, but it's going down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so maybe we can open it up again." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then it goes back up and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Experts are baffled.
- Surprised Pikachu face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Experts are baffled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How did this happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was going down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the Olympics just like blew it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God, just like I watched a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about all the fuck ups of the
Olympics and it was insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Having it all in one video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the sheer amount of people that got fired </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> off the Olympic committee is insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like half of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and then the amount
of controversy, it was insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like this is fucking terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so fucking weird.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean so far it seems
to be going all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean the other day I was at a park </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and with some of my friends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we should do a bold gamer move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We should drink a beer in
this park, and I was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It felt like someone
just offered me cocaine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like no no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think that's a good idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think someone's watching,
this this doesn't feel right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I did it, it was very liberating but... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck the police.
- Yeah, I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck the police, they can't stop us now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just waiting again for next week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the government to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Changed our minds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's lock down again." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, the real question
is, is karaoke open? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that's
- Is that true? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything is open.
- That's how you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lock down's actually ended. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Once the karaoke opens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like the equivalent of when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the British pubs were open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So the karaokes are open, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurants now go past eight o'clock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can order alcohol, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically, everything's back to normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, some of the
restaurants are still closed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some restaurants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah it's kind of confusing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is basically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's basically most restaurants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause actually, the
day of filming this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is literally my first
day out of quarantine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I've not been out to explore the town. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've just been stuck in
my or stuck in my house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You sound like Andy Dufresne, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like my first day of freedom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How was your 11 days at your home? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly I prefer like the three days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in my quarantine hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking love my home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, Oh my God, I
can walk, I have a space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can walk.
- I can walk around, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can shit in a bathroom that
has a bidet that's usable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your hotel... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It had a bidet, but it was like so weak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like a duck tickling my butt hole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted something to power
wash my cheeks, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was okay for like
a good five, six days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like the second
half of the quarantine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it really starts to get to you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you're just in your house </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're seeing everyone out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're seeing the
country be normal, I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Luckily i have Sydney so
I had her to interact with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in case I was feeling too lonely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I was by myself--
- Oh, bro I loved it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a great time.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, dude.
- The dichotomy of man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like I was testing like
every single Uber Eats out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was loving it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My new place, I really love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I got to like kind of work on it a bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I didn't schedule anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I just had like the full 11 days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to just kind of do what I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I played some games-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean you did that like
three, four days stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I did a 72-hour stream
- Oh, yeah, you did do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And guys I didn't say
anything racist in my stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well we don't know, I muted my mic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so maybe I did.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw a lot of mouth flaps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't make it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Enhance, enhance, enhance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Expert lip readers.
- Lip readers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I did a 70 hour stream not 72 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because I had a Japanese
class so I had to end it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it did a 70-hour stream which was fun, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had a really good time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was kind of last minute, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was kind of like I'm
gonna do a 70-hour stream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and my mods were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're gonna what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> No you can't do it, it's too soon." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "No, we're
doing it, we're doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's perfect time, I'm gonna do it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You were in quarantine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean you're stuck
at home, you might as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> By the third day I was
getting quite tired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand now why
Ludwig would watch clips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for so long, because after a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just was like, can I
stop talking for a bit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like can I just stop? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm getting really tired. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was fun it was fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sleeping on stream was not as difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as I thought it would be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was generally just quite
tired from streaming all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of just conked out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I tuned in right at the beginning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then again right at the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like looking
at two different people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like wait, is this the right link? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was starting to get
some really big eye bags </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> under my eyes.
- I could see that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I think like I wasn't
sleeping like eight hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's very hard to,
'cause when you wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you wanna check, make
sure everything's okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is everything working? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And people could have had the
ability to fuck with my lights </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So people were making my house
a rave while I was sleeping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's that fucking meme edit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like the outside of the house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can hear the music inside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the lights...
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was literally like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I just played Trash
Taste episodes while I slept. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, wow.
- That was what I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Easy content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Racking up those views, baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought right, when I was sleeping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I assumed, 'cause when I was streaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had about 10 to 14k viewers concurrent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Which was more than I normally have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was very impressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought when I was sleeping
it would go down to like 1000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Turns out there was like
7,000 people watching this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was like, I saw that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like what the fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What have you been doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was like going through jet lag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like let's see
what Connor's up to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like 7,000 people watching me sleep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like fucking hell, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought you did 7k normally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - My normal streams get like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like why am I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm getting more sleeping, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are they like sleeping with you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like I'm sleeping next to Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what was weird, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> waking up and seeing like
people had subscribed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like paid to sub to me
while I was sleeping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, shit, I should just
sleep on stream all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I get paid to sleep, fuck me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding, it's weird though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like why did
someone give me 50 subs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while I was sleeping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like 300 quid, more
than that I think actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a lot of money,
I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the most generous
tooth fairy in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (group chattering)
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like what the fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But it was weird and I'd
have like weird moments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> where I would wake up but
i don't remember waking up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would see clips of me waking up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, I don't remember that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw a clip of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if you
were half asleep or not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you just like flipped off the camera, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like halfway through your sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was trying to sleep, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then people just
went ham with my lights, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and they just started
changing it every second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I was just like, fuck you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it was fun though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't think it was
something I ever thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd be interested in,
but I thought, fuck it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll try it and I
obviously had a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd recommend you guys try it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm good.
- I'm good, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like my privacy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can barely stream as it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - People always tell me, they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You guys should do a Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where you just take it in turns streaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh it could work sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I feel like
if we did it as a group </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it would be easier, but
like by myself, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You do shifts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like we're together
sometimes but then shifts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've done long
streams with other people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that go for like 15 to 20 hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't do it by myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't do it by myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't have like many guests come on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just had (indistinct) play
with me which was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fun when you have
someone else to talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like if you have
someone else to bounce off of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you don't have to be like,
likely talking to a chair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here's one of the reasons
why I decided to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So i had not been
streaming for like a month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I left for the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so I didn't stream for a month at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I didn't stream for two months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I have a second channel as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and we like ran out of videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had like no more videos left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so, Mudan, my editor was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, Connor, please, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please make like a shit ton of content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, all right I got you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 72 hours of story content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the (indistinct) I
got like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10 plus videos out of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm like there you go Mudan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here you go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> He was very happy now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "Great, now I
have more content to edit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is great this..."
- More money for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause we have a deal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we split the money 50-50. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why he was desperate, he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I need to get paid, man" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, because the
channel has been doing great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so he's like come on Connor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've got to keep up the content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like whipping you for content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's now the guy who's
like, come on, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need content, start doing
something, Connor, film it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And he tells me, he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Play this game, it'll
be funny for a video." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's your content producer now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a really good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a really good balance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we kind of started it together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I didn't... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were just like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I won't pay you for editing fees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you get 50% of whatever it makes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we thought we'd
be in the red for a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or we thought he'd be
in the red for a while, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but luckily, yeah, it took off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now it's doing really really well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's killing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some of the videos get like more views </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than my videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One of them got like two million views </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Should have put this on my
main channel, goddammit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, they're doing really well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's cool, it's weird, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean we also met
Mudan in the UK as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I got to catch up with him, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> somehow he found two
days out of his schedule </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to program himself out of editing and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He flew all the way from
Estonia to come hang out with us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God, he is a machine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't realize this... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't appreciate this until like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually speaking to him in person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's insane.
- Where he is insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never seen someone with
like a more strict work ethic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than he does.
- Oh, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the man never quits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm surprised he still has emotion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you have to like
throw humanity away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to keep up with him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He edits videos in full time speed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know.
- He watches the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in full time speed
- He told me that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I don't think human
brain can comprehend that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am convinced he's just
jacked into the matrix, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause how do you edit
in four times speed? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you don't do that
with a mouse and keyboard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you do that in like Ghost of the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You like jack yourself in
and like he edits the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in his mind, that's how I'm convinced-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's one with premiere pro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He does editing speed
runs on his Twitch channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he edits like whole of
my videos in like four hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I remember talking to him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we were catching up
because he was with us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like with a bunch of our mates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as we were like all catching up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was talking to him and I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh so you're editing for like
Trash Taste, our specials </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> After Dark, Connor's channel,
Connor's second channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and some of Joey's videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've heard some of Aki's
videos in the past as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, are
you close to burnout </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, Garnt, I'm looking for more work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you have more work for me?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] So like, he was
on his holiday, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, "It's all
right, I can connect to my PC </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through my phone, and I
can edit this for you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> At the airport and I'm
like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's never disconnected.
- He's never disconnected. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And he never quits.
- And he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Garnt, have you ever thought about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> starting a stream channel?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Mudan, how are
you looking for more work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right now?"
- He told that to me as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I see you've been uploading
a lot on your second channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you want me to edit those?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "No, I'm good, I'm good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Enjoy your life please." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just like flabbergasted
that this guy is still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking for more work after
how many goddamn channels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's already editing for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's like a content black hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like he just keeps
ingesting, it's never enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like infinite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just like, 'cause I asked him like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Mudan, what is your limit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you ever limit tested yourself?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "No, I want
to know, give me more, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm nowhere near close to my limit now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's got the limitless pill.
- And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What the fuck, man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What is this machine
that I'm talking to, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like tested every
productivity app out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like find which one is
like the most productive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that he knows how he can
maximize his productivity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's insane, he's just
like a different breed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a fucking T-100. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Skynet didn't send back a
foot fucking terminator, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just sent back Mudan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like edit every video
on earth, on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and he won't stop until
he like monopolizes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the entirety of any tube basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think if every person was like Mudan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we'd be at like intergalactic
travel stages right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We'd be so advanced as a society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have the dice and spear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'd have had that by now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - We'd be like a level two society, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like controlling the solar system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I also feel like we'd be very dystopian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it was fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The whole thing was fun, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was really nice
getting to speak to him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> instead of asking him to do work, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ask him to have a beer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just hanging out and just
like having a beer with him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in person that was very nice. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> - These nuts, back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor belching) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry.
- I'm just trying to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of what i did while you guys were gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did you do while we were gone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What did you get up to?
- Yeah, what did you do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, fuck, what did do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw my family here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> First time in two years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like we all finally got vaccinated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause we all made a rule, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were like we're not
gonna see each other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> until we're all fully vaccinated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause my cousin, like my younger cousin's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> only like three years old or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, God forbid I
didn't wanna give him COVID, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or any my family. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we finally got vaccinated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so weird because the
last time I saw my cousin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's five now and he was
like two last time I saw him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's just weird I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm having a conversation with this kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so crazy fast
how like kids grow up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, oh, it's a
completely different person now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've reached that age now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And like I had a lot
of friends living here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from since I've known in
like high school and uni </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who were like, "I haven't
seen you in a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Once the country opens
up we should catch up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it has to be a weekend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I have to take
care of my two kids." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, have we really
gotten to that stage now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've really gotten to that age 'cause like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just my birthday
like about a week ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, it's starting
to get to that point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean you can relate Garnt,
'cause you're older than me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I feel it's around... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're a boomer.
- You're a boomer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thanks for singling
me out though, go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like I feel I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at least to me, like around 27 is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because I just turned 27, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it starts to get to the point
where it's not so much like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, yeah it's my birthday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's more like, oh, it's my birthday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've been like that for a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Age 8 to 15. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's not like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There's no like just that kind
of like childish excitement </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like getting older anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It slowly starts to turn into that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, God I'm getting older stage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does that happen when you get 30, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that when that happens? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, like for me--
- As the only 30 year old here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - As the only 30 year old here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember like it didn't
didn't really hit me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until I was 29, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so like every year like we... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When I lived in England we
had like this massive party </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where we get to catch up with
all of our friends in England. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we have this party every year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember it truly hit me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause we were at this party, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we're there for a few days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I was having a shower in the morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it kind of just hit me that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the last time I'm
gonna have this catch up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I'm 30, in my 20s. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I just had this like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> full-on fucking existential
crisis in the shower. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I take long showers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I take long showers anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like it was just me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That day that was a long shower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even for me that was
a long fucking shower. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Sydney like thought
I got kidnapped or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was just standing there just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I didn't know how to process that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I took like an hour-long shower, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then-
- Fucking hell! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well your hands must have been spongy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, they were, they were. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The whole body was spongy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then like after that
shower I was completely fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It washed away, down the drain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I washed my sins away, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was ready for my 30s afterwards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I also knew that I was
like getting to that point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause me and like a bunch of my friends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who were all vaccinated, so safe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> We rented out this like log cabin, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like the mountains in Chiba. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was really nice 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I hadn't really had it like
a nightlife for about a month </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> since everything was like closed down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like there's no point
going out to like restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that at night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was finally nice to actually get out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and change of environment stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially with your friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I knew I was also
getting to that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause all I received was
some pieces of clothing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two bottles of wine and
a bottle of whiskey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing)
And I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm getting to the point where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I see a bottle of whiskey
and I'm like pog jamming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Yoh!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess 'cause after a certain age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you normally have everything
you want, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Anything I'd want is like, yeah,
you wanna buy me a Porsche? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like a gift that
a mate doesn't already have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's either like in an
acceptable price range </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just doesn't really exist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just gets bigger and bigger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's either like you buy
them a new job or a new car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or a new house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, what do you want, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't really afford that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, like I'd say another thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that happened to me in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that you've just reminded me of is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to the Tesco's
to get my bottle of wine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then they asked me how old I was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never get ID'd, ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughing) And then I was
just like, "Oh, I'm 20." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No way.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had a moment like that too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone asked me how old I was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 23, oh, shit, 25. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I legitimately forgot at one point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how old I was turning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like am I turning 27 or 28? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck, I don't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to like do math
in my head to figure out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how old I was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd literally like forgotten
that I had turned 30, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like I had not been
asked for ID since I turned 30. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> By muscle memory I just
started saying 20 something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I had like this Darren Brown moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I just forgot the
number and I was like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Vsource music plays.
- Oh no, I'm 32. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were like, "Can we see some ID?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Oh my God,
I get to show my ID again." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never get ID'd, I wish I got ID'd. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- Yeah, 'cause-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never get ID'd here but... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've never gotten ID'd in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason I started
getting ID'd again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I went back to the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I look older than
you sometimes, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean sometimes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes, sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think most days.
- I think most people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who tune in to Trash
Taste for the first time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like wait, Garnt's the oldest one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone always thinks
that I'm older than I am, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is fair enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Just means-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everyone thinks Garnt's like 23. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just 'cause I'm fucking
miserable, that's why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm always complaining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't wait till I'm 50, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna complain about everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the beard man, it's the beard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, you have a good beard too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but the thing is if
I shave this off, I look 17. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I look like a child... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's plenty of Trash Taste episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I don't have a beard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I look at it and I'm like whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's just like
you shave your beard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and instantly you just lose five years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like 10, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe you 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I look like a 12 year
old when I have no beard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas I feel if Garnt came
to a Trash Taste recording </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a beard like ours, he'd
look like a fucking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had like a five
o'clock shadow before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah I don't know how that looks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't like it
when my beard's too long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just don't age, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, you could kill it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you can kill it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe I'll try it one day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe my mid 30s is the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could have grown
one while you were away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then come back, full
beard, "What's up, guys?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have assimilated.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Next time we have a break
when we don't record Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just let my beard grow
out and it'll just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the dichotomy of like
one Trash Taste episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the audience to be like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What happened during this week? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, Garnt really aged
during this week, didn't he? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt just like does some
Doctor Strange bullshit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or some nonsense or something
like that, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like a beard
could weirdly suit you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just not a big fan of
beards on me personally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I also like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> There's this like patch
where a beard like can't grow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on my on my chin as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so I don't know how weird that
would look if I grow it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I have a bit
of patchwork as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around the place- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, 'cause like the reason
I have this patch is because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was a kid I got... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well it's not that big
of an exciting story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but my chin got cut open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was on the playground, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hit a kid, fell on the floor and then my- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Split the chin
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Split my chin open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so once that got closed
up there's just this patch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> on my chin that just won't grow hair, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so I've always found it like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just stick it, just stick something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just stick something (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or just grow it out and
just like kind of bumble it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, braid it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Braid it into the middle
so it just comes down like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why not, why not, why not,
you've gotta give it a try. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe, I'll probably will one day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if we
should get into anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched an anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I forgot we're an anime podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What did you watch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Squid game?
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched Squid Game AKA Kaiji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched High Rise Invasion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck is that?
- Exactly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck is that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched High Rise Invasion on Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that a new-
- Is that an actual anime? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look it up, google. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got a Japanese name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - High Rise Invasion? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] There's a manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the manga called in Japanese? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (man speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When did this get released? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck?
- Wait, can I see? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never heard of this anime before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Man] It started as a manga but- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so what happened is that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I told myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna watch the first
anime I see on Netflix. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why?
- What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never seen this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so I watched it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was pleasantly surprised. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I quite enjoyed it.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It wasn't amazing, but it was good fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a 6.6 on iMDb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so when I started watching it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it felt like the most 6.6 show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was just good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had a fun time.
- Just good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had a fun time, it
was very interesting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and stupid at times and
dumb but interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys should check it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me explain the plot to you actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please.
- Go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whoa, Connor explaining the plot to us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Believe it or not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is gonna be the most
scuffed plot explanation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of any anime-
- We are used to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So this main character,
forgot her name already, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wakes up on the top of
a high-rise building </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can't go down the
stairs of the high-rise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can only cross like wooden bridges </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to get to other high-rise buildings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's these dudes
that are wearing these masks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are like budget
anonymous looking masks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> smiley masks and they're
trying to kill you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're trying to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're not trying to kill you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're trying to get you
to jump off the building </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> by making you have such despair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that goes out the window
within like 10 seconds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're just starting to kill you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's one of those things
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's one of those things
where they build it up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like a really big plot point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like they wanna
make you feel despair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and jump yourself and
then immediately like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why don't they just come
up to you and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Could you jump off please?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty please? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then immediately they then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> these masks people just
start killing everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it was like, wait
so that wasn't important? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then these masks are
like controlling people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and are trying to find
out what's going on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's some other... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're all (indistinct) so it's all... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All these characters-
- Oh, now I'm into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Why didn't you say so earlier, Connor? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can stop talking now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - All these characters come
from a different world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they wake up on high-rise buildings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have to go from different high-rise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's like masks that control them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's kind of shit but
it was interesting enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a fun time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what, it was nice watching a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and not caring if it was
gonna be good or bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And the dub was very good, very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fair enough.
- The dichotomy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think like this
was the longest stretch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I went not watching an anime at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And actually picked up a JRPG </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I like got fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tales of Arise?
- Tales of Arise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was fucking amazing, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you have to say that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I have to get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first time I played a JRPG </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like I'm just like-
- And actually completed it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I like, not only completed it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I'm like close to 100% as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, my God
- Like it's the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking JRPG where I
cared about it so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I didn't want the journey to end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I 100 percented the
fucking fishing mini game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That that's how you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I caught every fish in this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so I could see every skit
that there was available </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the game, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many hours have
you put in this game? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - At the moment, about 80 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So for JRPG length that's actually-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not too bad.
- That's not too bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Especially for a 100%
run, that's pretty short. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're talking 80 hours in
like the past two weeks, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, what else was he
going to do during quarantine? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What else was I gonna
do during quarantine? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like one thing that
really surprised me is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it really got me to care
about game mechanics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I'm here for
the story and characters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I just got really absorbed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - JRPG fans find out
that games can be good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I just got really
absorbed into the combat system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, how did you trick my... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How did you trick my non-gamer brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into caring about this shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like I've played
so many Tales games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the reason I got it and Tales </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was because it had like a
real-time combat system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I played Berseria
and I didn't like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Berseria?
- Berseria, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and that was in the time where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I only really got into Tales games because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> every other JRPG was turn-based combat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with random encounters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Tales was just like no no no no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how about you have a
real-time battle system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with enemies that you can see
when you get into a battle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then that kind of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as time gone on that
became more normalized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a lot of JRPGs, like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see the Modern Final Fantasy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's basically just an, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an action RPG with
some turn-based systems </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> implemented into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And so for the longest time
I still play Tales games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they didn't grab me as much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as say back in the old school days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where this was the only
type of JRPG there was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that had this type of system. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so like, my love for the Tale series </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had like waned a bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So when I got Tales of Arise, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I only got it 'cause
people were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, it's a new Tales game." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, I'm a Tales fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe I'll just play this like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm more of a Sonic guy.
- Yeah, I'm a Tales fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna ignore that for a second. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad you said it before I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just kept saying Tales
and I just kept thinking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was in my head I was
just imagining fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm a big Tales fan,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like if I wasn't in quarantine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't have played it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then on the first day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I played it for like a good 10 hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like oh no, oh no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm invested. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If there's one thing you
don't want to be invested in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the JRPG because you just
have to basically write off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like two three weeks of your life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if that happens.
- Pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's been such a long time where you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when you're so absorbed into a game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that every waking moment
you're not playing the game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're either playing the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're thinking about playing the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I miss that feeling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the combat system in this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> closer to something like, Devil May Cry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than it is like previous Tales games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can do like ridiculous
amounts of combos in this game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Can I go off about the game mechanics? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you care about the
game mechanics at all? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure, I mean, it's better
than you talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> aero game.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd love to hear how you like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so most Tales
games that I played before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like button
mashing, like you press- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I didn't like about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the last time I played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and you can get
through a lot of this game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through just button mashing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like, there's this
really weird difficulty curve </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where the later parts of
the game, you were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before in every Tales games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just get away with
like tapping one button, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> tapping special attack,
anything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then they've layered
so many different systems </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> onto this combat system from
like previous Tales games, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you realize you can
just start layering shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over like things over things,
over things, over things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they introduce you to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can only do a certain amount of moves </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before your character goes
back into a rest state. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you can only do like
three basic attacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and enough special attacks
before your meter runs dry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then if you juggle the enemy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you add more basic attacks on top of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then on top of that, you
have group attacks as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people in your party
can also join in on an attack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then what I didn't realize is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tales added this system, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can switch to
another person mid battle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you don't have to pause the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to switch to another character, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can literally, it's
a tap of one button, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can switch to another person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you can basically chain combos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ends combo with one person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then switch to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do a special attack with another person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> switch to that person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so the system awards people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are able to change really good combos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause if you get your
combo meter long enough, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you can do basically
a finishing attack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It looked kind of like
Genshin a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's that's the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's basically like, it
was a lot like Genshin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> except not having just one person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but having four people
in stage at one time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, in the sense that your chain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're playing Genshin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from how much more that you change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but it's like way
more in depth than Genshin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would say it does have some similarities </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to the Genshin combat system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like way more in-depth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can get combos
that are like way longer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than Genshin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You can get like 100 hit combos sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only thing that I found really funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't know if
this is the whole game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was watching someone
stream it on Twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were fighting this
dragon, and during this fight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single character was
saying their voice lines, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at every single point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't hear anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone is just screaming
in their own attacks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that happening all the time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's pretty standard
for a Jap, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't hear anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't hear what anyone was saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because everyone was
shouting their attacks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like what is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's the same with
like, Xenoblade as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when you're fighting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that shit I can't
watch 'cause that annoys me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Xenoblade annoys me watching Xenoblade, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm just hearing everyone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor imitating gaming sounds) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like four
people at the same time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't you like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause I can't hear
what everyone's saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just noise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't have to hear
what they're saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't, even if I
wanted to, I can't hear it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not like they're
giving important information. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wish that it
was like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from a viewing experience it
was very annoying, at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> From a gaming, it's
probably don't give a shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to put to focus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think if you're
watching it as a viewer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it might get a little bit annoying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause that's the only
thing you're focusing on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But again, it's not
like they're gonna drop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> huge narrative plot
points as they're going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey imitating gaming sounds) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm your dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing)
- I know, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like this is too loud, shut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause on top of that as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes the characters
will have conversations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with each other.
- That's what I saw as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As they're screaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As they're screaming their attacks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean there's a lot of things going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love that, I love that about Tales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's kind of campy about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the anime side that I live for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's something super
campy about it that I love. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, one person is being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, that was a good shot." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And the other one's like, "Ah!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, all right,
you're not listening, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It seemed pretty cool though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It seemed like a lot better
combat system than before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't trust people who
prefer turn-based combat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> over that, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who hurt you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't say anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Who is it, who is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who in this studio
likes turn-based combat? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't say anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I absolutely despise turn-based combat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] Turn-based is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's so boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I'm with Connor on that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Except for Persona. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We haven't figured a way to make it fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so we keep using the same shitty thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because we know it sort of works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but like no one's happy about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like turn-based combat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I'm
just used to it so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where I like think about it- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the thing though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's why people-
- I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If you didn't grow up with
it, it's fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and I think it's just 'cause, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a thing that we haven't
figured out a better way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I still feel that some games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole real-time combat in a way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is still kind of junk at times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds like it's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sounds like they finally
figured it out a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's really good because
they teach you the basics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they don't teach you all these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more advanced techniques that you can do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to basically extend your combos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like make flashier moves, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they give you gameplay
incentives, like I said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like if you get a combo for long enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without stopping it, then
you can do a finishing move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on an enemy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when they're high health, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's harder than when they're low health. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the common meter builds up faster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they're low health. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like when you sometimes
you start off a battle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and depending on how well
you can get your combo off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when when you kill one
enemy with a finishing move, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that makes it easier to do the next enemy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the next enemy and the next enemy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of like a domino effect, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, depending on the difficulty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you start off a battle well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can clear the enemy so fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you can like get KO'd really easily, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depending on like how well
you start off your attacks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and your combos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is just something that
I never experienced before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a Tales game, because Tales was always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm playing because I like it
and it's anime and it's JRPG. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the combat here is just to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> make me forget about the fact
that I just hate grinding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and combats and like
- Yeah, I don't like grinding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And turn-based battles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but this one was just,
it's legit good game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can see why it's like the closest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Tales has got to like
a mainstream release, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because it is a legit
good game that I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people who don't
even like JRPGs would like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been tempted ever
since they announced it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like I can't do it to myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I have so many fucking JRPGs lined up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I still need to play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I still haven't played
the like Nier Replicant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't played that either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bought that on Steam and
it's just been sitting there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, I'll get to it eventually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's Steam, that's how it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I'll get to it eventually
and then they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, there's five more JRPGs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I bought Sega Bass Fishing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Sega Bass Fishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I never played it.
- Sega Bass Fishing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A fishing game.
- Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sega Genesis type.
- Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why not, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's Sega Bass Fishing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually think we should
do a Trash Taste special, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we do high score on Sega Bass Fishing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Look at that game, look at that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can we just go real fishing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd rather go real fishing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd rather just go real fishing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then play Sega Bass Fishing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also really wanna play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the new Nickelodeon fighting game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They actually made it
into like a serious fighter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And apparently someone's
already figured out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that some characters are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking broken beyond belief.
- Of course they have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> We're gonna begin patch notes
for days and tier lists. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Spongebob is STR, Patrick is DTS. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spongebob bottom tier.
- Bottom tier is (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you also hear the news just yesterday? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know you're gonna say it.
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of Sora getting
confirmed for Smash Bros? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the internet just breaking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never seen the
internet break that hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm happy for those fans who like Sora. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was rooting for Master
Chief, personally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aki literally broke down crying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as if she lost a family member. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does Aki play Smash? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She does, but I didn't
know she played... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause she never played with me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But apparently she's
played like the 3DS variant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the older game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But now, I know there's
gonna be just like a whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> wave of new smash players. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's one of those things
where I'm happy for those fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who got it, but I don't really care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I could care less- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I never played Kingdom Hearts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, me neither.
- Me neither. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were you hyped? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I was hyped just
purely on the base of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just thinking to myself how the fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they must have thought
for tooth and nail with Disney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe smash is big enough where
they would have been like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Sakurai's done enough now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where he's just like,
"Do you know who I am?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also they'll be releasing
Kingdom Hearts on the Switch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is probably one of the
biggest reasons why it's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean like I was more
surprised about Minecraft Steve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That did break Twitter,
literally, it broke Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That broke Twitter as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like Sora I was just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> As someone who's not
that invested in Smash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Kingdom Hearts I was like, I see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it wasn't that
big of a surprise for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where did this come from?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I mean they had a cloud on there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they had (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - See this is why I want
a Master Chief, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It would have been so out of left field. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Master Chief would
have been out of left field. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, imagine it, the
fucking announcement comes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you hit the fucking halo music, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> This is full for memes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not actually want... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I do not care if he is in it or not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just want the meme potential- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what most people
were saying about Sans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> until they added a skin.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just want Master Chief. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They added a doom guy though as a skin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, fuck off.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - One of those skins is dooms guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a skin though, come on, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doom guy could have been anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, doom guy could have been anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] It's a final update as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the final update, so
there's no more characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well the next Smash in
future, whenever that happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we better get the Master Chief. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, Nickelodeon
did a fighting game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so who knows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, I want the
Master Chief in Smash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is this Nickelodeon fighter game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's basically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they took all the Nickelodeon characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and turned it to Smash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's actually like,
a well-designed game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from what I've heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I don't really care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw a video of some guy just saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how broken Spongebob was and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean he's the flagship character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I never thought I'd see the word </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Spongebob needs to get nerfed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> written in text but like
I saw it and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wow, what a time to be alive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, like, I'm super happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I personally, have
never really sat down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and played the Kingdom Hearts game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I only know so much about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I live with a Kingdom Hearts fan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, I'm happy for
the Kingdom Hearts fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just know that every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you talk to a Kingdom Hearts fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they try to explain the story,
I'm just like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's like the you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like as a fake fan it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand how it feels getting-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - They just love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (group chattering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad they have something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I had something that I got there- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I probably know more
about the Kingdom Hearts law </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just purely because of Aki. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I had to sit
down and watch her play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all of Kingdoms Hearts 3
and every turning point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "May I ask a question?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> May I ask several questions? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the memes of like Mickey Mouse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wearing like a black hood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't understand the context there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's king mickey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like Mickey Mouse
is wearing a black hood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he gets into the
darkness and he fights enemies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] The void. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, this is totally unrelated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just reminding me of this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the PaRappa the Rapper
memes with the daffy duck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have you seen that one?
- I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I slammed my penis
in the car door memes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you seen that?
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really weird
when you just say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I spoke to Emily and Didus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were all like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you guys seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the daffy duck where he slams
his penis in the car door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with PaRappa the Rapper? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And we were like, "Yes,
we love that meme." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, yes! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's such a dumb meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll show you later.
- All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very weird when you just say that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I hear that out of
context, I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's one of those memes
that passed very fast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I found it so funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I realized I'm such a child </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that is so funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like crying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, there's something in my eye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just so funny.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just the memory of this meme, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just breaking this man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just had to talk about, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It reminded me of the, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just love though like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not too invested in Smash anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but every time they announce a
new character I'm like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I always like try and keep up to date </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with what the community is saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I imagine that's how
it feels to like the NBA </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and have the draft
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like all of the predictions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I see from Smash fans, it's
just fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because with this last-
- You can bet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can bet on the characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With this last drop, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was three main predictions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, Sora, obviously, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Master Chief, obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Third one was fucking Goku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Crash Bandicoot as
well, I saw it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Crash Bandicoot, but like Goku, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like an
alarming amount of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who were like, Goku confirmed for Smash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd be hyped for Goku.
- And I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd be hype but I just
can't imagine a game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where Goku beats up Mario.
- And Sonic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Sonic, it just sounds fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you kidding me, that sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds amazing?
- I'd get hyped over that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's that game where you
bet on characters that fight? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Salty bets.
- Is that what it is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, Salty Bets, that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It turns into Salty Bets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just sounds like a Salty Bets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Salty Bets was just like
decades ahead of its time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hanson and Mickey is fighting Alucard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, sure, I'm down.
- Who will win? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then Hanson and Mickey
comes back from One HP </SPEAKER_05>
