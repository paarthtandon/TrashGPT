<SPEAKER_01> shout out to everyone who defended me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for my monkey brain um today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i want to talk about fellas i had a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thought last night i was like wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got my life together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we all know we all know that's a lie no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one just thinks that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay okay i've got my life more together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's better and i was wondering i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like well i i've had like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> drastic life change from moving to japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's not because of anything to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right that's probably because of i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the fact that someone's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> holding me accountable yeah before if i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] up a sponsor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was on me yeah yeah right now there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> someone else involved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was wondering because i'll explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mine but did you you know when you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> moved to japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know maybe when you joined the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> agency did your life change that much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> did you like have a lifestyle change or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just same [ __ ] i think the biggest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> change for me has been actually this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well we have a specific day we come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in and film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having something on my schedule has </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> schedule just because i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i have one day that's always booked off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and have to like plan around that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of being like i'm gonna wake up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm gonna feel like maybe i'll feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like working on something today maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll just </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> and you look on your calendar it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing this way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like what do i what do i do how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do i how do i do things now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> especially especially after quarantine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just wake up and you you don't even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know what day of the week it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and weekends don't feel like weekends or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> days or just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> other days i don't know yeah most people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wake up being like oh yes it's a friday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the end of the week i just wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it is morning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but youtubers every day is the same day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when when when we everyone started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working from home and everyone was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yes this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> such a refreshing change to my lifestyle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're just like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah welcome to your youtube live it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fun when everyone's doing it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone's in the same boat right then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know everyone's doing their normal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> life and working it's like it's hell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean that's how i felt though like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we as as you said like we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> started to be like all right every week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this day this time we're going to come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the studio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right now and i'm just like oh this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how normal people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel it's quite liberating i drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> coffee with other people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i know it's great because you know when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i worked at the bbc </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i worked for there for like two years um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like close </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> close to three years and i did not enjoy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it after a while but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after moving to youtube and being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> freelance and just going by my own </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> schedule </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i kind of missed the office environment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because yeah about like a year after </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing youtube i kind of realized </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> man if i don't like actively go out and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seek social interaction it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't it doesn't happen that's me like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> three or four years to realize that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so why do i have no friends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> unless they like drag me out yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> weird i i kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i kind of got that same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because i never had uh like a business </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like a corporate uh experience right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like working in an office or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's like extra exciting for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it is liberating because i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always been even during school i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always been one of those kids where it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i couldn't study on my own like i had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one of those yeah like i couldn't go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> home and just sit in my room by myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you mean one of those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like when they'd always be like y'all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to study together i'm like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh no i was always like yes no i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly the same because i can't because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that if i go home and i'm in my own room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i'm not going to want to study </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because no one's judging me for just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being like well i couldn't just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> play some games yeah but when i'm around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my friends i want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talk to my friends no same here we never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when there was always a group study </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> session we'd have in university i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember we'd always have like the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> hour was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like nice and productive we'd start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going over problems and then it would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people would get bored and then we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanna watch this youtube video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly that's always what would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no i was a model asian son so i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey do you want to go to the library and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do some study sessions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we put our headphones in and we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just study because if there's people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> around that's a [ __ ] lie no no way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we and we all met up and we all studied </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is why do you think i'm so galaxy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right i'll tell you the real mvp </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which wasn't my lecturer but my actual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real lecturer was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shout out to those indian youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lectures that were always uploaded khan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> academy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what's that it's like if you did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> maths or anything engineering yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was always like this channel i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't remember it might have been khan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> academy or something like that where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> upload the lectures that are shorter and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> way more informative yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh like kind of like cliff notes yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow they explained it better in 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes than the 2-hour lecture you went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to your lecture you sit there for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an hour you wouldn't take any of this in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then when you're revising you you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> search up hey um x topic like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do i use how do i do second order </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> integrate uh into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> integra i can't even just integers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um uh and you there'd just be always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is it was always an indian guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing the lectures i don't know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just no maths man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they get it they get it man yeah i never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> had anything like that i just i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you did any traditional route if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did anything maths or engineering at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> some point an indian man on the internet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would save you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's just how it is like that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just because they i don't know why is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that maybe like only a uk thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no because like it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> americans too i think would use these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it's an engineering thing must </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be an engineer yeah i never did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> engineering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the sciences yeah maybe yeah i never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> had anything like that i mean i had like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> indian lecturers like at school who were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like teaching me stuff and they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> usually like the best lecturers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah there's so many in engineering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i didn't have like any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube i wish i had like a youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channel that i could just [ __ ] go on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i'm being like yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> solve all of my problems for me please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thank you so i don't have to go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> classes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i felt so p when i went to university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was in english and i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait the internet's useful to the work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like welsh internet like isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really a thing so anytime i'd want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> cheat i just couldn't because i couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> google any of this [ __ ] right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i didn't know what i was looking up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah but yeah no man oh my god </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> my lifestyle university was so unhealthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys really unhealthy oh definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is there any uni student who lives a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> healthy life there was there was one guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my like uh year and he was like the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> peak form of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything he like wouldn't drink he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> went gym like every single day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and he always was the best but like had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what clubs was he part of because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember people who were like part of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the rowing club or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some kind of sports club would have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always the peak optimal lifestyle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there was like everyone else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but that would usually be the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they would be walking down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know the campus and people would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know that they're part of their club and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would just be like look at this wanker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because they they wear like they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm in this club yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look at this wanker wearing a polo shirt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he can afford a polo shirt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get out of here [ __ ] off i i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because i went straight into youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from uni </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like you got the uni lifestyle i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't change anything except for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i even like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i even like had an approach to youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making in uni like i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> procrastinating my videos the way i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing with my lectures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right where i would like not do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything and then one day i would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything and then i'd be like wow what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a healthy what the hell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was the opposite because i started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> youtube when i started uni yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right so i kind of live like a double </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life but usually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's supposed to be the opposite where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you should focus on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your studies right and like keep you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know maintained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and you know just because it's a hobby </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right you can just procrastinate and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just do whatever now for me was the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> complete opposite i was like all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> upload videos every day at this time get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it edited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get it done oh [ __ ] i have an assignment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in two days i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone who is who's like seeing good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> growth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> does that though because i knew that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> should have put engineering first but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no i put the youtube first yeah i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know how you managed to do daily uploads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while also going to university and still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> passed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's some of the easiest content that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i've ever made and like also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like compared to videos now i wouldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> call my old videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good editing because there was barely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any editing it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lots of cuts lots of zoom ins it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the easiest [ __ ] editing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put some background music in boom you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got a video right but yeah my computer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i really struggle with that because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously the upload speed in australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] horrendous like do you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> connect yeah the internet like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the download was fine we had like 20 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> down right we're just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not bad not bad right but you know what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> our upload speed was like 0.1 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty close like 0.3 oh my god oh god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> uploading a like 500 meg video file </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah which is like nothing right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> would take me like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eight hours jesus so what i would have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is i would go to my classes i'd come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would work on a video i'd edit it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until the night and then i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> upload it and then go to sleep and by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the time i got up in the morning usually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost finished or it was done and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just be public by that point and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> would do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every day for three years and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unsurprisingly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like i think it was like a month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> before i decided to move to japan right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> my computer just exploded like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> physically like i was sitting there i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was editing i remember i was editing a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> nekopara episode right that i was doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then one day just went boom it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nekopara </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's nekopara like it's just it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explodes like the cpu just exploded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's smoke coming up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything i'm like oh my this house is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> going to go down like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this house is gonna catch on get out mom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this fire starts yeah this is this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how like house fire starts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah so we got rid of it and i open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up i remember i opened up the computer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my cpu was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> gone it was disintegrated it must have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been constantly on you must have never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly on it was constantly on and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and the computer was just like nah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't do it anymore man wait did did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> live at home when you're at university </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah oh [ __ ] that's been such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different experience yeah yeah because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i never got the experience of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living in like a dorm right because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having roommates i moved out at 18. and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just turned 18 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i've pretty much lived alone or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not with my parents since then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i moved out after uni sounds like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fun idea until it's really not after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about two months of living with other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you realize man i really hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> people they're like well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't get a say in who you're put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> within at least british university </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh yeah sometimes you get put with </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> we're in the year 2000 and he's using </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the word peasant as an insult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he would call these rugby players to </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> that was really common did you say yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what [ __ ] universities did you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just walking around campus and i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't know i could ever see [ __ ] in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> location like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah you see vomit and [ __ ] where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand the vomit right because like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we had like a whole bunch of like pubs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and restaurants like within the campus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right so obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a little bit crazy as you do as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a uni student and you you know throw up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit but i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> why is there like poop on this sidewalk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like we're not actually i i'm now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you guys are mentioning it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm remembering so much poop that i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> blocked out my memory like i'm like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is bigger than an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apple it's not an animal it's clearly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not an animal like this is a human poop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i know what human works they are an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> animal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's like it's like it's not even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's not even like a kangaroo or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a big animal like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this clearly came out of a human i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think it must have been pretty bad at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my university because they had like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> row of porta-potties that would just pop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> up on friday through sunday yeah where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where all the clubs were so clearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people must have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] enough and pissing that they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like we gotta sort this out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pooping everywhere but there's this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just keep remembering there's so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> poop where there shouldn't be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember one day are like most amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> podcasters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's one time when uh came home came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> home from one light out and there was i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was in the common room and it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> smelled like some someone had died there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it smelled like an animal or died maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it was a dog or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> start looking around like searching for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> where where this smell is coming from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like playing the game of where's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just just with this smell right i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> searching everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was around christmas time and and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i searched behind there was there was i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> searched behind the christmas tree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like coming from the christmas tree so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i look behind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's just this turd like sitting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where there should be presents and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my first thought is surely this can't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a turd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right and like you said it's not it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not like a dog turd it's like a full-on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's clearly a human being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not like rabbit poop or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a big full-on turd my first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> surely there's no way this is a turd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is in your house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> huh in your house uh yeah in my dorms </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what in my dorms </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so it was it wasn't a house we lived in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like a shared shared dormitory of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 200 people so we have like a common area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so so i get this [ __ ] stick right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> poking it just think maybe it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something else other than the turn maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it's like a toy chocolate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and and the stick just sinks in i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh oh this is a [ __ ] turd oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i am smelling [ __ ] right now how did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this get here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was in the common room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was pretty late but people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> come here people come in the common room </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty often </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i i was just like i was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking there must be a story behind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> this how how did this turd appear here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i never found out oh my god that's such </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a wish all i remember was coming coming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the next day in the morning and it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> magically gone and i was like i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry for the person who had to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clean that turd up man see i just hear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] like that i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but don't you me like you get some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] stories that you're like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> course but like i like hearing it from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> other people i don't want to like go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> through the [ __ ] trauma of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> experiencing a lovely christmas morning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> with a turd right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't need that in my life it doesn't </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> have completely blanked out this memory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of mood and put this image on screen </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> i never thought i was chubby right no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but i didn't think yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the time yeah i think because it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just the way i'm built like i don't look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that choppy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i remember like a year ago like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an image like someone's taking a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> photo of me and it was like from the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> side right yeah i just saw like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stomach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like hanging over a little bit and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when did that happen yeah and you're </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_01> for you like because obviously you did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like a way bigger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like leap yeah because i mean i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i had like a gap year where </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> actually starting uh between graduating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from uni and actually starting my job at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the bbc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and that was when i kind of went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like that was when i went all out on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube before i just completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> stopped yeah so the period before i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> completely stopped i i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> spent a lot of time on youtube because i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had basically nothing else we were still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not making any money during that time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i wasn't making any money oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> um it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i had nothing else to do and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was really enjoying it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because that was about what about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the time like potaku started and a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of a lot of new things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right right happily invested in it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was pretty heavily invested in that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i remember i this was like such a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird year for me because i would spend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my time like all over the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um just in different places like i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lived in china for a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah uh really yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why huh um reasons i don't really want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i i i was there for a bit and then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was in thailand for a bit and most of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the time i was just working on youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and by the time by the end i just i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted something stable i wanted a job i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought i wanted a job at the bbc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i thought wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was it was good for the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> year about the first year was it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> good experience it was like yes this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a nice break from university and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and just like doing youtube for a while </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what i didn't realize is how hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> university life is compared to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of having a real job yeah like you you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guys don't know but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] the stress and [ __ ] you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through in uni is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ten times as much as anything you'll go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you've got like drama on top of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having to do like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 assignments all at one time and yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like if i fail one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> assignment i am stuck here for the rest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> of my life yeah like i i've been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stressed but never as stressed as i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at university oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah because they all were always i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know if it's the same for you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but in my university they always put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all the deadlines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the same time yeah yeah so it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> always like two months of like i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> having a great time playing league of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> legends 12 hours a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> got nothing to do and then boom november </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hits you have eight [ __ ] assignments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> two exams coming up yeah and four exams </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on top of that two exams that you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> holy [ __ ] it's constantly [ __ ] in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> your pants yeah yeah i'm gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm gonna die i'm never gonna get out of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> this yeah yeah but like i still had my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> really unhealthy lifestyle that i had in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like in my job at the bbc okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me explain to you my sleep schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for the bbs oh i want to get it i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just when i really wanted to go on okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay because my my sleep schedule was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disgusting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um because because at the time a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my friends were online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of them unfortunately were in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> north america right which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the best time to talk to them was either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like probably like really late for us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just get used to staying up super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> super late so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was fine when i was in university </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it was easy to do all nighters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anyway </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but when i was working at the bbc um i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had a nine-to-five job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i'd need to get up i lived five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes away from my workplace </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was a good thing because if if i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't my sleep schedule would be even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> worse than it already was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> so i would stay up until about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> um till about four a.m yeah every day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's pretty normal yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i would wake up at eight so i'd have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i would have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i would have four hours of sleep do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> do my nine to five month preparation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do my nine to five four hours of sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be [ __ ] dead for the entire day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then go back home at around five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six o'clock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have have a two hour nap and then that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was my sleep schedule </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i never had one long sleep it was always </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like intermittent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i would i would have a maximum of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like three to four hours </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at a time every night just like space </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spaced out by like eight hours </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah that was my sleep schedule for a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> full year jesus i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being friends with americans especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the uk because of how the time zones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> work you're like five hours ahead you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> end up like you're talking to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're having a good time and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i can talk for an hour extra and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it'd constantly like the hour extra </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly yeah before you know it the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sun's rising and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yeah i i mean schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah of course oh okay yeah like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was the similar thing because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as you said like a lot of my like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> youtuber friends were in north america </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not in australia essentially so i always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> had to adjust to their time zones and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was usually like three or four a.m </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> right but but at least i didn't have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get up at like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 8 a.m i would get up at like maybe 2 p.m </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i got up if i got up before noon that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was weird for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like that's this this isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right i can feel the morning sun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i felt the morning sun before i went to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know if you guys did this but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> would like just slowly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deteriorate my sleep schedule to go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the point where i was going to bed at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> seven a.m yeah and then i would you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wake up at like four p.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right um like i would do the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely [ __ ] it and then i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna fix it today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i fix it and then i immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> start just chipping away at it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it like offsets by an hour then an hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> turns yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah two hours and it's three hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll have that one night you and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sure you've had it where you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason you stayed up until like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 8 a.m yeah and you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] there's no coming back for some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> reason when it's when you step to 8 a.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's easier to keep on that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep schedule and keep on a healthy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep schedule right yeah it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it like i physically like i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last year it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so hard for me to try and fix this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would try and stay up i would fail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i would try and wake up early </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i would fail so i was just in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> loop for like i remember like two months </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was trying to [ __ ] fix this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i could not do it and then when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i had to fly to america and then come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back and just immediately fight yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like so it was like i couldn't win and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know this sounds so stupid like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> wake up early connor yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> lolita just wake up early just do it but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like for some reason when you're a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtuber and you have no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> responsibilities </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like impossible to fix this just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put an alarm on your phone yeah it takes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so much willpower </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to fix your sleep schedule oh yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's really difficult when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't have any responsibilities or a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schedule to stick right or people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> relying on you apart from your viewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this is probably the first year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i think almost every day i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gotten up at like a normal human time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah cause i remember when i first moved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> here you were still waking up pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> late </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah when i was like when i was first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> living here like at my previous place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> before rocky moved here with me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i was getting up at yeah like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 12 1 p.m yeah and i'm just like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> reasonable time yeah i went to bed like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 5 a.m last night so i got my sleep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i think being on this time zone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like americans are always asleep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when i want to like do [ __ ] so it's i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just go to bed and then they're all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> awake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't feel any pressure to stay up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here there's like no reason unless i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah cause i remember you talking before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> about how you would record videos at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> 2am yeah i'd record because i woke up at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like six i don't want to do anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> when i wake up 6 p.m by the way i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> wake up at like 6 00 p.m </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in wales right before i moved to japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i was i was kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know i was pretty depressed i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like i hated it yes i was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just wanted to move to japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i was just stuck in this shitty bedroom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i didn't like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my brother's bedroom wasn't even mine i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hated it it was in the attic room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no no no no [ __ ] it i wish it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually more space </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i hated this room i hated being in wales </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm sorry parents i love you but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they know i hate living in wales i hated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it so much i had no friends really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and so i i would just stay up until </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 9 10 a.m yeah and then i would go to bed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah wake up at 6 p.m </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then i couldn't do anything as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because everything was closed right so i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was just a perpetual cycle everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> opens and then closes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> while you're literally literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything would open and close while i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sleep and then when i wanted to eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like i couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had to like preemptively go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shop to buy things that i think i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want later </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah for dinner i think like i had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> similar problem like that in japan but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think it's because i was relying too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much on the convenience of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the 24 yeah yeah because like i would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> get up but you know i'd stay up till </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe like 3 a.m and i'd be like i'm a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> bit hungry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everywhere else in the world you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty much [ __ ] like you have to look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your fridge oh america </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean you know you could do like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> delivering stuff like that but it's no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my case like i would get out of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> house literally walk 20 meters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the 7-eleven that was like across the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> road from my house yeah and just grab </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> something and come back i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> well yeah of course i'm going to stay up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's no time limit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with food especially or anything like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that right yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah recording at 2 am though like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how would your yeah 2 am foreign how did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your neighbors find it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] them dude dude i would be like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bed at like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like what was it ok this is why my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> signature wasn't too bad like 4am </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i would hear [ __ ] peppa pig </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] blasting through my walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like like muffled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like shut the [ __ ] up it's 4 00 am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i didn't give a [ __ ] i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were still [ __ ] to me so i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know what you should have just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> blasted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back dmx through the wall like peppa pig </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> version </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i have like a similar experience to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the first house i lived in london </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you live in london you could live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna live in a shared house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just the way it is in london so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> paper thin walls right and i would live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> next i lived next to this couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just like would not stop having sex </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just not good on them good on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them get on them but it wasn't it wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> discreet sex that like they were loud </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it wasn't even like sexy loud like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the girl just sounded like a dying dog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay that's the kind of like the kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's kind of like the noise i had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> live with but i think they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i think they did that because they got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> annoyed at me recording podcasts and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> videos so they would feel like i'll show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> him they would choose to have sex </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right like whenever i start recording </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was it was coincidentally every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i started recording a video i just hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these [ __ ] moans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on on the on on the wall um and i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to wait like a good </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> don't know how what couple constantly </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but yeah i think they were just having </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like shouting contests because they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just annoyed at me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> recording videos and podcasts yeah some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can kind of hear like we had we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to blank out my audio because there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like moans in the background </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> release the uncensored footage they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like the moment they're like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> they just look they're just like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> putting their ear to the wall in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moment they hear </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> had of like living or having neighbors </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to worry about is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> here in japan but it's never been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anything like that i mean i had that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like really one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> recently that one really passive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> aggressive woman </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she gave me like a good it's not the one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> time either that's like the third or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fourth letter she sent me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can you explain the whole story i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting so i i don't know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> timeline so basically i don't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember when the first one was but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically i came home once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like the in in japan i don't know if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's in other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> countries as well but at least in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan's and apartments they have like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mailbox downstairs on the first floor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they also have like a little like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> male entry thing i think that's on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> door i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i don't know but basically i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> came home and i was about to open the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> door and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw like a piece of paper sticking out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so i'm like oh okay maybe it must be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flyer or something you missed a package </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i missed a package or something i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pulled it out and i opened it and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was really creepy because it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to nobody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was clearly typed out and there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just it was just in english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i read it i'm like this sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> google translated and i read it and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the woman down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a guy or a woman now says i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> even know who it is because when you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> first moved to an apartment in japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's customary to like go to everybody </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every room that's adjacent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so the two rooms to the left and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right of you and the person above and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> below you if there are any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and go and like basically say like hey i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just moved in here you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if you ever need anything i'm in this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> room kind of right the p two people to </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> neighbors person the woman at the top </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> super nice barely talk to her but the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> woman at the bottom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she didn't even come to the door like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rung the doorbell i clearly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heard her running up to the door to look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the peephole you should put your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thumb on the people yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then and i guarantee the moment that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she like looked at the peephole and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw a gaijin she's like oh hell no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not going out there dude are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kidding me so immediately i was like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i have that kind of neighbor right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever yeah and uh and then yeah so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately knew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it didn't say when this letter it didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say it was who it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but man like she must have not thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this through because in the letter she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i always hear you guys stomping around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so i'm like well then clearly you live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> behind me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not even hiding it now and she's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your stomping is so loud in the night uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i am getting uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> insomnia and i'm just like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean sorry like like you must hate me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then in my previous place because i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up till like [ __ ] four a.m </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like i'm living a normal [ __ ] life in </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like oh my god what am i gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do with this woman so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the moment she sent this like recent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> letter like a couple of weeks ago i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm gonna [ __ ] show this woman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm getting [ __ ] annoyed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because she threatened to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> burn down her apartment so i unscrewed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the hinges in her door </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i broke down her door and threw poop at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i shut in her mailbox </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly honestly would have got him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no so uh so i was like i'm gonna show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this woman so cause like clearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by writing by typing not even like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> handwriting by typing out a clearly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> google translated letter to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she obviously thinks like oh these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] dumbass foreigners don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this like mentality of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> xenophobic like japanese people usually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very senile </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who think that they can get their way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're a senile japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person and we're just a dumb foreigner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who doesn't know the rules </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm just like all right i'll show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> them so i wrote a handwritten letter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in japanese in the most like keigo as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the most businessman the most polite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> japanese that you could ever see right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i might as well have like written a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] like invitation letter like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> resume to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kingdom right and so i wrote it down and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i basically said like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm sorry but we got to do it because i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> work at you know sometimes late at night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like we're not trying to be noisy or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever and it's like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_00> now maybe i wouldn't yeah just like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wish death upon it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like she's feeling unwell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it was probably something like that yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's probably something like that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i mean i i bump into my other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> neighbors all the time and they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty chill they always say hi to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah my neighbors next to me are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this like really old couple who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> used to live in l.a so their english is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like productive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well and like and that's good because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like aki isn't like the most proficient </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japanese right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they obviously know that and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time they like meet on it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really weird because like i was walking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to my local supermarket and my neighbor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like walked past and it was really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i was expecting you know like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like traditional japanese like oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no instead she was like how you going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like a really like weirdly like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> australian british accent as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm like i thought you said you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> lived in l.a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't sound very los angeles like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and it was just i was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hi i guess oh because i was fully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expecting to do like the whole bow thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> right but she was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sup some some old people are real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] nice here and they love speaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then other times like they they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just they want you dead </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah i mean i guess that's old </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people everywhere with foreigners right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> there so no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not good but i think japan takes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it to like a whole other level it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it seems like one one extreme or the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> other yeah it's hard for me to say i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> mean i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> white and grew up in a white place so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know i mean in england nobody </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like nobody talks to each other or like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no like acknowledges </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> generally talking is frowned upon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember actually the first time i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went to america i was i was in new york </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this was the very first like my very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> first experience in america because i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> everyone knows they know the loudest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they know they know they hate it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because we're so like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> everything we consume obviously is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> american media we just use so much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> american stuff so we're so desensitized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to american media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and obviously to americans it's like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a flavor of british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought she's interesting very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> international i think it's also because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've been to america so often now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> four like conventions because i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back in high school but i think even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> just general british people aren't like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> impressed by americans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> accents i mean i remember back in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> university whenever someone had an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> american accent they would definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out maybe less so now because there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> more i think there's more americans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming over to england to study here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we had that like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> american exchange student in our high </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everybody [ __ ] loved it they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah like keep talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah many things have changed i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know man at least in my my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> university </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i definitely i mean we're all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> used to it but i think god and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely used to because we live with </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> i can't i i grew up in the north and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i was surrounded by those accents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and that's why i get i get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mocked when i go back they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from here yeah you you definitely don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sound like the area that you're not no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no and i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that evolved over the time it did if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> go back to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my very first youtube video i sound like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> from the area that i grew up oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when i first met you you had like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quite a heavy like welsh accent yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't even wow she was like more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> northern but like because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the welsh accent sounds like this you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and i never sounded like that yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone in my village talked like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but you don't but you definitely didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sound like you do now no no i didn't i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounded like more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like general northern english yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah cause i've lost my accent quite a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bit people yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah when i look back at old videos i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like ew yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because because i was strong because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like really iron out your like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you enunciate a lot more yeah i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's it's just a youtuber accent right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to like stop mumbling and start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> paying attention to what you're saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people from all different races are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be like listening to you yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like because like the word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> literally yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in australia we say literally yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like yeah but i can't say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> literally anymore i have to say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know why and my dad gave me so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> much [ __ ] for it the last time i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> home he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] did you say literally you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sound like a [ __ ] american man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like say literally like a true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aussie i'm like all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thank you for your patriotism i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> accused on one of the comments they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> connor isn't from wales connor no one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm from where connor is no one speaks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that that's right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and like it just didn't cross their mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like your accent can evolve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly i think there was a study </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was uh done in antarctica where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they like sent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know when they go to the scientists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> go yeah and they wanted to see from all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these european scientists like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would happen to the accents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right over like the three-month period </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it would fight like normally they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason pick up one person's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> accent the most right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> generally start to talk the way they did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how it is like it can quickly change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your accent if you're surrounded by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think that's why like i've lost my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> accent a lot of the times because i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> spent like just from what i do i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> spent more time with non-aussies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i spend a lot of time in london and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> then spend a ton of time in japan a ton </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of time around america </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah there's words like that i pick up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from like you know british english and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah it's just it kind of just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> becomes like a conglomerate of just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bunch of different languages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's it's just kind of a mixture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of like internet language as well pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much one of the international pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> much yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure if i move back to england my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accent would like slowly develop slowly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh slowly back into more of a bridge i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> haven't noticed that though when i go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back to australia and i talk to like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> high school friends or whatever i just i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just immediately kick into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i remember uh when i met uh robert </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ninja </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or ross yeah you know he's an aussie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah yeah but he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> been living in america for so long that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his natural accent is just american now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time i met him at aex the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> moment he heard my accent he was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah man he's just [ __ ] like he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just completely changed to an aussie you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you could all you could talk like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the entire time and i reckon like more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people would be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into it yeah yeah that happened to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i went back to wales i definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> regained some of my my my older accent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i didn't like i don't like my old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accent i prefer this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i like to like speak clearly and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know yeah like more concisely yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more of a voice acting accent yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> more generalized and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> allows me to say words easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> before i struggled with words so you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so then i'm curious how like since you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys have moved to japan right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like your lifestyle changes like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's because doing youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here i feel is completely different to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing youtube anywhere else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the world yeah yeah i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's because we have like an agency here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that keeps us in track </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i'm my own worst enemy and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if i can be lazy i will be lazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so having an agency has really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> helped me like just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stay responsible you know and i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to let them down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right right not that i was letting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> myself down anyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't really don't want to [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because meleen will kill me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and also having like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese class two times a week that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to be awake i have to be there by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> nine so i have to be awake at like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 7 30 to get there which i did this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> morning yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like i basically have no choice but to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maintain like a healthy lifestyle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before coronavirus [ __ ] i was going gym </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like five times a week i was so hyped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for that and now i don't care </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> to a gym and [ __ ] have to run in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mask right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just not yeah i mean you can't and </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i'm not i'm not doing a good job it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just feels bad where you would make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such good progress and then you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take it like two months off yeah and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go back to the gym and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i was getting so many gains bro my </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> that's okay but overall other than that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's i don't know what exactly it is if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just the different time zone that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forced me to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't talk to americans as much as i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used to yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to take care of myself i eat better </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> like the whole thing where you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know why are people so thin in japan </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ton </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you really have to like search for </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> you don't but like there's let's go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the conbini and half the [ __ ] and that </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you had to pay a lot and find the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> healthy food it's like it's equally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> distributed where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can have extremely healthy food and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right next to us the bad stuff and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's not a question of can i get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's do i want to get the healthiest </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> readily available five minutes down the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> road </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you have to like [ __ ] look up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you have to go deep on yelp to find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a vegan restaurant i mean that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean that's the tldr of why i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are thin in japan is you walk a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ton </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's way healthier food yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just it's just a lifestyle thing where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people because you're surrounded by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people who have a much healthier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> lifestyle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you kind of like you you kind of they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of guide you into having a more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> healthy lifestyle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because everyone else around you is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not eating like [ __ ] and not like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sitting in the past like when i order a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> domino's pizza and then joey's like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i had a salad i'm like [ __ ] i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you think last night yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> had like a meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> last night dude matsuya's my favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> place on earth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best when i joined you wanna explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matzia so there's like three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like beef bowls the big three the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically the big the big three of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> beef bowls and just general like meat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and rice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah fast food chains so there's matsuya </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yoshinoya </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and oh my god what's the third one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone will everyone on like the vlog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channels be like go to yoshinoya like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no don't go to yoshinoya let me tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why matzia is the best straight away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> first of all in the australia you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to speak to people i don't like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to like tell the person what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want i'm not for that i like it when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the machine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> takes my order and i give the the man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the ticket i don't say anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i just get my meal right right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right i love that first of all because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's an english option as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not that like you know everything should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> have an english option i'm not here for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that i'm just saying that it's nice that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't have to worry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i'm eating because sometimes in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan you're just like [ __ ] man i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to order without having to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like japan japan makes it like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> places in japan make it very easy just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to not have human interaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah which i appreciate which as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> british person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that's fan [ __ ] tastic what i hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> also as a british person in any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> restaurant in japan if they don't have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that calls the waiter to you you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> call them yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so in england the etiquette is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you try to be as quiet as possible you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you like look for eye contact okay you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> look far </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like excuse me yeah yeah even the hand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hand is a risky move </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah you even the hand you're kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> making a scene there yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of just it's like it's a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of this like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah like you want the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bill it's like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay and that's as much as that's as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> much as you do to get a waiter's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan you gotta shout out you gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> shout out the top of your lungs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dude koreans are like laughing their ass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> off right now they're like these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> peasants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the worst part is is that like me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and gone will go like i'll go like full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> volume like sumacer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the silence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like coming over the speed of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> light i'm like what the [ __ ] i don't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because like the other like last week we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went to like an izakaya afterwards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after we finished recording and because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the user guide that doesn't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the button so yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> conor mcgregor just like oh with this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] again it's like so fulfilling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> prophecy the moment you sit down right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like i know that it's okay to shout </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> publicly like to get their attention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like my body has been like crafted yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's conditioned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah should never ever ever make any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> public disturbance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the same in australia so like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember like the first couple of years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i lived here like i never did it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i always just kind of just did this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot of the eye contact like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nodding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because in japan they just don't want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make eye contact they do everything to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> avoid eye contact so doing that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> impossible so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time i have to shout out i die a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit yeah i think my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expectancy goes down by a few months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time i assume </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and especially if it fails yeah but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever had the the pity one where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've said it like suma said and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they won't ignore me but one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> customers will have heard me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and he'll go like so am i saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and they like point at me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want your attention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but anyway back to matsuya the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> place in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you basically can get like a banger of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> meal that fills you up to like the brim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like eight bucks maybe like less if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to get the cheaper ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like even less like there's a the set i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go for it's like you get this like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's amazing this grilled ginger pork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like rice you get a potato salad you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> got a ton judo which is like miso soup </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with extra [ __ ] in it yeah it's amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i [ __ ] love that [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but like you can get like a regular like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> beef ball with all of that for like 600 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like like no if you want to go ham </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you can get it and like you can like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like less than 10 bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can like double that [ __ ] up as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well for like an additional like two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bucks and it's like a whole pig </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like amazing i love it like every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time i come in like [ __ ] connor's coming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in get to get the whole pig carcass out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like because i'm like max everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i'm like i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meat and rice i'm there it's so good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and you'll see you get these like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pathetic little bowl sizes like what am </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i going to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no i like it okay okay are good i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think manchester is like the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah yeah yeah but like you could but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's because you don't order like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they specialize in no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you get like the side menu [ __ ] right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean yeah i guess because in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> terms of like actual like beef balls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like udons like i i reckon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yoshinoya have it better than matsuya </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> man just saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're gonna we're gonna make a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese fast food tier list here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this is the best one yeah i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this one time um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i i went to this very like local place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> with sydney because this was when we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were staying outside of japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no not not outside outside of tokyo yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's a bit more in the countryside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so we went in this like what we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> craving ramen so we were looking for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a local ramen place and we go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this place um obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> neither of us can you know speak </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese or read it too well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so we go to this place and the entire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> menu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is hand written in kanji oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no but like we had to kind of try to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out what everything is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so we we we go we we pick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that's you know looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reasonable because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> we were looking at the price and the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> price was about 1300 yen which is about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 13 bucks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> forgetting that in japan like ramen is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cheap </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in japan it's super super cheap and we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were ordering something that was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 13 bucks when he should have in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> middle of nowhere yeah in the middle of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nowhere should </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> be like seven eight hundred yeah when it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> should be about seven or eight hundred </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and we forgot that and i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we we ordered it and the waiter just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> looks to us and i think he was asking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you sure he was are you sure you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want this you want this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> two of them and we were like you should </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have known that that yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah did we just want some it was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> we just won ramen yeah we want it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so he he goes back he says something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to he says something to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> chef and the chef's eyes just goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> okay oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you you seriously like seriously their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keys out and unlock the safe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so what comes out is they bring us this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like extra large </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> ramen and then with it was just this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> extra large beef bowl </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then he brings out one of them puts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it in front of me and i just think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> i've made a massive mistake i look at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sydney sydney's just staring at this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ball being like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cindy seems like we ordered two of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two to one each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because it would be impossible for one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of us to finish this let alone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh uh two of us finishing both of them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so so we bring it out and he brings he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> brings it over to sydney and i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> know what the etiquette is if you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> finish your food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we we [ __ ] try to devour as much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> as we can we don't even get through half </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> we feel we feel so [ __ ] bad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> we were getting the bill it was the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shameful bill of all time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so you're sure about that are you sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay okay [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we didn't even make a [ __ ] dent in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never experienced that because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would rather like like behead myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than leave food in a japanese place i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know why i'm so scared of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like one time in matsuya funny enough i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> accidentally ordered two of like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> double </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> l size sets right which is like way too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much fruit it's like i think it's near 4 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 000 calories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it is like a mountain of rice and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and i don't know how i actually did this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i should have realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much i paid and it came and i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i wasn't even that hungry i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i like forced this inside of me yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like when i got home i threw up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the restaurant i was like if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could imagine like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a dude literally like if his esophagus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was full i was literally like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like trying to be so soup to like push </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it down you know what i mean i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> give me more water i need to push this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] down with water </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> going to die you must have been looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at me like me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crying in a mazia like why is he why is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he still eating you that's just like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> british thing i've ever heard would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rather throw up from eating too much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food and feel the shame of leaving food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd rather throw up in like an alleyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like order way too much clearly and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to give them it back and be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like throw it away yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah okay was it very unhealthy and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> extremely questionable but yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know sometimes you have to make a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> decision but i got the respect from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those martials but when i said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i [ __ ] meant that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like walking out like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like my bowls stacked on top of each </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> other i've never eaten that much food in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my life </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> the synergy what are you talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about as well bro the the way the bread </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> can feed like an ethiopian family for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a year like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it is an insane it's like too much </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> restaurant just be like here you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes when i'm with americans in </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> super expensive but i always got a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ton of food so i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah exactly it's just i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> having to learn the hard way that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just never order appetizers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you go to an american restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's been a meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah because that's why you call it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> appetizers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it's like as big as the main course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't get it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in every every other part of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> world you would happen you have like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three-course meal sometimes you know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're feeling frisky in america you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> order one thing off the menu </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that one thing can feed a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> family for a week one thing i could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> never [ __ ] believe was the concept of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bottomless fries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a fast food restaurant bottomless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> everything bottomless everything like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> already like free refills was like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> whoa at concept because in australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> there's no [ __ ] store yeah but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like oh it's free refills and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bottomless fries i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what is this what is bottomless i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realized episode is like british and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> australian people discover america </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what is what's up with all of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff because i was so used to ordering </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like a large drink at like a cinema </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like in australia because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you could actually finish it a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> large drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the [ __ ] american cinemas like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they might they might as well have just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> given you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> four liters of coke right you just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blew my mind i have nothing i found out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the cinemas in america </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can refill your popcorn in some of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah yeah yeah i'm like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no why is this allowed like i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why did i buy the launch then if i could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just refill it yeah okay here's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> concept i never understood right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can order you go to any restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right usually it's free refills right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah this is the drink machine yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's small medium and large sized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cups why would you not just get this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> why would you not just get a small cup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i asked aki and she's like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people are just too lazy to get up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to get a refill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what and i'm just like are you it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like 20 cents extra dude like are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you really that lazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you just be like yeah i'll pay a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit extra so i can sit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for longer all americans are watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this they're like is this uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you agree with the points that we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making are you frustrated that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i've heard from another american </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and i've heard from multiple americans i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't get buttered popcorn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't think it tastes good i don't i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just don't eat while i go to the cinemas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> don't it's like it's like i have to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i maybe get like a like a packet of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> candy or something or whatever but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i never get popcorn i need popcorn when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i go to the cinema all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't want to go i'm i'm the guy who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> never actively goes out and buys popcorn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but when someone like offers it i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> okay let me just chow down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my head it's like it's not the cinema </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience unless i get popcorn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's probably because they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conditioned me to think that way right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i mean i like i mean do you watch a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie at home and do you have to have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> popcorn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no no no so why do you have to have why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm going there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's an experience i need to have the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> popcorn maybe i don't know i think i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just been conditioned from australia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because popcorn and australian symptoms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stupidly expensive i was in the uk yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like and as like a high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> student it's like you kind of yeah high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> school i couldn't and i think because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my parents never ever wanted to buy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd almost be paying a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> mortgage to get like this popcorn and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> something like 10 pounds in the uk which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is like nearly like what like 14 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah or something like that which is way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> more than in america right yeah like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> large popcorn in australian cinemas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> usually cost more than the actual ticket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to go watch the movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i'm just like why i'll just go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> down to the [ __ ] supermarket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like blow and just sneak [ __ ] in and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone said you know it just doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste as good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know man when you bring your own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] in it tastes kind of like flat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i'm sorry we peasants won't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you peasants wouldn't get it as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wealthy 1800s victorian lord of the land </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i would say but no like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in america did you ever go to an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> american cinema yeah i did where where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they would have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i went to a cinema in wisconsin and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would just have these butter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> machines where you could just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> basically press it i was so confused </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like poor just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like as much butter as you can on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pop we had that we in vegas we had one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that had butter but also lard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm just like yeah a lot like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> just pure fat yeah mainly is this a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> thing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they put never speak i see i saw it it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was in vegas and like another state </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you just want to put lard on it because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it makes it like extra greasy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> americans this is true what is this yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it is is this true </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no no no in i saw it in another state </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> because i only saw it like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very very rarely yeah but it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some kind of like lardy like fatty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> substance that was sitting next to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> butter i'm like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> it was like touching the back of like an </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> it was like like the deep fried oil [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i ruined my whole popcorn i put that </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> i've never been to a motel so i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] with those </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> that's bad happens near a motel so i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my brain has been taught don't go to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> motel calling a motel a hotel is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> equivalent of calling mcdonald's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant right it's like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> how many people had to die for to be one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> star </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that was like the one the only </SPEAKER_03>
